Andaru,europe,"In Italy we have had a similar phenomenon with Lega Nord , which is not exactly extreme right wing , but shares a lot of traits with this kind of party . They wanted less immigration , more police , less taxes and more economical and political independence of the richer northern Italy ( one of their main slogans was \\'Rome is a thief\\ ' , referring to tax money being mostly spent in the poorer southern regions ) . They opposed Berlusconi at first due to the alleged Mafia relations ( and that is a southern thing , right ? ) , only to completely change opinion once they could use him to get into the parliament.\\n\\nThey managed to gather a significant consensus ( they had over 14 % at some point I think ) using the usual cards of \\'they\\ 're taking our jobs/stealing our stuff\\ ' and calling for secession of the north . This consensus came mainly from people in the richer , more industrialized zones who started seeing companies going bankrupt , jobs being lost to cheap immigrant laborers or outsourced to other countries and generally less money coming their way.\\n\\nThey invented a mythology about their ancient homeland and people ( a non-existent Padania inhabited by celtic descendants , distinct from other Italians ) and used that to rally a lot of \\'naive\\ ' people as a start , then gathered more exploiting discontent and fear of change with harsh , direct language ( \ '' We\\ 'll ram our hard manhood in their butts\ '' ) and threats of radical action against the other corrupt parties.\\n\\nUnfortunately this works a lot on the less educated segments of the population , and more educated people are happy to tag along once they see their interests being addressed , no matter the way.\\n\\nHappy ending ( maybe ? ) : now they\\ 're exploding after several illicit affairs have been discovered , involving the Mafia , kickbacks , corruption and their precious northern money being exported to Tanzania investments , of all things ...",Romance,Italian

Andaru,europe,"His line is \ '' the left is irresponsible .

Andaru,europe,"There definitely is a subset of Italians who match your description . But I think that they are -also- the byproduct of 20 years of brainwashing by Berlusconi\\ 's brand of TV.\\n\\nI was a kid , but I remember that before then we had TV channels who tried to entertain but also keep a minimum level of \\'culture\\ ' and engagement . We had \\'serious\\ ' documentaries and talk shows focusing on divisive topics or political issues - I loved the science documentaries of \\'Quark\\ ' for example , thanks to my parents enjoying them with me and explaining stuff.\\n\\nBerlusconi\\ 's TVs turned the tables : mostly shows devoid of any content apart from dancing girls and silly scripts . Mini-starlets were generated continuosly , so lots of girls had the dream of getting in there . There message was \ '' hey , studying is for losers , come here and have fun and be famous ! \ '' . I\\ 'll mention the name \ '' Uomini e donne\ '' shuddering ( a gym rat guy sitting on a LITERAL THRONE as several girls had to woo him so he could pick one - the \\'courtship\\ ' would last weeks and the various characters would make the rounds of all TV channels being interviewed as bringers of Important Truths . They would earn lots of money just by touring around and posing - how can you convince a kid that it\\ 's worthwhile to pursue an education when they see that ? ) \\n \\nOnce he got in charge he also had control of the 3 state channels and pretty much all became the same . The most blatant example was the news program of Rai1 , the leading and most respected state channel , which started devoting half of its time to issues like how to solve your dog\\ 's digestion problems or what will StupidBimbo24 wear for her marriage - it truly became a parody of a news program.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying that it\\ 's all his fault , as of course there must have been a receptive audience for that to work , but he created and exploited a kind of \\'perfect resonance\\ ' and we now have the harvest : lots of people who don\\'t appreciate culture , don\\'t read books and have trouble understanding non-basic written texts , ready to follow who shouts louder and that forget what happened two days after they stop seeing it.\\n\\nI might seem to be exaggerating , but I have a friend that works as a tutor in a school to prepare people for the national lawyers state exam . She is constantly shocked by the fact that the MAJORITY of these aspiring lawyers , with Law degrees , CAN NOT write using correct grammar , let alone understand complex matters of rights . And they don\\'t want to learn , they don\\'t care about being good : they want a shortcut across the exam.\\n\\nWe have to start rebuilding , and it will take long .",Romance,Italian
Andaru,europe,"Mostly due to electoral laws that prevent anyone from having a too strong majority and the large number of parties and internal factions , so that all governments are based on fragile coalitions which shatter on controversial matters.\\n\\nThis usually means that no government can do anything too radical and was one of the motives of the attempted constitutional reform .",Romance,Italian
Andaru,europe,"One of the reasons is that many see the left as the party of moochers and lazy people : \ '' You want to tax my work to pay for social support and gypsies ? Go die in a fire ! Berlusconi save us ! \ '' .\\n\\nBerlusconi has always endorsed the idea of lowering taxes on property and assets , which greatly benefits rich people , even going so far as to say that some tax fraud isn\\'t that bad .

If you lose the ticket you\\ 'll have to pay for the longest possible stretch on that highway . You can also buy prepaid toll cards ( \ '' Viacard\ '' ) to pay quickly and they often have dedicated exit lanes.\\n\\nFuel is generally more expensive on highways , so try to refuel beforehand . Also self-service refueling tends to be slightly cheaper than serviced . \\'Big brand\\ ' fuel stations tend to be a bit more expensive , but it\\ 's hard to find the smaller ones . Most , but not all fuel stations take credit cards or ATM cards.\\n\\nThe cheapest fuels is methane however . It is a lot cheaper , but you have to plan ahead as methane stations are far between and , well , you need a methane car.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Romance,Italian

We don\\'t even have a verb for \\'to spell\\'.\\n * Word order is quite free , with the subject often being optional . This allows for slightly different meanings : \ '' Vieni ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' Are you coming ? \ '' , \ '' Vieni tu ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' Is it you that will come or someone else ? \ '' , \ '' Tu vieni ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' What about you ? Are you coming ? \ '' \\n * Gestures and tone can indeed further change or add meaning to a sentence . But that\\ 's for advanced speakers ! \\n * Very high mutual understanding with Spanish .

This government focused on taking debt under control through austerity measures , with the support of BOTH the right and left moderate wings.\\n\\nFringe parties instead went to the opposition , while a newish party started gaining a lot of votes : a stand-up comedian turned opinion leader founded a new party based on the core idea of \ '' send all those fuckers packing\ '' , proposing a selection of candidates via CV , short mandate limits and stuff like that , so that all the \\'old guard\\ ' politicians would be ruled out . He got a LOT of audience and managed to place a mayor in an important city.\\n\\nSince last year there has been a MAJOR wave of corruption and embezzlement scandals , mostly ( but not exclusively ) involving right wing people in high places , resembling at times the famed bunga bunga parties . The right wing parties have taken a nose dive in the polls , so much that the second highest party is the \\'fuck-em\\ ' party , according to several polls.\\n\\nThis general feeling of hate towards politicians and their privileges is starting to have an effect , so all parties are scrambling to find new , younger people to capture the disenfranchised voters . \\n\\nAccording to the current polls the next elections should have a pretty strong left-wing majority ( albeit with a drift toward the center ) and a sizable component of \\'fuck-em\\ ' people . These are seen as wildcards with no political experience , so nobody knows what to expect.\\n\\nShould you be interested in the polls go [ here ] ( http : //termometropolitico.it ) and click on the \\'Sondaggi\\ ' tab , then \\'i quattro poli\\ ' .

Andaru,europe,"**Italy**\\n\\nA quick recap : a short while ago we had a quick government changeover as Renzi , the left wing mayor of Florence who has been trying to become prime minister candidate for a while started a party rebellion which pulled the rug under Letta , who acted as prime minister for just a few months , and stole the crown.\\n\\nBasically the parliament is still mostly split 3 ways , but Renzi built some bridges towards Berlusconi in order to secure some support and had himself voted by the parliament as new PM . Some people call Renzi \ '' the Berlusconi of the left\ '' , some other \ '' the buffoon salesman\ '' and some other see in him the true chance for something to actually happen.\\n\\nSo , this week : \\n\\n* Renzi primises a chainfire of reforms , almost one a month , to fix jobs , the economy and schools . As a first step within 2 months the automatic taxes on salaries will be reduced for mid/low earners by about \u20ac1000/year . Where the money is supposed to come from is still unclear.\\n\\n* Renzi has started the Europe tour by visiting Hollande in France , apparently finding some common ground in trying to get Europe ( read Germany ) to change the tune on austerity . On Monday he\\ 'll go tell the tale to Frau Merkel.\\n\\n* The newly minted defence minister is considering cutting the notorious F35 orders , and maybe closing down a few hundred military installations.\\n\\n* Berlusconi , despite having been convicted and banned from offices , is considering not giving a fuck and candidating himself for the European elections , since it would be undemocratic to keep a beloved leader from his electors . He\\ 'll probably try forcing the issue to play the martyr part.\\n\\n\\n* Beppe Grillo , the \\'inspirator\\ ' of M5S , the \ '' fuck all politicians\ '' party of web-democracy that got almost 25 % of the votes , keeps kicking out all the elected MPs that even vaguely hint at not agreeing with him . The kicked out people are now basically free for the picking by other parties , while Grillo himself is now looking for allies in the xenophobic and secessionistic Lega Nord , who also would like to ditch the euro , to gain momentum for the European elections.\\n\\n* One of the \\'nice girls\\ ' of Berlusconi\\ 's entourage was caught at the airport coming from Venezuela with 24kg of cocaine in her suitcase , when she somehow skipped the security check . \\n\\n* Pot is now legal in medical therapies .",Romance,Italian

Arnold_Layne,europe,"As required by the mods , here is the full text of the article : \\n\\nEVERY winter , town squares all over Europe are filled by the hum of Christmas choirs . Towns in northern Italy follow this tradition too , but with a twist . Singers abandon Santa costumes in favour of the distinctive feathered hats of the Alpini , tough soldiers mostly recruited from remote Alpine villages . The Alpini repertoire is different too . Christmas songs are swapped for haunting ballads about the cruelty of war . These canti Alpini\u2014and the soldiers who sing them\u2014have become part of the region\u2019s cultural heritage . \\n\\nAt first glance , this is surprising . After all , to start with , the Alpini were a decidedly military outfit , established in 1872 to protect the new Italian state from its enemies to the north . Their baptism of fire came during the first world war , fighting the Austro-Hungarians high in the Dolomites . Conditions were terrible : avalanches and frostbite were a constant threat . Despite this , the Alpini notched up some impressive wins . They also fought courageously in the second world war , distinguishing themselves in battles from Ethiopia to the Russian steppe . \\n\\nUp to a point , the continued popularity of the Alpini can be explained by their reputation for courage . Their songs reflect their sacrifices . \u201cAmong rocks , wind and snow , we are forced to stay awake all night , \u201d one explains . \u201cWe started out as twenty-nine , \u201d begins another . \u201cNow we\u2019re only seven.\u201d This pride transcends the songs themselves . Monte Grappa , a famous Alpini victory in 1917 , is still commemorated on street signs across the country . Other songs , meanwhile , juxtapose Alpini bravery with the supposed incompetence of other Italian soldiers . In one , the choir warns Luigi Cadorna , the Italian commander in the first world war , that he\u2019ll need the Alpini \u201cif he wants to advance\u201d . The regular conscripts \u201care too weak\u201d to do the job , while other troops \u201care mafiosi\u201d . \\n\\nBut if some Alpini songs stumble towards chauvinism , their enduring reputation is down to their stark anti-war message . \u201cA \u2018happy\u2019 death has never existed , \u201d explains Massimo Marchesotti , conductor of the Alpini choir in Milan . \u201cWe sing about the truth : of the pointless death\u2026that none of those kids chose for themselves.\u201d The results are intensely moving . In \u201cOi Cara Mamma\u201d , the Alpini ask what their mothers will do when their sons don\u2019t come back . Elsewhere , the choir tells their lover that they are buried \u201cin a field of edelweiss\u201d . The choir concludes that \u201cwhen you are alone at home , the edelweiss and I will be with you.\u201d \\n\\nThe presence of edelweiss is not accidental . Alpini songs have a deep link to the mountain culture that bore them ; some of the songs are centuries old . And unlike other wings of the Italian military , \u201cAlpini herald from the same valleys\u201d as their songs , says Mr Marchesotti . Indeed , most songs are odes to the mountains themselves . When a soldier is thirsty , \u201crefreshing snow\u201d will be there to soothe them . A dying captain asks his men to give a part of his body to the mountains so that he blossoms into \u201croses and flowers\u201d.\\n\\nThis thoughtful melancholy is popular : Alpini choirs still release albums and play concerts all over northern Italy , and interest in them extends beyond their music . Several films and documentaries have been made about their story . A book of Alpini exploits by Mario Stern , a sergeant who fought near Stalingrad , has been republished five times , and has been made into a play . While in Russia , Polenta , as well as the cheese of his native valley , and of course the mountains themselves are constantly on Stern\u2019s mind . \u201cGhe rivarem a baita ? \u201d repeats one of his men , in thick Brescian dialect . \u201cWhen do we get home ? \ '' Home , or baita in the dialect , is literally a mountain chalet . Once again , Alpini culture is less about martial swaggering , and more a vehicle for nostalgia for beauty of Italy\u2019s northern frontiers . \\n\\nThis heritage is not as secure as it used to be . Most Alpini regiments were dissolved after the Cold War . The soldiers themselves now come from all over Italy , weakening their cultural link to the Alps . Still , the troops continue to play an active role in Italian life . They fought with NATO in Afghanistan . Their avalanche training has proved useful in earthquake-ravaged corners of the Apennines . Moreover , the national Alpini association , with its 355,000 members , is still important . As well as promoting Alpini culture , local chapters\u2014encompassing both veterans and eager civilians\u2014help their communities in numerous ways . They maintain chapels , and a series of mountain shelters for weary hikers . This dedication has not gone unnoticed , even among civilians . In the Piedmontese town of Biella , 36 % of the members of the local association were never soldiers themselves . \\n\\nWith the centenary of the armistice ending the first world war fast approaching , the Alpini look set to return to the forefront of Italian cultural memory . They are in fierce debate with their Austrian counterparts about where to hold joint commemorations of the fighting . ( The Austrians do not want to meet in Alto Adige , a region Italy annexed from Austria after 1918 , and which is still mostly German-speaking . ) The soldiers have even stumbled into controversy over a new videogame . \u201cBattlefield I\u201d features Alpini fighting on Monte Grappa . The head of the national Alpini association said that \u201cdelicate themes , like war , need to be dealt with differently.\u201d The beautiful stock of canti Alpini promises to do just that\u2014long after memories of the 2018 commemorations wisp into the mountain air .",Romance,Italian
