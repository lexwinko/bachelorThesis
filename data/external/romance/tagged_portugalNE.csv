011111000101,poland,"Heya , I 'm currently traveling around europe half for fun half surveying a new place to live and work . Poland really caught my interest . I ca n't really speak for the country as a whole but I visited Warsaw and Krakow and I absolutely loved Krakow . I 'm from Portugal and I do n't really see a future in my country and Poland seems to be in a good place economically , cost of living is cheaper and salaries are about the same or even higher ( I 'm a web developer ) than in Portugal . So it seems like a good choice . But since being somewhere as a tourist is very different from living somewhere , I have a few questions : - How bad is it really with religion and the conservative government ? I have n't met that many poles while traveling but the few I did seemed pretty fed up with religion and with the impact it had on their lives and they spoke to me about it out of their own initiative . Maybe I was unlucky but how big is the influence of religion in this country ? - How is the public healthcare ? According to what I found on google it seems almost required to have private insurance to have effective care , correct ? - Do you think it 's a good idea to move there ? : ) - Any other cities you think I should absolutely visit before making up my mind ? Gdansk ? Poznan ? About Krakow : - While researching I found out that smog could be a problem . Is this still true ? How bad is it ? - I can rely on trams for my transportation , right ?

011111000101,IWantOut,"Hey everyone ! As most of you probably know the situation in Portugal is sort of shitty money-wise so I 've been thinking about leaving . Europe is an option but I would have to sacrifice the great weather I have here so I 'd like to explore other options . I 'm aware that the US has a lot of problems but AFAIK as long as you have a job there and do n't do anything too stupid you can manage to live better than you do here . I feel somewhat close to the US already , they export their culture everywhere , a lot of the things I use daily were made there and reddit is very US-centric so I end up absorbing little nuggets of info here and there about the country . Still , it 's nowhere near a replacement to actually going there and experiencing things for myself . Especially the people . Even if I did ... the country is huge so things could be very different depending on where I went . So ... I 've been entertaining the idea of moving to California . The weather is very similar to Portugal 's and as a web developer it 'd mean I 'd be close to where the most important companies in my field are ( or seem to be ) . It also seems more progressive , or at least that 's the image I have . Unfortunately it seems really difficult to move to the US and I wonder if it 's realistic to think that I could get in or if it 'd be a good idea to do so . I 'm 26 with a bachelor 's degree and about 3 years of experience in Web Development . What are my options here ? I 'm very open to advice from people who have been through something similar or even from those who have moved into/from the US . Meanwhile I 'm going to read the remaining threads .",Romance,Portugese

A TB MBP with 512GB SSD is 3100€ here . Thats 3692 dollars . The same computer in the US is 2600 dollars .

1143z,MapPorn,"There is not much demand for passenger connections between Portugal and Spain . You can also see this if you research the flights available in the whole Iberian Peninsula national flights are the norm , especially in Spain , and the rest are Lisbon/Porto - Madrid/Barcelona mostly . A train line from Sines ( not in the map , port city in the coast at around the same latitude as Beja ) to Badajoz/Madrid is being developed , but it will be freight only . The high speed train ( green ) that would run from Lisbon to Badajoz to Madrid has been cancelled because of the crisis and really it would n't be faster nor cheaper than planes so it was going to be unsuccessful . Another couple things you have to take into account is that Spain and Portugal are both really mountainous countries so train tracks are not feasible in some cases due to the high costs and large distances between cities in the interior of the country . Another aspect is that Portugal is a really dense country , most population lives in a thin area near the coast , so most of the train and road network is built around the Lisbon - Porto axis ( Faro - Braga ) if you extend it . Since the distances are pretty short , a high speed train is not useful in this case because it could only achieve top speed for a short peroid of time in between stops , hence Portugal not having `` green '' train lines such as Spain . As for things I think realistically could be better , I 'd like to see Porto - Vigo having more express trains to shorten the travel time instead of just prolonging the regional trains to the other side of the border . Lisbon - Madrid is mostly done by plane , the service now in place got `` absorbed '' by Lisbon - Hendaye and half the train separates at Medina del Campo to Madrid , that is fine . Faro - Sevilla is not really in demand but if Spain reinstated the train tracks to the border the regional trains could just end on the other side of the border and that would be good enough , even if it 's only done in the summer . All the other possible connections would be a waste of money in my opinion .
