AdamEdge,asoiaf,"Wargs . It 's interesting to me that we just take it as fact that since magic is returning then the family of a Lord would start having magical children . It is stated by GRRM that all the Stark kids are Wargs ( including Sansa ) , but what does n't match is the fact that Jon is also a Warg , he is not Ned 's son , but Lyanna 's , so this generation of Starks is giving birth to these kind of people . If we thrust the fact that Benjen is not a Warg ( do n't know why he would ) then something must have happen between his birth and the birth of Rob Stark/Jon . I believe whatever Howland did in the isle of faces is connected to this , he immediately meets the Starks after this visit . He was there , alone , looking for something or someone , then Rhaegar sees something in lyanna that obsess him and although Lyanna is not ugly there were far more beautiful women in westeros , he saw something in her other than beauty , but have never met her before . I think Howland was but a messenger to deliver some kind of gift to the Starks , the gift that is passed on their children , skin changing . Howland Reed after waiting all these years finally makes a move and sends his kids to Winterfell to fetch Brandon Stark to the 3ER . As if that was part of the plan since that day .",Romance,Spanish
