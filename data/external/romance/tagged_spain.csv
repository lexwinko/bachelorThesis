It provides the necessary flexibility for competencies to be transferred.\\n\\nWhat Catalonia asked for this time was for the competency to ask the population questions ( in order to know the population\\ 's position on issues ) to be transferred to Catalonia , in order to ask the populace whether they want to be independent or not , and finally know what their opinion in the matter is , beyond guessing from the results of polls and the attendance of demonstrations.\\n\\nAnd this proposal , which came from a wide majority of the Catalan parliament , in their responsibility to their electoral promise of holding an independence vote and the people that elected them to carry it out , has been insultingly rejected straight when made , thus not allowing for it to be processed , which would have meant discussion and negotiation.\\n\\nIn short , that\\ 's what the \ '' dialogue\ '' the Spanish government is supposedly offering amounts to.\\n\\nNevertheless , we\\ 're not surprised with this ; this sort of thing is one example in thousands why we find it hopeless for things to continue as they have been up to now.\\n\\nThe process continues .

3G6A5W338E,europe,"& gt ; I don\\'t see why such a vote should be illegal if it\\ 's nonbinding . \\n\\nThere\\ 's one reason they\\ 're opposing it so strongly even if it\\ 's non-binding . Up until just a few years ago , popular polls put opinion at around 15 % for independence , and whenever the topic was brought up , they\\ 'd ridicule it as an unpopular extremist opinion.\\n\\nThey still pretend it\\ 's minor , although polls by newspapers and such show this has changed and independence would win : \\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia_independence # Studies_on_public_opinion\\n\\nIf the poll happens at all , even if non-binding , Spain would no longer be able to claim that Independence is unpopular and negotiations for independence supported by the expressed will of the catalan people would follow.\\n\\nSo they\\ 're trying hard to prevent ( read : delay ) that . It will still happen , however . Should the referendum in November not happen , there\\ 'd be advance elections for the Catalan parliament , where parties would be polarized on the issue and people would vote them accordingly . If the recent EU elections meant anything , ERC would win again , with an absolute majority . That party has already had \ '' Independence for Catalonia\ '' as the core of their electoral program for many years , and they\\ 'd be supported by the other parties that are also for independence now ( 2/3rd of current parliament , likely more after these elections ) . After these , independence negotiations would , too , start.\\n\\nIf , even with the expressed will of the people supporting them , these negotiations failed ... unilateral declaration of independence would follow . That could go more or less smoothly , but in any event , it would become an international conflict .

3G6A5W338E,europe,"Some background . Disclaimer : I\\ 'm Catalan . The article goes : \\n\\n & gt ; Under Spain\\ 's constitution a region \ '' can not unilaterally call a referendum on self-determination to decide on its integration in Spain\ '' , according to a written summary of the ruling released by the Constitutional Court.\\n\\nProblem is , there\\ 's no request for a referendum ( binding ) coming from Catalonia . Catalonia has asked for something else entirely , that is , a consultation ( which is non-binding ) . That\\ 's completely legal and that\\ 's Spain\\ 's government current nightmare.\\n\\nWhat Spanish government doesn\\'t want is for the actual numbers ( how much support independence really has ) to be known , no matter what , because they don\\'t like what the polls on the matter look like ( yes wins at least 2:1 ) . And that\\ 's a battle they can\\'t win . There\\ 's nothing illegal about a consultation in the Spanish framework . Even if somehow they actually manage to stop the consultation from happening by November 9 ( e.g . : by sending the military to kidnap the urns ... what a joke ) , that would only delay things slightly . The Catalan can and will hold elections should that happen . Parties will then no doubt be organized as independence yes/no . So what the Catalan want will be known.\\n\\nAfter that , I can\\'t picture a scenario where the Catalan want independence and don\\'t end up getting it , one way or another . The different scenarios there have to do about how much democratic hygiene Spain shows regarding the core principle of sovereignty belonging to the people , and how much the Spanish populace and the world are willing to overlook whatever actions Spain\\ 's government does take against Catalonia .",Romance,Spanish

Wait , not . It\\ 's just nonsense on your end . Really silly , too . I have ( honest ) no clue how you came up to that conclusion . I don\\'t see the slightest sign of a CDC/UDC break , as in any new tensions between the two . I do see , however , some fun bound to happen soon internally in PSC ... their \ '' official\ '' stance *against the referendum* is something a good sector of that party is in disagreement with.\\n\\n & gt ; Com\\'on ! La Lliga Catalana ? Lluis Companys ? You don\\'t know your history ? The reason Spain is full of nationalists , Spanish or Catalan-wise is because the fascists won the civil war.\\n\\nNevermind our ( depressing to us , boring to most redditors outside spain who just want to get to the point ) past , why did the independence movement only rise when the new Estatut d\\'Autonomia was attacked in 2009-2010 ? ( below ) \\n\\n & gt ; Oh , and they did so with help of the Catalan bourgeoisie . The same class that now wants independence because they see economic profit into it.\\n\\nNonsense and already covered : It was no one no less than the attack on the Estatut d\\'Autonomia that , after being ok\\ 'd by spain , the Catalan voted for in a referendum in 2006 only to have it shot down in 2010 . That is what did it . Try pulling that kind of bullshit on anybody anywhere and they\\ 're not gon na be quiet and complacent about it . More about events and their result in position of the catalan people [ here ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1spuk9/catalonia_intends_to_vote_independence_from_spain/ce359ib ) .\\n\\n & gt ; you should also know that there are alternatives both nationalist , ... \\n\\nI\\ 'll admit I\\ 've never voted CiU if that\\ 's any comfort to you . I\\ 'll also add I have voted every time I\\ 've been called to do so , and I\\ 've never voted PPSOE either : P.\\n\\n & gt ; anti-nationalists ( and of course there are parties that claim to be the latter but are just a different kind of nationalists , Spanish ones . I shouldn\\'t explain you that ) .\\n\\nI\\ 'll just call these spanish nationalists the anti-democracy group . Very appropriate considering how they\\ 've handled the whole situation . I\\ 'm including the spanish \ '' socialists\ '' in that group , as they\\ 're not doing it any better.\\n\\n & gt ; TLDR : Catalan politicians abuse a real wish of people ( to decide about their future ) , to get away with the corruption and the plain robbery.\\n\\nAwesome identity \ '' Catalan politicians\ '' equals Corrupt there.\\n\\nI\\ 'll give you some points for recognizing there\\ 's a real wish from people to decide about their future .

There\\ 's no such promise anywhere , not in the link , which by the way is ultimately a collection of facts and not propaganda by any definition of the word , not am I aware there has been any such thing in any pro-referendum or pro-independence talk from these two parties.\\n\\n & gt ; if it were really for CiU ( mainly ) and ERC ( secondary ) , you would have had a national front years ago , and the referendum would have taken place already . Nationalists have had always since 1978 the majority of seats in the catalan congress.\\n\\nThese CiU \ '' nationalists\ '' have always been totally pro-spain , ever since the party was founded on the very idea , and their voters have always been aware about that fact . You\\ 'd have to be terribly ignorant of Catalan politics to think otherwise . I take for a fact you\\ 're either very young or not Catalan . And as for ERC , they have always been for further autonomy inside Spain but not for independence unless as last resort.\\n\\nCiU only gave up on Spain recently , both the party and its voters , due to the events covered on what you nonsensically call a \ '' propaganda\ '' link , and due to other events not covered in it.\\n\\nIf Spain didn\\'t shit all over the Estatut d\\'Autonomia , with humiliation and insult to the Catalan people who voted for it in a referendum , there would have been no independence movement to speak of . ERC called for independence immediately , CiU did so only years after , due to the demonstrations , when they realized their voting body would just vote ERC otherwise .",Romance,Spanish
