0ffliner,europe,"By \ '' European like minded\ '' I was referring to the liberty to critique anything , from simple things like bad parenting till the governmental problems . So basically I\\ 'd consider that some Russians are really narrow minded when it comes to certain political , economic , and social problems ( probably like how Amish are in US and most of Americans don\\'t get why would you want to live like this , you know ? ) . \\n\\nAs an example I can give : for social one , most bad things that happen in Chechnya , simple Russian folk would comment that it\\ 's the Chechen\\ 's wrong doing and not theirs and would like to walk over other [ nationalities ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1zQnKdcitdM ) because they\\ 're the majority ( In that video basically some individuals from the police department that weren\\'t even in their uniforms , asked 2 Chechen girls to show their passport , one of the girls was a mother that was feeding at that time , and they didn\\'t even show any documents to prove that they\\ 're actually coppers . And Chechens are the luckiest ones in the whole R.F.\\n\\nThe politics kind of bind together with the economics , they\\ 're angry on the US sanction because they think that US is the evil warmonger that wishes only destruction and chaos , and while they\\ 're believing that Russian culture is based solely on resistance and defensive wars ( Most of them think that they had all the rights to annex Crimea ) .\\nAbout oligarchs I\\ 'm not even talking , Putin is kind of the boss of this mafia-state , or so it seems that he\\ 's the honcho . State media is controlled by Kremlin and most Russians believe it without checking also the western channels , thus their opinion is based from one point of view.\\n\\nI\\ 'm sorry that I had to write this Shakespearean play but otherwise I don\\'t know if you would\\ 've understood my point of view .",Romance,Romanian

AlbaIulian,AskEurope,"No , it should not , and I hope that this won\\'t happen in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWhile European nations have much in common one with another , I wouldn\\'t say that there are things that every European country shares aside from very broad-stroke things , like country and dishes . Regionally , you\\ 'll find more shared beliefs and traditions , however.\\n\\nNot to mention that the EU will never , and should never , be a country . It\\ 's a big mess right now , caused by its attempts to envelop most of the functions that properly should be performed by a sovereign state : minting currency , defense , and organizing its political system.\\n\\nAlso , the bureaucracy needed to run an entire continent ( or at least a big portion of it ) will be staggering , and I know cases where ordinary people have been screwed over due to EU regulations and their ilk . Not to mention that the current of internationalization that affects us today is affecting the national identity of the states in a very negative way ; instead of working for companies in the motherland , people instead have jobs working for foreign companies , feeding more money to Germany than to Romania.\\n\\nAnd the guys in Bruxelles have no way of knowing what is best for Romania , for example . Over the time , the countries on the European continent have developed individual cultures , which , while influenced by their neighbors , are still distinct . So , what might be a good idea for some countries in Western Europe may be a disaster for the East . Attempting to smooth out the differences between East and West would never turn out well in a sane world , and it goes against the Uniunea lu\\'peste\\ 's motto \ '' unity in diversity\ '' . If the Union truly respected that , then they wouldn\\'t attempt to slowly drive us into abandoning our old , slower-paced way of life for the urban-centered hustle-bustle of the West . Both might have their flaws , but a foreign model is very bad if imported rapidly . Maiorescu said it himself that \ '' *The second , and most important truth , is this : the foundation-less shape ( imports from the West not adapted to our circumstances ) is not only useless , but very damaging* ... .*It\\ 's better to not make a school at all than make a bad school*\ '' \\n\\nSaid my piece .",Romance,Romanian

However we are commenting on an article about how the EU parliament president is saying that you\\ 'll be out of the EU but maybe you know something I don\\'t ( very likely ) .\\n\\n & gt ; TThe most grating part is that you are clearly showing a deep ignorance of the cultural , economic , political and even historical aspects of spain and catalonia , and yet you are doing all sorts of assumptions on who will recognise us and worst , the rationale these countries will use to deny us such recognition , despite you not knowing what is their opinion because ou don\\'t really follow the issue of Catalan independence , the movements of Catalan and Spanish diplomacy ( you don\\'t even know catalonia has its own diplomatic service ) and the results of the meetings and conferences which are constantly taking place . \\n\\nReally you got all that from what ?

As a highly educated eastern Euro who spent the last 8 years of his life in the West ( which is 1/3 of my life by the way ) I could not help but be in complete support to Eastern europeans on the refugee crisis . As many eastern states stated , forcibly relocating refugee there\\ 's was simply idiotic , as all would try to run or feel cheated for not getting placed in Germany , and how would you keep them there , by force ? Refuge started fucking crying even when they realized they ended up crossing the romanian border by mistake , how dafuq do you think that felt to us ? It was very offensive , I\\ 'll tell you that . \\n\\nAnyhow , so here\\ 's the issue , it\\ 's all about politics really . When western politicians such as Merkel saw a political benefit in being the mother of \ '' refugees\ '' she went all in for it , with many politicians from Netherlands , France , the Nordic countries etc . The only reason why the western media ( which is just as much propaganda as russian propaganda really ) went so harshly on eastern states was because they did not buy into that . In eastern Europe being an all for more refugees politician was not bringing political capital , it was actually destroying you politically . Thus eastern politicians didn\\'t buy into their play , and they went to place their own opinions against it . That was all they had at the point , a different opinion , but they got called racists , bigots , nazi\\ 's and what not for it ! How would you not be frustrated at the western Euros after you get that treatment just for not being as idiotically PC as them ? Of course , some leaders saw a way to win political capital from this and they went and created a shit show from the issue themselves , such as Orban in Hungary , the current leaders in the V4 as a more extensive example . And that was probably what went in your face so much that it annoyed you , but it wasn\\'t at all different from what western european politicians did to us , it was exactly the same as a matter of fact , just on the other side . So don\\'t you think you are a bit hypocritical when you are using a clear double measure like that ? \\n\\nWhat I wanted to say is , that while I do support helping refugees and am a very educated person , I could not help but agree with most eastern politicians on the issue . They correctly noticed that the entire solution of distribution was a complete shit and only done to offer the fake impression that something is done , it was only done for the political capital of western politicians , and they didnt want to commit political suicide in their own countries just for the western once to save face , how could I accuse them for that ? For any open minded person there reaction was totally natural , even though exaggerated in some cases ( Viktor Orban ) . \\n\\nNow back to the issue , that did not stop western Euros , such as you , from shitting on eastern Euros for that , which in truth , was you throwing shit on us for having a different opinion on the issue from you . Take me for example , do you think I was against helping the refugees ? I never was , I am not even now . But the solutions proposed by the west were simply idiotic , the problem had to be solved at the core , around Syria , were most refugees live , were all those women and children who can not make the trip are . Send money to Lebanon , to Turkey , to Egypt , make those country help their brothers , they are of the same culture after all . Who could understand them better than their own kind ? And yet , for simply having this different view on the solution , I got so much shit from people like you , how could I not get sick really ? \\n\\nNow a final example , take the politicians of Romania , they were more moderate on the issue . They voted against the mandatory quotas as they believed they were not a solution , however they did not oppose the relocation as it was enforced by the EU . They even started doing it , by now I think they got like 30 refugees here . Why so little you wonder ? They should be above 4500 coming here . Well , that\\ 's because the fucking relocation hubs in Italy and Greece are not working , they are not even fucking operational . That\\ 's how much the EU actually cared about their relocation project , so much it doesn\\'t even work even if you want to do it . But of course , it was never meant to work , it was always just a facade for the masses . The only reason you are pissed is because eastern Europeans didn\\'t buy into your charade , and for that we ANNOY you ? How hypocritical is that really , and because you are annoyed by that I am annoyed for your annoyance ! Isn\\'t life really a wonder in the end ? : ) ) \\n\\nYou are also completely ignoring the very fundamental part of how much western Europe is getting from the eastern open markets and their economical growth which overflows in the west too ... . currently eastern European nations are kinda the engine behind the sluggish growth that the EU is even having as a matter of fact , but let\\ 's not go there , because I feel I would have to start another long long argument about that with you . \\n\\nPS : I agree on the LGBT issue , still lots of things to solve . It\\ 's mainly due to the people being hard core religious here , and that is a result of communist oppression of religion . You western Euros forget or ignore too much that most eastern countries were still a dictatorship 26 years ago . Actually in Romania\\ 's case I would say the communist rule only fell somewhere in the 2000\\ 's , which you can even see on our GDP graphs , the entire decade from 1990-2000 was a complete waste , nothing moved here , just things got demolished . But for what we achieved in just 16 years and the amazingly fast improvements we are doing I can only be proud of my country , and if you can not see that it\\ 's because of your long nose , not because of my peoples\\ ' lack of efforts . So I am sorry , but I\\ 'm not sorry at all ! ; ) \\n\\n Have a nice day .",Romance,Romanian
