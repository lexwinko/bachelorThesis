A coalition ( made of every major party except the communists ) was the norm in the 80s , under the first postwar , highly representative voting system , but [ it did n't work out well ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite ) , eventually . This is not a specificity , it 's pretty systemic in nature , and I feel this is the kind of issue Grey just plainly ignores when he speaks about voting systems . I think it 's partly because he only ever witnessed political issues in the US and UK , which both have the issue of low representativeness , and also ( by his admission ) he has no interest in the peculiarities of each country 's party system and political situation . Voting systems do n't exist in a vacuum , and there is no `` one-kind-fits-all '' type of voting system . This does n't mean that the UK , US etc . voting systems are fine the way they are , but there are more things to consider than how well does it reflect the breakdown of the voters .",Romance,Italian
09876543212345,CGPGrey,"& gt ; It 's not the electoral system that created the problem ; it 's the fact that the PSI and PSDI would n't form a left-wing coalition with the PCI , which guaranteed that the Christian Democrats were in government forever . True . The issue here was that the party system was polarized to an extent . I feel this should be taken into account when drafting the institutional makeup of a country , but that 's another matter . My point was that there are cases where coalitions governments do n't work out as expected . & gt ; Most PR systems stabilise as a number of left-wing parties , and a number of right-wing parties and the larger coalition gets into government . Voters can choose between the two coalitions , but can also choose between parties within the coalitions and therefore push the coalition in a direction they prefer ( e.g . vote Green to increase the priority given to environmental issues within the left-coalition ) . This is pretty much how the Italian system works out these days . One thing to consider is how disciplined the coalition is . Both the 1996 and the 2008 elections in Italy were early elections due to a no-confidence vote from a party in the governing coalition . Needless to say , situations like this have a negative effect on the country as they stifle the lawmaking process .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,AskReddit,"& gt ; Well that 's just fascinating ! So the energies given off by regular matter affect anti-matter in the same ways ? Is this theorised to work with all energy or only light ? If you want a searchable term , this is called `` C symmetry '' in particle physics . Strong force ( holds nuclei together ) has C symmetry as well ( experimentally verified ) . Weak force ( beta decay ) does not have C symmetry ( experimentally verified ) . Gravity does not have an accepted quantization , but I 'd say it has to have C symmetry as well ( an expert please fill this in for me ) . & gt ; I 'm getting way off track here , but to take that to an extreme , could an anti-matter radio pick up my regular music stations and play the music in a normal way ? Pick up , yes . Then the speaker would need to be immersed in `` anti-air '' to transmit the sound . But then **you** would have to be immersed in it to hear it .

12345ieee,AskReddit,"& gt ; In the known universe , sure . I 'm not entirely convinced about the theory that the universe created 1 % more matter than anti-matter at the creation of itself . AFAIK , the matter-antimatter imbalance is still unexplained . Known CP violation sources are still not enough to cover it all . & gt ; I think the chance that a majority of matter/anti-matter destroyed itself and then the rest of the matter and anti-matter never made contact is more likely . & gt ; With this hypothesis , it 's more likely that there is another half of the universe that is entirely anti-matter . I 'm not a theoretical physicist though , so I 'm not sure if there is more evidence or proof of the 1 % theory .

12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"Going on , you 'll notice more and more the 'game ' aspect of this game , which will start imposing constraints on the high-level approaches you can take to solve a problem . E.g . R { A , O } Ms work in a way that forces you do do sequential read/write operations , having an efficient algorithm that requires extensive random access is n't of any use . Learning some tricks to cut on code size is very important , because later you wo n't be able to fit enough in a MC if you do n't compress your code . That said , even in the later levels you can go with a `` optimizer passes '' approach , where initially you write with `jmp`s and waste the `slx` sync value , because it 's high-level and easy , then , much like an optimizing compiler , you come back and do `jmp` pruning , global flag assignment , efficient register assignment and so on ...

Saves 2 lines and 2 power/iteration * `slx x0 ; mov x0 null ; & lt ; instr & gt ; 0` is a transitional pattern , but once you 've done a working solution , you can optimize that `mov x0 null` away , by sending 0 ( or whatever constant you happen to use ) and using it , so it becomes `slx x0 ; & lt ; instr & gt ; x0` . Saves 1 line and 1 power/iter * The bottom MC uses a single flag , the `jmp` is unneeded . Rework the flags and remove the `jmp` .

A RAM has 14 numbers and 2 pointers you can modify , which means there are 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^ ( 2 ) different states in which it can be . Realistically you 'll not be able to iterate through pointers in a RAM , but iterating through all the integers is not that difficult , and yields a 1999^ ( 14 ) steps loop . Sample code ( x0- & gt ; d1 , x1- & gt ; a1 ) : li : mov -999 x0 teq x1 0 - jmp li lg : mov x1 dat mov x0 acc teq acc 999 + teq dat 13 - add 1 - mov dat x1 - mov acc x0 # Put long function # here , e.g . : # mov -1 x3 - jmp lg EDIT : This code does not actually use all the states , but just 1999*14 , but it 's enough to show that a RAM has much more potential than a ROM or register .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"Duplicate the `mov 10 x2` in the lower MC6k and make both conditional , you saved 1 instruction in the `2` codepath at expense of 1 line . Also , I recommend iterating through a RAM , a ROM has just 14^2 states , a RAM has 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^2",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,spacechem,"Received the invite , thanks a lot . Let 's see how this thing works .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,Gemcraft,"Let 's get started with a simple overview . Chain hit is worth between x500-x10000 in gem efficiency , depending on how many monsters you have over your gem . For comparison having slow gems is a x10 in gem efficiency ( 90 % slowed = speed x0.1 = hits taken x10 ) . Now , the nice global scaling formula `P=M^ ( gk/ ( 1-gm ) ) *K` tells you that if you lose a x10 in gem efficiency you roughly lose a x10^5 in final damage ( this factors in mana collection , managem scaling , killgem scaling , etc ... ) . So , uhm , leave out red and you roughly lose a x ( 1000^5 ) = x1e15 . Technically it is possible to win an endurance with this penalty , you 'd change the easiest endurance in an extremely hard one ( see https : //docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mfWXh80KGKTaTx-p033c6xeEuH2UoyoWna6SoKKXB2U/edit # gid=1391672033 ) . So , to answer : & gt ; Are there any ways of improving performance to have a steady 30 fps while still using chain hit gems ? I have tried every tip from this sub regarding option settings . No & gt ; Is it possible to finish endurance mode on the hardest difficulty without chain hit ? If my math is n't wrong , yes it is . But it 's very very very very tight . & gt ; What would the optimal setup be ? Same one you 're using : slow , managem ( s ) ( the more the better , till too much lag ) , space ( optional , in case you want WoE-cycling ) , slow ( optional , you might not need it ) , killgem . & gt ; Can the gemforce software be used in a way to return the best recipes without the red gem ? Yes , gemforce actually builds red-less gems , the red adder is a shitty hack that adds red with a semi-decent brute search . You 'll need to run gemforce itself , though , asking it to give you the red-less recipes and then feeding them to wGC . In case you **really** want to do that feel free to ask for further help , both with the tools and with battle tactics .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Link to youtube video generated by the game 's record function for verification , done . No need for any steam id friendlist bullshit , just submit a link and anyone can verify it . This way all the solutions will become public . I do n't think this should be mandatory to submit a score . & gt ; I would n't bother listing scores by platform , as there 's no easy way to verify that something like a production level is using a specific platforms random seed except for fully constructing the solution on that platform . Just lump them together and let people minmax their random seed by platform selection if they want to push the envelope . The problem with this is that the score table will become meaningless . The first place would always be of the guy who wrote a botched C math library ( this counts as 'platform ' ) , had the game load it and then abused a randomness he can perfectly control . The table should lock down the platform to be usable . & gt ; I would n't try to evaluate what is and is n't a state machine , because you run into a lot of edge cases . Is a solution that is n't able to handle a rare input combination a state machine for taking advantage of that or just not a perfect solution ? What about only using knowledge of the first input , or just the last ? Many optimized solutions take advantage of that kind of knowledge while handling all other inputs normally . & gt ; & gt ; For bug exploits you 'd need to be very specific for what is and is n't allowed , since the same bug that enables particle smashing also enables Input + Fuse where you input on top of another atom and avoid collision by fusing the same cycle to remove the collision . Input + Fuse is used in a ton of optimized and even regular solutions to various fusion levels . Choose a standard , then rely on the honor system .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"For comparison , in Shenzhen IO we rely entirely on Steam scores ( and the honor system for the less significant digits that the game does n't show ) . This is possible because it was decided to not record full information ( cost/power/lines ) for each record , but just the score , because knowing the cost leads to metagaming in Shenzhen IO . In Spacechem I do n't think there is any information gained from the number of reactors used , so there is no problem with recording the whole score . We can definitely start with the honor system and the hundreds of solutions already on youtube . To deal with bugs and randomness , the default bucket could be `` all goes '' ( one for each platform , if there is randomness ) and then a `` restricted '' that uses e.g . 2015 tournament rules ( again , one for each platform , if there is randomness ) .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,dataisbeautiful,"I do n't think you know where dark energy enters the equations here . Einstein 's equations have a free parameter , called `` Cosmological constant '' ( I 'll call it L ) , that ca n't be constrained by local measurements ( we can just say it 's very small ) . It turns out , if you want GR to match what we see , you can not take L to be 0 , but it 's got to have a certain tiny value . This is not a `` fudge factor '' , it 's simply a free parameter of the theory we tuned with experiments ( like , dunno , the value of surface gravity in classical mechanics ) . L then reappears in the equation for the age of the universe , we plug it in and do the math , no funny business anywhere . The interpretation of L , now , it 's difficult . It turns out that L is on the same side of the equation as the densities/pressures of matter and radiation , so we think about L not as some wavy factor , but as the density/pressure of a strange kind of `` energy '' ( hence the name `` dark energy '' ) . But we know of no kind of particle/field/whatever that can produce the observed density/pressure of the dark energy , so for now we simply measure it and put it manually in Einstein 's equation . In the future we may identify some exotic `` thing '' that produces the right density/pressure and we 'll be able to compute L from the properties of this `` thing '' .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,dataisbeautiful,"I 'm not sure I follow you . Physics theories are just giant machines that ( assuming they are correct ) get some data in input and spit out some other data we want to know .

In an ideal world you 'd measure each one in a separate experiment ( so you have no correlation ) , here is a bit more complicated , but whatever ... Once you have these 4 values you can throw them in the age equation and it spits out the age of the universe , which is the important thing you wanted to know . You can not avoid `` mixing '' the 4 experimental values if you want to know the age of the universe .

At that point we 'd have difficulties in saying you can use QFT near the horizon ( that IIRC is necessary to get Hawking radiation ) , because we are in the domain of `` quantum gravity '' .

12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Bad comparison , since using things like particle smashing or telekinetic waldos require a deep understanding of the game and a lot of design work to use well and are n't an automatic win button . A better comparison would be to various speed runner tricks in games , or to something like [ Parallel Universes in SM64 ] ( http : //pannenkoek2012.wikia.com/wiki/Parallel_Universe ) . Yeah , you 're right . You 'll also know that speedruns have different categories ( just get to the end/complete everything/do not abuse glitches/etc ... ) , that 's the same way I proposed to solve the scoring problem on the other thread . & gt ; Swapite is trivial due to an output molecule verification bug and is one of only two levels affected by it where input = output . It 's basically never used outside that in actual solutions due to being inconsistent/poorly understood and generally not worth the effort . So it ends up being the onus of the level creator to check that input =/= output . & gt ; & gt ; For everything else , I do n't believe in `` intended challenge '' in an open ended puzzle game . That 's the beauty of SpaceChem : you 're given the tools and an obstacle to overcome , and how you approach and tackle that obstacle is all up to the individual . Different approaches can already make puzzles intended to be difficult super easy , ie creating a garbage ball instead of working out perfect fusion/fission math . But that 's part of the fun and charm of the game , and things like particle smashing are just another tool in the toolbox ( a hard one to use practically at that ) for designing clever solutions . I do not agree here . In a sense , you 're not playing Spacechem ( or I 'm not , perspective ) , you 're playing a game with slightly more ( less ) tools at your disposal . The puzzles are designed for just one of these `` game versions '' and may break horribly in the other . As the campaign and 99 % of ResearchNet were designed with the restricted game in mind , that 's what I play .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Thanks again for the info , I followed that guide and changed some skills around and got 300 more levels . I have some other questions now though : ) . Ok & gt ; & gt ; You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; What exactly are the skills you are referring too ? Do I need some special program or is it programming code ? I have some familiarity with coding . Also , do you know if changing the sprites would help ? I just kinda pulled that out of my ass . The short answer is : forget it . & gt ; In the guide you created/helped create you mentioned at the end that it could take up to 40 hours to max out exp on a map . Does this mean that endurance runs take so long that you usually have to leave it paused while you go to work/sleep and it spans several days ? Cuz that sounds terrible . Yes . Yes . Yes . & gt ; When I tried out using bloodbound gems , I noticed my managems at one point had a million hits , yet my killgem only had ~30,000 around the same time . What can I do to up the hit count of my first killgem ? For the final killgem you need to use a training killgem before your manafarm , the EEG guide explains this . Upping the count of the first killgem is hardly useful at all . & gt ; The guide also mentions at a certain point you want to stop mana farming and start building your final killgem . When do decide to do that/how do you know when you have enough mana ? When you 'll be an experienced player and go for the endurance victory you 'll do the math and farm enough mana that allows you to build a killgem good enough to kill the last waves . For now , farm till you get bored . & gt ; Also , how do you construct the final killgem ? I had about 6 g2rb gems each with between 1 mil and 3mil hits . I combined them all with yellow and each other and then did killgem combine with the gemweaving program , but it still was worse than my first killgem even though it had way more hits ( I guess the start was really bad/inefficient ? ) Yep , the 'spec ' you used is horrid , refer to the EEG guide for an effective method ( training killgem ) . & gt ; Finally , is there some way to add mana cost to gem recipes in the gem weaving program ? Because I used a combine when I did n't have all the mana I needed . It stopped halfway through , and I did n't know how to finish the recipe , so it seemed like a huge waste . It makes no sense , how is the combiner supposed to know how much the starting gem costs ? For all it knows you could be using the same combine for a g3 or a g110 . The only things that make sense is the cost increase , which is showed . & gt ; Thanks again ! You are welcome .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Hello , I recently started playing this game and I 've enjoyed it quite a bit , but I 'm a little confused on the next steps I should take . I am wizard level 2.3k and have just started some endurance runs . Hi & gt ; Lately , I get bored cuz it takes too damn long with lag , and I stop enraging and just send all waves . I 've made it to wave 372 in endurance . Is there any way to reduce lag ? Get all your settings to min . Short of that , nothing to be done , game is in Flash , the engine itself is shitty . & gt ; Maybe by modding the game to change the sprites of all the enemies to small boxes or something ? You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; However , I 'm not exactly sure how I should spend skills optimally . I saw a guide on steam that ranked skills in level of importance , but it did n't mention how many unused points to save . Right now I have almost all capped skills maxed out ( just the spells left at 30+15 ) and all non-capped skills at 30+15 ( the important ones at least ) . Said guide is mine . You have to leave enough unspent points so you have enough mana at the start . I do n't play for you , you have to find a balance . & gt ; I am also curious how people enrage waves and how often ppl upgrade gems . Any guidelines would be helpful . So far I 've just enraged until the HP of reavers/swarmlings is about equal to my killgem 's max dmg , then used the same number of gems on giant waves . Nope , enrage for armor over managem damage , not HP . The EEG guide has a ton of info on this and gems . http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=434889753 & gt ; Another question I had was what are the optimal talisman bonuses ? I 've heard anything with WoE is good , but I 'm not sure how to balance + % charge of all spells and enhancements . Anything with +1 all skills and +10 % exp is good , extra stats are just for show . Skills sought after are WoE/Freeze charges and effect and shrine charges & gt ; When are you strong enough to take on hatred 10 ? Never , unless you cheat & gt ; Final questions : does destroying a monster nest reduce the number of monsters in a level ? No & gt ; Does endurance mode end and how strong do you need to be to reach it ? Yes , at w999 . Depends on the difficulty . & gt ; When is it better to use bloodbound instead of poolbound ? Always after g30 & gt ; Thanks ! You are welcome & gt ; Edit : Another question , lets say I blocked beacons from spawning everywhere but a corner of the map and that corner can have a max of 20 beacons , if I were to enrage a wave such that 22 beacons would spawn , will the extra two beacons spawn after I destroy some of the first 20 ?

This is absolutely not the way to go . I know it and I 'm sure you know it too , so let 's just get that out of the way . & gt ; I 'm pretty sure that once I have a bit of success my anxiety will dissipate and my skills should come up to the level of others my age . This jumped out at me , too , so I 'll tell what my experience taught me : your anxiety is there to stay , unless you tackle that mofo down , with the help of a therapist if needed ( I can assure you , for many people it 's much easier with one ) . Tying the solutions of your internal struggles to an external 'miracle cure ' will never solve your problem : your head will simply find something else to be anxious about . Now that I 've gotten that out of the way ... This probably wo n't be exactly what you 're looking for , but the way you 're feeling is normal . At 20 , you 're still incredibly young , and , even if it feels that way , not having had any sort of relationship at 20 is neither particularly uncommon nor something you should feel ashamed about . I myself did n't have any sort of relationship with anyone until I was 22 ; I absolutely felt sexually frustrated , unwanted , ready to be with any guy at all just to get rid of my virginity . I was being way overdramatic about the whole thing ; worse , I was treating people like a means to an end . You say things like `` to find a reliable source of real life sexual release '' , or `` what conversational techniques do I need to employ to avoid the dreaded friend zone and get quite quickly to the point of having a sexual relationship ? `` , and that just feels like you 're seeing these potential girls as the way you 'll get sex . That wo n't solve your insecurities or your desire of intimacy with someone else , and it will just make it a sad experience for everyone involved . So , this is how it happened to me : I actually got out of the house to do the things I was passionate about . I stopped approaching every conversation with a dude as a `` can I get him interested in sex with me ? '' minigame ; I just talked about the things we had in common . I met new people at the places I went for my hobbies ( you mention liking music : are there any local band you can follow , maybe a smaller scene where you can chat with people , close to your home ? ) ; if you can start talking about your shared passions , the conversation will be more fun for everyone , and you 're probably going to feel a lot less embarassed . I got an haircut that suited me and made me feel snazzy ( silly , but effective ) . In the end , I employed a lot of `` fake it till you make it '' : I could act more confident , make people believe I was confident , and feel slightly more confident myself as a result . I finally had sex , it was super fun , but my insecurities stayed firmly in their place . To close this already long-ass post , I used to read what Dr. Nerdlove wrote on his blog : it has a lot of stuff about helping nerdy and otherwise shy guys with girls ; things about presenting yourself well and being charming without being pushy . I have n't read it in a while , and I have n't always found myself agreeing with him , but it may be something you want to check out . Edit : syntax",Romance,Italian

Also , a rape trial -if it does , indeed , even go to trial- is not merely `` unpleasant '' : it 's an occasion where your every action is picked on , where you feel violated all over again because everything will be called into question . Very often , there is no jail time for the rapist , no justice , because very often there is no objective proof . I 'm not going to blame the OP because she does n't want to face that . I get what you 're saying , at a logical level , but that 's not an empathetic response .

I 'm wildly guessing , but I think he 's trying to find out what she `` did wrong '' , so there can be a reason to the harm his daughter has received . It 's a wrong response , though , because now she has to deal with his reaction as well and she has one less parent to receive support from . She 'd be justified with cutting him out , IMO , and I 'm glad she has at least her mom . To OP , I just want to tell that I 'm terribly sorry you 're going through this .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I was molested by my stepfather when I was about 16 , did not tel my mother until one year ago , more or less , 8 years after the fact .

I accepted that she 'd rather keep the status quo , at least for the time present , than confront her partner about shit like this . This , though , was something that worked for me ; you may want other things . It 's supremely shitty that your mother did n't recognize the abuse when you were younger , and I think she knows it was a partly her fault that this never came up , and that 's why she 's unresponsive now . She does not want to face it , so she 's running away and pretending the problem does not exist . Which is doubly shitty , because one good step to repair the damage would be being close to you and helping you . My personal reading , you know best if this fits your mother or not . And honestly , no matter the reason , you can decide how much contact do you want with your mother from now on . You can not control her reaction , but you can control how much she 's around . I would second the advice of trying therapy ; for me , it meant I finally sterted to deal with the molestation . Sometimes you do n't click with your therapist , but that 's normal ; you can always try with another . I would also advise you to tell your boyfriend or a close friend , to have someone 100 % on your side , because that helps immeasurably . I think it 's good that you finally told someone , even if your mother failed to support you in any way . Anger is your friend here , it can push you forward and make you learn how to deal with stuff that seemed too complicated or scary before .

OWB is a solo mission , the others give you companion ( s ) as much as it makes sense for the story . *Nope ! Your ED-E will wait for you in the Mojave . I do n't really want to say more . *It depends on how you play . I prefer not to cheese and to stay closer to a role play perspective , others have more fun trying to get all the cash home . Bear in mind that by the end of the game you will not have money problems , gold bars or not . *Lonesome Road is , IMO , best enjoyed near the end of the storyline , because it wraps up all the other DLCs and touches upon your alliances ( if it 's not still bugged- are you on PC ?

Therapy will help her cope with what happened and find out how she wants to deal with this situation , wether that be secrecy again or not . You should n't push excessively , but I think that saying that you 're very worried and that you think she 'll be infinitely better with therapy would not be too much . How old is your friend , by the way ? If she 's had any experience with relatives or friends who were helped by therapy , it would be a good thing to remind her .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Oh , sweetheart , I 'm so incredibly sorry this happened to you . Guilt is a normal thing to feel , and it 's useless to tell you that you should n't . What I 'd like you to do , however , is to tell yourself every day that you did n't take anyone away . You did not deprive your mother of her husband , he did that . You did not deprive your brother of a father , he did that too . And , most importantly , he never let you have a real father , only one who was also an abuser , and this is the worst thing of them all . Please , please , if you are n't already doing it , keep in contact with your school counselor and stay in therapy . You 're going through a terrible time , and you have been through some really messed up stuff . Therapy will give you the tools to process it in a healthy way . I can tell you that this feelings will pass . You will probably feel very , very angry . It will be terrible , but you can also use that anger to do so many things , to reinvent yourself as a girl who has great grades and volunteers and does sports . Things are awful right now , but you can and you will get on the other side as a new , even stronger person . I have no doubt of it , because you have been brave as hell in speaking with your counselor and telling your mother . Even if you doubt it now , I 'm 100 % convinced that you made the right choice . I 'm sending you hugs .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,GirlGamers,"Oh man , I 've been replaying New Vegas and I *lurve* it just as much as I did the first time . It 's got the right mix of freedom of movement and story depth and nice quest design , and the DLCs are the best ( Dead Money being my favorite ) . I 'm trying Project Nevada for the first time , and it is amazing .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Completely agree . Also , OP , I wanted to add not to get hung up over the notion of `` closure '' that seeing her at the convention would give you . Closure is something you find in yourself , IMO , not something other people can give you . Do n't go , not because you 'd be professing your feelings to `` another dude 's girlfriend '' , but because this fixation is unhealthy for you , and you showing up and declaring your love would probably be really uncomfortable for real-person-Jane . On a positive note , I once nursed a one-way crush for four years straight and let me tell you , buddy , once I managed to stop obsessing over him and I was able to move on with my life without heartache , it was SO great . I am now in a relationship with a fantastic guy , and it 's so much better , because it 's real and not just in my head , and I 'm not comparing him to a fantasy .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Hey , OP , I 'm sorry this happened to you . I 'm going to offer a different opinion : you do n't *have* to tell anyone of you do n't feel like it , but maybe talking with a therapist could help . I tell you this because I was in a similar situation ( although it happened when I was older , so there are no missing scenes , so to speak ) and the memories never really went away . I did suppress them for a while , but in the end , they always came back and ended up fucking with my head quite a bit . Maybe you will deal with them on your own and all will be well . But a therapist could help you not only decide who/how/how much to tell , but also make peace with the fact that they exist , while reinforcing that what happened was very much not right . It helped me a lot .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Honestly , I also think that down to the road of `` does he know what he did was wrong ? '' lies madness . Right now that does n't matter , OP , only how his actions made you feel . And his actions were horrible and wrong , and made you feel incredibly bad . Why do n't you try writing your best friend an e-mail ? It can make talking about difficult things much easier . After that , you can decide wether or not you feel confortable going to the police .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Yes ! OP , freezing in these situations is so , so common . It 's a normal reaction to fear , and not an indicator on wether you fought him off `` enough '' ( also , you should n't have to bodily fight off your husband if you do n't want sex ) .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I did n't say it before , but I 'm sorry you went though this , OP . Reporting or not is 100 % your choice- though I agree with u/Totally_Ok_Guy that if you decide to do it , it would be best to do it soon . I can understand the feeling of `` wrongness '' from reporting someone close , but keep in mind that he sure as hell did n't extend you the same courtesy . I , personally , do n't think you owe him shit . All in all , though , you know the situation best , and I absolutely would n't judge you either way .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"Ad Dionysus said , JE Sawyer 's is pretty great . Keep in mind that with that mod , you are also going to level up slower and die more often , and IIRC get crippled more easily . Project Nevada is also a good overhaul mod with a lot of separately customizable parts , just do n't use it with Sawyer 's . Other than that , go nuts with your character ! Are they a sniper , maybe a cowboy ? Keep a theme with weapons , armor and perks ! Is he/she a mysanthrope with horrible charisma and a 12 in Speech ? I feel that imagining characters with motivations and a personality with virtues and flaws makes for a better experience . And then have the skills and SPECIALs reflect that personality . From a gameplay point of view , I 'd say pick either survival or medicine , since they 're both healing skills .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"No worries , I like planning characters ! And ok , so no mods then . If you want to go solo , I 'd recommend a higher Perception , rather than Agility ( you probably want to go for the one-hit-kill as a solo sniper , anyway ) , since you 're not going to benefit from ED-E 's perk . You need at least 6 Luck for the Better Criticals perk ( +50 % crit damage , and keep in mind that every hit from sneak counts as a crit ) . Also , you 'd have to have at least 6 Strength for the sniper rifles ( 8 for the AMR , but I do n't think that 's made for stealth ! ) . Christine 's Rifle in OWB ( if you have the DLC ) or the Gobi ( if you have some lockpick skill ) are good choices . Moderate intelligence ( and probably charisma , since no companions mean no benefit from it ) sounds fine . Guns , sneak , lockpick , speech if you want , repair and medicine/survival would all be good skills . Then there 's the little things that have no effect on the mechanics , but help you choose the quests and responses , like how empathetic he is to other 's misfortunes , wether he likes technology or not , if he prefers to approach problems diplomatically or with violence , if there 's a particular group of people he likes or dislikes , and so on . Buuut , I realize that not everyone likes to roleplay that much , so do what you think is more fun .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"Nothing dramatic should happen , but they change a lot of the same things , so I guess the mod placed lower would just overwrite a lot of stuff from the other .

Also , yeah , if you express sexist , assholish views , people are going to think you 're a sexist asshole .

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Oh ! Totally did n't catch that they 're all in the USA now , sorry . It 's even *more* ridiculous now that I see that . That said , they 're using European categories to discriminate , considering that racist Western Europeans look down on Slavs ( which IIRC she technically is n't , since her family is muslim-bosnian ) . Racist non-Muslim Europeans in general also look down on Muslims , BTW . I 'm not entirely sure I understand what American communautarism is , but I 'd be ready to bet quite a lot that they would n't have problems if the girlfriend was a Catholic or Protestant girl of French descent or something .",Romance,Italian

I go to therapy for other things , but also talk about sexual-related problems if I have any . It looks like you had a terrible upbringing regarding your sexuality , of course it must be hard to relax during sex . I 'm pretty sure your therapist would help you like with any other issue . Also , regarding your boyfriend and foreplay , he should understand it 's okay sometimes to do things in bed that are just 'meh ' for him , but make things better for you ( keep in mind : not stuff that makes him uncomfortable , just stuff he 's not crazy about ) . Sex is a two-people ( or more ... ) effort , and he 's not *that* young , so he should already know this .",Romance,Italian

And boy did I have your same fears as a teen , especially seeing how almost all of my friends had boyfriends or girlfriends . How you 're feeling is perfectly normal . Like everyone else , I 'm going to tell you not to worry about it : there 's no expiration date to anyone 's virginity , and nobody with a modicum of maturity will really care about when you first had sex . If you 're not comfortable with it just now , then it 's perfectly ok to wait until you are , and I , for one , think that it 's smart that you 're picking this choice , even while feeling conflicted . You 'll be fine . Right now it may feel like the rest of high school is a damn long time , but really , it 's not a couple of years that are going to make a difference .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Honestly , I see what you mean , it 's just the expression `` glutton for abuse '' that does n't sit too well with me . Also , from experience , I think it 's important to remain in the abused person 's life , and not let them become isolated ... to be present and not judge her , or she might just not have anyone to turn to when she realizes this relationship sucks .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I do n't know , OP . I can tell you that when my brother was ready to leave his unhealthy relationship , I was glad that he felt he could come crash with us . He had already alienated the rest of the family and , as far as I know , also did n't have much contact with his friends . I 'll agree that it 's draining though , what with the excuses and the lies and the going back despite all the red flags ...",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"It does n't sit well with me because people do n't *like* being abused ... People are young , or they are afraid to be alone or have incredibly stupid notions that if love does n't mean pain and sacrifice , it 's not true love . Maybe they think that they are being loyal to their partner , when they are just being manipulated . Maybe they just do n't want to admit that they could ever end up with an abusive pertner . Nobody ever thinks that being controlled and cheated on and constantly hounded is a just swell way to live . It 's just that they tend to minimize , because they think that the good stuff is worth the bad . And you and I know that it 's bullshit , but an 18-years-old may not .",Romance,Italian

Unfortunately , that is just what 's going to happen to anybody that criticizes him , for now .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Well , first of all , deep insecurity sucks , I know how that feels ! As already suggested , maybe therapy to deal with that could be helpful . Also , I do n't know how serious you are with your last line , but remember that any kind of suicidal thought is a serious matter , and should be addressed with a therapist . That said ... I was a very insecure 20-something , who never had a boyfriend and had n't even held hands with anybody . A thing that helped me immensely with insecurity , and also led me to meet my current guy , was launching myself in all kinds of activities , because I liked them , and not just to meet men . Go volunteering in something you care about , or join a political group if you 're so inclined , or develop a social aspect to your hobbies , be it sports , or reading , or gaming ! This way , you actually get more experienced in dealing with people , find out how to navigate a public setting , and , gradually , it would maybe help with being a bit less nervous . Cherry on cake : you get to meet new people who like the same things that you do , and with whom you have at least a starting common topic . People who will automatically consider some of the things you do interesting , because they do them too ! I mean , maybe you just are n't the type of person that 's able to approach people out of the blue . Some people are , I sure am not , and I do n't think that it 's a bad thing . You 're still very young . Your twenties are all right there to be experienced , time is not running out as much as it seems . And remember that , even when you go out and pursue hobbies and meet women who like the same things as you do ... sometimes your personalities will still be incompatible , or maybe you wo n't be their type . This happens , and it 's nobody 's fault , and it will not be a strike against your worth as a human being . Rejection sucks , but it happens to everybody , and how we deal with it says a lot about our personality . Good luck , OP !",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I 'm so sorry this happened to you , it 's terrible to even think about something like this . You did good though . You involved the police , you protected yourself and your son . You took the most difficult step , now you just have to keep going in this direction . Other people will have more experience than me in this , but until they write , I 'd say : -go stay with family or friends for a while , or maybe look for women 's shelters in your area , if you want to stay somewhere he does n't know about . On that note , I 'd maybe turn off any kind of tracking/gps app on your phone , if you have any . I do n't want to scare you , but you have to keep in mind that this is the most dangerous part in an abusive relationship ; do n't tell people who might speak to your ex where you are , and try to always be with someone ; -take pictures of all the bruises he gave you ( on multiple days , maybe , so they can be seen better ) and the property damage , for the trial ; -sending your son to a therapist is a good idea , but do find something for yourself , too . If you do n't want/ca n't afford a therapist , RAINN.org has a hotline for abuse survivors , and I 'm told it 's a good one .

Yeah , to the outside eye , it 's not great . It sounds to me like you handled that first conversation well , but it 's something I 'd expect from a long-term partner . An addiction is a tough thing to push back , and alcoholism is a pretty destructive addiction . Even if he 's completely serious about stopping drinking , there would still be a lot of highs and lows . I 'd tell you to proceed with care and compassion , if he was not taking his difficulties out on you . Matter of fact , he is . I honestly do not see this ending well , I 'm sorry .

Speaking of which , I also found really interesting to play a faithful Dalish that gets disillusioned with their history , ancestors and gods after the Well and becomes a non-believer . This from someone who vastly preferred the City Elves to the Dalish in earlier games , so , in my experience , it can be a satisfying story even if the Dalish are not your favourite . As far as class goes , it 's really not much of a difference ( it changes one line in the Solas romance , and I think that 's it ) .

13RunawayTurtles,GirlGamers,"Mmm , let 's see if I can make this more coherent .

Except the reason presented in-game is pretty contrived . Also , i think that not liking a game because you do n't like shooters , or stealth games , or puzzle games is not the same thing as not liking when a game has a bad portrayal of women , or black people , or gay people . Because one is a matter of taste , the other is a matter of feeling excluded , or mocked for what you are . These kind representations make me feel `` othered '' , as it is , because I see my gender and a body ( broadly ... I mean , I wish ! ) similar to mine used simply for titillation in something that 's not supposed to be porn . I do n't know , can you relate to what I 'm saying in any way ? Has anything ever made you feel like this ? To conclude , I also do n't think this does not hurt anybody . Obviously , it does n't hurt people directly , but it exists in , and reinforces , a cultural paradigm in which women are seen as sex objects in contexts that have really nothing to do with sex .

It 's very much male-gazey , and therefore it makes me feel like the creator is telling me `` This is not for you '' . And that hurts a little , when it comes from something you love ( gaming in general , for me , not MGS in particular ) . Like the author of this article said , it 's not about the boobs .

333ml,civilengineering,"The ASD and the WSM are the same design philosophy , which is limited to the elastic range . Basically you have a member that you want to design , you compute the forces acting on the member , the next step is to choose size the member/reinforcement . You want to makes sure that the required strength does not exceed the allowable one , so you compare the stress acting on the section with the yield stress of the material being used . The yield stress is reduced by a safety factor . Concerning the limit state method , the loads are amplified by a safety factor and then you determine the cross section properties . The cross section has to satisfy the ultimate limit state and the serviceability conditions . The ultimate checks basically are about the safety of the member ( the condition just before collapse ) , for example for a concrete beam you want to make sure that the strain is less than 0.0035 ( I think this is the value given by the ACI ) . Serviceability limits are not as critical as the ultimate ones , for example you have to limit the deflection of a beam or check the amount of cracking . The LSM method allows for more economic design , the structure is allowed to go beyond the elastic range , the yield strain of concrete is about 0.002 but your allowed to go beyond that in a beam design .",Romance,Italian

333ml,lebanon,"Check qs rankings for universities in Europe in the field of ME and check the websites of the universities that you find . In general UK universities are expensive whereas in the rest of Europe the tuitions are very affordable . It does n't matter if the university is listed in the study abroad page . And you do n't need to know the language if the courses are given in English , of course it 's beneficial for everyday interactions but I 've been abroad for 2 years and the language barrier was never a serious problem ( I highly recommend you to start learning the language in Lebanon you wo n't find time to learn it in Europe ) . As for how useful it is and if a master in Lebanon is better it depends on what you want to do after graduation . If you 're interested in working in research and development a master abroad at a reputable university is infinitely better , you learn interesting advanced topics that you wo n't find in Lebanon . If you want to work in hvac design ( I do n't know much about ME ) I think a master in Lebanon will be enough . In terms of difficulty it 's harder here . In Lebanon most of my courses were 3 hours a week each . Here it 's either 6 or 10 hours for each course so you have much more content to learn and the semester length is nearly the same . And you will lack a lot in terms of background ( again 3 hours vs 6-10 hours ) so you 'll have to study some extra stuff that your colleagues know . A lot of people fail , in my first semester abroad there was around 35 foreign students , in the second semester around 10 people left and at the end of the year around 10 more people left . It might be easier in other universities but expect to be challenged wherever you go in Europe .",Romance,Italian

333ml,civilengineering,"Because of the lateral confinement which is present in a plate but is not present in a beam . If you consider a beam elongated along z under a transversal load it will have out of plane displacement , not only in the same direction of the load but in the second plane ( x-y ) too due to Poisson effect . Now in a plate these lateral deflections are prohibited ( that 's why you have internal moments in both directions ) , just imagine the slab as a row of beams which inhibit each other from expanding/shrinking . This change in behavior reflects on the constitutive relations between the resultant stresses and curvature . Consider the case of cylindrical bending , I think it 's the best way to compare the beams to the plates . The relation between the moment and the curvature in the plate is : Mx=DX D is the plate stiffness and equal to Eh^3 /12 ( 1-v^2 ) where h is the plate thickness and X is the curvature . Now consider a beam , the stiffness is EI=Eh^3 /12 . As you can see D is higher that EI ( the Poisson ration is ~0.2 for concrete and ~0.3 for steel ) .",Romance,Italian

Tripoli is more conservative than Beirut in general but most of it is nothing like Tebbeneh or the Jabal which only make a very small part of the city .

333ml,arabs,"I never had issue with government surveillance , I was like I do n't do anything harmless meh . My opinion changed after reading this post . I do n't have a link to the original comment , I only have the text : ***************************************************************************************** I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship . One of the Arab spring countries . I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US . People here talking about curfews are n't realizing what that actually FEELS like . It is n't about having to go inside , and the practicality of that . It 's about creating the feeling that everyone , everything is watching . A few points : 1 ) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state . Not terrorists . People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo . These could be religious ideas . These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking . It makes it very easy to know who these people are . It also makes it very simple to control these people . Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals . So you make a plan and go to protest these practices . You get there , and wow , the protest is huge . You never expected this , you were just goofing off . Well now everyone who was there is suspect . Even though you technically had the right to protest , you 're now considered a dangerous person . With this tech in place , the government does n't have to put you in jail . They can do something more sinister . They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend . Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes . Or they can threaten to get your dad fired . All you have to do , the email says , is help them catch your friends in the group . You have to report back every week , or you dad might lose his job . So you do . You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid , you 're reporting on them to protect your dad . 2 ) Let 's say number one goes on . The country is a weird place now . Really weird . Pretty soon , a movement springs up like occupy , except its bigger this time . People are really serious , and they are saying they want a government without this power . I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal . You see on the news that tear gas was fired . Your friend calls you , frantic . They 're shooting people . Oh my god . you never signed up for this . You say , fuck it . My dad might lose his job but I wo n't be responsible for anyone dying . That 's going too far . You refuse to report anymore . You just stop going to meetings . You stay at home , and try not to watch the news . Three days later , police come to your door and arrest you . They confiscate your computer and phones , and they beat you up a bit . No one can help you so they all just sit quietly . They know if they say anything they 're next . This happened in the country I live in . It is not a joke . 3 ) Its hard to say how long you were in there . What you saw was horrible . Most of the time , you only heard screams . People begging to be killed . Noises you 've never heard before . You , you were lucky . You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you , but no one shocked you . No one used sexual violence on you , at least that you remember . There were some times they gave you pills , and you ca n't say for sure what happened then . To be honest , sometimes the pills were the best part of your day , because at least then you did n't feel anything . You have scars on you from the way you were treated . You learn in prison that torture is now common . But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker . Its considered a threat to national security . Pretty soon , a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad . You think it 's infected . There were no doctors in prison , and it was so overcrowded , who knows what got in the cut . You go to the doctor , but he refuses to see you . He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you . Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police . You decide to go home and see your parents . Maybe they can help . This leg is getting really bad . You get to their house . They are n't home . You ca n't reach them no matter how hard you try . A neighbor pulls you aside , and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and have n't been seen since . You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest . Even your little brother is n't there . 4 ) Is this even really happening ? You look at the news . Sports scores . Celebrity news . It 's like nothing is wrong . What the hell is going on ? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper . You lose it . You shout at him `` fuck you dude what are you laughing at ca n't you see I 've got a fucking wound on my leg ? '' `` Sorry , '' he says . `` I just did n't know anyone read the news anymore . '' There have n't been any real journalists for months . They 're all in jail . Everyone walking around is scared . They ca n't talk to anyone else because they do n't know who is reporting for the government . Hell , at one time YOU were reporting for the government . Maybe they just want their kid to get through school . Maybe they want to keep their job . Maybe they 're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor . It 's always a simple reason . Good people always do bad things for simple reasons . You want to protest . You want your family back . You need help for your leg . This is way beyond anything you ever wanted . It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms . Now you 're basically considered a terrorist , and everyone around you might be reporting on you . You definitely ca n't use a phone or email . You ca n't get a job . You ca n't even trust people face to face anymore . On every corner , there are people with guns . They are as scared as you are . They just do n't want to lose their jobs . They do n't want to be labeled as traitors . This all happened in the country where I live . You want to know why revolutions happen ? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse . But this thing that is happening now is big . This is the key ingredient . This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above . The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described . In the country I live in , they also claimed it was for the safety of the people . Same in Soviet Russia . Same in East Germany . In fact , that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone . But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality . Maybe Obama wo n't do it . Maybe the next guy wo n't , or the one after him . Maybe this story is n't about you . Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now , when a big war is happening , or after another big attack . Maybe it 's about your daughter or your son . We just do n't know yet . But what we do know is that right now , in this moment we have a choice . Are we okay with this , or not ? Do we want this power to exist , or not ? You know for me , the reason I 'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance . I was taught that the United States meant `` liberty and justice for all . '' You get older , you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution . That 's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is . Well , the government just violated that ideal . So if they are n't standing for liberty and justice anymore , what are they standing for ? Safety ? Ask yourself a question . In the story I told above , does anyone sound safe ? I did n't make anything up . These things happened to people I know . We used to think it could n't happen in America . But guess what ? It 's starting to happen . I actually get really upset when people say `` I do n't have anything to hide . Let them read everything . '' People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads . They are naive , and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no .",Romance,Italian

Beirut is the capital , it attracts most of the foreigners , it has the AUB , professors coming from outside will settle there . The biggest companies are located there , the headquarters of the banks are in Beirut . So in theory Beirut should be doing fine , lots of opportunity to work , good infrastructure to accommodate for the traffic and the foreigners . So everything should be good but it 's not , even in the capital . Tripoli does n't attract as much people as Beirut , it does n't have the biggest companies so poverty is a big problem . I mentioned the banks in Beirut because I know people who work in banks in Tripoli and all of them will tell you that there salaries are lower than the salaries in Beirut . You find **a lot** of kids working in Tripoli , either in car repair shops , barbers , groceries , cleaning shoes , they 're everywhere .

But you probably did n't stop and think about the income these people are making or if they can feed their family with it .

333ml,lebanon,"BEIRUT : Recent media reports that there are 300,000 Syrian refugee woman currently pregnant in Lebanon has been contested by international agencies that argue the figure is not reflective of data collected since the onset of the Syrian crisis . Several local media outlets reported earlier in the week that “ out of 1.9 million Syrian refugees present in Lebanon ... there are 300,000 pregnant Syrian women that will give birth in 2017. ” The outlet did not provide a source for the information , raising questions as to its credibility . “ We ’ re not quite sure about the source used in the report , but our records show that since the beginning of the crisis in 2011 there have been a total of about 100,000 Syrian newborns in Lebanon , ” Khaled Kabbara , spokesperson for the United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , told the Daily Star . Mounia Amrani , Medical Coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres , also challenged the figure . She said such a number was impossible based upon MSF ’ s data and work with Syrian women . “ The number is exaggerated and really strange . We can expect an estimated number of about 80,000 [ pregnant women ] maximum , ” she told The Daily Star . “ The Syrian women that come to us for aid often request and use methods of family planning . So the fact that these figures are so high doesn ’ t make sense with practices we see at MSF , ” Amrani added . Minister of State for Refugee Affairs Mouin Merehbi dismissed the media reports ’ claims , saying he thought that such false information was part of an anti-Syrian refugee agenda in Lebanon . “ The maximum growth rate is maybe about 4 or 5 percent in some countries . In our region , a 3 percent increase in population is very high , ” he said . “ It ’ s not right [ to report this ] . I ’ m not sure what the purpose of this propaganda is , but it is definitely crazy. ” The report claimed that unnamed Scandinavian and Gulf countries had offered aid packages in response to the alleged projected uptick of refugees in Lebanon . Specifically , it noted that the EU had already donated 200 million euros ( $ 219.4 million ) in support . As of Thursday evening , the European Union was unavailable to corroborate or deny the claim . Over 1 million Syrian refugees are currently registered with UNHCR in Lebanon , but the government has estimated that the number is closer to 1.5 million . Large populations of refugees settling in remote and vulnerable areas of the country have sparked tensions with equally underprivileged host communities .",Romance,Italian

The military said in a statement that the Syrian families left the makeshift camps in the northeastern border town of Arsal in a convoy of 30 civilian vehicles . They were accompanied by the Lebanese Army until the last military checkpoint on the outskirts of the area , The army said that the departure follows a `` high interest of the families '' to return to their homeland . Local media reported that the convoy comprised of 50 Syrian families . The families left through north and northeast Lebanon , the latter route going through the Lebanese border town of Tfail . Local Al-Jadeed TV reported that around 500 families are expected to return to Syria following `` reconciliations in Qalamoun and the Damascus countryside , and the militants leaving to Idlib . '' In February , Hezbollah 's media spokesperson told The Daily Star that the party is mediating the return of Syrian refugees from Arsal border area to their villages in the Qalamoun region in Syria in talks with Syrian opposition group Saraya Ahl al-Sham . MP Nawwar Saheli had told The Daily Star that `` it won ’ t be formal until the Lebanese government contacts the Syrian government . For now , it ’ s indirectly between Hezbollah and opposition groups. ” The Lebanese government estimates that around 1.5 million Syrian refugees live in unofficial camps around the country in deteriorating economic conditions – which Lebanon was already suffering prior to the refugee crisis .",Romance,Italian

I think you 're a bit wrong here , the law is n't exactly like this . You have to account for the ratio between the number of voters and the number of seats . Consider this example : A certain district of 100 thousands voters has 5 seats . A list will get a mp if they gain 100000/5 votes , so a list will need at least 20 thousands votes to guarantee a seat . They can win 10 % or 19 % of the votes and they 'll get nothing . Your example is true if the district has 100k voters and 10 seats .",Romance,Italian

333ml,lebanon,"& gt ; Because there 's no corruption in USA . The scale of corruption is not comparable , in Lebanon you ca n't even work in retail 3a chway if you do n't know someone , in Lebanon politicians get small sentence ( and they do n't even serve it ) after planning to blow up the country ( Samaha ) . In a university which I wo n't name , 40 people got caught cheating in multiple exams , do you know what happened ? 30 of them got punished , 10 of them passed their exams as if nothing happened , this shit does n't happen in the US . No one gives a shit about laws it 's like a jungle . & gt ; But sometimes a lot of you forget , we 're not the only country , and we 're not the worst either . And so what ? Why content yourself with poor standards , does it bring you pride that we 're better than very poor countries in Africa ? & gt ; Man this guy got an education at becoming a doctor and he 's complaining . That 's what gets me the most ... Doctors in Leb do n't have it so bad either . Man this whole blog was bullshit . Why are you mad because someone is ambitious ? Lebanon simply ca n't offer what the US does , check how much funding goes into research for example in the US and compare it with Lebanon . & gt ; I 'm sorry . Some people really have it worse.. with $ 500 salaries that can barely cover rent , and food and shit , and not have the option of leaving . Just so this dude can just write a shit post about that country , after getting the opportunity it provided for you to actually leave and be like `` adios bitches '' . Again this has to do with ambition , why settle for a mediocre life while you have the opportunity to go somewhere better ? **Edit : ** On the corruption topic read [ this ] ( http : //www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/06/five_official_charged_with_man.html ) & gt ; Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette has charged five water officials -- including a member of Gov . Rick Snyder 's cabinet and a former emergency manager -- with manslaughter related to their alleged failure to act in during the Flint Water Crisis .

333ml,lebanon,"& gt ; Why soldiers still have a watch in every corner ? & gt ; Why soldiers are on duty at places like normally police do the job ( airport , traffic , etc . ) At the airport you only see the soldiers outside . Inside you have the people in the grey patched suits ( police ) who check your bags and make you go through the metal detector and then the people wearing the beige suit who belong to what 's called General Directorate of General Security ( the people who stamp your passport ) . Concerning traffic you only see the army at few points , mainly at important connections between different cities ( like on the highway between Beirut and the north ) so they can stop drug dealers ( the minor ones ) or terrorists . The army have stronger equipment than the typical police , they 're necessary because a lot of people in Lebanon are dangerous and have equipment that can match the firepower of the typical police . & gt ; Do Lebanon have separate forces ? The Lebanese army , Hezbollah ? Do they control different areas ? The hezb mainly operates in the south and in the southern suburb of Beirut . There 's also army and other security departements at the south but the control in these area mainly belongs to the hezb . & gt ; Traffic .
