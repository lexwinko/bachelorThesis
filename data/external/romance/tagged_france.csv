8rax,europe,I am living in swiss ; prefer them home for sure .,Romance,French
8rax,europe,"& gt ; I think it\\ 's also important to mention that French universities do not have the same prestige as their German or British counterparts . If you study computer science / technology , we have \ '' engineering schools\ '' that are more expensive and have very strong links with the industry . Those schools work very well . But you have to pay.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; We also have a system of \ '' grandes \u00e9coles\ '' ( elite schools ) in which you need to pass an exam ( more of a contest ) to enter . Those are the cool ones which get the funding . As said in the article , these are not accessible to everyone . It\\ 's mostly \ '' I know this guy who knows this guy\ '' . Very common in France.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; In general , French universities are considered cheap education , with all that it entails . Few teachers , infrastructure falling into pieces . But if you plan to study humanities , the university is pretty much your only solution . \\n\\n\\nOh god , you say so much bullshit it is quite clear that you have no idea how the grandes ecoles/ecoles d\\'ingenieur works ... \\n\\n* Most/a great number of \u00e9coles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur are free , source : I graduated from one of them\\n* grandes ecoles = ecoles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur by the way.\\n* most of them ( if not all ) are accessible to anyone , some you can enter with good grades others with a national concours = on merit . Nothing to do with \ '' knowing someone\ '' or whatever . You can enter everywhere if you are good enough . \\n* you can study human sciences in prepa litt\u00e9raire as well , in science po ... You have also good choices for this kind of studies . \\n* Lot of top tier schools are outside or Paris ( Most of them ) \\n\\n\\nThe only points I can agree on is that the infrastructures for the public universities ( faculties ) are often quite old and not very sexy + that the universities of France have less visibility than their counterparts in England/the USA . I would blame this on the separation between engineering school/business schools and regular universities . If you combine all of them together in a city then you might have something which can stand up to big campuses in the UK . But we chose to have the faculties + grandes ecoles and business schools apart.\\n\\nSome of our Business schools are top notch ( Insead MBA , HEC paris , ESSEC.. ) , some of our grandes ecoles are also top notch but less visible due to the concurrence of big monsters like Harvard/Oxford/Cambridge.\\n\\n",Romance,French

ABaseDePopopopop,europe,"[ Here is an article in French ] ( https : //www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/pourquoi-la-france-refuse-de-ceder-le-controle-de-saint-nazaire-fincantieri ) that goes a bit more into the reasons and French point of view.\\n\\nSome points taken quickly : \\n\\n- French government says they don\\'t want to take risks on jobs , skills , and strategic industrial area . Since it\\ 's a strategic activity , they don\\'t want to give a majority to a foreign investor . They say that if the Italians won\\'t accept the 50/50 proposal , they\\ 'll use their refusal right.\\n\\n- The previous agreement planned for 48 % for Fincantieri , 6 % for Fondazione CR , 33 % for the French state and the rest for Naval Group ( DCNS ) . The \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' was supposed to make it so that Fincantieri wouldn\\'t control a majority , but the Italians would still be able to buy it.\\n\\n- Since the Italians now said they won\\'t accept a new agreement and want a full majority , the \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' thing is shown to be a trick.\\n\\n- The previous agreement was made in 2008 because there was no refusal right for the French state . Since then they have acquired enough.\\n\\n- The Italians argue that they should be prefered to a Korean firm because they\\ 're European . The current feedback from STX is that the Korean firm was bad financially but \ '' very transparent\ '' , without technological theft.\\n\\n- Saint-Nazaire is the only plant able to build large ships for the French Navy , and is developing well on offshore renewable energy , which is seen as an important sector for France who has the second sea area in the world.\\n\\n- Fincantieri works with the Chinese for their future ships . They\\ 'll build in Shanghai the large ships that were previously made in Italy for the American Carnival Corporation . Fincantieri defends that the technology transfer is under control , but the French doubt their ability to resist to Chinese pressure , and are very wary of technology transfer to China.\\n\\n- The entire ship industry is preparing for China to offer a huge competition , supported by their state . They are very wary of any help to cover the technology gap they currently suffer . This is also the position of the German Meyer Werft . STX is considered along with Meyer Werft as among best expert for cruise ships.\\n\\n- Concerning jobs , the agreement secures them until 2026 . But 5 years later , Fincantieri would be able to decide directly the work share between its different sites . As the company belongs for 72 % to the Italian government , the French government is worried that they would prioritize work in Italy . \\n\\n- It is observed that among the company , its suppliers and customers , nobody supports the plan to go for Fincantieri . The ship-owners even went as far as proposing an alternative to the purchase agreement of 2008.\\n\\n- The French position is that their opposition has nothing to do with the nationality of the buyer . They\\ 've been under foreign ownership since 11 years , and would have accepted much more easily a merge with the German Meyer Werft.\\n\\nTLDR : The French government is worried about jobs as Fincantieri is under Italian goverment ownership and could prioritize their plants , and more importantly about technology transfer to China because Fincantieri works with them already .",Romance,French

Similar trend is happening in french where some people go out of their way to add diacritics like . or - or ( ) and \ '' e\ '' in between grammar agreements ( to indicate feminine gender ) . French has evolved in such a way ( and other romance languages too ) that masculine gender is used for both , say , \ '' male related things\ '' and \ '' neutral\ '' settings which let feminine alone for \ '' female related things\ '' . I\\ 'm caricaturing though : feminine is also used to indicate neutral with regard to inanimated \ '' objects\ '' but since masculine is used for neutral animated \ '' objects\ '' ( I mean living things ) , it stands out and that\\ 's where the political split come from . At the end of the day , it\\ 's a matter of grammaticality and morphology for lack of better option , I guess most people don\\'t see sexism behind it and really mean to be neutral when using the masculine gender accordingly for animated objects .
