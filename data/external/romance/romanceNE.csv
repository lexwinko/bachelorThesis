You even had someone believe they were compatible with you , even though it turned out to be a mistake . That means you 're probably over-reaching , but it 's OK. For now you have this bruised ego that makes you feel like giving up altogether is preferrable , because it 's a certainty , than having another go at things . Accept this pain . You have to move on . It 's nothing . And more importantly , you 're capable of getting beyond all this peacefully , but you must take the first steps into making it a reality . I know you 're facing your own feelings mostly right now , but they are n't the most important . Think of them as an energy exchange - see their validity in the progress that they start . Stepping right into the other side , this girl must have liked you . Still her feelings pushed her to do a hard thing and speak her own mind .

I 'm sure this shit you 'll figure it out yourself , loneliness can be a help in proper introspection . The two things you 'll need to come to accept to belong again , in my experience , are : -no one will do what you think or wish they will do , so ignore those wishes . People are unruly like that . -you will have to get acquainted with the unknown and take risks . Go to new places , unplanned events . Because when you meet someone new , this is exactly what you are to them - the unknown . That 's what you 're asking them to step into . So empathize in advance . It 'll make future relationships a lot clearer to you . Anyway do n't dwell on it . I know I did a while . The brooding is a natural process that will at some point be overcome . So do n't bask and try to appreciate the charms of misery at a reasonable level . ; ] Tldr ; loneliness is a tricky mirror and what you see of yourself is n't what others see . Be less in demand . Empathize . Leave it alone .",Romance,French

But you have reflected a lot , while others may do it more mechanically . It 's not a merit they have , but a lucky advantage . In fact you 'll be the one with merit if you push on .

Since I never sleep far from my phone , I entered my own number as `` dreamjournal '' ( with a picture of my close-eyed self : p ) , and pretty much picked up the phone and wrote myself a SMS every time I woke .

The less you think of how bad it is , the more likely the chance of life turning pleasant ... .. So try it ... .

I dunno if reading this might help you the way you expect it to , because you 're looking for clarity , but there are no magic words for that .

At 30 or 40‚Ç¨ per night , you have a nice variety of places to pick from . Eating : you can eat cheap very easily on the go . a slice of pizza is just 2 or 3 euro . It 's amazing .

09876543212345,CGPGrey,"& gt ; I would like to see CGP Grey address the stability problem though . This seems very relevant in a prime minister system where stability is critical ( as opposed to a Presidential system ) . In HI , he basically said that in 100 % representative parliaments , parliaments will reach a common ground , at least in important matters . I feel that does n't take into account many things . To use Italy again as an example : the parliament there can give a no-confidence vote to the prime minister , forcing him to resign , and if no replacement for the PM is found , another election is called . A coalition ( made of every major party except the communists ) was the norm in the 80s , under the first postwar , highly representative voting system , but [ it did n't work out well ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite ) , eventually . This is not a specificity , it 's pretty systemic in nature , and I feel this is the kind of issue Grey just plainly ignores when he speaks about voting systems . I think it 's partly because he only ever witnessed political issues in the US and UK , which both have the issue of low representativeness , and also ( by his admission ) he has no interest in the peculiarities of each country 's party system and political situation . Voting systems do n't exist in a vacuum , and there is no `` one-kind-fits-all '' type of voting system . This does n't mean that the UK , US etc . voting systems are fine the way they are , but there are more things to consider than how well does it reflect the breakdown of the voters .",Romance,Italian
09876543212345,CGPGrey,"& gt ; It 's not the electoral system that created the problem ; it 's the fact that the PSI and PSDI would n't form a left-wing coalition with the PCI , which guaranteed that the Christian Democrats were in government forever . True . The issue here was that the party system was polarized to an extent . I feel this should be taken into account when drafting the institutional makeup of a country , but that 's another matter . My point was that there are cases where coalitions governments do n't work out as expected . & gt ; Most PR systems stabilise as a number of left-wing parties , and a number of right-wing parties and the larger coalition gets into government . Voters can choose between the two coalitions , but can also choose between parties within the coalitions and therefore push the coalition in a direction they prefer ( e.g . vote Green to increase the priority given to environmental issues within the left-coalition ) . This is pretty much how the Italian system works out these days . One thing to consider is how disciplined the coalition is . Both the 1996 and the 2008 elections in Italy were early elections due to a no-confidence vote from a party in the governing coalition . Needless to say , situations like this have a negative effect on the country as they stifle the lawmaking process .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,AskReddit,"& gt ; Well that 's just fascinating ! So the energies given off by regular matter affect anti-matter in the same ways ? Is this theorised to work with all energy or only light ? If you want a searchable term , this is called `` C symmetry '' in particle physics . Strong force ( holds nuclei together ) has C symmetry as well ( experimentally verified ) . Weak force ( beta decay ) does not have C symmetry ( experimentally verified ) . Gravity does not have an accepted quantization , but I 'd say it has to have C symmetry as well ( an expert please fill this in for me ) . & gt ; I 'm getting way off track here , but to take that to an extreme , could an anti-matter radio pick up my regular music stations and play the music in a normal way ? Pick up , yes . Then the speaker would need to be immersed in `` anti-air '' to transmit the sound . But then **you** would have to be immersed in it to hear it .

I 'm not a theoretical physicist though , so I 'm not sure if there is more evidence or proof of the 1 % theory .

12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"Going on , you 'll notice more and more the 'game ' aspect of this game , which will start imposing constraints on the high-level approaches you can take to solve a problem . E.g . R { A , O } Ms work in a way that forces you do do sequential read/write operations , having an efficient algorithm that requires extensive random access is n't of any use . Learning some tricks to cut on code size is very important , because later you wo n't be able to fit enough in a MC if you do n't compress your code . That said , even in the later levels you can go with a `` optimizer passes '' approach , where initially you write with `jmp`s and waste the `slx` sync value , because it 's high-level and easy , then , much like an optimizing compiler , you come back and do `jmp` pruning , global flag assignment , efficient register assignment and so on ... This is a very rewarding game , carry on optimizing !",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"So , get some tips : * The input xbus lines can do the buffering for you ! No need to read the clean/feed values in acc/dat , just sleep with them in the bus , they 'll still be there once you 've slept , ready to be retrieved . Saves 2 lines and 2 power/iteration * `slx x0 ; mov x0 null ; & lt ; instr & gt ; 0` is a transitional pattern , but once you 've done a working solution , you can optimize that `mov x0 null` away , by sending 0 ( or whatever constant you happen to use ) and using it , so it becomes `slx x0 ; & lt ; instr & gt ; x0` . Saves 1 line and 1 power/iter * The bottom MC uses a single flag , the `jmp` is unneeded . Rework the flags and remove the `jmp` . Saves 1 line and ~4 power/iter * The top MC has several issues as well , but I 'm leaving them for you to take care of . Have fun .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,researchnet,"Great work . Of all the `12345ie+` I 'm the only one . I do n't think he built a cradle on a stick , because that would give you an even cycle count , unless you waste another cycle as well . It looks more like 18/2 .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,researchnet,"`` Your solution is n't even in the same class of the top players ' '' . Yeah , I 've been trash-talked to enough .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"Then you 're getting worse gems that you 'd get if you used simple U . The easiest way to map a recipe to other colors is simply to put other colors in the slots ( e.g . if you want a black- & gt ; purple substitution , just put a purple g1 where wGC asks for a black g1 ) .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; HA ! Thats too much like cheating , but since youve been playing `` forever '' , I can see how that saves a bit of time . So how does that work with unlocking skills and gems ? Dont you still have to beat the specific fields to unlock stuff ? Yes , but unlocks at WL500 are trivial . I ensure you that unlocking yellow for the 10th time at 100ish WL is n't really a great use of my time . & gt ; That is not exactly the answer I was looking for , the question still stands what recipes are used without the black/red/yellow . & gt ; The combiner tool is nice but seems to be made for power players since it only has a limited variety of recipes . If you dont have access to the black gem ( other than sticking to fields that have it , /boggle ) , what do you do until then ? You do not use any recipe , because you do n't need them . & gt ; Also , I still dont know what the k stands for inside the recipe I know its killgem but whats the sub combine to that ? 1b+1r ? Your earlier killgem , all the way down recursively to a spec 'd killgem . & gt ; I 'd say there needs a new beginner/mid guide . One worth reading . Write it ! & gt ; DTG",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,Gemcraft,"As a guide writer I feel compelled to say that I want to bring 'you ' to the end-game because I have no clue how mid-game plays out , I just skip it entirely . An example is this video of mine : https : //vimeo.com/160455365 , I go directly from WL130 ( early-game ) to WL560 ( semi-late-game ) , using an appropriate field that has the gems I need , and racking out all the exp I want .

To test a drug , you need an extremely low-level and detailed model of the inner working of a cell , maybe you can avoid simulating each atom and its QED interactions , but I do n't think you can save up more that a few orders of magnitude . What you are talking about is building a `` unit '' that `` acts like a neuron '' , then linking a trillion of them together . That 's for sure much easier , and may give you a `` human-like brain '' , but it tells you nothing about how a drug will affect real human neurons .

The easiest way to make something very slow in any programming language is : for i from small_number to big_number do_long_task ( ) in Shenzehen IO a `do_long_task ( ) ` is not difficult to write , but indexes are limited to `-999 - 999` . To get a bigger index you can use something that has more 'states ' than a ShIO integer , you check for a specific state and then break the loop . An integer has 999+1+999=1999 different states . A ROM has just the 2 pointers that you can modify , which have 14 states each , for a total of 14^ ( 2 ) =144 . A RAM has 14 numbers and 2 pointers you can modify , which means there are 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^ ( 2 ) different states in which it can be . Realistically you 'll not be able to iterate through pointers in a RAM , but iterating through all the integers is not that difficult , and yields a 1999^ ( 14 ) steps loop . Sample code ( x0- & gt ; d1 , x1- & gt ; a1 ) : li : mov -999 x0 teq x1 0 - jmp li lg : mov x1 dat mov x0 acc teq acc 999 + teq dat 13 - add 1 - mov dat x1 - mov acc x0 # Put long function # here , e.g . : # mov -1 x3 - jmp lg EDIT : This code does not actually use all the states , but just 1999*14 , but it 's enough to show that a RAM has much more potential than a ROM or register .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,spacechem,"Received the invite , thanks a lot . Let 's see how this thing works .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,Gemcraft,"Let 's get started with a simple overview . Chain hit is worth between x500-x10000 in gem efficiency , depending on how many monsters you have over your gem . For comparison having slow gems is a x10 in gem efficiency ( 90 % slowed = speed x0.1 = hits taken x10 ) . Now , the nice global scaling formula `P=M^ ( gk/ ( 1-gm ) ) *K` tells you that if you lose a x10 in gem efficiency you roughly lose a x10^5 in final damage ( this factors in mana collection , managem scaling , killgem scaling , etc ... ) . So , uhm , leave out red and you roughly lose a x ( 1000^5 ) = x1e15 . Technically it is possible to win an endurance with this penalty , you 'd change the easiest endurance in an extremely hard one ( see https : //docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mfWXh80KGKTaTx-p033c6xeEuH2UoyoWna6SoKKXB2U/edit # gid=1391672033 ) . So , to answer : & gt ; Are there any ways of improving performance to have a steady 30 fps while still using chain hit gems ? I have tried every tip from this sub regarding option settings . No & gt ; Is it possible to finish endurance mode on the hardest difficulty without chain hit ? If my math is n't wrong , yes it is . But it 's very very very very tight . & gt ; What would the optimal setup be ? Same one you 're using : slow , managem ( s ) ( the more the better , till too much lag ) , space ( optional , in case you want WoE-cycling ) , slow ( optional , you might not need it ) , killgem . & gt ; Can the gemforce software be used in a way to return the best recipes without the red gem ? Yes , gemforce actually builds red-less gems , the red adder is a shitty hack that adds red with a semi-decent brute search . You 'll need to run gemforce itself , though , asking it to give you the red-less recipes and then feeding them to wGC . In case you **really** want to do that feel free to ask for further help , both with the tools and with battle tactics .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Link to youtube video generated by the game 's record function for verification , done . No need for any steam id friendlist bullshit , just submit a link and anyone can verify it . This way all the solutions will become public . I do n't think this should be mandatory to submit a score . & gt ; I would n't bother listing scores by platform , as there 's no easy way to verify that something like a production level is using a specific platforms random seed except for fully constructing the solution on that platform . Just lump them together and let people minmax their random seed by platform selection if they want to push the envelope . The problem with this is that the score table will become meaningless . The first place would always be of the guy who wrote a botched C math library ( this counts as 'platform ' ) , had the game load it and then abused a randomness he can perfectly control . The table should lock down the platform to be usable . & gt ; I would n't try to evaluate what is and is n't a state machine , because you run into a lot of edge cases . Is a solution that is n't able to handle a rare input combination a state machine for taking advantage of that or just not a perfect solution ? What about only using knowledge of the first input , or just the last ? Many optimized solutions take advantage of that kind of knowledge while handling all other inputs normally . & gt ; & gt ; For bug exploits you 'd need to be very specific for what is and is n't allowed , since the same bug that enables particle smashing also enables Input + Fuse where you input on top of another atom and avoid collision by fusing the same cycle to remove the collision . Input + Fuse is used in a ton of optimized and even regular solutions to various fusion levels . Choose a standard , then rely on the honor system .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"For comparison , in Shenzhen IO we rely entirely on Steam scores ( and the honor system for the less significant digits that the game does n't show ) . This is possible because it was decided to not record full information ( cost/power/lines ) for each record , but just the score , because knowing the cost leads to metagaming in Shenzhen IO . In Spacechem I do n't think there is any information gained from the number of reactors used , so there is no problem with recording the whole score . We can definitely start with the honor system and the hundreds of solutions already on youtube .

Einstein 's equations have a free parameter , called `` Cosmological constant '' ( I 'll call it L ) , that ca n't be constrained by local measurements ( we can just say it 's very small ) . It turns out , if you want GR to match what we see , you can not take L to be 0 , but it 's got to have a certain tiny value . This is not a `` fudge factor '' , it 's simply a free parameter of the theory we tuned with experiments ( like , dunno , the value of surface gravity in classical mechanics ) . L then reappears in the equation for the age of the universe , we plug it in and do the math , no funny business anywhere . The interpretation of L , now , it 's difficult . It turns out that L is on the same side of the equation as the densities/pressures of matter and radiation , so we think about L not as some wavy factor , but as the density/pressure of a strange kind of `` energy '' ( hence the name `` dark energy '' ) . But we know of no kind of particle/field/whatever that can produce the observed density/pressure of the dark energy , so for now we simply measure it and put it manually in Einstein 's equation . In the future we may identify some exotic `` thing '' that produces the right density/pressure and we 'll be able to compute L from the properties of this `` thing '' .",Romance,Italian

Physics theories are just giant machines that ( assuming they are correct ) get some data in input and spit out some other data we want to know .

In an ideal world you 'd measure each one in a separate experiment ( so you have no correlation ) , here is a bit more complicated , but whatever ... Once you have these 4 values you can throw them in the age equation and it spits out the age of the universe , which is the important thing you wanted to know . You can not avoid `` mixing '' the 4 experimental values if you want to know the age of the universe .

12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Bad comparison , since using things like particle smashing or telekinetic waldos require a deep understanding of the game and a lot of design work to use well and are n't an automatic win button .

You 'll also know that speedruns have different categories ( just get to the end/complete everything/do not abuse glitches/etc ... ) , that 's the same way I proposed to solve the scoring problem on the other thread . & gt ; Swapite is trivial due to an output molecule verification bug and is one of only two levels affected by it where input = output . It 's basically never used outside that in actual solutions due to being inconsistent/poorly understood and generally not worth the effort .

That 's the beauty of SpaceChem : you 're given the tools and an obstacle to overcome , and how you approach and tackle that obstacle is all up to the individual . Different approaches can already make puzzles intended to be difficult super easy , ie creating a garbage ball instead of working out perfect fusion/fission math . But that 's part of the fun and charm of the game , and things like particle smashing are just another tool in the toolbox ( a hard one to use practically at that ) for designing clever solutions . I do not agree here . In a sense , you 're not playing Spacechem ( or I 'm not , perspective ) , you 're playing a game with slightly more ( less ) tools at your disposal . The puzzles are designed for just one of these `` game versions '' and may break horribly in the other .

Do I need some special program or is it programming code ? I have some familiarity with coding . Also , do you know if changing the sprites would help ? I just kinda pulled that out of my ass . The short answer is : forget it . & gt ; In the guide you created/helped create you mentioned at the end that it could take up to 40 hours to max out exp on a map . Does this mean that endurance runs take so long that you usually have to leave it paused while you go to work/sleep and it spans several days ? Cuz that sounds terrible . Yes . Yes . Yes . & gt ; When I tried out using bloodbound gems , I noticed my managems at one point had a million hits , yet my killgem only had ~30,000 around the same time . What can I do to up the hit count of my first killgem ? For the final killgem you need to use a training killgem before your manafarm , the EEG guide explains this . Upping the count of the first killgem is hardly useful at all . & gt ; The guide also mentions at a certain point you want to stop mana farming and start building your final killgem . When do decide to do that/how do you know when you have enough mana ? When you 'll be an experienced player and go for the endurance victory you 'll do the math and farm enough mana that allows you to build a killgem good enough to kill the last waves . For now , farm till you get bored . & gt ; Also , how do you construct the final killgem ? I had about 6 g2rb gems each with between 1 mil and 3mil hits . I combined them all with yellow and each other and then did killgem combine with the gemweaving program , but it still was worse than my first killgem even though it had way more hits ( I guess the start was really bad/inefficient ? ) Yep , the 'spec ' you used is horrid , refer to the EEG guide for an effective method ( training killgem ) . & gt ; Finally , is there some way to add mana cost to gem recipes in the gem weaving program ? Because I used a combine when I did n't have all the mana I needed . It stopped halfway through , and I did n't know how to finish the recipe , so it seemed like a huge waste . It makes no sense , how is the combiner supposed to know how much the starting gem costs ? For all it knows you could be using the same combine for a g3 or a g110 .

Right now I have almost all capped skills maxed out ( just the spells left at 30+15 ) and all non-capped skills at 30+15 ( the important ones at least ) . Said guide is mine . You have to leave enough unspent points so you have enough mana at the start . I do n't play for you , you have to find a balance . & gt ; I am also curious how people enrage waves and how often ppl upgrade gems . Any guidelines would be helpful . So far I 've just enraged until the HP of reavers/swarmlings is about equal to my killgem 's max dmg , then used the same number of gems on giant waves . Nope , enrage for armor over managem damage , not HP . The EEG guide has a ton of info on this and gems . http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=434889753 & gt ; Another question I had was what are the optimal talisman bonuses ? I 've heard anything with WoE is good , but I 'm not sure how to balance + % charge of all spells and enhancements . Anything with +1 all skills and +10 % exp is good , extra stats are just for show . Skills sought after are WoE/Freeze charges and effect and shrine charges & gt ; When are you strong enough to take on hatred 10 ?

Always after g30 & gt ; Thanks ! You are welcome & gt ; Edit : Another question , lets say I blocked beacons from spawning everywhere but a corner of the map and that corner can have a max of 20 beacons , if I were to enrage a wave such that 22 beacons would spawn , will the extra two beacons spawn after I destroy some of the first 20 ?

Affirmative action is there to counter that bias , and to give everyone the same chance , on a macro level .",Romance,Italian

You went from refugee without a home to refugee with a hovel , then to mercenary with money and a reinstated noble house , *then* to champion , after the invasion- all done with your actions , and the ones of your associates . DA2 had a lot of flaws , but let 's not invent ones that did n't exist . As for DA : I , I liked how you could reject the `` chosen one '' narrative , which was thrust upon you without your say-so , or embrace it . And at the end of the day you were just some poor shmuck who found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time . I felt it played on the themes of faith and destiny pretty well .",Romance,Italian

I 'd say you should n't do it .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,swtor,"You can absolutely still do the second one . I just did it a week ago on my healer : just get your companion ( tank mode may be optimal , but I did it with a damage one too ) to attack Stivastin , then , when Stivastin is focused on the companion , use passive mode to make the companion follow you into the fire . This way you can kite the boss as a healer .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"& gt ; It 's coming to the point where I 'm worried that I may just end up groping a random girl because the urge to explore and experience is just getting too strong . This is absolutely not the way to go . I know it and I 'm sure you know it too , so let 's just get that out of the way . & gt ; I 'm pretty sure that once I have a bit of success my anxiety will dissipate and my skills should come up to the level of others my age . This jumped out at me , too , so I 'll tell what my experience taught me : your anxiety is there to stay , unless you tackle that mofo down , with the help of a therapist if needed ( I can assure you , for many people it 's much easier with one ) . Tying the solutions of your internal struggles to an external 'miracle cure ' will never solve your problem : your head will simply find something else to be anxious about . Now that I 've gotten that out of the way ... This probably wo n't be exactly what you 're looking for , but the way you 're feeling is normal . At 20 , you 're still incredibly young , and , even if it feels that way , not having had any sort of relationship at 20 is neither particularly uncommon nor something you should feel ashamed about . I myself did n't have any sort of relationship with anyone until I was 22 ; I absolutely felt sexually frustrated , unwanted , ready to be with any guy at all just to get rid of my virginity . I was being way overdramatic about the whole thing ; worse , I was treating people like a means to an end . You say things like `` to find a reliable source of real life sexual release '' , or `` what conversational techniques do I need to employ to avoid the dreaded friend zone and get quite quickly to the point of having a sexual relationship ? `` , and that just feels like you 're seeing these potential girls as the way you 'll get sex . That wo n't solve your insecurities or your desire of intimacy with someone else , and it will just make it a sad experience for everyone involved . So , this is how it happened to me : I actually got out of the house to do the things I was passionate about . I stopped approaching every conversation with a dude as a `` can I get him interested in sex with me ? '' minigame ; I just talked about the things we had in common . I met new people at the places I went for my hobbies ( you mention liking music : are there any local band you can follow , maybe a smaller scene where you can chat with people , close to your home ? ) ; if you can start talking about your shared passions , the conversation will be more fun for everyone , and you 're probably going to feel a lot less embarassed . I got an haircut that suited me and made me feel snazzy ( silly , but effective ) . In the end , I employed a lot of `` fake it till you make it '' : I could act more confident , make people believe I was confident , and feel slightly more confident myself as a result . I finally had sex , it was super fun , but my insecurities stayed firmly in their place . To close this already long-ass post , I used to read what Dr. Nerdlove wrote on his blog : it has a lot of stuff about helping nerdy and otherwise shy guys with girls ; things about presenting yourself well and being charming without being pushy . I have n't read it in a while , and I have n't always found myself agreeing with him , but it may be something you want to check out . Edit : syntax",Romance,Italian

Besides that , I 'd say look at your date 's body language , and stop if they seem to have a rigid posture or a blank expression , or generally show a lack of enthusiasm .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I was molested by my stepfather when I was about 16 , did not tel my mother until one year ago , more or less , 8 years after the fact . The disappointment did get easier , for me , and ultimately I did want a relationship with my mom , so I had to make some mental adjustments . I accepted that she 'd rather keep the status quo , at least for the time present , than confront her partner about shit like this . This , though , was something that worked for me ; you may want other things . It 's supremely shitty that your mother did n't recognize the abuse when you were younger , and I think she knows it was a partly her fault that this never came up , and that 's why she 's unresponsive now . She does not want to face it , so she 's running away and pretending the problem does not exist . Which is doubly shitty , because one good step to repair the damage would be being close to you and helping you . My personal reading , you know best if this fits your mother or not . And honestly , no matter the reason , you can decide how much contact do you want with your mother from now on . You can not control her reaction , but you can control how much she 's around . I would second the advice of trying therapy ; for me , it meant I finally sterted to deal with the molestation . Sometimes you do n't click with your therapist , but that 's normal ; you can always try with another . I would also advise you to tell your boyfriend or a close friend , to have someone 100 % on your side , because that helps immeasurably . I think it 's good that you finally told someone , even if your mother failed to support you in any way . Anger is your friend here , it can push you forward and make you learn how to deal with stuff that seemed too complicated or scary before . I believe that you 're on a good path , and you 'll end up on the other side stronger than you were before . Hugs if you want them .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"First of all , I 'm very sorry to hear about your abuse . I 'm seconding the therapy advice , that would be the most reliable solution , really .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"... There was no `` trap '' . She was living in her own home , growing up with her own father . What the hell . Aside from that , what you 're saying is not factually wrong , per se . Still , as a psych major , I 'm sure you can see that bringing this up in a thread from a young girl who was abused by her own father is not appropriate ? We can have this discourse , but away from survivors who really should not deal with that . It 's not her job to forgive her father , if she even wants to , on anyone alse 's time but hers . Rereading your comment , though ... I do n't know how anyone could do what he did and not think it 's wrong . And further than that , it 's really not up to me or you to decide if this man could be forgiven or not . That would be up to OP , and , again , only if she wishes to and only on her time .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"So , here 's my take in the DLCs : *First of all , you only lose your items during Dead Money . DM 's a very particular DLC , that people tend to either love or hate . Personally , it 's my favorite . It 's a bit hard , though . *You wo n't take your companions with you . OWB is a solo mission , the others give you companion ( s ) as much as it makes sense for the story . *Nope ! Your ED-E will wait for you in the Mojave . I do n't really want to say more . *It depends on how you play . I prefer not to cheese and to stay closer to a role play perspective , others have more fun trying to get all the cash home . Bear in mind that by the end of the game you will not have money problems , gold bars or not . *Lonesome Road is , IMO , best enjoyed near the end of the storyline , because it wraps up all the other DLCs and touches upon your alliances ( if it 's not still bugged- are you on PC ? If so , get the unofficial patch ) Above all , have fun and do n't spoil yourself too much . These are some of the best DLCs I 've ever seen in a game .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"These things make my blood boil . Absolutely seek out a counselor for yourself , second-hand trauma is something that happens , there 's nothing shameful with looking for help in a stressful situation . She ABSOLUTELY also needs therapy . What I 'm hoping here is that telling you may have broken the dam regarding keeping the abuse a secret , and that it means she 's ready to talk about it . Therapy will help her cope with what happened and find out how she wants to deal with this situation , wether that be secrecy again or not . You should n't push excessively , but I think that saying that you 're very worried and that you think she 'll be infinitely better with therapy would not be too much . How old is your friend , by the way ? If she 's had any experience with relatives or friends who were helped by therapy , it would be a good thing to remind her . Also , this story is almost step by step what happened to me , except that thankfully I was never raped . So , if you want to PM me , or somehow if your friend wants to talk about it , feel free to .

You did not deprive your brother of a father , he did that too . And , most importantly , he never let you have a real father , only one who was also an abuser , and this is the worst thing of them all .

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Completely agree . Also , OP , I wanted to add not to get hung up over the notion of `` closure '' that seeing her at the convention would give you . Closure is something you find in yourself , IMO , not something other people can give you . Do n't go , not because you 'd be professing your feelings to `` another dude 's girlfriend '' , but because this fixation is unhealthy for you , and you showing up and declaring your love would probably be really uncomfortable for real-person-Jane . On a positive note , I once nursed a one-way crush for four years straight and let me tell you , buddy , once I managed to stop obsessing over him and I was able to move on with my life without heartache , it was SO great .

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Hey , OP , I 'm sorry this happened to you . I 'm going to offer a different opinion : you do n't *have* to tell anyone of you do n't feel like it , but maybe talking with a therapist could help . I tell you this because I was in a similar situation ( although it happened when I was older , so there are no missing scenes , so to speak ) and the memories never really went away . I did suppress them for a while , but in the end , they always came back and ended up fucking with my head quite a bit . Maybe you will deal with them on your own and all will be well .

Reporting or not is 100 % your choice- though I agree with u/Totally_Ok_Guy that if you decide to do it , it would be best to do it soon . I can understand the feeling of `` wrongness '' from reporting someone close , but keep in mind that he sure as hell did n't extend you the same courtesy .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"Ad Dionysus said , JE Sawyer 's is pretty great . Keep in mind that with that mod , you are also going to level up slower and die more often , and IIRC get crippled more easily .

Are they a sniper , maybe a cowboy ? Keep a theme with weapons , armor and perks ! Is he/she a mysanthrope with horrible charisma and a 12 in Speech ? I feel that imagining characters with motivations and a personality with virtues and flaws makes for a better experience . And then have the skills and SPECIALs reflect that personality .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"No worries , I like planning characters ! And ok , so no mods then . If you want to go solo , I 'd recommend a higher Perception , rather than Agility ( you probably want to go for the one-hit-kill as a solo sniper , anyway ) , since you 're not going to benefit from ED-E 's perk . You need at least 6 Luck for the Better Criticals perk ( +50 % crit damage , and keep in mind that every hit from sneak counts as a crit ) . Also , you 'd have to have at least 6 Strength for the sniper rifles ( 8 for the AMR , but I do n't think that 's made for stealth ! ) . Christine 's Rifle in OWB ( if you have the DLC ) or the Gobi ( if you have some lockpick skill ) are good choices . Moderate intelligence ( and probably charisma , since no companions mean no benefit from it ) sounds fine . Guns , sneak , lockpick , speech if you want , repair and medicine/survival would all be good skills . Then there 's the little things that have no effect on the mechanics , but help you choose the quests and responses , like how empathetic he is to other 's misfortunes , wether he likes technology or not , if he prefers to approach problems diplomatically or with violence , if there 's a particular group of people he likes or dislikes , and so on .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"& gt ; I felt like once I started disagreeing about her boyfriend , she stopped calling . Unfortunately , that is just what 's going to happen to anybody that criticizes him , for now . I know it sucks , but anything she percieves as an attack against him is just going to reinforce the him & amp ; her vs the world narrative .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Well , first of all , deep insecurity sucks , I know how that feels ! As already suggested , maybe therapy to deal with that could be helpful . Also , I do n't know how serious you are with your last line , but remember that any kind of suicidal thought is a serious matter , and should be addressed with a therapist . That said ... I was a very insecure 20-something , who never had a boyfriend and had n't even held hands with anybody . A thing that helped me immensely with insecurity , and also led me to meet my current guy , was launching myself in all kinds of activities , because I liked them , and not just to meet men . Go volunteering in something you care about , or join a political group if you 're so inclined , or develop a social aspect to your hobbies , be it sports , or reading , or gaming ! This way , you actually get more experienced in dealing with people , find out how to navigate a public setting , and , gradually , it would maybe help with being a bit less nervous . Cherry on cake : you get to meet new people who like the same things that you do , and with whom you have at least a starting common topic . People who will automatically consider some of the things you do interesting , because they do them too ! I mean , maybe you just are n't the type of person that 's able to approach people out of the blue . Some people are , I sure am not , and I do n't think that it 's a bad thing . You 're still very young . Your twenties are all right there to be experienced , time is not running out as much as it seems . And remember that , even when you go out and pursue hobbies and meet women who like the same things as you do ... sometimes your personalities will still be incompatible , or maybe you wo n't be their type . This happens , and it 's nobody 's fault , and it will not be a strike against your worth as a human being . Rejection sucks , but it happens to everybody , and how we deal with it says a lot about our personality . Good luck , OP !",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I 'm so sorry this happened to you , it 's terrible to even think about something like this . You did good though . You involved the police , you protected yourself and your son . You took the most difficult step , now you just have to keep going in this direction . Other people will have more experience than me in this , but until they write , I 'd say : -go stay with family or friends for a while , or maybe look for women 's shelters in your area , if you want to stay somewhere he does n't know about . On that note , I 'd maybe turn off any kind of tracking/gps app on your phone , if you have any . I do n't want to scare you , but you have to keep in mind that this is the most dangerous part in an abusive relationship ; do n't tell people who might speak to your ex where you are , and try to always be with someone ; -take pictures of all the bruises he gave you ( on multiple days , maybe , so they can be seen better ) and the property damage , for the trial ; -sending your son to a therapist is a good idea , but do find something for yourself , too . If you do n't want/ca n't afford a therapist , RAINN.org has a hotline for abuse survivors , and I 'm told it 's a good one . Actually , do call them anyways , because they surely have better advice than I do . You are brave , and you are a good mother . I 'm sending you hugs .",Romance,Italian

Yeah , to the outside eye , it 's not great . It sounds to me like you handled that first conversation well , but it 's something I 'd expect from a long-term partner . An addiction is a tough thing to push back , and alcoholism is a pretty destructive addiction . Even if he 's completely serious about stopping drinking , there would still be a lot of highs and lows . I 'd tell you to proceed with care and compassion , if he was not taking his difficulties out on you . Matter of fact , he is . I honestly do not see this ending well , I 'm sorry . You 're 21 , still too young to shackle yourself to a drowning person in the hopes he learns how to swim .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Hey , no worries . Ultimately , you know your own relationship better than strangers on the internet . Both me and my boyfriend have helped the other through some rough patches ; them being present is not a red flag at all , but you do need to worry about if and how they get resolved . So , if you feel that they are resolved in a constructive way , then you 're good .

13RunawayTurtles,dragonage,"You totally should , the gut punch is delicious . As far as your character goes , I played a non-hardline Dalish and it was consistently believable , plus your clan is said to be one of the friendlier ones . You can , IIRC , express a desire to move forward in a few convos , like the post-Mythal one with Solas . Speaking of which , I also found really interesting to play a faithful Dalish that gets disillusioned with their history , ancestors and gods after the Well and becomes a non-believer . This from someone who vastly preferred the City Elves to the Dalish in earlier games , so , in my experience , it can be a satisfying story even if the Dalish are not your favourite . As far as class goes , it 's really not much of a difference ( it changes one line in the Solas romance , and I think that 's it ) . Mage seems to be the favourite class , but my Lavellan was a rogue and I actually prefer it , for that `` scrappy '' feeling . Also , damn that turned out long . Sorry about that .",Romance,Italian

I 'm not an expert of the series by any means , so do you think that MGS 's representation of women has been so consistently good that we can reasonably assume it 's satire instead of applying Occam 's razor ?

I 'd say because it is closer to the ideal `` tall and strong '' shape for men , coming a little bit from nature , a little bit from culture IMO : cultural expectations of how a man `` should '' look are definitely there , even if maybe they are not as strong as with women . If this is coming from a shorter man : do n't sweat it so much . There are women who will not be interested in your body type , just like not all body types probably interest you .

Mmm ... other than that , keep in mind that the game is made of three distinct acts , and finishing the main mission for an act takes away the opportunity to do the side quests for the same act . Main missions are really obvious , though , you 'll notice the point of no return . Oh , and a companion quest in Act 2 is actually timed : to try and stay as non-spoilery as possible , you 'll derail an ambush , and after that you have to go to the ambush source soon-ish , or you lose your companion IIRC .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,GirlGamers,"Mmm , let 's see if I can make this more coherent . First of all , the `` ashamed '' bit parrots a statement by Kojima ( or the company , I do n't remember right now ) , who said that the people who were criticizing Quiet 's design pre-release would be ashamed once they understood why she dresses like this . Except the reason presented in-game is pretty contrived . Also , i think that not liking a game because you do n't like shooters , or stealth games , or puzzle games is not the same thing as not liking when a game has a bad portrayal of women , or black people , or gay people . Because one is a matter of taste , the other is a matter of feeling excluded , or mocked for what you are . These kind representations make me feel `` othered '' , as it is , because I see my gender and a body ( broadly ... I mean , I wish ! ) similar to mine used simply for titillation in something that 's not supposed to be porn . I do n't know , can you relate to what I 'm saying in any way ? Has anything ever made you feel like this ? To conclude , I also do n't think this does not hurt anybody . Obviously , it does n't hurt people directly , but it exists in , and reinforces , a cultural paradigm in which women are seen as sex objects in contexts that have really nothing to do with sex . It 's not the end of the world , of course , but I think it 's still worthwhile to examine .",Romance,Italian

Which is to say , I have no problem with a character designed with sex appeal , as long as it is portrayed as part of the character . To me , and that is just my opinion , to have a female character serve the purpose of eye candy first , and everything else second , is like saying that , for the creator , being sexy is the primary purpose of a woman . It 's very much male-gazey , and therefore it makes me feel like the creator is telling me `` This is not for you '' . And that hurts a little , when it comes from something you love ( gaming in general , for me , not MGS in particular ) . Like the author of this article said , it 's not about the boobs .

If you think agriculture will bring us 25 billion I think you have to take a second look on your model . Take Albania for an example , 25 % of their land is used for agriculture purposes . Their area is 28,748 km¬≤ , so it 's equivalent to us cultivating 50 % of our lands . Agriculture contributes 20 % to their GDP which is 36 billion . That 's a 7 billion contribution . Argentina is strong in agriculture but that 's because they cultivate an area of 417000 Km^2 . If you think that Lebanon economic revolution will be due to agriculture you 're wrong , we 're tiny . If you think that UAE has nothing you 're completely wrong . You could argue that they rely on petroleum money but they have the money to go into any field they wish .

AdamEdge,asoiaf,"Wargs . It 's interesting to me that we just take it as fact that since magic is returning then the family of a Lord would start having magical children . It is stated by GRRM that all the Stark kids are Wargs ( including Sansa ) , but what does n't match is the fact that Jon is also a Warg , he is not Ned 's son , but Lyanna 's , so this generation of Starks is giving birth to these kind of people . If we thrust the fact that Benjen is not a Warg ( do n't know why he would ) then something must have happen between his birth and the birth of Rob Stark/Jon . I believe whatever Howland did in the isle of faces is connected to this , he immediately meets the Starks after this visit . He was there , alone , looking for something or someone , then Rhaegar sees something in lyanna that obsess him and although Lyanna is not ugly there were far more beautiful women in westeros , he saw something in her other than beauty , but have never met her before . I think Howland was but a messenger to deliver some kind of gift to the Starks , the gift that is passed on their children , skin changing . Howland Reed after waiting all these years finally makes a move and sends his kids to Winterfell to fetch Brandon Stark to the 3ER . As if that was part of the plan since that day .",Romance,Spanish

I ca n't really speak for the country as a whole but I visited Warsaw and Krakow and I absolutely loved Krakow . I 'm from Portugal and I do n't really see a future in my country and Poland seems to be in a good place economically , cost of living is cheaper and salaries are about the same or even higher ( I 'm a web developer ) than in Portugal . So it seems like a good choice . But since being somewhere as a tourist is very different from living somewhere , I have a few questions : - How bad is it really with religion and the conservative government ? I have n't met that many poles while traveling but the few I did seemed pretty fed up with religion and with the impact it had on their lives and they spoke to me about it out of their own initiative . Maybe I was unlucky but how big is the influence of religion in this country ? - How is the public healthcare ? According to what I found on google it seems almost required to have private insurance to have effective care , correct ? - Do you think it 's a good idea to move there ? : ) - Any other cities you think I should absolutely visit before making up my mind ? Gdansk ? Poznan ? About Krakow : - While researching I found out that smog could be a problem . Is this still true ? How bad is it ? - I can rely on trams for my transportation , right ? I would n't want to have a car and Krakow seemed great for that . Thank you : )",Romance,Portugese
011111000101,IWantOut,"Hey everyone ! As most of you probably know the situation in Portugal is sort of shitty money-wise so I 've been thinking about leaving . Europe is an option but I would have to sacrifice the great weather I have here so I 'd like to explore other options . I 'm aware that the US has a lot of problems but AFAIK as long as you have a job there and do n't do anything too stupid you can manage to live better than you do here . I feel somewhat close to the US already , they export their culture everywhere , a lot of the things I use daily were made there and reddit is very US-centric so I end up absorbing little nuggets of info here and there about the country . Still , it 's nowhere near a replacement to actually going there and experiencing things for myself . Especially the people . Even if I did ... the country is huge so things could be very different depending on where I went . So ... I 've been entertaining the idea of moving to California . The weather is very similar to Portugal 's and as a web developer it 'd mean I 'd be close to where the most important companies in my field are ( or seem to be ) . It also seems more progressive , or at least that 's the image I have . Unfortunately it seems really difficult to move to the US and I wonder if it 's realistic to think that I could get in or if it 'd be a good idea to do so . I 'm 26 with a bachelor 's degree and about 3 years of experience in Web Development . What are my options here ?

I find that Apple does a better job with iOS in terms of optimization and doing more with less hardware .

Anyway in terms of the ecosystem , considering you have an apple tv , for example , you 'll be missing out on how easily everything just works together and how , for example , you can start streaming to your apple tv just by sliding up from the bottom and selecting the apple tv . That will take considerably more steps on Android and depending on what you want to stream it might require different apps ? Also continuity is a big one .",Romance,Portugese

These used to be people with low education but recently young people with degrees started emigrating as well to more central countries in Europe , the brain brain that affects all peripheral countries in Europe also affects us . The destinations mainly include France , Switzerland , Luxembourg , the UK , USA and Canada from the Azores , and Angola ( infrastructure/engineering jobs ) , although there probably is a community of Portuguese people ( Portuguese emigrants are close-knitted ) in every major city on Earth .

1143z,MapPorn,"There is not much demand for passenger connections between Portugal and Spain . You can also see this if you research the flights available in the whole Iberian Peninsula national flights are the norm , especially in Spain , and the rest are Lisbon/Porto - Madrid/Barcelona mostly . A train line from Sines ( not in the map , port city in the coast at around the same latitude as Beja ) to Badajoz/Madrid is being developed , but it will be freight only . The high speed train ( green ) that would run from Lisbon to Badajoz to Madrid has been cancelled because of the crisis and really it would n't be faster nor cheaper than planes so it was going to be unsuccessful . Another couple things you have to take into account is that Spain and Portugal are both really mountainous countries so train tracks are not feasible in some cases due to the high costs and large distances between cities in the interior of the country . Another aspect is that Portugal is a really dense country , most population lives in a thin area near the coast , so most of the train and road network is built around the Lisbon - Porto axis ( Faro - Braga ) if you extend it . Since the distances are pretty short , a high speed train is not useful in this case because it could only achieve top speed for a short peroid of time in between stops , hence Portugal not having `` green '' train lines such as Spain . As for things I think realistically could be better , I 'd like to see Porto - Vigo having more express trains to shorten the travel time instead of just prolonging the regional trains to the other side of the border . Lisbon - Madrid is mostly done by plane , the service now in place got `` absorbed '' by Lisbon - Hendaye and half the train separates at Medina del Campo to Madrid , that is fine . Faro - Sevilla is not really in demand but if Spain reinstated the train tracks to the border the regional trains could just end on the other side of the border and that would be good enough , even if it 's only done in the summer . All the other possible connections would be a waste of money in my opinion .

English-speaking enclaves should learn French so they can properly communicate with the 80 % of the population of that province that do not speak English . It freaking common sense to do so !

222baked,canada,"I am in the process of learning French right now for work . I am going to France next year , so I need to do it . I learned some foundations in French years ago in Ontario , but it was very basic . I dropped it after Gr.9 as I did n't think I would ever need it ( 't was comme on dit `` my bad '' ) . They only teach you some very basic grammar . Simple compounded future/past and the present , but also quite a lot of vocabulary since at the end of the day we had it for a period a day for 9 years . You can essentially not die if dropped into the centre of a French town , but that 's all what it will give you . I now used Duolinguo , and bought a bunch of grammar books and just read them over and write and rewrite . I spend a couple of hours a day writing and rewriting conjugations , and words . Generally just adding on every day to my vocabulary . I have some French-speaking friends and I practice with them , but they can get somewhat snobby when I make mistakes . I also write out emails for communicating with my future employer , and have to get them corrected by people . I learn from my mistakes . I also watch a lot of French and Quebec made shows/movies . There are some good ones out there . French music is cool too . Look up lyrics and translate the words you do n't know . Try to attack it from multiple angles . Speaking , reading , writing , listening . Slowly it starts making more and more sense . Do n't be afraid to make mistakes . I say the basis is learning the grammar and structure of the language , because like this it will make more sense . Learn all the tenses and rules for conjugations , and when to use them . There are nuances . Do n't be discouraged . It 's a hard language . Especially since it 's often hard to find people willing to speak with a beginner , and do n't even get me started on that ridiculous verlan they use in France . But just chip away at it . Lay the foundations from books and build on that . I must admit that I already spoke Romanian when I started , and as a Latin language , it is similar to French and I could essentially read French from the get-go .

It will be interesting to see what happens . Most UK politicians want to be members of the european free trade agreement , but that comes attached with freedom of movement which was one of the core issues for the Leave campaign . There were talks from the start that even with a Leave vote the UK would find itself in essentially the same situation but with less rights . It could go against the will of the electorate but the referendum was non-binding and this was a devisive issue .

222baked,canada,"& gt ; No one from Western Europe will have any difficulty with this as their medical programs are on par with the training in Canada and recognized as such . What do you consider Western Europe ? As far as I know , only the Royal College in the UK has any sort of recognition of speciality training . France too has a mutual recognition agreement with Quebec , but I do n't know if that will provide licensure in any other province , as it 's done through the CMQ and not the RCPSC . Germany , Austria , Norway , Sweden , Belgium , Netherlands , ect . get no such deal and graduates from these countries have to repeat their residency in Canada . These are n't countries with substandard medical education . I am not saying the MCCQE should n't be easy to pass for everyone writing it . That is a given . IMGs study for it because they have to get a top grade just to have a chance of landing a family medicine residency in some northern community . It 's not the case with Canadian graduates . I 'm sure there are people who slip through the cracks , and achieve licensure without being the most competent , but then again , similar things can be said for Canadian graduates too . I do n't speak of these people , because they 're not relevant , and I do not believe them to be in such a huge proportion as to be a serious problem . The system does not need to be more restrictive . It needs to be more permissive , but smarter . We 've created a bottleneck in how many ( competent ) physicians we can license in Canada by forcing physicians who are already trained to go through the whole residency nightmare again . I am all for checks and competence requirements , but there should certainly be a an equivalence process for foreign-trained specialists from Western countries .

I can compare Europe that uses brick and concrete [ like this ] ( http : //www.sape-tencuieli.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/casa-pe-structura-din-beton.jpg ) nowadays . One thing is that a solid brick construction does n't allow for the same type of water drainage as a brick facade on a frame , so you have issues especially with freezing and melting where water will enter , expand , and crack porous material like modern bricks and contrete . In Scandinavia , wood framed houses are common like in Canada largely for similar reasons . Stone and brick houses are also very cold and it takes a long time for them to heat up . In southern climates like Italy , Greece and Spain you see tons of [ cool stone houses ] ( http : //www.yourhomeoncrete.com/Custom/Resources/Files/pages/Building_Styles/P1010362.JPG ) and they 're very nice and cool in the summer so you do n't need A/C .

Same reason we are one of the few countries using wooden telephone poles when most of the rest of the world switched to concrete . Also , as a final point , I am uncertain if you can still find trades people specialized in building full structures out of brick and concrete in Canada as the demand is so low and it 's largely been forgotten .

Yours is the same opinion I hear touted from my Israeli friends . I am informed . I just disagree . For example , the Ottoman empire is a terrible example . They were not an Islamic caliphate in a traditional sense . They were regressive by today 's standards , but probably more progressive than the christian/european balkan areas they conquered at the time . They were also fairly inclusive of minorities with their millet system , compared to what today 's ISIS and and Taliban are preaching .

However , just because you got hit in the head , it does n't mean there 's a lot , or even any blood , filling your cranium .

I can be downvoted for it , but I know I am right on this one . It 's a mannerism .

A recent example of this ( first one to come to mind , and not necesssarily the best ) was in that new movie `` hell or high water '' where the two brothers at the end say they love eachother , and then immediately follow up by saying `` go fuck yourself '' . It 's just how men communicate with other men . The only way to break this for people is to be aware of it and try and communicate differently around women .

222baked,canada,"I can give you a clear example of low income rents staying cheap despite inflation . Look at Vancouver 's poverty stricken Downtown East-side where rentals have resisted the inflation that is paguing the city , and you can find one bedrooms in the 350-500 $ /mo range . Why ? Because it 's a shit hole that 's targeted for the low income group we 're talking about . UBI would not increase this target group 's disposable income by a significant margin , and it should n't effect the price of housing in that area . As to your second point , that is only partially true , and there 's many times when it 's downright false . Often times people who have lost all ties and are in severe poverty wont find a job . They smell , theyre dirty , and they dont have a phone . They often wo n't get hired in the first place , and one needs some basic amenities and support to be able to pull themselves out of severe poverty . It 's why it 's a called a poverty trap . Canada is also large and many smaller communities do n't have plentiful jobs . I 'm not saying there arent lazy crackheads who ca n't even hold down a job , but it 's not so black and white , and some peole really do need help .

222baked,canada,"Wow , there 's some real misunderstanding of our system here . First of all , let 's understand a bit the role of your family doctor . He 's the one who is supposed to hold a complete medical history for you , and ultimately decide treatment regimens , and tailor them to your needs , even above the authority of a specialist . If you visit walk-ins , it 's very difficult for your family doctor to keep track of your medical history . You may have revealed something at a walk-in that could later on affect your future treatment . This lack of effective communication might lead to your family doctor getting a big slap of malpractice when something goes wrong in the future . He 's ultimately responsible for you . Why would he take the risk ? Another big one is the misunderstanding in how our billing system works . That he 's being billed directly for your walk-in visit . GPs receive a yearly sum of cash for having you as a patient , and will receive a service fee every time you come in . When you go to a walk-in , not only is he not receiving that fee , but he is getting billed for a service fee . Now , you might scream that he 's being money hungry , but that 's not even remotely the case . Family physicians can only take so many patients to remain effective ( some take too many , but that 's besides the point ) , and so by you going to see walk-ins more often than your GP , you are essentially occupying a spot that could be better used on someone else for whom he can treat more effectively . Also , you 're literally depriving him of revenue . Your GP does n't make that much after covering his overhead ( see : http : //www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/how-much-are-canadian-doctors-paid/article7750697/ ) . Have you ever seen a server get angry when they do n't make tip ? Now maybe you can empathize a bit . Next is this 2-3 week waiting you are all screaming bloody murder about . That 's not really how it works . Most GPs have atleast 1-2 days a week where they will see take walk-ins also , and if you come into your GPs office with a soft emergency , they will squeeze you in . You might have to wait . The 2-3 weeks is for scheduled visits , which are not supposed to be used for acute conditions . When you have strep throat , you go right away and wait for your turn . Those scheduled meetings are used when it 's something that can wait ; follow-up , adjusting treament , yearly physical , non-emergency complaints . Also prescription refills should n't be a 2-3 weeks wait . Your family physician knows when you run out of medication , and usually schedules you to come back for a refill when you run out . I once got hit in the tailbone , and it hurt so bad I could n't sit down , but it was n't a serious ER emergency , so I went in to my GPs office he took me in first , because it was a priority . Learn to use your family doctor effectively . You should n't be going to walk-ins except in very extreme circumstances . It 's actually to your own detriment in the long term , and since you 're warned about this when signing up , your doctor is in right for freeing up a spot when you are being uncompliant .",Romance,Romanian

You were able to back it up too , so it 's nice to see that there is still an active spark in Quebec to try and preserve their culture . It 's a real gem in Canada .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"& gt ; why many Qu√©b√©cois do n't feel like they 're fully part of the country . I personally ca n't blame them . Well , that 's a shame . We owe much of what has become unique Canadian culture to things that stem from Quebec . From maple syrup to birch bark canoes and ice castles , the Quebecois have promoted a lot of what is iconic to Canada abroad . Maybe the language has n't taken hold in the rest of the country , but I think culturally Quebec has been more integral to Canada than any other province . If it 's any consolation , a good portion of the world is adopting English as the language of business affairs also , so it 's not just Canada .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"Fair enough . If that is how you feel , who am I to disagree ? Although , I always figured that internally the government generally speaks English in an unofficial capacity and at closed door meetings if they can . At the end of the day , government employees are just people , and probably the majority are more comfortable speaking English despite them having some sort of official capability to speak French . Not everything that comes out of their mouths will be in both languages . It 'd be odd if that was they case . Sure , they can accommodate to a French speaker , but it 's simpler and takes half the time to use a lingua franca if it 's spoken proficiently by all . Then on any written documents , French will be present because those are the rules of bilingualism . It seems reasonable to me , and does n't come off as an attempt to alienate anybody , but hey , I 'm not really a native French speaker .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"I 'm sorry you feel that way . Really . Speaking as an Anglo , I love the French language . I 'm going to wrap up my degree in Paris in the coming couple of years , and if Canada had not had its bilingualism , I never could 've done it . I 'm glad I was forced to learn French . No contempt on this part . People in the English speaking Canada who have contempt for the French language are ignorant , but hey , the world is full of ignorant people , so we ca n't worry about them . However , from what I garner these are just going to be used for short internal memos , and it wo n't be like all official documents will be published using a translator . What does it matter if a machine translates it , or a human does if the end result is the same ? Either way it 's getting done . Realistically , I doubt machines are at that level yet , but it is besides the point . We 'll never have laws published in broken French , so fear not . I wish French-speakers were not so sensitive about these language issues . Do n't misunderstand , I can see why one feels that they are losing their language , but to start yelling fire that a machine will translate some internal memos used by parliament seems rather excessive . The truth is , and read this with feelings aside , the languages are not equal . Nobody said they 're equal . French is spoken by a clear minority of the population ( 22 % according to wikipaedia ) . It 's sad that not more people speak French , but you ca n't really impose 3/4 of the population who have no clue about the French language or culture to all of a sudden speak French , and do everything in both languages . I believe any rational being can see the folly in believing it possible to achieve something like this . French has huge respect across the country . Every cereal box is in both English and French , every child has to learn 9 years of French , and all official functions are bilingual . It would be hard to find a country where a minority language has the respect French has in Canada . I am a big fan of this by the way , but it 's sad to see that my fellow French-Canadians do n't even appreciate that we 're trying .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"My French is n't that great , but I feel this came off perhaps either a bit dramatic n'est pas ? Most would agree that it would be a shame to lose the French language , as it , and the French-Canadian culture , is so intertwined with Canadian identity , but having an automatic translator for ease of use is n't going to destroy the French language and everything Canada stands for . French is really mostly dominant in a very isolated region and Canada is big . Very big . The vast majority speak English , and a lot of people are many thousands of kilometers from a French speaking region . Most people do n't have a clue about French . It 's just a fact . However , nobody is trying to take French away from Quebec . It 's undoubtably the language of use there . Why conjure up the 1960s over some automatic translator being used in office ? Maybe it 's even a good translator . Who knows ?",Romance,Romanian

Home growing is possible because in every country where it 's been legalized/decriminalized , growing has been made legal , and I do n't think Canada will rock the boat on this one .

222baked,canada,"I can say that Canada does a better job of integrating people compared to the average first world country , and from that extrapolate that the mosaic model works . France and Belgium , for example , have a very difficult time integrating people from the maghreb because they ca n't assimilate them into their culture . I also suspect that it has to do with the very rigid French cultural identity and nationalism . Canada is more inclusive with its nationalism and has had much more success with immigrants . Many immigrants feel they 're Canadian first and this is largely do to the mosaic model . For example , I 'm a proud Canadian , and secondarily I 'm an immigrant .",Romance,Romanian

Economically it makes sense as the government has control over how many slots to fund and in which feild .

222baked,canada,"So many countries have implemented successful state funded post secondary education . Hell , even the USSR had it and many Eastern European countries still have some form of it . It would solve the imbalance in our current education system . There would be stricter limits on available university spots and only the best would be selected . None of this pay to get an arts bachelour degree and work in starbucks after . Also no more $ 1000000 bonuses for administrators . Probably more professorial positions would be made available . Our universities our publicly funded but are run like a buisness . With state funded education we 'd have tighter regulation and more control over something that is essential to the growth of our country . It 'd be great . It 's not even a novel idea . Look at Germany and how successful it is over there with their constitutional right to education . The side effects are awesome . EDIT : I 've considered one aspect that might contradict my enthusiasm . Although I stand by what I said about the benefits of nationalized post secondary education , I must admit we are geopolitically disadvantaged . Consider that we 're neighbouring the US . The brain drain already is happening , but if we had free education , all the money we 'd be investing in training young adults would be wasted if they decide to hop across the border . With countries like Germany , they 're arguably one of the strongest economies in their region , so the brain drain is reduced . Also in Europe the language barriers keep new grads in the country .

You 'll never be Spanish no matter how long you live there . Spanish is Spanish . If you 're a German living in Spain , you 're German . Germany is unique in that it does n't accept dual nationalities and once you receive German citizenship , you should be by all accounts German , but this does n't really work on a societal level as much as it 'd like to .

The box was introduced in 1949 , nearing the end of the spike in infant mortality due to the great depression , and WW2 ( which was quite devastating on Finland ) . Also abortions became legal in 1950 , probably also reducing the number of infant mortality . These things alone can explain a reduction in infant mortality , and not the baby care package itself .

Really , a household making over 40k a year wo n't really need something like this . Sure it 's nice to get . Like getting some government check in the male when you were young . However , the costs of a child are far greater then the couple days of charity this will provide . I presume that the average Canadian family is n't the one that did n't plan on having a child or taking into consideration the cost involved . Sure , that exists , but I 'm talking most people . The net social outcome has to be weighed against the cost of things . We do n't really live in some utopia . I really believe that if this program produces so much waste that the couple hundred babies it really helps wo n't be worth the millions it could take to implement . Also , that instead of doing this we come up with a better alternative that targets those few hundred babies in a more meaningful way then a couple weeks worth of diapers . We can take the money spent on this and put it to better use . So it 's really not about abuse of the social safety net . I see this as misapropriation of funds for political motive .

( 2 ) End of a very harsh time period 1938/1949 end of Great Depression/WW2 both saw spikes in infant mortality .

222baked,canada,"& gt ; A practitioner must disclose immediately to the practitioner 's client any interest , direct or indirect , that might be construed as prejudicial in any way to the professional judgment of the practitioner in rendering service to the client . I feel like you just made this up . Physicians certainly do n't have to disclose anything of the sort to their patients . You 're obligated to put the patients needs first no matter the situation , or you have to find someone else to take over your duties . There 's no grey area on that matter , and no disclosure necessary . Physicians have a regulatory authority through the Medical Council of Canada that can easily take away your license if you 're found doing anything unethical or against the wishes/interests of your patients . So , if you do find a physician is prescribing you a superfluous drug , or refuses to change your medication to a more effective regimen due to some loyalty to a pharmaceutical company , you 're free to contact the MCC , and they most certainly will pursue this kind of professional misconduct . The issue here is that in reality , it 's not really being used in anyone 's detriment . At most , it 'll be an asprin A vs asprin B type thing . That 's why the argument is mute . I feel like this is something that might seem to be open to corruption , and that 's why people who are n't directly involved with the system have a problem with it , but in reality it is n't a problem because of the high ethical standards that come with being a physician , which really are n't abused , and if they are , there are checks in place . There is also the inherent positive of pharmaceutical companies subsidizing professional education to pitch their newer better drugs . I think you can agree that is obvious . Most physicians make sufficient income that they wo n't compromise their integrity , and risk their license for some cheap perks . It 's just a perk of the job . Nobody suffers from it . It 's why the MCC deems it an acceptable practice . I do not know what the future will hold , but I trust the system on this , because I have n't seen any real corruption because of it . It 's just hypothetical .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"I do n't pretend to know what you do , but a lot of family practitioners are self-employed small business owners , and can do as they please . Drug reps are just pitching a product . There 's nothing really wrong with that . Dog food companies do it for pet stores . Like I 've said , with the sheer volume of new drugs coming to market , it 's quite impossible to stay up to date on every drug . It 's why you have these drug reps . They come with some study , and a quaint explanation why their product is better , and then it 's up to your physician to decide when/where to use it . Most of the time it 's marginally irrelevant , like why their 70mg of asprin is better than the previously indicated 100mg pills for CVD . Many of those drug reps are borderline medically illiterate , and no physician really takes their word at face value . There 's got ta be some trust that your physician is doing things in your best interest , otherwise why bother going to the doctor ?",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"Yeah , that 's the thing . Discrimination is forbiden based on religion as per our Charter rights . It does n't mean that one religion needs to be singled out specifically .

For example , you ca n't throw out hate speech against christians and jews , and then say that that 's not an identifiable group because the two ca n't ne combined .

They 're essentially the same thing , the newer one that was marketed only needs to be taken once a day ( which is good ) . You 'd prescribe them anyways , they 're quite harmless , so what if the drug rep wants to pitch their drug ? It can get unethical only if the drug is inferior in either cost/effectiveness , and the physician prescribes it , but it 's the physicians responsibility and privledge to make that call . I do n't know any physicians who actually compromise on their patients well-being and ethical duty for some gifts and free meals . People have some sort of repulsion to these things because they do n't understand them and only see the outrageous superficial nature of them . Drug company = bad , doctor = evil and corrupt . In reality a lot of physicians are n't aware of new drugs which are constantly coming on the market , and some are better , whereas some are just the same . I do n't really believe it 's a widespread problem of docs prescribing inferior medication just because a drug rep told them to .",Romance,Romanian

Also I do n't argue for communism . I came from an ex communist country and have seen first hand the damages it 's done . I argue against unfiltered capitalism which is what you suggest should be in place in something as vital as education . I think you might change your opinion later on in life . Do n't hold so strongly to your notions of free market and unfettered capitalism because it is n't a perfect system either .

Total nationalization removes incentive and progress halts . The trick is finding a good balance . Free education is a good thing because we as a society benefit from having educated people . More doctor , engineers , and scientists . We would also benefit by allowing university access to those in lower socioeconomic classes who may excel in a certain feild , but can not afford to do so .

We as a society decided we 'd rather pay taxes than live in libertarian paradise , because that quickly leads to an imbalance of haves and have-nots , which ends up in a multigenerational caste system without hope of altering your status ; something akin to a feudal system , but drawing its power from wealth instead of divine right and violence . Not all degrees are gender studies . In a nationalized educational system , you 'd have the government dictating the availability of degrees based on projected need . You would n't have nearly as many useless BAs . Instead we 'd be funding only what we presume to need , and select based on skill instead of wealth . I am an advocate of such a system . Bringing about this kind of system is worth the tax dollars in my opinion . Also , ultimately other people will pay for your education , as you pay for others ' .

The kids wo n't learn it , or will only learn it as a foreign language but wo n't be bilingual , unless the mum makes an effort to speak to them in russian as often as possible from an early age . I 've seen numerous cases like this where kids ended up not learning the native language of one of the parents and it 's really sad .",Romance,Romanian

I have n't seen studies on this but I 'm sure that seeing adults only speaking between them in one language and not the other makes an important impact . A lot of the learning is made from picking up what the adults say .",Romance,Romanian

You ca n't really use an ssc before that age either and some mums just are n't into wraps .

Mostly because there 's a lot less space .",Romance,Romanian

I think everything you said sounds quite reaseonable and youdid your best to compromise . You might want to seek less judgemental parenting subs . I 'm definitely on your side . If you 're the primary caregiver and husband only spends a couple of hours a week with the baby then it 's normal that you make most of the decisions . It should n't be this way but life is n't perfect . In a perfect world you 'd both be spending equal amounts of time with the kid , but I understand if that 's not financially viable for you . Also , he has no excuse for not trying to educate himself more on childcare . There are audiobooks he could listen to during commute if he does n't have time to read . Also , the fact that your husband refuses to allow you to seek counselling for yourself is a huge red flag . He should n't be denying you the medical and psychological care you need . Also , he should n't have the power to deny you that , even if he wanted to .",Romance,Romanian

22boutons,relationships,"That 's not unreasonable at all . If they want the kids to be bilingual they need to speak both languages at home . It will be really inconvenient for the mum to speak with the kids in a language that the dad does not understand . The kids wo n't learn it otherwise , they might just learn it as a foreign language eventually . The comparison with religion is not really adequate but even there , if the kids see that their dad gives no fucks about something that their mum says is important it will be quite hard .

There 's this very common rethoric among romanians that somehow the stray dogs issue is created by animal lovers who want the dogs on the streets . That 's really stupid , as you probably know , animal lovers in Romania try really hard to sterilise the dogs , reduce their numbers and keep them off the streets . The problem is the uneducated population , often from the rural areas . They do n't sterilise their dogs even though often there are programs available which offer free sterilisation .

22vin,Roadcam,"There are two types of car insurance policies in Romania : RCA and CASCO . The first one is mandatory and it is illegal to drive on public roads without one ; this type of insurance covers everything you damage when you cause an accident ( other cars , people , public property ) except your own car . CASCO is for your own car and this one is not mandatory . If the company you signed your RCA with does n't pay for some reason , the damaged party can sue to recover their money . There are some cheap crappy insurance companies here so if the driver chose the worst and cheapest there 's a chance he 'll have to pay for the pole himself .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,Roadcam,"Does n't work like that here . I explained the way car insurace policies work here in the comment above ; if you hit something , your RCA will cover the damages regardless of speeding , not yielding etc . The only way you 're not covered by insurance is if you legally were n't supposed to drive the car ( no driver 's license , DUI ) or the car is not fit for public roads ( bad condition , illegal modifications , summer tires when it 's snowing ) . So if you have 0 alcohol in your system and your car is legally fit for driving on public roads , you can cross a red light while doing 150km/h in a city and if you cause an accident your insurance will pay for it .

22vin,cars,"Location : Romania - Europe Price range 8-9000eur max , used Right , so I need to replace our other car which is a 2013 Opel Corsa 1.2 86hp . Reasons : way too slow , crappy MPGs in busy traffic , crappy build quality , crappy ride quality , crappy everything . I 'm looking at diesel hatchbacks as MPGs are quite important but I 'd like something a bit more interesting than your average 1.6 diesel Focus/Golf . A good friend is selling his Boxer Diesel Subaru Impreza . Made in 2009 , 137000km ( 85K miles ) , 2litre 150hp diesel with a 6 speed manual . Extra features : leather seats , keyless go & amp ; entry , sunroof , xenon headlights . Price : 9000eur **What I like about it** : it drives really nice , the engine is powerful enough for my needs , that sweet AWD ( which is really useful considering we have snowy winters ) , it 's not your average crappy hatchback as Subarus are not very common here and I trust him . We 're good friends for quite some time and he owns a repair shop which focuses on Subarus ( he used to own a small Subaru dealership as well ) . He bought the car from Germany last year and wants to sell it because he 's looking for something more powerful . He replaced everything that needed to be replaced in the car ( he worked on all of my cars and he always did a good and responsible job ) and told me that atm there is absolutely nothing wrong with it . It 's not the first time I 'm buying a used car so I 'm well aware that anything can go wrong with it even though it drives just fine now . **What I do n't like about it** : It 's a bit old . So it 's almost 8 years old and it 's got 137000km . If I 'd get a diesel Focus , I could get one that 's 5 years old and with less than 100.000km . Sure , the Subaru drives better and it 's definitely nicer than a Focus but would it last as much ? I 'm planning to hold on to it for 4-5 years . Driver seat is a bit worn on the left side though I understand some leather paint would fix it and the front lip is a bit damaged . I 'd really appreciate some opinions on this matter as I ca n't really decide and I 've been thinking about it for a while now .

The edges are n't sharp anymore so the phone feels really polished and nice in hand . I 'd say the phone feels pretty natural to hold . The figerprint sensor is indeed placed in a weird spot .

So I started searching ; I really wanted the N4 but it 's not officially available in my country yet ; One X - no more HTCs , I wanted to try something else ; SGS3 - awesome hardware and features but too big for my taste , too plasticky and not my kind of design . There was no Android phone I really liked so I decided fuck it , I 'll get an iPhone and if I do n't like it I 'll switch back when the N4 will be available here . Now , the iPhone 5 is pretty expensive here in Romania - 16GB : $ 950 off contract and $ 400 on a $ 77/month contract ; not worth it when I do n't know if I will like it , so I bought an iPhone 4 . Now here are my opinions : **The bad , and things I miss most about Android : ** - having no quick toggles for wifi , mobile data and brightness takes some time getting used to - fuck iTunes . I have 3 computers and not being able to transfer data without syncing it with every damn computer I connect it to is just stupid . The good thing is that I transfer data rarely since I do n't listen to music on it and I do n't use it for taking pictures - God , I miss smart dialing . I never used contacts or recent list for dialing , just smart dialing wich was simple and fast . It 's gone now - the pull-down status bar wants to copy Android but does a crappy job . It 's useful but in no way as useful as the one in Android ( especially because this one does n't show icons when I receive something - it just shows a banner that dissapears leaving no icon on the bar ) . - communication between apps is very limited . I think you know what I mean , you ca n't just send a photo from the album directly to Dropbox or WhatsApp nor can you open an address from the browser directly in gmaps . **The good : ** - even with a 1ghz single core processor it 's so damn smooth and responsive . I can even play GTA3 ( without some of the effects for the iPhone4 , like it was at first on Android , it 's very playable , runs exaclty like on my stock Sensation ) - I do n't usually play games on my phone but I tried this as a `` benchmark '' - everything is so polished , the attention for the small but important things is impressive - battery life is so damn good ; I do a lot of mobile data browsing and I can get through a whole day without problems . With the Sensation that was n't possible , I had to plug it in my car at least once before I got home - it 's simpler and more basic but everything just works as it should . Maybe sometimes simplicity and not changing something that works just fine is better than new but not 100 % polished things - I love the lockscreen notifications , they look nice and the slide to reply/call back/open feature is pretty cool - the apps are very good . Most of them are more polished and work better and faster than on Android - iMessage is pretty cool if you have many friends with iPhones , like I have . Of course , there is WhatsApp , but it 's just not the same thing - the speaker is loud and clear , I can easily hear it ring and hear the alarm in the morning . Now the conclusion : am I sorry for buying an iPhone ? No , definitely not . This is just what I need right now : a reliable , smooth and simple smartphone with good battery life . There is nothing I did on Android that I ca n't do on the iPhone . I use my smartphone for calling ( minimum 1h a day ) , chatting , internet browsing ( 90 % are mobile sites ) , mail , reddit ( Alien Blue is good ; not as good as Reddit News or Reddit Sync but not bad either ) . I thought the smaller screen will bother me but it does n't since I rarely watch videos on it and do n't usually browse desktop sites ; the best thing about it is that I can easily use it with one hand - this is the main reason I do n't like displays bigger than 4.3 '' . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm still an Android fan , I still want Android to succeed more than I want Apple to but the iPhone is just better for what I want from a smartphone now . And since I miss Android I 've decided I want a Nexus 10 but as usual , it 's not available here right now . And who knows , maybe when I 'll get a chance to use a N4 I 'll switch right back .",Romance,Romanian

I 'm interested in doing my postgraduate training ( in Romania this consists in 5 years of residency ) in a country with an advanced healthcare system .

They 're worth it as long as they have 6-7mm of tread and they 're less than 4 years old . We usually say that snow tyres are n't efficient anymore once the tread is less than 5mm and they 're more than 5 years old . Always check the manufacturing date ( DOT ) , I 've driven cars with old snow tyres and even though they had enough tread left , they were crap as they become quite rigid after ~5 years . I would recommend the Nokian WR A4 's . I 've got them on the Volvo and they 're great . Just remember : old and/or worn out snow tyres are almost as crappy as summer tyres .

Windscreen defogging never really worked so you had to have a cloth in your car for those cold or rainy days . - there was a strong smell of petrol in the back of the car - engine overheating was part of the driving experience during summer . - everybody carried a toolbox in the boot and everybody knew how to fix one ( or else you were fucked ) - replacing the exhaust was a routine maintenance job - there was no such thing as a fully functional Dacia .

There 's also a [ Stepway ] ( http : //www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/uploads/f2/news/img/201664_102441.jpg ) model . The old one is your average barebones low cost car , equipped only with the stuff you need and nothing more , like ABS , A/C , CD player , power windows . The new one gets a few nicer extras , like leather seats , auto climate control , 7 '' touchscreen nav & amp ; media center , auto gearbox ( they even offer a dual clutch gearbox on the Duster ) , LED DRLs . Photos [ 1 ] ( http : //static.automarket.ro/img/auto_resized/db/article/066/843/967177l-610x390-b-0c61b42f.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( http : //trimtechnik.net/assets/images/content/138/dacia_sandero_stepway_black_004__1000.jpg ) . A base Sandero costs ( in Romania ) 7000eur and a fully loaded diesel model about 13000eur . I would n't spend 13000eur on a Sandero though . How the car feels : - the old one ( as seen on Top Gear ) is not great at all . Yeah it 's cheap but it 's for people who want a cheap car that 'll take them from point A to point B without too much hassle . It 's kind of noisy , seats are not very comfortable , the interior materials are cheap , handling is n't great ( not dangerous by any means but if you enjoy driving , this is not the car for you ) . Engines were n't the newest versions , there was a 1.4l 75hp and a 1.6l 90hp , both petrol and a 1.5 diesel 85hp . You wan na get the diesel as it has great fuel economy ( diesel Dacias are amazing at fuel economy ) , it 's reliable and since it 's a diesel , it has a bit of torque so the car does n't feel slow . The 1.4 and 1.6 petrol versions are obsolete , they were phased out a few years ago but they were reliable engines ; fuel economy wasnt't great though . - the new one is much more improved . Feels less like a low cost car and more like your average european small , affordable hatchback . It handles better , it has better noise insulation , seats are better and the ride has generally improved . It 's still not a driver 's car by any means but it should be more than acceptable by anyone 's standards . It 's great for people who want a cheap small car and they want to buy it new , there are n't many cars that can compete with it considering the price and what you get for that price . Engines : the petrol options are now a 1.2 75hp NA and a 0.9turbo 90hp ; if you want a diesel , you 've got the same good 1.5dci 90hp . Fuel economy is really good , they also have an Eco button that reduces power and fuel consumption , a very good option for city driving . The advertised fuel economy for the diesel is 65 US mpg and it is honestly very capable of doing that if you 're careful with the throttle . Again , I recommend the diesel option unless you do n't plan on driving much ; if you only plan on doing much less than 10k miles per year , the 0.9 turbo would be a better option . It 's a tiny engine but the turbo makes it feel much more powerful and taxes and isurance will be cheap as it 's & lt ; 1litre . So yeah , the Sandero . It 's not a bad car at all , they may be low cost cars but as they 're made in the EU , they 're safe and quite reliable . Their target customer is not the car enthusiast but the person who wants a cheap new car that takes them from A to B hassle-free ; and the Dacias are , honestly , great at doing exactly that .",Romance,Romanian

Why am I saying all this ? Because when you first learn how to drive a manual , you 'll know how to properly drive the one you learned on . When you switch to a different car it will be difficult again . You will be able to easily switch to other manual cars once you gain a bit more experience .

I do n't believe it 's all about the traffic , I think it 's a matter of personal preference and what you got used to .

Climbing to the actual fortress might be a bit tricky if there 's a lot of snow but as the altitude is not very high ( the fortress is 850m above sea level according to google ) there might not be any snow at all . The drive from Bucharest should not take more than 2h-2h30min depending on weather conditions and the roads are good . Keep in mind that you 'll have to pay extra for winter tyres when you rent the car . Winter tyres are mandatory in Romania when it snows and all rental cars are equipped with them but for some reason rental companies like to charge you extra for that even though they wo n't even hand it to you without winter tyres installed . I would also suggest getting the extra windscreen protection because there might be a lot of small pebbles on the roads due to the sand-salt anti icing mixtures they sometimes use for the road surface .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,Romania,"There 's no need to get chains unless you wan na go further up in the mountains .

You can ask for it at the rental location , before signing your contract . Now , regarding rental companies : I 've used Hertz , Avis , Enterprise and Sixt in Romania . Go with Sixt only if they offer really good rates ; otherwise they 're not worth it , their cars are n't great .

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"I do n't think it 's low enthusiasm , just look at this https : //twitter.com/rob_swire/status/677292896245149696 btw , I remember that Kevin ( the drummer ) did an interview not long ago and he explains that Rob truly loves the live format , but is too much things for him and how you guys will know , it 's not specially cheap ... My opinion is that they started KP just to try new things and make some money ( I 'm not calling them sellouts , just that KP is a more easy way to make money ) but they have lost the passion to the project now like it happened to them with pend in 2010 . The difference is that seems like they 've lost the passion from KP because of the scene they 've been moving now ( Electro , Dubstep , Big Room ... genres that are saturated rn ) , and this is different way to `` lose the passion for the project '' like it happened to pend and for a creative mind the EDM scene is too much restrictive in terms of originality . Just look how Rob has been bitching to the EDM scene and doing songs that are just jokes about the scene , because KP is just a project to have some fun . IMO , I think that they are going to do more Pend stuff this 2016 , but the lives are going to be in the biggest festivals ( less glastonbury ) so they can win money and not lose it like it happened in the past , and if this works they will continue with pend or do pend and kp at the same time like Jon Gooch with Spor and Feed Me this 2015 .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think the same as you . Luffy already unbalanced the balance of power by defeating three shichibukais and as we have seen he did not need to efeat them all so that it will now be clear that it is possible for the system of sea warriors to be overthrown . With the emperors in spite of being presented as possible final bosses , it is quite unlikely that Luffy face them all because it would take too long . In addition , when Whitebeard was defeated , we saw that there was an imbalance in the balance of power in the New World . Right now as the story progresses , Luffy is not ready to beat an emperor himself alone or with the help of his crew and is unlikely that he will have a power up large enough in an arc to reach the level of an emperor . I see more possible that the first emperor to be defeated is Kaido after a great confrontation between him and the worst generation . That will cause an imbalance that will cause both Blackbeard and the Marine to gain more power in the new world . Shanks may be defeated by Blackbeard towards the end of the story given the fact that Teach said in the paramount war that he was at that moment not ready to fight against him , about Big Mom I have no idea although it may be the same as with Kaido . Anyway the only 1 vs 1 that I see possible is between Luffy and Teach . But I do see truly possible that after Kaido 's defeat Luffy will gain even more recognizement and the great fleet will gain a lot of new members so the world government will start to look at him as a serious problem .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,history,"Japanese were against the european habits , they said that the nanban ( `` barbarians of the south '' ) were disrespectful , dirty and uncivilized . The only reason why they were welcomed was because of the trade , especially for the muskets which arrived to Japan thanks to the portuguese merchants . Japan was under a civil war during that time and alot of the feudal lords could n't afford to trade with China or Corea during the XVI century because the sea was under the pressure of the Wako pirates ( and even the chinese government prohibited to trade with Japan because of that ) plus they did n't had enough money to spend it in trade since the focus was on the mainland and by the way the merchants in the japanese society were even under the peasants in the social pyramid . That 's why some feudal lords wanted to trade with the europeans , because it was a good way to recive both european and chinese products without having to move from their own possetions in Japan . The europeans were also tolerated because they came in a period of war bringing with them a new religion that said that everyone was equal to god view . Some feudal lords adapted the christianism because they wanted better relations with the europeans so this could make them have priority in the trade in Japan against other daimyos . The thing is that in the christian territories there was less xenophobia ( if we can call it like that ) against the europeans because those japanese christians sometimes felt more related to the europeans that with the rest of the japanese society . Some of these japanese christians married portuguese merchants so when the sakoku was established all of them had to move to other places like Macau , Malacca or even the spanish philippines .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,spain,"For what I was taught , America wanted to expand to both the caribbean and the pacific and Spain was the easiest prey in both places . The spanish government felt like Cuba was the gem of the nation at the time , so it was seen like even when Spain was n't prepared to deal with a war , it was necesary as a matter of pride to fight for Cuba . The war left Spain in the ruin moraly speaking even when the monetary losses were n't that huge .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do agree that in a normal situation he would not forgive all that in one day , but we need to think that in one day they are going to die . He can empathize with them a bit or maybe leave the grudge he has aside for a greater good : To save Reiju . Leaving them to die would not solve the Vinsmoke drama either . He needs to solve the problems he has with his family . If they die it 's like he has done nothing to solve the issues he was going to solve back when this arc began . If he either kicks them then what 's next ? Yonji was in fact defeated off screen and it seemed like Sanji did it without blinking . If it was n't for Judge using that wall think he would have been defeated too . Also , with Niji he gave up because Zeff was in danger . The only one that imo could be strong enough is Ichiji and it 's just an assumption based on the fact that he seems to be the leader . The truly problem here is Judge , not the brothers . Sanji holds a grudge to the family as an extent for all the shit they did to him , but particularly to his father , which imo is the real conflict here .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I 'm so intrigued about Lola 's fianc√© . That guy needs to be either a huge influential character or a truly monster . Knowing that , it ca n't be one of the past shichibukai members because they do n't have enough power or influence to change the balance of power between the four emperors . The only ones that could change a bit the balance are Doflamingo and Mihawk , and any of those would want to be under a Yonko even when they were related to Kaido and Shanks . It ca n't be either one of the supernovas because they were n't in the new world back then and they are becoming a new power just now . I highly doubt it was a member of the world government either . Why would they even want to become allies with a Yonko ? If she became pirate queen then it would be a huge problem for the Gorosei . Also , it 's kinda impossible that it was a celestial dragon . I mean those guys do n't care about the pleb and they feel that they are gods . They ca n't mix themselves with normal citizens and even less with pirates . The only possibilities I believe that are viable : 1 - Teach : He betrayed Whitebeard . It can either be possible that he wanted to create an alliance with other Yonko to scape of the rage of WB after he killed Tatch , or just to betray both of them at the same time . Trying to ally himself with BM with a political marriage would have been the best way to do it . Also , we know that his current hability allows him to be the perfect counter to every DF user . 2 - Weeble : It would be the best way to introduce him to the plot . He 's really strong so maybe he could have been a determining character against the other emperors . 3 - A new character , which imo could be a strong member of the underworld : We already saw some brokers back in Punk Hazard and I doubt that all of them were working only to the emperors . There 's definitely strong people in the underworld that should know a lot of information about how the things work there .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"The thing is that BB wants to become pirate king , so it would n't be weird if even when he was a member of the Whitebeard pirates , he was in contact with the other emperors just so his master plan to become pirate king could work properly . He wants to top the rest of emperors , it was pretty clear when in Marineford he said to Shanks that he was n't able to fight against him **YET** . Maybe he wanted to marry Lola so he could enter into his family and thus dethrone Big Mom from the inside of her own kingdom . Is not like he could n't do that , in truth he did something similar when he became Shichibukai . He just wanted the tittle so he could recruit some new crew members in Impel Down . Also , we already know that Capone is married with one of BM daughters but he 's going to betray her . Having blood ties with Big Mom makes her vulnerable against her own family . She does n't expect that one of her family members could betray her . Teach could have lied to her saying that he wanted to become part of her crew .

The scenario with Teach would be possible but I doubt that Oda would want to repeat the same thing that happened with Whitebeard again . Talking about Big Mom I doubt she 's going down this arc , but I also do n't think that she would move from Totland . I do n't know what is going to happen since Wano wo n't start till 2018 , but I can say what I would want , and is that Luffy , Law , Kid , Moriah and Marco fight against him together and after a huuuuge battle , he 's defeated .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think that he is pretty much a complex character , just like Law . He 's known for killing civilians , but looks like he kills people that laughs at his dreams but he respects Luffy and Law even when he wants to defeat them . Also , he stated in Sabaody that even when he was a pirate he had his own standars compared to the celestial dragons buying slaves . The thing is that surely we need to know him more before we start to judge him . My personal opinion is that like every other important character we 've seen so far , he had his own sad backstory which surely changed him . Maybe someone related to him ( in a similar way to Shanks and Luffy ) taught him about fighting for his own dreams and he took it the wrong path . Maybe his family died , or his words in Sabaody about the slaves are some kind of foreshadowing , we already know that he was poor as a kid thanks to one of the SBS . I 'm sure that it will be really important to know more about his past and how his relationship with Killer started .

I think that Oda is setting up the worst generation in a way that they would end needing each other to defeat a Yonko .

In the space of 2 hours there 's too few things that you can do with these new characters . Tesoro could have had more build up in 15-20 episodes of the anime and we could have knew more about his backstory . Also , Sabo and Lucci were there just for fanservice and we did n't knew what happened with Sabo after he and Lucci shared some punches , tho I need to recognize that I love to see both of them again . The only thing I did n't liked was that there was some inconsistences with kairoseki and sea water : Luffy moved underwater and he technically was tied in kairoseki but then moved like nothing .

All the Yonko had their own crews long before the worst generation arrived to the new world , so it 's logic to think that Kaido did have 3 calamities before X Drake arrived there .

In contrast , Luffy was defeated by an army of BM pirates and he needed Nami and the whole forest of homies to defeat a commander . With this I 'm not saying that Luffy is weak , but against an emperor and his crew the supernovas are like ants . And I have the feeling that Kid being destroyed by Kaido , Cracker and the whole army of BM defeating Urouge and Luffy being captured is just to show that they are not at the same league as the emperors , And to be fair I love it .

What I like of him is that he has an interesting backstory , he is serious and does n't live in the clouds so he could become a great adviser for Luffy and also a good contrast with the rest of the crew . Maybe this will make them mature a bit , do n't get me wrong , I like the regular dynamics of the crew but now in the new world and after two years it would be great to see them maturing a bit ( we 're seeing it with Sanji already ) . On the other hand , I think that having an experimented pirate would kill the feeling that they are a group of young ( mentally speaking in Brook 's case ) pirates that have been building their experience from the start of the series . Also , I find Jinbe 's fighting style pretty bland .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I believe that there 's not a huge gap of power between Luffy and the other members of the worst generation as some people say . In truth , Luffy and Zoro stayed 2 years training , but the other supernovas have stayed the same amount of time in the new world dealing by themselves with strong pirates and they have survived . Even Urouge , Kid , Apoo and Hawkins have stayed that amount of time without being under an emperor and they have survived . By the way , Luffy is as close to defeat a Yonko as Urouge or Kid have been in those two years , less for the fleet and the alliances . I mean , do you guys really believe that just because they trained 2 years they are at the same level as 4 pirates that no only control the new world by themselves but instead one of them is enought to deal with the 7 warlords and the marine hq at the same time ? It 's like , seriously guys , they are the fucking four emperors . Is not like other strong pirates have tried to defeat them before . Without a huge alliance between the supernovas and other strong allies no way one of them is going down .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I get what you 're saying but that does n't make Luffy able to defeat a Yonko nor does him way stronger than the rest of supernovas . In fact we have the case of Urouge , who defeated Snack , presumibly by himself due to his raw force and his devil fruit . Luffy needed Nami and the whole forest to defeat Cracker in 11 hours , if it was n't for them , Cracker would have attacked him till Luffy were tired enough to finish him with pretzel . That 's why I hate when some fans underestimate the other supernovas .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"There 's a difference tho , Akatsuki members worked together even if their ambitions where different . the warlords had a deal with the WG but not between them , and as we know they had some tense moments in the marineford arc . As a team , akatsuki members have more opportunities to win . At the same time if you compare akatsuki with the shichibukais , it 's fair to say that the weaker shichibukais are stronger than the weaker members of akatsuki and viceversa , the strongest shichibukais are weaker than the strongest members of akatsuki . * Deidara vs Crocodile : Imo Deidara is the weaker member of the group , and even when he is truly destructive , the fact that Crocodile can skip the explosions thanks to his devil fruit makes every move of Deidara a waste of time . Crocodile would win imo . * Hidan vs Law : In that specific fight against Law he does n't stand a chance . Law can literally split Hidan 's body from a far distance and given that Hidan needs to injure someone in order to make the Jashin ritual , he ca n't do anything against Law . * Konan vs Hancock : Hey , I doubt that Hancock 's DF could work on Konan . Also , Konan can become paper like if it was a logia . Imo Konan is stronger no doubt . * Kisame vs Jinbe : Both are on par imo , Kisame has a gigantic amount of chakra that could overcome the gyojin karate of Jinbe , but Jinbe has proved like he can resist a lot of damage . So who knows . * Nagato vs Teach : Due to the fact that the Yami Yami works specifically against devil fruit users and Nagato does n't have a DF , I 'd say that Nagato wins . Even if Teach had the Gura Gura , Nagato can control gravity so he can attract Teach to himself and then steal his soul . * Sasori vs Moriah : I do n't know , Sasori looks like a weak version of Doffy but Moriah is Moriah ... * Kakuzu vs Kuma : Kuma no doubt , pretty much the same that Hidan vs Law . * Itachi vs Mihawk : I know that Mihawk is possibly the strongest shichibukai , but hey , Itachi can defeat him just using tsukuyomi imo . This without talking about if he used amaterasu . * Obito vs Doffy : I love Doffy buuut Obito 's hability to move into different dimensions makes him a serious problem . Also , If we count that moment when Obito had both the rinnegan and the mangekyo sharingan , Doffy is fucked even if he used his awakening . The interesting fight here would be Madara against the Yonko . Imo , Madara 's power is so fucking ridiculous that with just one of the emperors he would be bored .",Romance,Spanish

He is the most op character ever written in a shonen imo . I believe that if Madara ended in the OP world , he could easily kill everyone without sweating . * Kaguya was kind of a deux ex machina character but surely she could defeat Big Mom . * mmm I do n't know , it depend in how the dust ability of Onoki works against the Yami Yami and the Gura Gura , but I would say that Teach had it better to win because the Yami Yami absorbs everything so I suppose that he could neutralize it like that .",Romance,Spanish

Imo the chemistry that both of them share does exist for something more that for comedic relief . We will see how it ends , but after Madao and his wife this is the only pairing that I can see actually happening .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,Gintama,"I do n't like to ship characters in any manga/anime because a lot of them are so forced and unnecessary that I ca n't even want them to happen . In this case is the other way around . The build up has been so slow peaced yet so well done that it needs to happen . Even if Sorachi said that he does n't like romance , like you said Gintama has a lot of it and it 's so well writen that it does n't feel forced . This also happens with Oda in One Piece . He said that he does n't like to write about romance but if you are a manga reader the current arc has some romance in it and it does n't feel forced . Sorachi has make us see that Gintoki is the kind of guy that thinks that he does n't deserve to be loved . But at the same time , every moment he is with Tsukuyo it feels different . In the Courtesan of a Nation arc they even acted like a couple of 15 years old brats that do like each other but do n't want to admit it . There 's not really any other character that could be with Gintoki : Otae is pretty much like a sister for him , Sacchan ... well in this case is just comedic relief and to be fair Kyuubei never felt like she looked to him in a romantic way . Tsukuyo is the only one that could happen and it 's even more evident in every new arc with both of them as main focus . Also I said it in the other post , but in the manga it looked like he liked her even without the effects of the incense . Specially when he said `` I ca n't even look at the woman I like like I usually do '' , because it was implified that he knew that the incense was surting effect in himself but anyways he stated that he liked her . Sorachi is that kind of writer that builds up the story in a way that things that happened at the beggining of the series have a meaning and transcendence now . Maybe the main reason why Sorachi created Tsukuyo was to have someone to teach Gin that he can be loved and also love someone and the better way to do it is if both end together . Also , it would weird if Gintama ends with Gin alone after all the shit that he has suffered in his life since he was a kid .",Romance,Spanish

I think that is not that they are least evil , because it 's clear that they just care about them and their goals .

That 's for showing us that even when we thought that the Vinsmoke were like Nazis , Big Mom is even worst . Also , there is a saying in my country that says `` More knows the devil for being old than for being the devil '' , and it fits pretty much with Big Mom . The Vinsmokes were talking about leaving Totto Land with Pudding as soon as possible because they knew that in that way they could have some advantage over Big Mom in the treat they had with her . She possibly expected it so that 's about it . The whole thing is just making us the readers see that there 's no way you could cheat to Big Mom and that for Luffy and the rest , the enemy ( the Vinsmokes / Capone ? ) of their enemy ( Big Mom pirates ) will become their ally .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't fucking know what to think anymore . I liked her being the ally in this arc ( even if she was the stereotypical princess that helps the SH 's , I liked her way more that the past ones ) and her memories about Lola , the moments she shared with Sanji and all that looked so real that I ca n't really believe she was bad from the beginning , plus the moment when Brook and Pedro saw her choosing a wedding dress she looked like she really wanted to make it to the seducing woods to help Luffy and the rest . Yeah , it looked too good to be true but let 's be honest , there 's a lot of characters that acted kindly with the SHs in every island since they meet them . Just remember Skypiea for example . Also , the way it 's been builded up it looked that some daughters of Big Mom felt like tools and wanted to get out of that ( not just Pudding and Lola , but also Praline and Chiffon ) . If she 's been working for mama since the beginning then she 's such a psychopath specially because Sanji was already tied and he could n't scape . Where is the point into making him falling in love for her then ? Also , why she said it to Luffy and Nami whispering if Opera was the only one there and he is also loyal to Big Mom ? So ... I not 100 % sure that she 's evil . Maybe she wants to make both parties fight each other so Sanji can scape . Maybe even if all that she said was true , it could be that she has two personalities or even that she started all this like what Big Mom planned and then it turned that she ended liking Sanji . After all why Big Mom wants to kill the Vinsmokes ? She would gain not only the technology but also the royal family as allies which are strong warriors . And why she wants to kill them in the ceremony ? I mean , she can kill them now , as we know the Germa kingdom is there so there 's no point into waiting to the wedding . Anyways , it is interesting to see how Oda has introduced us to the Vinsmokes as a kind of arrogant Nazi family which a lot of us hated or wanted Sanji to clean the soil with them and now it turned that I am even afraid that something bad could happen to them . Maybe this will be the path to make them see that Sanji deserved to be treated better when he saves their lives . At the other hand if she is evil then it would be really interesting , specially since it would be completely unique and different compared with the princess in distress we 've been seeing for years now . Having a manipulative and psychopatic female character is one of the things that would make this arc even better , plus it has some logic since with Anana we 've seen that Big Mom teaches her kids into being as cruel as they can , and for the rest of siblings it looks like they are absolutely loyal to her mother . Seriously , this arc is right now the most matured one we 've seen so far . The complexity and diversity of characters , the amount of `` What if.. '' moments it has with every chapter and the way Oda is showing us that the Yonko are at a different league in comparison with the rest of characters we 've seen so far makes this the best arc of the new world and pretty close to Enies Lobby as the best arc of One Piece .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I like both equally so I get what you mean . Like you I think that One Piece has a better world building no doubt and the story is full of amazing lands , mythology , races , kingdoms , cultures and organizations . Also , if we compare both mangas , I personally find more interesting and unique Oda 's style of drawing . Gintama on the other hand is funnier , but people tend to think that is all about dick jokes and parodies when in truth the serious arcs are no doubt at the same level as the best arcs of OP and that is because Sorachi does an amazing job building the relationships between characters in the funny arcs , so when we reach the serious ones all has been builded so perfectly that you can feel the motivations of the characters . & gt ; The Shogun Assassination arc is the best story arc I have ever read and seen . And it 's largely because it contains my favorite fight of all the media I 've experienced .

You have some interesting designs like Gladius , but then you have grotesque and annoying ones like Buffalo , Machvise or Jora . The problem was n't that they had just weird designs , but that their personalities felt too flat and their powers were , as I said , the same as the agents of Baroque Works .

The same can be said about Usopp , Luffy , Whitebeard , Jinbe , Capone or Coby .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think considering that there are 4 yonkos , it is quite likely that Oda will do some kind of intermediate arc . I say this because I doubt that Oda want to face the SH with the 4 yonkos one after another . I believe that he will focus in Big Mom and Kaido ( both have been hyped yet ) , then a small arc in which other characters are included and then return with Shanks and Teach . He showed something similar at the beginning of the series , when we were introduced to Mihawk . Many thought that the SH would fight with all the Warlords one after another , especially after seeing the confrontation with Crocodile . But this did n't happened because Oda knew that it could have been too cliche . At the same time , the yonkos are possibly the strongest individual characters and Oda will lengthen the saga of the four emperors as much as possible so that we can see in detail their skills and motivations and what made them the most powerful pirates . A little break between the emperors could be good not just for the pace of the story but for reintroduce old characters or other ones that are not really related to the yonkos . Obviously we do n't know what will happen with Crocodile , Moriah , Buggy , Weevil , Mihawk , Jewelry Bonney , Urouge , Enel , CP0 , Vegapunk , the revolutionaries etc . Maybe some of them will be part of one recent arc ( my hopes are in Crocodile , Bonney and the CP0 in the BM arc , Moriah in the Wano arc and maybe Mihawk and Buggy with Shanks ) but there 's a lot of characters that are like wildcards right now . They can have their shining moment in a small bridge arc after BM/Kaido arcs and before the other two yonkos . I think that if this is the case , my bets are with an arc related to the moons and sky islands involving Enel and Urouge among others ( maybe Monet ? ) . That would be a good way for Oda to explain some of the history surrounding the moons .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I always see theories about possible new members for the SH crew , but I would like to see new member in the other important crews . These are the ones I woul like to see : **Bellamy** : I know that this will not happen bc Bellamy is more an ally than an enemy and after everything that happened with Doflamingo is quite unfeasible to him being under the rules of someone again , but would love to see Bellamy being part of Crocodile 's band . The current design of Bellamy reminds me to a member of a mafia and Crocodile at the moment except for Mr 1 seems to have no one under his command , if Crocodile ends up being an ally or even a revolutionary , it would be really interesting to see Bellamy with him . **Caesar Clown** : Kid Pirates . It has been said in some occassions and is something that I think it could happen and indeed it **should** happen . Caesar is not going to be redeemed and it fits perfectly with the way that the Kid Pirates act , he has no remorse about killing people . At the same time , it would be a good way to create an alliance between enemies of Luffy as happened at the beginning of the series with Buggy and Alvida . In this case , it would be much more logical , because Kid represents a greater threat than Buggy . I know there are people who think that he will end in the Law 's crew but I personally doubt it , the Heart pirates now are 20 members and I assume that we will know more about them in Wano . **Caribou & Coribou** : From the moment they were introduced , these two characters were shown to have skills to finish under the orders of Buggy . After all we know that Buggy has a great reputation and most of the funniest villains end up in his band . It would be amazing to see that these two act with him like Bartolomeo with Luffy . **Monet** : Yes , I know many of you believe she 's dead , but I 'm really optimistic , specially since there are some things about her that Oda did n't explained . If she comes back , I think it would also be possible for her to end up in the Kid pirates . Monet is an harpy , one of the most brutall creatures of the greek mythology and at the same time she would be somewhat of the more human character within a sanguinary group of pirates when ironically she is not completely human .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Since we know the identity of Ichiji and Niji , the theory of Killer or the two brokers that we saw in the Punk Hazard arc being them had disappeared completely . At the same time it has also virtually disappeared the possibility that these characters are siblings of Sanji ( in an SBS Oda already said that Killer was greater than Sanji and the other two characters also seems older than him ) . Based on what we know about the Vinsmokes ... Could it be possible that those characters are kind of a second branch of the family ? I mean , we saw that in `` Sora , the warrior of the sea '' there was 2 Vinsmokes with the numbers 1 and 2 in their capes . This history was really old like Vito said , it 's possible that those two characters are different from the Ichiji and Niji that we 've seen yet . So it could be that there is a second branch of Vinsmokes who follow the first branch , just like what happens in the actual mafias . In fact , it is possible that the names of the Vinsmoke could have the premise that they are `` immortal '' ( not literally , of course ) . Something similar to what happened with the 10,000 immortals of the persian army ( always the same number of soldiers , so if one of them dies other one replaces him ) , but in this case with names . Thus , the idea that even if you kill `` Ichiji '' or `` Niji '' there will be other ones with the same name being their successors , so the leader of the Vinsmoke always would be `` Ichiji '' and the second will be `` Niji '' , suggesting that they are an immortal family . Talking again about this second branch , I do believe that Killer and those 2 guys are part of it . Let 's focus on Killer . We do n't know how is his face ( so he could be hiding the typical eyebrows of the Vinsmoke family ) and although this is only like that because perhaps Oda likes the design with the helmet , even when his face was shown when he was a kid we could n't see it well ( all his face was covered by his hair ) , besides there are many things between Killer and the Vinsmokes ( especially Sanji ) that look alike : we do n't know his full name since Killer was a nickname that Oda used because he was lazy to think about something , his mask is based on one of the members of Daft Punk ( two french artists , Sanji would be french for what Oda said ) , their culinary tastes also have something to do with France and Italy and his fighting style is very bloody , so that not only fits into Kid 's crew but also would do as a member of Germa 66 . I know there are many points that do not fit if we think about Killer being one of the brothers of Sanji : He ca n't follow the pattern of the names for what we 've seen so far ( He is greater than Sanji , so there is no number for him now ) and if he was a Vinsmoke , how he ended in the South Blue ? Well , what if he has a similar story that Sanji in that sense ? it might even be that both escaped together and finished in different Blues . Killer is 6 years older than Sanji so it could be a cousin , member of that second branch . For the two brokers , I think that it 's difficult to know but for their looks ( blonde hair , their faces are hidden and one of them carries similar headphones to those of Reiju ) it could be possible .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,feedme,"Until a couple of years ago I always tended to compare Jon with Rob Swire . The two come from similar backgrounds , starting at the Drum & Bass scene and passing a few years ago to new genres with a secondary project that in both cases has become the main project . But today , I see that while Rob has stalled and releases less music ( and worst in quality if you ask me ) , Jon is at the peak of his career . Since Calamari Tuesday was released and specially since he created his own label , each new release of Feed Me is more versatile and original although still retaining its characteristic sound , even in EPs with more commercial songs it stills sounds great . As if that were not enough , he has relaunched new Spor material while he works on Seventh Stitch . Last year he released 22 tracks of Feed Me / Spor and this year already he has released 13 , not counting the second EP of Feed Me that is going to be released soon . Do you think that he will stay that way for long ? I personally believe that he is more self confident and has more freedom with his work so he 's going to release a huge number of new tracks in the next years and even if he starts to run out of ideas he will just focus on Spor or SS while he finds inspiration with new Feed Me material .",Romance,Spanish

Waiting till someone can do it for them ? And what about the Worst Generation ? Kaido is aware that Kouzuki Oden was able to read them but what about the others ? Do you think that any other possible pretender to the throne has someone in their crews able to read them ? Personally and since Oda said in the last SBS that one of the hobbies of BB was story ( I doubt it was just a pun about his name ) , I think that he can read them . Or maybe someone in his crew . Remember that half of his crew was on the last level of Impel Down , so maybe someone there could read them and that 's why they were there . Also , what about Big Mom `` collecting '' Poneglyphs ?",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"**Note** : I doubt that everything that I will expose here has been done by Oda explicitly , some things are surely simple coincidences . No need to be very smart to realize that the band seems to be based , among other things ( cuz you know , Oda loves to mix a lot of different things ) , in tribes of Central Asia : - During ages and until China was invaded by the manchus , in China , India and Europe the tribes of central asia were considered authentic beasts or demons : They moved like nomadic hordes , ravaging all its path . As an example , the Huns were considered sons of demons and witches . Quite possibly Oda has played with this and specially the fact that they are a band formed mainly by Zoan users . Also , a lot of members of this crew have horns . It was very common in Europe and China to represent the Huns and Mongols with horns , as if it were demons . However , the main point of connection between the theme of Central Asian tribes and the beasts pirates are at the moment , its known members : - **Kaido** : For his design , I think that it 's obvious that a lot of his traits are based on the classic look of the great Khans of the Mongol Empire , but mixed with the red Oni ( a japanese demon ) . He is consideres the `` world 's strongest creature '' , a curious fact that his main inspiration seems to be Genghis Khan , title of the first and most important Mongol emperor . At his peak , the Mongol empire stretched from Korea in the east to Hungary at the west , and from Mongolia in the north to the northern India in the south , so their rulers were the kings of the world 's biggest empire . The term *Genghis Khan* has two meanings : *Lord of all oceans* and *immovable / universal king* . One of the most famous phrases of Genghis was `` *The greatest joy for a man is to defeat his enemies* '' . Well , it seems that Kaido is no slouch in this regard *cough* Kid and Moriah *cough* . In turn , alcoholism was quite common among many Mongol rulers . On the other hand , his name resembles that of Kaidu , emperor of the Chagatai Khanate , a division of the Mongol Empire . It 's funny because during the time when Kaidu was a ruler there was a great war between the successor states of the Mongol Empire that led to Kaidu 's death after being wounded in battle . The fact that Kaido has occupied Wano is a clear reference to the two attempts of invasion that the emperor Kublai Khan did to Japan in 1274 and 1281 . Although it has nothing to do directly with the Mongols , Kaido has three trusted men , the three calamities . It 's funny because Oda recently began to see GOT and among the Dothraki there is a tradition of having 3 men trust known as bloodriders . Although the Dothraki are fictional , they are based on the nomadic tribes of central Asia , too . Let 's talk about the calamities . We only know **Jack** , whose name like in the case of Ace , Joker , Pica , Diamante , Trebol , Ginrummy etc is a pun on a card game . At the same time , shares its name with Calico Jack , a famous pirate of the XVIII century . - Jack was introduced by Sheepshead as `` the Drought '' and he said that if Jack is in a place all the land stays dry as if it had suffered a drought ... Too much coincidence : He 's based on another famous tribes who came from Central Asia , the Huns . More specifically in Attila . It was said that the grass did not grow where Attila had passed . His appearance seems closer to that of a viking . Even when this just does not means anything , Attila is an important part of some Scandinavian chronicles . - Again talking about the invasions of Kublai Khan to Japan , the attempt of Jack for bringing down Zunisha and his easy defeat is possibly a reference to the *kamikaze* , a typhoon that destroyed the entire Mongol fleet before they could get to step on Japanese soil . **A small side note** : Obviously we do n't have information about who are the other two calamities . However , if Oda continues the pattern of Central Asian tribes or just Asian emperors / generals , my bet is that one of the two remaining calamities will be based on Timur . He was the biggest conqueror of central Asia after Gengis Khan and he had his own epithet ( *the Lame* ) . Some people thinks that the other two calamities will be based on famous japanese samurais but I doubt it . This will be saved for Wano . Also , looks like the Shogun is not a calamity so he does not count .",Romance,Spanish

But what makes Sanji different to his brothers is that he can feel emotions and thus emphatize with them . He could even feel sorry for them . Maybe I 'm the only one that would want this to happen , but I think that it would be great if he could forgive them at the end of the arc so we could see them working together and Ichiji , Niji and Yonji recognizing that Sanji is strong enough to be respected .

At the time , India was under the gupta empire government , tho there was some other empires like the Pallava dynasty , the Kamarupa kingdom , Chalukya or the Kadamba dynasty .

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"Why Rob said a lot of times that the Live thing was dead and now it seems that he want it more than never ? Let me explain it point by point . First of all , I do n't think that Rob hates Pendulum but rather there 's a set of factors that have made that him ca n't feel comfortable when someone asks him about Pendulum and sometimes simply he let us see that he really does n't care about Pendulum just because he thinks that doing this these people will stop asking . It 's normal that when you 're working on a new project such as Knife Party , it will bother you that an amount of fans will ask you non stop about your previous projects and in their case they had to endure many fans asking again and again or saying things like `` Knife Party is shit , go back to Pendulum '' . I think that is the main reason . The second reason is that as has been said several times , lost interest in the project but I do not think he did it in his creative phase , that is , I do not think he lost interest in producing more music as Pendulum when he started the Knife Party project , but rather he wanted to try new things , just like Jon Gooch when he started Feed Me . He lost interest in Pendulum because the lives assumed a great economic cost and because pendulum started to become more `` Mainstream '' , considering that they acted in the same scenarios that well known bands and Pop artists at the same time that the expensive tours for Lives sometimes had to deal with a bland public ( See Glastonbury 2011 , although according to Rob there were more moments like that ) . So I think that Knife Party was clearly the most natural and logical path for him , because in the beginning he had a great interest in producing things that sounded too far of what Pendulum could have release , especially the first three EPs in which we can note that certainly they put a lot of effort into producing something interesting and though they say that Knife Party is not a serious project I think that was initially planned as something serious . Besides that Knife Party allowed them to earn more money thanks to the DJ sets and releasing music for a sector that grew as much as EDM . Until 2013 it is clear that they have enjoyed Knife Party , but the bubble burst : The Dubstep saturated soon and within the Electro House sound , they released his last interesting songs in Haunted House . From 2014 we saw that Rob was pretty tired of EDM , because he could not offer anything more to it and as he said `` it 's time to produce Drum & Bass '' and I was like `` after Abandon Ship came again the turn of Pendulum '' . For the album name and the lyrics of Begin Again I must say that I saw it as a clear statement that Pendulum was coming back and it was time to leave Knife Party and thus the EDM boat . This 2015 they have been virtually absent except for a very shitty and generic EP until they announced the Pendulum Live . This leaves me a very clear - perhaps too optimistic - idea but is what I think . I think that Rob and Gareth now are more interested in Pendulum that in Knife Party and this may be something that has been dragging on since Abandon Ship , because is likely they are not longer interested in Knife Party as a project ( this is why Rob said that he wanted to do a new project in the AMA ) but they have been unable to return because if they return to Pendulum - at least in the case of Rob - will be for Lives alone , and considering how expensive the Live are ( I 'm sure UMF has paid a lot of money ) they have decided do it in a big festival and in the perfect moment . Now they only are not going to lose money , they know that UMF is the perfect place to make a glorious return , and this is what Pendulum deserves . On the other hand , I think that when he said in the AMA that he was not interested in producing Drum & Bass , it was a lie because if they are not interested in Drum & Bass , why they are always playing Neurofunk at the end of the KP sets ? He said this because if he said that there was another album , the pend fans would not have stopped asking him about it . Finally , I remember two tweets that were deleted but that are interesting : First when Rob responded to a girl that the album would begin to be produced in September 2014 ( although maybe he deleted it because the Knife Party album took them too long and most certainly they were exhausted after it ) and the second when someone asked Gaz and he said something like `` We are with Knife Party for the moment until Pendulum is organized again . '' This tweet it also was deleted if I remember correctly and although maybe it was just a joke , might be the drunk Gaz ( it would not be unusual ) saying the truth . I do n't know if they are going to release a new album soon ( at least I do n't think that we are going to see it until the end of the year if they produce it ) but what is clear is that they will do it sooner or later , I think that everything depends on the response they have with the crowd and if they feel confortable , we will have as soon as possible , in fact I do n't think that will be weird if they include some demos on the Ultra Live . Well what are your theories ? P.S Sorry for my english , is not my mother tongue and btw I 'm drunk now so",Romance,Spanish

The only member that does not seem to fit into this definition is Jean Bart . Kidd Pirates : Kidd band is based on characters from dark carnival , goth and metal music . They have a sinister and dark theme , with a masked murderer ( Killer ) , a zombie ( Heat ) and a satanic priest ( Wire ) . There is a great number of similarities between Kid and Moriah .

2stepsfromglory,askseddit,"This is my first post here , but I 'm going to go full detail bc I really need help with this girl . Well , the past month I was in a bar with some friends , just drinkin as usual . At the other table there was a group of girls . That being said , two of my friends tried to talk with these girls , but before doing it they went outside a minute ( you know , smoking and other shit ) and I was alone for a couple of minutes . My friends know how I am : I 'm not a shy guy , but I do n't really talk to random girls bc I 'm very cold and selective , and there 's a great difference between me and my friends . They see girls like if they where meat or a trophy , while I see them as what they are : persons . That 's why for me , if a girl is just pretty but she 's dumb af I do n't really want to talk to her at all , and these girls seemed like that ( yeah I judge people without knowing them , I 'm a bad person you can hate me ) . But then , one of these girls turned and she invited me to a couple of drinks when I was alone . At the moment I saw her , I became stone . I was like hypnotized , I do n't know if it was just for how she looked at me but it was weird . My friends came and then they started talking with the friends of this girl . One of my friends was kinda jealous , and he said some bad things of me to her but she brushed him with his hand and kept talking to me . Then she took my phone and wrote his number ( I did n't asked it ) , and after this all his group went outside bc it was very late . So without doing anything ( just being myself and without wanting it ) I was sure I liked her . After that , I 've been talking to her for a month , and she said to me that I was a really special guy ( and not in a kind of LJBF way , she had said to me a lot of times that she does not have boyfriend without asking it ) . She has been really interested on me . I 've been with her and it 's the first girl that only with his presence makes me feel really special , adding to this how intelligent , funny and interesting she is . But then there 's something bad with this . It 's the first girl in my whole life that I think I really like and that 's the problem bc at this point I always do shit . Last week I was with her and we were like 15 seconds looking at each other just straight in the eyes and smiling like idiots . But I could n't do anything , It 's the first time that I 'm paralyzed with a girl and this is because I really like her . The whole thing was really good , she was happy and smiling all the time and tho I was kinda sad for my own fail not going to the next path I was like `` well , next day all will be done '' . It 's been a week and since this moment practically we have not spoken ( and that 's rare because when I do n't talk to her , she does ) . I 've tried to talk to her since then but I think that something is happening . basically I talked to her the wednesday and she said `` I 'm studying '' . Yeah , I can believe it bc I do it too but it 's weird because when she does it at least when it ends always talks to me for a while . On thursday she said that she had two exams the next day and we talked some more , so I thought she just not had time to talk to me and all was ok. Then this friday I asked her `` how the exams are going ? '' and seems like she 's avoiding me bc no one can still three days without saying at least one `` they 're going good '' but I 've saw her changing the profile picture so ... Normally this could have ended with me not giving a fuck but I REALLY like this girl . I 'm not desperate at all but for me it 's really difficult to find THAT girl . If you take 90 girls maybe of these 90 I will find interesting like 1 or 2 , while just one of these two will be more than interesting for me . And she is obviously this one . I do n't want to leave this ( at least without knowing if she does not want nothing more from me ) , but I am a very proud guy so I do n't want to ask her continually if something happens . Do I need to wait or I need to say something more ?",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I have a theory that the Kaido-shogun alliance has something to do with the black boats of Matthew Perry , so first of all , I 'm gon na explain it : Imagine that you are the governor of a country that has been closed to the rest of the world for practically 200 years and it starts to grow the discontent between citizens and some political and military . Then some very powerful foreigners come to your shores and threaten you to open the doors to trade . You do it , but it 's obvious an unequal treatment and you go terribly disadvantaged . This happened in Japan in 1853 , and this obvious lack of strength against the `` nanban '' was one of the causes of the fall of the shogunate . Kaido is a Yonko , one of the four pirate emperors of the new world . A country that is not into the world government has a great disadvantage in the new world , because the world government ca n't help you in front of these huge pirates . Then someone like Kaido can just reach Wano and sit on the throne . After all , it is a closed country and quite possibly **what happens in Wano , stays in Wano** , so if he is recruiting an army , obviously there 's no better place that a country with a closed door policy . No one will know what is he doing in there , or even maybe he wants to have some samurais in his army . However , it is sure that Kaido know that the samurais are proud warriors and that they would not accept a `` foreign devil '' being their direct ruler , so he preferred to be allied to the Shogun . In truth , I believe that more than a ally , the Shogun is a puppet for him , something like an intermediary between him and the samurais . This Shogun obviously does have some Daimyos against him , So he needs Kaido to maintain the order in his own country . It is a symbiotic relationship in which however , Kaido wins . I believe too that the beasts pirates are really annoying to the looks of the Wano citizens ( holy fuck , they are called `` beasts '' for something ) : Drinking , breaking things and causing continuous fights . So , you have the conflict here , a Shogun who leaves a bunch of annoying pirates do what they want , while defend him in case there is a revolt of samurais . Btw , obviously he wants someone who could read poneglyphs and Wano is the country of the family who invented them . tl ; dr : Kaido has his entire zoan army in Wano bc the world government has no way to get information of what happens there , he wants the samurais joining his army bc he know how strong they are so he needs the Shogun to control them and he is wanting for someone to read the red poneglyph he has . The Shogun uses the fear that the citizens have for Kaido to maintain control of the country in a safer way .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,oddworld,"Tho I love every place in the games , these are my two favourites . Stockyards / Free Fire Zone : Every Time I arrive at this part of the game gives me some weird feeling similar to what I have every friday when arriving at home at the afternoon , then realizing I need to do loads of things before being entirely free . The stockyards are like this part of your town that you do n't like to visit , because it is practically abandoned . The first `` enclosures '' of scrabs have some orange / yellow lights coming from the factory himself , and it 's kind of depressing if we mix this with the shadows of the scrabs . The gates are rusted and it shows that no one had review them in a long time . As further you go from the factory , most obvious is that Glukkons have little interest in the creatures used as merchandise : The cages are more broken and you can see how quickly the limits of the factory end between a huge sterile rocks . The huge smell of dead animals goes off , the two or three pesky flies that were annoying you in the stockyards disappear . Then a intense cold goes through your body , a feeling of moisture that gets into your bones . You are in the Free Fire Zone . Always I play this part of the game , I imagine that this place was , long ago , a little village of some Mudokons seing all the wood elements in there ( bridges specially ) , but they were killed long ago . The skies are clean of pollution , but years of deforestation and hunting have turned these lands into barren fields . On the other hand I also imagine that the area in which Abe passed are a group of hills crowned by sharp peaks of black rocks . In the NNT conceptual art it shows something that seems long fields with dead trees . I think that these are the lands that lie just beneath these hills , and were once large savannas . ( Note : Of the three versions of the stockyards , my favourite is the original from Oddysee , because it has this old , abandoned and depressive look . Btw , I like more the old motion sensors that looks like Glukkon heads , they give a sense of authority . I like some things from the New N Tasty version tho , specially the orange lights on the floor and the end , when you can see the true contrast between the Stockyards and the Free Fire Zone . The Nowtun 's version has some great additions by adding the feeling that the stockyards are separated by nodes that are much more extensive than what we see in the original games ) . Slig Barracks : Polluted and desert , I do n't know why but I believe it has a strong smell of dirty water . I imagine it as a place where it is not hard to go unnoticed , because you just have to hide among the huge number of bags of artillery around you . A place in which it is easier to fall into the void to be fired . It 's like a cross between a giant landfill and a post-apocalyptic land after a great war in a retro-futuristic world . I love the looks it has , and the green / yellow lights gives this place a cold and distinctive atmosphere . So ... what is your favourite Oddworld place and why ?",Romance,Spanish

Seeing all this amount of characters being allies of the SH , I start to think about the role of Kid in all of this . In Sabaody and the new world , he was like the Kurgan from the Highlander . He kills everyone who gets in his path and does not receive orders from anyone . So , I always thought that he was going to have a paralel history aside of Luffy , doing his own thing .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"A lot of people is talking a lot about Kaido and the beast pirates but seems like no one has a great interest in Big Mom . Some people figure that she is the weakest of the Yonkos while we do n't have any proof of this and even if she is the weakest , she is the fourth stronger pirate of the world . What we know about her is that she has a huge obsession for candies , she controls a lot of islands and extorts their citizens : If they do not offer a monthly amount of candy , she does not only stops to protect these islands but also she will destroy them . In fact , she does not even have to do it personally , and if her crew members can destroy countries , it 's obvious that she can do it too . Even more easily . We 've seen that she is a huge monster and she ate some of his crew members . She algo has some kind of corrosive saliva . Some people says that this is some kind of DF . But after all of this , I believe that the interesting thing about Big Mom is her theme . If the theme of Kaido is a mixture of the animal brutality and the mongol mythology ( the strongest creature on earth , the beast pirates , his army of zoan users , he is enemy of minks and samurais and has a Gengis Khan look ... ) , Big Mom theme is the mafias . She acts like the leader of the italian mafia , her epithet also sounds like it ... also , the whole thing about the alliance with the Vinsmoke ( a family of assassins ) and his family concept really looks like the one in the mafia films . She has members of her crew working in the underworld ( Tamago , Pekoms ... ) and Capone Bege ( a character obviously based on Al Capone ) is working for her . This is why , without doubt , I 'm even more hyped about BM that with Kaido . With the BM arc we are going to see not just fights with a Yonko , mafias and assassins , we are going to learn more about the underworld . And I believe that in this arc we will see some of these characters of the new world that we know that had to appear again : Crocodile , Mr. 1 , Moriah , Bartolomeo ( his crew was part of a mafia before they were pirates ) , Jinbe , Caesar ( both are related to BM ) and maybe Bonney ... Btw , if the girl with three eyes is Purin , seeing how she looked kind of sad I hope this ends with her being an ally . What I 'm saying with this is ... BM arc will be epic and I believe it will have a lot of information about how things go in the new world .",Romance,Spanish

It can be very possible that they were growing to a pre-industrial life style , seing how they were the best in a lot of things they could n't be living as a stone age type of civilizations for such a long time . I think that this could have been possible in the way that at the first time Glukkons and Mudokons worked together just before they were slaved .

Victoria fits with the fact that it 's a period that they 've never touched before ( if we do n't count FotS ) and it could add a lot of new content and mechanics for the campaign , including trains like FotS did . If they do this game , it needs to be a map of the whole world , or at least Europe , Africa , Asia and north america . It would be then the biggest map they 've done to date , also it would add greater naval battles since it was the time of the pre-dreadnought battleships and there would be a huge diversity of factions . Diplomacy and politics should be more important that in the previous games and religion should become something important again . It could even add some different campaigns like the american civil war , the crimean wars , the opium wars ... - XVI / XVII century : That also could be a good option since it could be a like a mixture of Medieval 2 and Empire , adding the wars of religion in Europe like the 30 years war or the conquest of america as a subcampaigns . - China : I loved Shogun 2 because it was refreshing after a lot of games about Europe . China has had a lot of periods of war but the period of the three kingdoms it 's no doubt the best one for a game , and since China has more diversity in cultures and religions than Japan it 's sure that it will have more diversity between factions . There 's a problem with the chinese government about games that talk about their history so I do n't know if this could be done tho - Bronze era : I do n't want this one tbf , it would be like what RotS was to the Shogun 2 campaign but with Rome 2 .

It would be like shogun , not much unit variation That 's not enterely true tho . A game about China should definitely be way more diverse than Shogun in both factions and units . China is not like Japan , there 's a lot of ethnicities and the country is as much diverse as you can imagine : plains , deserts , mountains , rainforests ... so the way of understand how war works was way different depending on the province . Depending on how huge could be the map , you can add the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria , plus Corea . With this I 'm just saying that I 'd love something out of the eurocentric formula we 've had with the other games .

Also , they are not a main threat anymore since the story right now seems to move into the next level ( the emperors ) , and also all seems to root to their abolition since it 's been proven numerous times that the shichibukai are not stable enough : Jinbe helped an emperor , Moriah was too weak to hold the title , Law and Teach only held the title until it stopped being from utility to them , Crocodile tried to own an ancient weapon and Doffy tried to mass murder the population of a country .

It has been stated that awakened zoans gives the users the hability to recover rapidly even after suffering high amounts of damage .

Well , it felt kinda odd that the Jailer Beasts had their devil fruits awakened . They were n't that strong to begin with , and after the timeskip there was even a new member ( which felt odd , specially since he is also a zoan user ) so my headcanon is that they can also be awakened artificially , and Vegapunk knows how to do it . Smoker has been shown to be way behind Luffy , so to catch up and since he 's going to see Vegapunk , it would n't be weird that his next power up would be an artificial awakening .

I 'm just speculating here but it would n't be weird that his personality switched back then , so Hakuba was born and then he was exiled or maybe he fled by himself . Second , we have a bit of extra information about the giant warrior pirates . It seems like after a time , the captains leave their title to the next generation , thus the oldest captains become some kind of respected elders for the tribe of the giants . ~~That 's really interesting , because this is the first pirate crew that seems to be inherited from one generation to another~~ . Also it seems like there 's always two captains at the same time . If Hajrudin 's dream comes true , he will be the first one to be captain in solitary unless we meet someone else in Elbaf . Another thing that I find interesting in Big Mom 's backstory is that at the beginning of this arc it was stated that she wanted the formula of giantification so all her sons could be at the same height that her when they were eating . It felt like a flat excuse just to have a full on army of giants , but now I think that it either could be part of her dream . I mean , this chapter talks us about the fact that she felt happy that everything around her was of her own size . Edit : I forgot about both the Kuja pirates and the Happo Navy , my bad .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"& gt ; The white Horse represents conquest , not victory The white horse has different interpretations . One of these is that he represents the victory of christianity over the pagans and the fact that the white horse represents the right path . Also , the order is correct if you take into account that Blackbeard was n't a Yonko until he fought against Marco during the timeskip . Shanks was the first that we meet since he was already an emperor , also he was also the first to show up after Whitebeard 's death . Kaido was presented to us in chapter 795 while Big Mom got his introduction in the current arc , even if we saw her silhouette in Fishman Island .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"& gt ; The white horse representing the victory of Christianity was a creation of one mans interpretation in the second century . You could even call it his personal `` head canon '' . True , yet is was the main interpretation given by the roman theologists then and that interpretation survived to our days . Sure , originally the white horse was a representation of the romans since they conquered Palestine but that does n't mean that the other interpretations are wrong since we 're talking about a religion that has splitted a lot in different creeds since it was born . Luther and Calvin diverged from the point of view of the catholic dogma , same happened with orthodox , the coptic church or the ones that followed the arrianism . Religion is always opened to interpretations , and that 's why it has split so much over the centuries . Hell , do n't forget that christianism originally splitted from juddaism . But anyways , if we take into account the fact that the white horseman 's main representation was conquest like you aptly said , Shanks still fits with the concept : 1 - He 's known to have conquered the new world since he was part of Roger 's crew . 2 - He 's been shown to be the strongest user of Conqueror 's Haki till now . & gt ; You 're also wrong about big mom being introduced in the current arc .

Not all the pirates that were in the Marineford war were part of his crew , loads of them were just allies . After WB died , surely a lot of his allies changed sides for convenience or necessity . The sun pirates passed to be underlings of Big Mom btw , and maybe some WB pirates moved to Shanks territories or formed their own separated crews . Without WB , loads of these allies were unprotected . Big Mom , Kaido , the supernovas and the Marine surely killed a lot of the little pirate crews that were allies of WB or that protected his islands . I believe that the war was just between the WB most important members and maybe some loyal allies , and we need to see that BB crew is not just a group of criminals . BB can rekt all the DF users of the WB crew now . This without counting his crew members .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Capone Bege : Although he is an ally of Big Mom , I think it all boils down that the theme of Big Mom are mafias , assassins and the underworld in general , something she has in common with Bege . I think that although he may not be considered an ally ( and indeed is a declared enemy ) , is a character who probably is only allied with Big Mom for interest . Its aim is surely control the underworld and therefore I think the most likely be an enemy in the arc with Big Mom . At the same time , I hope we can see some kind of confrontation between him and Crocodile , since both characters have the same theme of the mafias and it would be interesting to see a fight between two characters that are so cold and calculating like these two . Or even that they became allies . X Drake : Given that he has changed sides between the Marine and pirates and that seems like a pretty honorable character , I think it 's the only one who does not intend to betray the Yonko who he 's working with , I even hope he is one of the two other calamities . He just wants to fuck the world government as much as possible , so it is understandable that joins the most destructive Yonko . I predict that when Kaido is defeated , perhaps he will join the revolutionaries . Jewelry Bonney : I never understood his true motivations but I see quite possible that she will have a recurring role in the arc with Big Mom . Not only because I think it 's his daughter , but because it 's the only woman of the supernovas . In addition , I see many parallels between these two : Both have an insatiable appetite , the same colour of hair , similar lips and a cake-shaped ship . However , I think it will be an ally , especially because we saw her crying when Whitebeard died . Kid : I think it 's the supernova that we should really pay more attention , considering that arises as the main enemy of Luffy of the worst generation . After all , he intended to dethrone the only Yonko that Luffy admires , and even if I 'm honest , I 'd like to see it happening . Would be too absurd that Luffy and his allies defeated a Yonko and the other characters were not able to . I think the alliance with Hawkins and Apoo is now allied with Kaido , or at least Kaido decided to ignore them considering that they intend to deal with Shanks , who ultimately is his enemy . Killer : The Kid 's Zoro is perhaps too mysterious from my point of view . He is intelligent and calm but at the same time , a fierce murderer . I think it has something to do with the Vinsmoke and I would like to see more of him besides him being part of Kid 's crew , maybe in the arc of Big Mom . After all , both Kid and Killer have contacts in the underworld . Basil Hawkins : I do not understand very well the need of allying with Kid and Apoo , especially considering that he conquered Foodvalten . But after all , I think it 's a very interesting character who will show his full streght in a possible arc with Shanks . Scratchmen Apoo : I must say that is the supernova that interested me the less , but I think it will act as a mix between Usopp and Brook in this alliance between the three bands . I guess that will be the enemy of Brook if the two alliances fight each other . Urouge : I think its function is completely neutral and that perhaps was introduced to face some character from heaven . Given that their wings are similar to that of the Birkans and his band is called `` pirates of the fallen monk '' I think it has something to do with the destruction of Birka . Does this mean that we may see Enel again or something that has to do with him ? I hope so . Otherwise , I do not see Urouge will intervene in the events of the new world in a great way . maybe even we are going to learn what is the other way to arrive to the sky islands .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"For me each of the three albums is special in some way but Immersion is Pendulum at its finest . In Silico was a test and as they often say , they suffered something of an identity crisis . Immersion is a mixture of what they learned on In Silico and Hold Your Colour with new sounds and influences . I agree that the album tells a story about love , depression and death . But I do n't think all the songs follow the same line or have to be connected together . Watercolour : For me it was always a song about a person who is suffering from depression and people around him notice it , he need help . Crush : Perhaps the song with a greater number of interpretations . For some it 's about a jealous or possessive man who killed his girlfriend , for others he is a man in love with a woman who ignores him ... Based on the lyrics and the video , I think it 's either the first option or a man who did much damage to a girl , she committed suicide and he tried to justify erroneously that she flirts with other men when in truth she was just kind with everyone . Under The Waves : Someone who ends surpassed by the bad events of his life despite fighting all the time . The Island : for me this song is about two people who just met and they feel some attraction between them . However , this does not go beyond something casual and although one of them start to feel something for the other , everything ends in nothing . Witchcraft : It 's about domestic violence . Self vs Self : The struggle between good and evil in a person after having lost everything . The Fountain : Someone who feels that nothing is enough for him , nothing satisfies him and lives in a state in which he feels extremely lonely despite being loved or with lots of people in his life . In other words , he does not feel himself complete . Encoder : Rob said that this one was about dealing about the loss of a friend , but for me it 's about the last moments of a relationship in which one part begins to realize that the other does not feel the same and although at first tries to fix it , later discovers that instead of suffering it 's better to let go . The title of the album I think that refers to being `` immersed '' in bad feelings ( loneliness , sadness , depression ... ) . When you 're passing from one of those feelings , it 's like you 're drowning . Indeed at the end of Encoder , you can hear some waves and someone walking between them , as if he has managed to stay afloat , it 's like all the bad feelings are gone .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"Well , it depends . In my case , I liked KP from 2011 - 2013 . Then it started to be a generic EDM act that I did n't liked at all .

KP it 's different , it was planned to be a non serious project , at least this is what they have been saying recently . And I do n't like when a talented producer goes to the easy path , doing generic music like their last EP or some songs of their album .

Some went full mainstream ( Ti√´sto , Sander van Doorn , W & amp ; W , Ummet Ozcan , etc ) , others went to the cheesy path ( Dash Berlin , Tritonal ) and others moved to new sounds with trance and EDM elements ( A & amp ; B ) . In Armin 's case is different . He really likes Trance , and at the same time he knows that he ca n't switch bc is what makes him big . I mean , the day that Armin leaves the Trance scene , his career will be literally dead . IMO , Trance is what makes Armin big , not vice versa ( at least since Intense ) . At the same time , he is a really important figure in the Trance scene because he helps a lot of producers of different subgenres , from progressive to uplifting and from trouse to tech trance . Thanks to him a lot of `` non trancers '' starts to look at the genre . As a DJ/Producer , he goes to Big Room and crappy pop house bc he needs to draw the attention of mainstream audiences . In current times , trying to separate yourself from the rest in most cases does not end well . Most of the public are like sheeps , music interests them very little , they go for what they think it 's the new trend . That 's why Armin mixes shit in festivals .

I believe that we are going to see a mixture of Sengoku Jidai / Tokugawa Bakufu period and the Meiji ishin , with the Kozuki clan taking down the Shogun like the emperor Meiji did ( Meiji Ishin ) with a huge war between clans ( Sengoku Jidai ) . In this context , I see Kaido pirates like the Mongol Empire , being Kaido some sort of Genghis Khan . He looks kinda like the old drawings depicting the Mongols and the Hun tribes as Oriental demons or `` beasts '' . Btw , Jack was introduced with a very similar quote of what people said about Atila in the last days of the Roman empire .

2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,I read that info about the Venom movie a couple of months ago . Are you sure that they scrapped it ? I believe that if it 's not scrapped there will be one of these two possibilities : 1 - It 's a film kind of what Fox does with the Fantastic Four . Just for not to lose the rights on the character . 2 - It 's canon with the rest of the MCU movies even if it 's a Sony film in a similar way that the Tom Holland Spidey will be under the MCU but with Sony involved .,Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,trance,"Btw , this is what Eco said about why the album has been delayed for so long : '' I know a lot of people will be disillusioned by how long you have waited for this album and maybe moreso now , realizing there is still 6 months to go ; I fully understand . There are many reasons it has been delayed , many reasons it has taken so long to produce this record , so I feel the need to explain to my biggest fans why . Understand that I am not a full-time musician . I think that may be one of the biggest reasons you love my music ; but it 's also the biggest reason my music has taken so long to get out to you . I made a choice a long time ago ( even before `` M ( you ) sic '' was released ) to be a working man , to not fall into the trap of becoming a full-time trance producer ; to not do it as a `` job '' . It is not some magical coincidence that many of the artists you used to love have made that leap , and then felt the pressures to change their sound into something that could sell ; something that could pay their bills and put food on the table and keep their lights and plumbing on . It is not some magical coincidence that the pressures of the music world turned their music and live performances toward styles that you no longer enjoy , styles that make more money , money they need to survive . I made the decision to avoid that , and that decision is what has fueled me in making music that my fans continue to enjoy , music that has its roots fully embedded into the styles I produced before , styles you enjoyed from the start . That decision also means I go to work Monday-through-Friday , put in 10-11 hours in at an office , and go home . I go home tired like everyone else in the office world . Most people go home , microwave their dinner , watch TV all night or play video games ; but I do my best to find rejuvenation in writing the music , mostly , writing the music that you will hear in this album . I sit there , writing music until 2-3AM , sometimes 4AM . I get 2 hours of sleep , many times do n't even eat dinner , and then I go back into work the next morning ; like you . I do n't mean this as a complaint ; quite the opposite , it makes me unbelievably happy . I find a certain zen in not feeling the endless stress and pressure in NEEDING my music to pay my bills every month . That kind of pressure would have made me go the EDM route lightning-fast , like many many of my peers . Like the first cavemen who produced nature-inspired cave drawings , I go out everyday to hunt for my food , and I come back every night to produce my art in the comfort of my home ; doing it to please no one but myself . I would n't have it any other way . So days turn to weeks turn to months turn to years . Target dates I set out to meet previously go unmet , but my life goes on , and so does yours . It may seem like I 've been creating an endless hype train for the release of these songs , and while that may have happened , it was not my chief intention . As months turned to years , my intention became to put out the best product that I possibly could . If estimates and promises ( about completion dates/ranges ) were broken , that 's because I felt that the art needed more work and more attention ; more sleepless nights , more tired days at work , more weekends saying `` no '' to friends asking to hang out . If you think the wait was annoyingly hard for you , imagine how hard the process has been for me . Hard , but worth it . And then when it 's almost done , the daunting AND LONG task of finding the right label with the right vision and the right resources begins . An agreement is made , and even then the album can not be released right away . Singles , music videos , press , etc. , need to be planned out . These are the realities of the process . Some people will download for free off torrents or whatever , give it a 15 minute listen and say they `` do n't really like '' my 4 years-worth of work . That 's fine , it happens . But I hope all those years of work will inspire even just some of you and be an album you remember for the rest of your lives . When the album comes out in 6 months , I promise you it will all be worth it . ''",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,"the connection between the different characters and the way how their stories become more and more bigger . From the problems of Iron Man with terrorists in the very beggining of phase 1 to wars in space in phase 2 , it happened in a good pace . It not looked forced . Btw , for Marvel is easier to explore more superheroes in films bc they are more versatile . I do n't know how to explain it , but a lot of DC characters are really boring . I was absolutely disappointed when I saw that j'onn j'onzz was not going to be part on the Justice League film . Other problem they have is how they compressed all the DC universe in a very few number of films . This is something that they are going to regret in the future . But on the other hand , there are things on the DC films that I want in the Marvel Universe . First of all , a more darker essence . I like light films like Ant Man for example , but the continuous dose of humor I think is increasingly absurd . I mean , a film like CA2 or just a little bit darker could be great , specially for the more important characters . Other thing I like from DC is how they really do a great work with the villains . Malekith , Ronan , The Mandarin , Ultron , Darren Cross ... all of them were not interestings at all , even when in a great part of their films they were something interesting .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,"In truth , I 'm talking about phase 3 . I want Infinity War to be something less comic , I mean the humor is necessary and it worked well in Avengers but in AoU it was continuous and killed the vibe of danger that Ultron had at the very beginning of the film . I agree in that there is some characters that NEEDS to be funny , especially when we are talking about less known heroes , like Ant Man . When I saw the film I do really liked it though my expectations were very low with the trailer . I do like the relationship between Iron Man and the Cap , but for the phase 3 I really expect it to be a little more serious that the other two , except for just 3 films that will be more lighter .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,totalwar,"I do agree about the diplomacy and I need to include how agents and generals do have new settings and how you can upgrade them , it 's something really interesting . For the rest tho , I think that M2 was better . It has a more versatile amount of units for every faction , more cultures and a content much more varied in the sense that rotates between religion , conquer territories , control trade and create alliances . The things I did n't liked about the game was the lack of a greater map , specially for the middle east and the lack of factions ( I miss really important states of the Medieval Europe like Aragon , Ireland , Kiev , Wales , Norway , Sweden , Genoa , Lithuania ... ) and how unbalanced they were , I do hate how shitty Novgorod or the HRE are in the vanilla . Apart of this it could have been great to have every woman of your family to be a princess so you can use it for alliances , but all of these things were fixed in the mods so the game is the best one of the TW franchise imo .",Romance,Spanish

For Gaia 's case is different , is not that he needs benno because he ca n't do a Gaia track alone , in truth is more like Gaia is both of them . 4 Elements was a track made just by him and everyone knew that it was his alias . Years later with Tuvan , Armin and Benno made the track as a collaboration , you can see how the track is just called Gaia . A lot of people understood that it was just Armin and it received a very huge response , but Gaia is and it will be since 2009 a collaboration between both of them , and you can really hear the Rank 1 vibes in some tracks . Years later they added the `` avb pres . gaia '' thing just to reach more people , specially now that Trance is not that big how it was in the past .",Romance,Spanish

Maybe now we will see X Drake taking his place .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,"Nah , it has set up . The problem was that it had a lot of filler that killed the pace of the film ( the Banner-Natasha thing , Hawkeye 's family , a lot of scenes of them rescuing citizens ... ) and that Ultron was a very untapped villain . I mean the truly plot was about them trying to stop a city falling from the sky . Ultron was absolutely weak and it had too much comic moments , even Loki seemed more stronger than him when Loki is more like an intelligent and calculator villain .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,"& gt ; the movies that marvel really wanted them to be successful like GOTG . with a laterally middle finger giving to audience the movie was accepted by the studio and James Gunn humor was well handled and treated that it melded beautifully in the movie That was because no one knew GOTG and they needed to introduce them . IMO the film had some good scenes but the amount of cliches , jokes and the anticlimactic ending made this film the one I less like tho I am a great fan of the GOTG comics . And well , all depends of the film . I do think that every film needs to have a different pace , otherwise it could have been absolutely boring . I mean , for Ant Man you can see how the whole movie is based in the premise of thieves with a great number of jokes and it absolutely works . Why ? Because it 's Ant Man . A superhero that can change his size . For a solo film about him , it really worked . For TWS they wanted to reveal the darker side of the MCU but without being excessively dark , it was on point . Most of the films of phase 2 were just preparations for the Phase 3 or development of some characters . That 's why Iron Man 3 , Thor 2 , GOTG ( just in my opinion ) or even some parts of AOU seemed so unbalanced or with too much fillers . Because technically , phase 2 is the filler of the MCU . The good things are coming now . Civil War will be at the same level of TWS at least and with Dr . Strange seems like we are going to have a more mystical film .",Romance,Spanish

The best ones actually are Aly & amp ; Fila , Darren Porter , Will Atkinson ( tho he produces Tech Trance too ) and Cold Blue . Above & amp ; Beyond or Andy Blueman were so fucking good but A & amp ; B moved to a more EDM sound and Andy moved to orchestal music though he has released some trance tracks this year . Search labels like FSOE , Blue Soho , Monster Tunes and his sublabels Monster Force and Monster Pure , Who 's Afraid Of 138 ? ! and all the stuff from Anjunabeats before 2010 or from A State Of Trance before 2012 .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,knifeparty,mmm though I like the track I 'm not interested in Prydz music anymore since he sellout so I just want Breathe .,Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,knifeparty,"I 've been following Prydz for years , and I have practically all what he has released under the names of Eric Prydz , Pryda and Cirez D since 2003 . But he 's not relevant now , just like deadmau5 . Their time passed , accept it . 2015 was a year of him releasing such a boring songs like Opus or all the Pryda 10 compilation , and this is something that seems to happen now this year again , just look at the album tracklist and there 's nothing really relevant in his career here . I 'm a great lover of the true Progressive House , but Prydz is not a reference anymore and I ' more interested in producers like Andre Sobota , Gai Barone , Fehrplay , Grum , Jeremy Olander , Philthy Chit or Tinlicker . I will respect him for all what he has done in the past but I 'm not interested anymore into him as a producer . As a DJ he 's still being good .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,knifeparty,"Pryda 10 is mediocre , especially the last EP of the 3 he released . Is just like buildups of seven minutes that do n't go anywhere . I like progressive music without drops more than music with them , but not when it 's just an infinite and boring loop ( and that being said for someone who is a HUGE fan of techno and psy-trance ) . I agree with you about KP , for me their peak was Rage Valley and their glory period was between the first and the third EP , but you need to understand that KP does n't exist to be such a thing , it 's an EDM act that they have called alot of times that they do n't take too seriously .",Romance,Spanish

They need to make us believe that it will be one show and no more so it will look more exclusive , but I believe that it 's obvious that they are going to perform more that one show . think that if they say that they will be playing in UK for example , a lot of people in Europe would think `` well , then I do n't need to go to Miami '' and they obviously do n't want this .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think that Luffy is going to see Shanks at least two times in the new world . Remember that Shanks surely knows where is Raftel so maybe he will be an ally at the first time and then he will fight with Luffy as a kind of last obstacle to become the Pirate King . Something like if Shanks says `` If you ca n't beat me , you ca n't be the pirate king '' . Kurohige maybe will fight with him before , bc he said in Marineford `` I 'm not ready to fight him ... at the moment '' . But this gives my theory of Kid dethroning Shanks less value , after all Kurohige was planned to be that kind of character that we all need to hate , and if he kills Shanks there will be more hate for him after all . So I do n't really know what will happen to Shanks , but I 'm sure that he will be the last of the Pre-Marineford Yonkos that we will see fighting . I think that he has no real interest in Kaido 's / Big Mom actions , and his territory it 's obviously more close to the end of the new world that the territories of the other two .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"You get confused about several things . For starters , there is no racism against moroccans , that 's a medieval topic because in the Middle Ages the arabs conquered 3/4 of the Iberian peninsula after the christian reconquest is evident that muslims became second-class citizens like christians were second-class citizens when they were under the control of the arabs . The arabs brought a lot of innovations to the Spanish culture , especially in the field of medicine , philosophy , art , architecture and agriculture . There is no real racism , although there are racist people everywhere . Dressrosa has nothing to do with this , but it is based on the dictatorship of Franco . Doflamingo and their officials are like Franco and the bando nacional , while the king Riku represents the second republic . the toys represents the defeated republicans . Dressrosa is based in a mixture of the typical Andalusian folklore ( a lot of people thinks it 's the typical spanish culture , like flamenco and the colosseum that in truth it feels like a bullring ) with some buildings that are more like the ones from Barcelona ( and all the Gaudi style ) .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,seduction,"For me eye contact is one of the most important things , bc is how we express how we are and what are our intentions without words . Eye contact it 's something personal that we do n't do the same way to a friend or someone which we are interested of . I usually look at her eyes all the time while she 's talking . That gives you the impression that you 're interested in her but at the same time that you 're listening to what she 's saying . This avoids the feeling of the `` guy that just wants sex '' ( believe me , a girl can feel this just as the way you look at her ) . You need to look at her eyes like they are an artwork , but without looking like a wasted dude . If she can do the same or she avoids it but smiles , then it 's a good sign . It means that she 's interested too , but maybe she 's shy . Never look at loads of directions . That gives you an impression of insecurity that it 's not going to help you . If all of this does not work for you , just think what would Jesus do .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,trance,"For me it 's not about what it 's more hard to do or not . It 's more like what sounds more emotional or original in other way . What I was trying to say is that loads of structures from the Anjunabeats releases are pretty similar and that make them boring , because it stands in a point that they want to do a banger with a good melody and it sounds kinda forced . I 'm not talking about Grum for example , he 's a Progressive House producer so I do n't count him . I 'm talking about S8 & amp ; T , Genix , Fatum , some Sunny Lax songs , Bayer when he does clubby songs ... I do n't really see any feeling in loads of recent tracks of them . For Bluestone , I do have Sinai and Big Ben . The rest he has done has exactly the same drop ( yeah , it 's kind of his signature sound but come on you ca n't change the drop between different songs ? just look at All These Wounds and you will see ) so I 'm not a fan of him anymore . Less with him tweeting `` Trance '' all the time and doing such a pretty predictable songs . I 've been following this label for a lot of time and it has lost quality . It 's not that I hate electro sounds mixed with trance melodies ( I 'm a great fan of some old Heatbeat songs ) , it 's that for me Anjunabeats had stuck in the same thing for 3 years and has sold themselves to be part of the EDM ship , like Armin has done ( maybe not that hard but they have done it anyways ) , and it hurt that every release was pretty similar . I do n't count Anjunadeep because it 's a completely different thing , made for the Progressive / Deep House releases . From Boom Jinx and Super8 & amp ; Tab , I 've listened their last albums and they were bland for me . My though is that A & amp ; B are actually like Eric Prydz . They have more popularity than never but their music is not as good in quality as it was in the past , the thing is ... I 'm not the only one who feels like this . And after all , you ca n't deny that some of the tracks they have made for WAAWN are radio friendly . I do n't really see Satellite or Miracle being radio friendly songs . Yeah , they have a Radio Mix but both are pure OceanLab . Good vocal songs with a pure trance sound , the other ones are absolutely radio friendly . Maybe for promotion at the rest of the album but they are . For Atkinson ... my thoughts are that we do n't really know what he can do . I 've heard a lot of IDs of him that are absolutely mind blowing from his Atkinson name and his Josep and Darkboy monikers .",Romance,Spanish

A thing I 've learned about text is : Do n't be too much talkative . Use phone just for date her and talk to her in person . As much as you talk to her every time to get her attention , she will loose all the interest . A lot of guys do this , and it does not work because it 's like being too much needy and girls hate that shit . I do n't really know all the thing but the best you can do is leave it . Anyway , how I 'm passing for something similar as you I know how do you feel . It 's like `` if all was good how the fuck I failed ? '' . But it 's all in your brain . So , something into me needs to say this : If you REALLY like her leave it for a time ( a couple of weeks ) . Do n't be annoying , go for other ones or just concentrate on yourself . In that time you will really know if you like it . If after this time you try again and she does n't pay attention to you , leave it definitely .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"Switching A.I . ( seems like we have a different opinion of it ) , you ca n't say that Anjuna is still an excellent label . Just listen to the last 2/3 years of this label . They have been releasing the same kind of tracks over and over again or even switching to Big Room ( yes , this is big room with a good break , but still being big room https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Xfxkrhsg1kg ) The 90 % of the releases taged as Trance in Anjuna sound pretty similar : You have a kind o Electro intro , then comes a drop , then comes a piano break , then the same electro drop again ( This being a perfect example https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=YLmu-IhmHgM ) . So what 's the difference between this an the Uplifting being the same ( intro - long piano break - explosion - outro , all with the same basslines ) ? . For you Atkinson is repetitive ? I could agree in alot of trance producers doing the same over and over again , specially in the Uplifting subgenre ( which I 'm really tired of ) . But Atkinson is one of the few that is still being original and interesting even doing Uplifting / Tech Trance / Prog Psy lol By the way , I did n't said that A & amp ; B did not produce their own tracks . They have been doing music since 16 years ago , not even talking about their solo projects which are from the late 90 's . What I say is that since GT they NEED Andrew Bayer to work with them , and that being said , all what A & amp ; B does is follow what Bayer does in his solo work . Bayer did in 2013 some songs like England , Perth , Mirth Mobile etc and then A & amp ; B did Hello / Mariana Trench , which sounds pretty similar . These Electro / Progressive estructures mixed with Progressive Trance breaks are Bayer 's imprint sound in his solo releases since then , A & amp ; B just are following his style . Why ? Because Bayer does a great part of the work . I 'm with you that Bayer can be fucking epic when he wants ( his albums speak for him ) , but alot of his `` club work '' seems pretty banger-ish and repetitive . And yeah , I called them boring because they are . Armin is boring too when he does shitty Trouse and he has connected with a lot of people over the years , I ca n't really figure how much people did started listening to trance or just electronic music thanks to Armin . Or fuck , what about Ti√´sto ? Of course they have gone Mainstream . Not even in the way Ti√´sto or W & amp ; W did , but they definitely have gone to a more radio-friendly sound . In truth you said that I 'm not hearing them getting played on the radio but this is not truth at all , bc Blue Sky Action has been played LOADS of times in the radio and i 'm not talking about the States . I 'm from Spain , a country that does not pay ANY attention to electronic music if it 's not Martin Garrix or Hardwell . And I did hear it just after Sun Is Shining on the radio . Loads of times . That being said , I respect different tastes . What pisses me is that some people ca n't see that some of their favourite artists are humans and ca n't be on the top forever . I accepted it long ago with loads of artists I loved which began to be less and less creatives .",Romance,Spanish

The 90 % of the Anjunabeats catalog the last three years has been boring af , the same prog trance melodies w/ trousy drops . Same with their releases .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"ASOT has being good for years and years and I 've been listening to it for a long time , but as much people knows it has changed to just a radio show that brings the usual Armada catalog . It 's not about finding new talents , is about the same artists over and over again . Years ago the first hour was interesting progressive stuff and the second one hard straight Trance , now tho it has the same formula has changed way more with the first hours usually being a mixture of Prog house / Trouse . I need to be clear that I do n't listen to ASOT anymore but just because I was kinda tired that just 5 or 6 songs of the whole 2 hours were really interesting ( not just good ) , and the last episode I really LOVED was 666 . ABGT for me was good in the beginning but I do n't really like it . Not because I think it 's bad , just because it 's the same way ASOT does with Armada but with the Anjunabeats / Anjunadeep artists , and that being said , I 'm not that much in Anjunabeats anymore because they are repetitive af in terms of releases . Specially in what they catalog as `` Progressive Trance '' that is just a trancy break with trousy drops and structures . The whole ABGT has a more familiar vibe with the audience , the tracklist lies to a mixture of progressive , deep , some EDM stuff and usually a couple of more trancy records but the other way it 's not that good as people says . So , my opinion is that if you want Trance go for ASOT tho is kinda redundant with the same artists and Armada releases . If you want more diversity in sounds go for ABGT tho it 's about Anjuna producers the 90 % of the time . If you really want Trance podcasts go for FSOE ( all about Uplifting ) or Outburst ( Tech Trance mainly ) or just search things like the Damaged Radio Show of Jordan Suckley . [ EDIT : Just my thinking about the permanent comparison between AvB and A & amp ; B ] I do n't know why everyone always try to compare Armin mixes / releases / labels with the A & amp ; B ones . Both are in the doldrums , so I always look at these comparisons like if the anjuna fans are trying to bash Armin because he sellout when A & amp ; B have done it too at the same way lol Both did a radio-friendly album the past year ( Armin one 's was practically made as an SHM album while WAWN has songs that sound like Cash Berlin ) , both have good labels that have become boring shit ( Armind for Armin and Anjunabeats for A & amp ; B ) , both have gone to the Mainstream EDM ship and both of them need someone for make their tracks ( Armin needs Benno as much as A & amp ; B ca n't do a track without Andrew Bayer )",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,feedme,"Just look at the cover and the name of the EP . Family Reunion is more about music to listen in home than bangers like his other EPs . Is a great release , it 's versatile in genres and sounds . I like What It Feels Like or Life Raft even when I absolutely hate those radio anthems . Anyways , if you do n't like it do n't worry . Jon releases an average of 10 songs a year . The past one he released 23 . This year he has released 14 , not counting the Strobe Remix and the other EP he 's going to release in autumn .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,Barcelona,"Yep , I know it grows but technically it does when you receive it and you do n't pay . I received it now ( five months later ) and it has grown like 44 euros even when I never received it previously . This is why I want to know if I can claim .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,feedme,"What I meant at first is that this EP is still more relaxed , and it has a more `` familiar '' tone so to speak , and this is why this was meant to be an album and it ended being an EP . It is something that is clear in songs like What It Feels Like or Life Raft especially . You are right that this one has bangers like Trouble and Schizoid , but apart from that , the EP is generally only a journey through different genres and sounds , Also , it has reminiscences to other EPs so it 's like a fusion of the Post and Pre-Calamary Tuesday Feed Me : High Speed Weekend Survivor ( it follows the style of Feed Me 's Psychedelic Journey ) , Stay Focused ( which is something like a follow up of a Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo ) and Red Clouds ( after all it 's a different version of Cloudburn ) . I sincerely believe that his previous EPs had many more bangers , but compared to this EP , they have grown in us more and they have his classic sound ( Look at Escape From Electric Mountain . Unless Embers all are bangers . Or AGWDOT , all the songs are bangers directly and is still my fave Feed Me release to date ) . Many people associate Feed Me with Electro and Dubstep exclusively , and for them it 's rare to see him doing different things in the newest EPs .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,feedme,"No worries , we all have different approaches about music . For me Jon is one of the few producers that are leading art in everything they do . What I do like about him is how he has created a whole world around his characters ( Feed Me , Spor and SS are way more than alias to him ) that revolves around his tastes in painting , literature and cinema among other things . It 's something I have not seen in any other producer so far ( least for maybe Franck Rivoire aka Danger ) , in fact is something much more common in writers and painters than in musicians . Also , there 's a rework of Spilt Milk ? I 've heard the old demo version and I 'm sure that he used some parts of it in one of the IDs he dropped not long ago in a mix ( the mau5trap one I think ) but I ca n't remember a different version of the track rn . Of the VIP versions he has of his own tracks , I like the one for Trapdoor ( even when sounds more like an unfinished Spor remix ) , the vocoder edit of Ophelia and specially the VIP version of Fiasco . Sounds like a completely new track even when it has the same melody and reminds me loads to the old Ed Banger / Roule releases .",Romance,Spanish

There will be other 3 emperors to defeat , but I believe that the first one needs to go down with a huge struggle and the help of a lot of stronger characters just to show how strong these 4 pirates are in comparision to the rest of characters . Then Luffy , seeing the gap of power between him and the emperors , could learn new techniques to defeat Big Mom and Teach without needed the help of other allies . The way I see it : Luffy , Law , Marco , Kid and some other strong allies will fight against Kaido . Kaido cleans the soil with some of them , Moriah comes up , boosts G4 's Luffy with shadows , Luffy defeats Kaido in a much more balanced fight even with the help of other characters . This shows us that Luffy is definitely a threat to the emperors even when he is not at their level yet , because how Mihawk said , his truly power is to make allies anywhere .",Romance,Spanish

It 's obvious that we are not going to have new Pend material this year , but maybe this would be the spark that runs all for the next year . Miami was more like `` hey we are still alive '' , and this as a exclusive DJ Set seems like it 's a way to keep the hype alive , specially since seems pretty much like it will be Paul , Rob and Gaz .

CDs are the representation of the vanity , the abuse of power and the egoism of the nobles . There 's anything good about them and they ca n't even redeem themselves for what we 've seen . Also why Oda would want to create a good celestial dragon when we already have what you said but with normal nobles ? I mean we 've got a lot of good nobles like Sabo , Sanji , Reiju , Vivi , Neptune , Viola , Rebecca ...

However , I think that Homing and Corazon were the closest thing to the exception that proves the rule . Why ? because the CDs are pretty much like a circle jerk of arrogant nobles . They are living with the idea that they are descendants of gods and therefore everything they do is right . Is like if the world owes them a favor . They do n't even need to change their way of acting or change the world because it favors them .

Also , even if her devil fruit works only on people with fear she can just steal Nami 's soul and blackmail Luffy with it , pretty much doing the same that the Vinsmokes are doing with Zeff .

Btw , Kaido is on Wano ( Japan in the OP world ) so obviously , the Oni fits perfectly . If he does not have this fruit , I believe that then he has some kind of fruit based on a dragon . For Big Mom , there is a legend in Japan about something similar to a witch called Yama-uba that fits a bit to the appearance of Big Mom .

As much I would espect something along the lines of an old Pend unreleased track/remix being released as a free download , ( but that also seems unlikely ) , so time will tell , they definitely are going to do something but the sooner I can see new Pendulum material being released is in next year 's autumn .",Romance,Spanish

The thing here is , we really want or even need more OceanLab material ? Even if it was an A & amp ; B Mix , Another Chance was truly a poor track . The OceanLab essence has been dragged by the new ABGT era , so I doubt that new OceanLab material would be something interesting now . Also , since A & amp ; B moved to slower bpms , 2016-A & amp ; B and 2016-OL would sound pretty much the same , or at least that 's what I believe . What I feel is that It will be more marketing that anything , because there 's a lot of new ABGT fans who do n't know anything about pre-2011 A & amp ; B , so if they do new OL material it will be just to please the old fans that have been moaning about more OceanLab material , just like what Armin did with Rising Star .

Little Something is a good song , but is a clear example of what I said in the second paragraph : I doubt that if OceanLab comes back will be different that the current A & amp ; B vocal tracks . It will be something along the lines of Counting Down the Days meets the Acoustic album . That 's why I think that a return of OceanLab would be disappointing . It will be for the sake of doing so , if they do a full album with songs like Beautiful Together I would be happy but that 's not going to happen . With this I 'm not saying that I just like 140 stuff but after 7 fucking years without producing trance of high bpms , it will be better if they release some Tranquility Base songs , I mean 2 or 3 just to diversify after those years without doing so .

I 'm saying that if they do a new OL album a lot of songs will be pretty much like that track , which is a good song without doubt but then why do you need to release it under OceanLab ? & gt ; I think the problem is many people like you think of Oceanlab as Beautiful Together and Satellite , the faster BPM songs with that energy . I think that 's fair to an extent , but it 's not the entirety of their sound . OceanLab was all about downtempo stuff , there 's like 2 Uplifting Trance songs in their entery discography . So no , for me those two songs are amazing exceptions , but not what it would come to my mind if someone ask me about what OceanLab is . Tbf , my fave one from them is Secret . Is obvious that A & amp ; B have more elements of the OceanLab sound now than ever . After 7 years doing a lot of vocal work with slow bpms with their A & amp ; B moniker and also 2 acoustic albums , OL is not going to have the same impact or the quality that it had back then . The same happened with Group Therapy and We Are All We Need , even when there 's some good songs in WAAWN , it 's the same formula and it felt kinda bland . The quality was there , but the first we got was better because it was something new and fresh and it had more iconic songs .

What I 'm saying is , they signed to Armada bc now if they want to release trance they can ( there 's more sublabels centered about the genre ) , so we are going to see more Trance from then now or this is what I believe . Edit : Also , maybe they will release more garbage . Who knows .",Romance,Spanish

They were definitely bloodthirsty ; they threw kids into cenotes , also there 's a lot of paintings about ritual sacrifices : Victims that were tied and stabbed by some priests with a spear or others about kids with their heart booted just because they were from other tribes .

More than anything , because why everyone remembers Columbus is because he was the first European to discover the American continent ( not counting the Vikings ) and he was the one who united two worlds .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"Yeah , I do agree . Eco is such a talented producer and I think that what makes him so good is that even when he loves Trance , he wants to do his own thing .

Some of the songs it has are absolutely masterpieces , there 's a lot of amazing melodies and experimental songs : Puhuri , Slow M ( ocean ) , Planes Overhead , It 's Over When The Silence Comes and Volare or Songbird in the Slum ( that one pretty much sounds like a collab with Gaia ) . Also , I believe that 'Wildlife On One ' from Art Of Trance is underrated , a lot of people just pay attention to Octopus bc it 's a classic but the whole album from Kaleidoscope to Cambodia is a masterpiece . Even when it stands out compared to the majority of the Psy-Trance albums , 'No More X ' by LOUD is truly a masterpiece and it 's a shame that a lot of people even ignore it .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"1 - Shanks : It 's very possible that he is going to be the strongest character in terms of haki in the OP world and is the best swordsman of the 4 Yonkos ( he fought against Mihawk several times ) , at the same time he can control the time or his own velocity with an unknown ability . I think that he is the strongest tho he is the laziest of the 4 . His brute force at the same time must be overwhelming given that was able to stop a punch of Sakazuki and a blow of Whitebeard despite having only one arm . 2 - Kaido : Currently I think it is quite on par with Shanks in power , but I think Kaido is called the strongest because has the advantage that it is much more resistant ( or at least it is said to be immortal for something ) , and destructive . At the same time I think that he has a mythological Zoan and quite possibly he will have the strongest fruit of this type . His strength seems based on his brute force . In this , I believe that he is stronger than Shanks . 3 - Big Mom : We do n't really know his abilities yet , but maybe she will be related to witchcraft or some kind of weird paramecia ( black magic , acid or some ability to turn people into sweet ) . His power tho seems more based on his great influence in the underground and she seems really relentless and tactical . Not a first line fighter like Whitebeard or Kaido but someone who can fight in the distance and win easily , sort of what Doflamingo did . 4 - Teach : Yes , he has the strongest paramecia and the most op logia BUT he is like Enel or Crocodile . A guy that is overconfident on his devil fruits . I think that if his power was in the hands of other character or if he was more serious , it could be the strongest of the 4 . By the end of this new saga I believe that he will be on par with Shanks or even stronger , but now he is the weakest . 5 - Whitebeard : Yeah , he was on par with Roger back in the days but in Marineford is obvious that he was shit compared to the rest of the group .

Btw , the speech about gods of Wisplash is brilliant . It 's not a great movie compared to the first one , but at least imo is better than IM3 . The Dark World had good moments , specially expanding the world of Thor , but otherwise it 's one of the weakest films of the MCU . Forcing the appearance of Jane Foster which was not necessary at all , in the first film was a need for the development of Thor , but in this one it could have been better to give more protagonism to the Thor - Sif relationship . On the other hand , if it is true that Wisplash was wasted in IM2 , in TDW I never felt that Malekith was part of the plot and even Kurse had more importance than him . I mean , he deserved much more space on the tape that they took to add the stupid plot with Jane and the ether inside her .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't have a solid proof , but let 's join the clues that we have about Kaido 's power . 1 - Mingo was afraid just thinking about what could happen to him if he could not supply more artificial fruits to Kaido . He was n't afraid of Whitebeard , who was the strongest pirate before the timeskip . At the same time he was n't afraid of Kuzan , who was on par with Akainu . 2 - Jack was going to save Mingo from an admiral , the past fleet admiral and some VA . Even if he was defeated three times since we meet him , he 's still alive and he has been fighting uninterruptedly since then . That means that , at least , Jack is as stronger as Mingo . Maybe even stronger . And he is just one of the three right hands of Kaido , so there are other two guys with practically the same strength that Jack . 3 - Jack was rapidly defeated by Zunisha . But then , Kaido is called the strongest creature alive . So that means that he is stronger than Zunisha and the rest of creatures of the OP world , at least in a 1 vs 1 . 4 - Kaido said something like `` these supernovas who defeated some shichibukais think that they are the great thing '' , and do n't forget what he said to Kid . So , for Kaido the Shichibukais are like what VA 's are in our eyes . We must not forget that despite Whitebeard was the strongest pirate in the world before the timeskip , that does not mean that his destructive power was comparable to what he was years ago . Although we know practically nothing about Kaido , his apparent immortality and the fact that before the Marineford war he was going to face Whitebeard and had to be stopped somehow by Shanks make it clear that he had enough confidence in himself to face the world 's strongest pirate.What is clear is that among the Yonko there is not a big difference in power . They are the 4 strongest pirates in the world and that means that although Kaido is right now the strongest , the other 3 emperors are fairly close to his power . This is why I do n't believe that Kaido will be defeated just by Luffy . Kaido will be the one to show the supernovas the gap of power between the yonkos and the rest of pirates ( Kid has it clear now , after all ) . After Kaido , Luffy will have to defeat the other yonkos , so it will be more realistic if the first one was defeated by an alliance of supernovas and after what he learned with his clash with Kaido he will defeat the other ones alone .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Sad in a way , there will never be another operating system , the barrier to entry is just to high . That 's thankfully wrong . We 're not at a terminal stage . This barrier you 're speaking of does only apply to systems that offer the same ( i.e . : Bring nothing to the table ) . However , there 's much going on in OS fundamentals , including designs that give the ability to provide features which Linux simply will never be able to without a fundamental redesign and rewrite . A clear example of this is `Minix3` with its [ fault tolerance and self-repair ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_3 # Reliability_in_MINIX_3 ) features , most of which are tied to a design that uses the pure ¬µkernel multiserver approach , which is opposite of what Linux does have . Similarly , [ Dragonfly ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonFly_BSD ) is a fork of FreeBSD done by the best lead it had ( Matt Dillon ) after he was removed due to a revert war over dealing with SMP . Matt wanted to sit down and discuss design , while other developers just wanted to push their random , misguided code . The result is that while FreeBSD implemented a lock labyrinth closely modeled after Linux ( thus providing nothing new in that front when compared to Linux ) , Dragonfly became a hybrid kernel design , implementing `LWKT` and splitting the kernel into `system servers` , benefiting from the message passing abstraction in place of locks , and [ doing quite well scalability-wise ] ( https : //www.dragonflybsd.org/performance ) , while FreeBSD , unsurprisingly , does pretty poorly in the same test . Besides fault tolerance and different approaches to multi-processor scalability , there are some fronts in which Linux is n't doing very well . One of them is `hard realtime` . The sheer complexity of the Linux monolith kernel makes it really hard to guarantee times , like , how long it will take for execution to return to userspace after switching to supervisor mode and entering the `lock labyrinth` , or whether this will ever happen . There 's the out of tree linux-rt patches , but there 's only so much they can do with this design ; particularly there 's reliability issues to the approach taken ( which involves doing very funky things with locks ) , and it does also kill throughput ; no one-size-fits-all is possible with the monolithic design .",Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,"It runs a lot of Free Software . It can be used day-to-day like Linux . The design ( with the ports ( ipc ) , the kits and the datatypes ) is also very refreshing . And it 's quite responsive and lightweight .",Romance,Spanish

So if you would , please give your reasoning . Thank you After what happened with `Reiser4` , the only ( general purpose ) FSs that I know of which are actually delving into new territory are `HAMMER2` and `Tux3` . `Tux3` is about high performance , low-latency ( ever suffered from stalls ? ) and guarantee of write order . All of that without using a journal , and while still behaving well in case of power outage . `Hammer2` is about ZFS functionality with better performance than ZFS and without the RAM overhead . `XFS` is an old design , `EXT4` is an even older design on steroids . `Btrfs` ... Oracle , emphasis on feature-checklist against ZFS and little thought put into design and corner cases . Furthermore every use story I hear from my acquaintances does end on a bad note a few days or weeks after . My own ended with me going back to XFS after about a week , due to extreme performance degradation over time . Last friend had dataloss instead ( without hw failure ) . And all of these FSs tend to stall for seconds at a time , typically causing the UI to freeze until I/O is done . & gt ; BTW I myself think hammer2 is at the top of the heap , or at least the one I 'm most interested in .

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; The point is simple , there is nothing that can replace linux as a for the next 10 years as an all purpose OS . Hardware support in BSDs ( specially NetBSD ) is much better than you seem to think it is . For a real world example , a few weeks ago , OpenBSD 5.7 was released . I installed it , ran startx and within ten minutes I had a nice desktop environment , chromium , firefox and mpv as music player . Sound and 3d acceleration worked right out of the box , without requiring any setup from me . Another example is my recent experience with an Allwinner A20 based board . NetBSD does have basic video support ( framebuffer ) , and a driver for the DMA engine , which is necessary for decent I/O with a lot of the SoC 's functionality . Linux has neither of these yet . A good portion of the drivers Linux has have actually been ported from the BSDs . As for software to run , most of what runs on Linux does run in the BSDs and the other way around . Just [ pkgsrc ] ( http : //pkgsrc.se/statistics.php ) already has over 10k packages . For perspective , Debian has some 15k source packages . The real challenge is to get people to break their shackles and use free software . Once that 's accomplished , free software is very interchangeable .",Romance,Spanish

But I remember that it was n't enough to just adjust the bitplane pointers with the copperlist . But I do n't think I have the diskette anymore , although I kept it for many years , I never got the chance to get it onto a more standard format . IIRC copper had 3 instr , they were to wait ( for desired position ) , mov ( chip ram only ) and to end . The mov could be used to raise an interrupt on the CPU , however . & gt ; Today with UEFI BIOS and SSD disks , boot times are becoming almost tolerable . Still slower than my A1200 boot-to-wb time . The PC would still be detecting hard disks and not yet loaded the bootloader by the time Amiga finished . & gt ; systemd has also been a huge step forward for Linux IMO . Agreed , best thing to happen in a very long time . & gt ; The thing I hate about Linux , is the Unix legacy with obscure names for everything , and nowhere to look for what might be the command to do what you want . If you need to pipe something to grep , then how the hell do you figure out it 's called grep , the Amiga had a command directory , and that 's where basic shell commands resided . and the names made somewhat sense on what the commands were for . There 's still $ PATH , which behaves like the C : assign . Sure , there 's a load of crap in there ... but then there 's `info coreutils` . Documentation wise , the BSDs are just superior though ( The manpages and the handbook each BSD has , plus actual kernel docs ) . & gt ; Another thing I miss is that on the Amiga you could access storage directly through sensible names . On Linux you need to know the location of the mount point , which varies among distros and if it 's automounted , it can even vary between what kind of drive was automounted . IMO Linux/Unix really need a standard for accessing devices directly , and not just through a link in a directory which is the minimum if you follow any accepted standard . LFS should cover that ( mountpoints for external media ) . But FS labels just are n't taken as seriously in the PC territory , so even if they 're exposed as mountpoints , they are useless . Also , there 's the Amiga `assign` command , which has no real equivalent in UNIX . And of course , there 's no standard way to try and access a disk that is n't there ( `type WHATEVER : test` ) , and get the user to provide it . ( Please insert volume WHATEVER : in any drive ... ) & gt ; I do n't generally have problems with latency & gt ; when I had it was mostly because of fglrx proprietary drivers . I remained with AMD for a long time , hoping the open source drivers would become good enough , I still think it 's great that AMD has open specs and improve on the open source drivers , and I hope they can make a comeback financially , to give both Intel and Nvidia more competition . Me too ... but my policy is to use the free drivers , and if that does n't suffice , just boot Windows to play the game . & gt ; I want my system to perform well on graphics , I 'm still a bit of a gamer , and games must be smooth , if it is n't , either the hardware or the game is insufficient . Last I heard , the alternatives to Linux you mention , do n't have good 3D graphics support , which Nvidia fortunately provide for Linux , but unfortunately only with proprietary driver . I prefer AMD , but that 's because they 're at least trying , whereas [ Fuck you , NVidia ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3c92mr/one_million_new_lines_of_code_hit_linux_kernel/cstp9jk ) .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; First off , yes it is , not even Tanenbaum tries to pretend otherwise , so please do n't . Tanenbaum has said again and again he simply does n't care about performance . He 'd pay a real high performance penalty just fine if he got a reliable system in exchange . & gt ; If it was n't they 'd be shouting it from the rooftops and we would all be using micro-kernels today because there would be no drawback to doing so To even get into benchmarks , they 'd need to have a real , working system first . Guess what ? There 's no such thing . And sadly , MACH ( and its horrid performance ) is still what comes to mind for most people when microkernels are brought up to the table . Non-dead , non-ancient , free , there 's just Escape , Genode , HelenOS and Minix3 . They 're at different stages of development , but none of them is ready for benchmarks . If you 're interested , I would say Minix3 is the closest , as they 've chosen to leverage a lot of netbsd headers and userspace , and they use pkgsrc . Still , the current release ( which finally has dynamic shared libraries ) only builds and runs a small portion of pkgsrc . HEAD finally has a version of Xorg working . Assuming Minix3 gets there soon in terms of running software , it will still take some time for the development focus to shift from getting things to work ( software and hardware wise ) to performance . And only after years of work in performance will having benchmarks be meaningful . So all these devs can do performance-wise is just high-level architecture decisions , and write articles like the one I linked above to try and remind people that , while really bad , MACH is thoroughly obsolete , and computers ( particularly ever since they come in multicore packages ) have shifted to SMP , where the multiserver design does hold unexplored potential .",Romance,Spanish

At that point I decided to go AMD for the next ; it was a very wise decision in hindsight , after 8 years of NVidia : 5 cards , all broken , including a replacement one I was sent on warranty , and the very last one , which at the point I replaced , was already intermittently drawing garbage . The AMD I got , HD4850 , I still use and is in good health , and drivers are better than they 've ever been ( both the foss ones and the non-free ones , they support old cards well ) but I will soon replace it with a Fury Nano , as its too weak and power-inefficient when compared to the rest of my current setup , and as I can afford to do so .

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; How well does it ( in your experience , I am skeptical of the hype ) handle frequent disconnections such as if you are moving , on a mobile connection , and said connection drops out every few minutes ? Very well . It 's pretty much made for this . IP of the client can change very often , packet loss can be very high , and it still manages to get through . Part of the trick is that the serverside implements some sort of tmux/screen-like but minimalistic and transparent to the user terminal emulator in between . Even in a not-roaming scenario , when simply using it to connect from home to my servers , it feels more responsive than ssh . Latency is less of an issue somehow .",Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,Thanks for the overview !,Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Sorry but this makes no sense , anything done in this space could easily be replicated by say the Linux devs in a monolithic setting . It could be done in a hybrid kernel setting , it absolutely can not be done in a monolithic setting . The reason is simple : Without boundaries ( as imposed by modular structure , which could be enforced or not at runtime via running the modules in userspace ( pure microkernel architecture ) or not doing so ( hybrid kernel ) ) , everything can call everything , anytime . Therefore , locks are unavoidable if they 're to support SMP or kernel preemption , the latter being a terrible hack to prevent userspace from suffering the latencies of the very long and unpredictable paths the kernel can get into , and an example of how terrible monolithic kernels tend to eventually get . & gt ; Just because the kernel is monolithic does not mean it 's subsystems ( components ) are n't logically separated . In other words they could mimic any ' SMP / avoiding locks / messaging ' ideas in their monolithic kernel and perform better than the micro-kernel design due to avoiding overhead by running all it 's components in a single process . As I 've explained above , this would make your kernel a hybrid kernel . Of course , there 's also the school of thought that hybrid kernels are marketing bullshit and do not exist , but I do not subscribe to it ; even if the hardware does n't enforce the boundaries in runtime , they are still enforced at compile time and are very clear from a design perspective , allowing for design decisions that depend on the modular design and are otherwise not possible . Perhaps someday we 'll actually have a decent such system to do benchmarks with ; if system servers run fine in userspace and the microkernel allows for them to run in kernelspace as well , then we can do both in an otherwise identical system and compare . & gt ; in fact what would give it the 'hybrid ' moniker to begin with ? https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonFly_BSD # Kernel Looks very hybrid to me , and benefiting from a lot of non-locking multithreaded system servers already . They 're even advancing towards moving many of these parts to userspace , and getting rid of systemcalls and wrapping them into messages instead , which could eventually lead to pure microkernel multiserver architecture . & gt ; Also a large part of the performance increase ( in this test which the author admits does not mirror realistic work loads ) seems to come from a technique called 'swapcache ' which is also in no way bound to micro-kernel design . That 's described in a separate section of the performance page dedicated to it . That 's grasping at straws if anything . & gt ; But those real world performance costs are n't going away , and unless the stable monolithic offerings It can be argued that pure microkernel ( with system servers running in userspace and therefore supervisor/user context switching ) will never be as fast as hybrid kernels ( same design , but allowing for servers to run in kernelspace ) . Then it 's a compromise between reliability and performance , as many [ reliability features ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_3 # Reliability_in_MINIX_3 ) do depend directly on the pure architecture . The exact practical numbers of the penalty the pure design implies are still unknown , they could turn out to be very acceptable . We wo n't know until we have a reasonable pure microkernel multiserver system , only then tests as the one described above will be possible . But what 's already established is that the user/supervisor context switch overhead argument is not valid against monolithic kernels , as monolithic kernels are n't hybrid kernels , and thus many potentially awesome optimization strategies are unavailable to them .",Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; I 'm rather amazed that it 's still being developed . I do n't consider it to be *actively* developed , if anything , outside of the Debian work . They might have a commit once in a while with & lt ; 5 active devs per week ... it 's definitely not a healthy project . That 's not comparable to `Genode` , `HelenOS` and `Minix3` , which have 10-30 active devs , many of which paid , and are actually advancing their systems to some direction . Even systems like `9front` , `ReactOS` , `AROS` or `Haiku` have way more activity than the HURD . I was excited back when the HURD L4 port happened , and I 'll be excited again when they finally make some progress towards abandoning Mach .

But the important part is it 's about pure microkernel vs hybrid kernel , not monolithic . & gt ; What is this magical message passing , you can send messages ( data ) between processes through plain old POSIX if you so wish . Sure , but you ca n't pass messages between kernel components if the kernel does n't have components , and that 's what separates hybrid from monolithic kernel , which instead resorts to direct calls . & gt ; And I do agree with those who say 'hybrid ' is a nonsense label That 's been implicit from all your conversation so far , but thanks for coming out clearly about it . & gt ; the closest thing to a 'hybrid ' I 've come across would be the original BeOS , because it actually moved a performance critical component out in user space ( networking ) , but then moved it back into kernel space due to the poor networking performance it resulted in . [ A hybrid is about having clearly bounded components ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel ) , there 's no requirement for any of these to be in userspace , but they can be .

From what I 've gleaned from previous BSDNow podcasts , FreeBSD people generally conceded that Dillon had the right idea , and fixed SMP accordingly . Dillon 's approach is to go `multiserver` ( like XNU , Minix , BeOS , AmigaOS and so on ) . FreeBSD 's approach is to go `lock labyrinth` ( like Linux ) . My main concern with Linux is that once the CPU enters the kernel , there 's no telling when it 'll finish , or if it even will even return to userspace at all ; kernel stalls are n't uncommon . BSDs seem to do better somehow , as kernel 's generally structured and order is enforced ; they would n't take layering violations like the one with `ext4 and dm-raid` interactions somehow causing a data loss ( what a pile of hacks ... ) . They also somehow manage to feel more responsive than Linux when using them on a workstation . But they still have the same issue . A multiserver approach forces modularity , which in turn makes the relationships between components become defined , and the nonsense avoided . I cringe when I run latencytop on any random Linux system , leave it a minute or two and typically see latencies over 15ms ( typically filesystem related ... `Tux3` , please hurry it to the kernel somehow ! ) . It 's a shame Matt did n't implement it on top of some generalized message IPC like `Minix3` , but it 's still a major step in the right direction . Dragonfly is making BSD suck less progressively by transitioning from monolithic to hybrid architecture , whereas Minix3 took a more radical approach of rebuilding itself from scratch and with pure ¬µkernel architecture ; They stripped `Minix2` and moved everything to userspace while adapting the system as necessary , so technically it 's not from scratch , but almost .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Actually , that final point is a bit less dry . They argue that ZFS was never allowed to stay in a state where it lost data . The fact that BTRFS allowed this , with the promise that they 'd always fix it later , is a bad precedent akin to allowing your child to grow up a vandal `` because he 'll just grow out of it '' . Actually , I think they do have a point . It 's so unfair `btrfs` got special treatment , whereas `Reiser4` and `Tux3` were treated very harshly , despite not having that *little* `known to lose data` issue . I 'm also sad at the state of filesystems on Linux . Right now , the only FS that I know wo n't just eat my data is `XFS` , which barely any distribution uses as default . `Btrfs` is too young , `ext4` gets data corrupting bugs every now and then , such as the present one , and the other filesystems do n't see much usage so they ca n't be trusted either . They have the solid [ UFS2 ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_File_System ) as the default in most BSDs . It features [ soft updates ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_updates ) rather than the archaic journal most Linux filesystems use , and does n't have a corruption bug every other week . In fact , I have never heard about a data corruption bug there .
