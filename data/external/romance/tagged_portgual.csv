AaronWasRight,europe,"About Portugal\\ 's Estado Novo , led by Ant\u00f3nio Salazar.\\n\\n\\nIts main motto was \ '' [ Deus , P\u00e1tria e Fam\u00edlia ] ( https : //i.imgur.com/Yu5GOvo.jpg ) \ '' , which means \ '' God , ~~Fatherland~~ Homeland and Family\ '' . It defended Portugal as a **Catholic country** , heavily focused on the **traditional values of family** and the idea of Portugal as a **pluricontinental nation** . Territories like Angola , Mozambique , Cape Verde , East Timor , Guin\u00e9-Bissau , Sao Tom\u00e9 and Macau were seen as an extension of said ~~Fatherland~~ Homeland , Portugal itself . The integration of all these different cultures as being portuguese was heavily encouraged as seen [ here ] ( https : //i.imgur.com/aAR1Xva.jpg ) - That means \ '' A lot of races , all of them portuguese.\ '' Also [ here ] ( https : //i.imgur.com/tARnMLi.jpg ) .\\n\\n\\nSalazar ascended to power as a Minister of Finance , and was successful , to a degree , in restoring the country\\ 's poor finantial health . Later on , as the country\\ 's ruler , he was successful in **keeping Portugal out of WWII** . \\n\\n\\nAs per Wikipedia : \ '' The Estado Novo was an authoritarian regime with an integralist orientation , which differed greatly from other fascist regimes by its **lack of expansionism** , **lack of a fanatical leader** , **lack of dogmatic party structure** , and **more moderate use of state force**.\ '' \\n\\nSalazar wasn\\'t exactly like other dictators . He kept his image as an academic , a stern grandfather , if you will . Salazar was a Catholic traditionalist who believed in the necessity of control over the forces of economic modernisation in order to **defend the religious and rural values of the country , which he perceived as being threatened** . One of the pillars of the regime was the PIDE , the **secret police** . They kept the political dissidents in a **penal colony** , Tarrafal , in an island in Cape Verde . The Portuguese Communist Party was intensely persecuted . So were Anarchists , Liberals , Republicans , and anyone opposed to the regime . **Censorship was in full force . Elections were rigged . **\\n\\nThe whole education system was focused toward the **exaltation of the Portuguese nation and its five-century old overseas territories ( the Ultramar ) ** . After 1945 , the main raison d\\'\u00eatre of the regime became resistance to the wave of decolonization which swept Europe after the end of World War II , which led to the **Colonial Wars**.\\n\\nThe regime fell in 1974 , with the **Carnation Revolution** , which was a peaceful revolution . Salazar had died 4 years prior to that . The retreat from the colonies and the acceptance of its independence terms in 1975 prompted a **mass exodus** of Portuguese citizens from Portugal\\ 's African territories ( mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique ) , **creating over a million destitute Portuguese refugees \u2014 the retornados** . Most of them were forced to return to Portugal . By 1975 , all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years . The Portuguese Empire all but collapsed ; it officially ended in 1999 , with the return of Macau to China.\\n\\nTL ; DR. No fanatical leader ( Salazar was a college teacher ) , no expansionism , retention of overseas possessions was a matter of national interest , somewhat moderate use of force when compared to other dictators , emphasis in a Catholic country , emphasis in traditional values and in the rural way of life , extremely averse to globalism ( we made our own shitty Coca-Cola ) , kept us out of WWII , secret police , rigged elections , censorship , our own Azkaban to political dissidents , and a [ peaceful revolution ] ( https : //aeesv.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/maia.jpg ? w=510 ) to end it all.\\n\\n",Romance,Portugese

N=131 ) . They both suggest that Britain didn\\'t want Portugal to fight in the war , at least in the first stages of the conflit . By our government\\ 's words : \ '' Portugal\\ 's participation in WWI was not an immediate consequence of the anglo-portuguese alliance and didn\\'t occur at the beginning of the conflit , quite the contrary , the London Government asked , in August of 1914 , that Lisbon declared itself \ '' non-belligerant and not neutral\ '' \ '' . \\n\\nAs for reasons : \ '' In August 26th , 1914 , the Lisbon Government gauged London yet again about a possible joint military action in Africa , and response was that the UK wanted to avoid having Portugal involved in the war , as Portuguese armed forces should be reserved for internal defense . This was another lost attempt to force English belligerence from the situation in Africa . On August 27th the London Government ensures the defense of the Portuguese possessions in case of German attack.\ '' \\n\\nSo , at the time , Portugal had : \\n\\n\\n* a very weak regime after deposing of the royal family in 1910 , that was viewed with some degree of contempt both internally and by other Governments\\n\\n* various actions by the Armed Forces within Portugal\\ 's borders , which seriously weakened the Armed Forces\u2019 operational capacity and destroyed its discipline\\n\\n* The prospect of a military intervention from Spain\\n\\nHowever , the Portuguese Republicans *wanted* to fight in the war , because they believed that a common cause would give them some legitimacy and woud help hide their sheer incompetence . Also , to keep our colonies in Africa that were being theatened by *ze* Germans . We entered the War when Britain activated the Treaty of Windsor and requested us to arrest all the German and Austrian ships in our ports . Which we did ; Germany sent us an angry letter 2 weeks later declaring war on us.\\n\\n\\n\\n**WWII**\\n\\nAlso from the Government : \\n\ '' During the 1930s , Portugal and the United Kingdom understood the necessity to ensure the neutrality of the Iberian Peninsula in case of conflict in Europe , something that could prove difficult given the proximity of Franco ( *Spanish dictator at the time* ) with the Axis . After an internal consolidation period that characterized the first half of the 1930s and the worsening of the domestic political situation , the Estado Novo ( *Salazar\\ 's regime* ) defined the bases and strategic objectives of Portugal\\ 's external relations , electing the UK and its proximity to the Atlantic Power ( *read USA* ) as the fundamental instrument both for national independence against the eventual \ '' Spanish danger\ '' and the maintenance of the colonial empire , to which are added , among others , internal reasons such as the regime\\ 's survival\ '' .\\n\\nAlso : \\n\ '' The signing of a pact of Luso-Spanish Friendship ( called Pacto Ib\u00e9rico ) , in March 1939 , tied the two countries to a neutrality that would become advantageous for Portugal and especially to England , as it contributed to the neutralization of the peninsula during World War II.\ '' \\n\\nThis is only the short version of events , of course . People just forget that adding a headless chicken ( like Portugal was in the time of WWI ) to the mix could actually worsen Britain\\ 's position . And the fact that we are sort of glued to Spain made the people that mattered think if it was better to have Iberian neutrality or having a full out war between Portugal and Spain while Hitler was rampaging half of Europe.\\n",Romance,Portugese

Sometimes annoying , sometimes funny.\\n\\n**French** : singing , but more like german . And they always the same metric in their sentences . Mildly pleasant to hear.\\n\\n**Germanic languages** ( besides English ) : they sound like someone is gathering spit from the back of the throat . Also , the combination of the consonants is very different from Portuguese , so it sounded for some time like you guys had less vowels than us . Dutch to me sounds like a slower german and their cadence is arrhythmical . Always expect them to speak them in a pattern different than they use to.Can\\'t distinguish individual scandinavian languages , they all sound like even more incomprehensible german , although they loose some of the impression of taking out a spit and sound a deeper tone . Dutch - Annoying . German - not like it . Scandinavian - Bearable to hear.\\n\\n**English** - very nasalized mixture of german with french words . Bearable to ear.\\n\\n**Finish** - Slow hungarian , not a great comparrison , but the best I\\ 've got . Don\\'t get any of the words , like the magyar tongue , but feel like they over-extend the duration of the vowels - something like \ '' aaa\ '' ...

Had a good teacher that also done that , so I like it.\\n\\n**Turk** - Sometimes it seems not every turkish speaks the same language . The impression that I\\ 've got the pronounciation and rhythm of speech varies greatly from person to person . Not enough data to form opinion.\\n\\n**Galician** - Basically Portuguese with Castillan pronounce . That\\ 's what stood on my mind after watching Tv Galicia . Maybe not same language as mine ( maybe yes ) , but the closest thing I will find in Europe ( and ahead of some brazilians with weird accents ) . 10/10 would use Galaico-portuguese again.\\n\\n**Catalan** - Very close to Portuguese , but with the habit of not terminating the words with vowels . Sometimes hits the uncanny valley due to looking very close ( but not close enough ) . When it doesn\\'t , it\\ 's good to hear it.\\n\\n**Estonian** , **Lithuanian** , **Latvian** and **Albanian** - Error 404 , could not find .

ArpMerp,europe,"Measuring migration entails a number of difficulties that make the availability of information quite scarce , even when simply measuring the number of migrants . The major limitations are due to the fact that only registered migrations across borders are counted.\\n\\nInternal migration is not considered . According to UNDP internal migrants are almost four times the number of international migrants , thus representing an important phenomenon for a number of countries , especially for larger countries with internal economic and social differences . not considering them may greatly bias the real overall figures of the migration phenomena.\\n\\nIn addition , figures reflect only legal migration , as measured by the receiving country . Illegal migrants are obviously not counted and no country generally counts the number of people leaving , which means that there is no double checking mechanism . Also , short-term migrants are often not registered under national regulatory frameworks and , therefore , are not included in available statistics . To be registered , a person entering from outside the country must intend to stay in the country for a specified minimum period , which may vary from one week ( Germany ) to three months ( Belgium ) , or even one year ( Sweden ) . This means that short-term migrants are counted in Germany , but not in Sweden . With the exception of asylum seekers , the reasons why people migrate are not always explicit or recorded . Hence , international students and seasonal workers are both considered migrants for statistical purposes.\ '' \\n\\nFurthermore , second generation migrants are not counted as migrants . They are not technically migrants , but , from a sociological point of view , they may face similar difficulties.\\n\\nThese are the main problems faced when trying to measure the stock of people moving into other countries ( i.e. , the quantity of migration ) . In relation to the qualitative aspects of migration ( i.e. , reasons for migrating , level of education , sector of employment ) , many countries lack data , and a qualitative analysis of the standards of living of migrants across countries ( i.e. , income , production , consumption , hours worked , access to credit , access to health care , family reunion , life satisfaction , etc . ) simply does not exist . These are issues studied locally through surveys . The only international survey on qualitative aspects of migration is the one conducted by the OECD on the quality of education ( PISA ) , which fortunately takes into consideration first and second generation migrant students.\ '' \\n\\n**TL.DR : Only migration across borders counts .

ArpMerp,europe,"I can\\'t answer for the person you are replying to but I can give an answer of my own as I feel more European than Portuguese . There are a few points : \\n\\n1 ) I personally do not understand why people feel \ '' proud\ '' of the place they are born . To me pride is something reserved for what you achieved and not for circunstances that are out of my control . Blindly saying \ '' my city/country is better than yours\ '' just seems silly to me because , most of the times , people actually don\\'t go out of their way to explore/understand other places . You can\\'t compare two things if you only know one of them . You can\\'t review a movie if you haven\\'t watched it . You can\\'t understand people until you interact with them . I like the freedom of going to another country and being able to live there and have contact with their culture and not just turistic spots.\\n\\n2 ) What are borders ? What is a country ? Portugal for example has many different cultural aspect from north to south . I have been living in England for the past 4 years and I get the same impression , don\\'t know if you agree with me or not . Going back to Portugal , one could probably say that people that are close to the border with Spain haven cultural influences from there that people from the coast do not . Same with the spanish , the ones at the border with Portugal probably have cultural influences that the ones at the border with France do not and vice-versa . Borders were created in times of war and they changed all the time , they just happened to settle as they are now.\\n\\n3 ) The country a person is born in does not necesserely represent the ideals and views of that person . So what does it mean \ '' I\\ 'm Portuguese\ '' , besides that I was born in Portuguese territory ? What does it mean for you to be English ? Is there something so different about Portugal compared to any other country that would define almost 100 % of the population that no other people have ? You can probably feel more at \ '' home\ '' or more \ '' confortable\ '' in other some cities in other countries than in cities of your own country . I lived in the north of Portugal for most of my life and it was \ '' meh\ '' , too religious for me . I lived in Lisbon and it was great . I came to Oxford and it feels \ '' meh\ '' . London feels great , Manchester would probably feel better too . I went to Prague a couple of times and felt great , I stayed in Zeliv for a while and it was \ '' meh\ '' . Only been there to visit but Amsterdam felt a bit \ '' meh\ '' , but Utrecht felt like a place I would live ... sorry , I think you get my point , been going for a while.\\n\\nAll in all I see myself as European because the EU is an idea that I like , of openess and hability to share what each country has to offer .

But the descendants of people from Badajoz are not Luso-descendentes and the people from Portugal are not Spanish.\\n\\nAnother great example is that a Portuguese Speaker is called a Lusophone , pretty ridiculous when the Portuguese Language has it\\ 's roots in Galicia that wasn\\'t even part of Portugal and worse it is far away from Lusitania .
