MarsNirgal,europe,"I don\\'t know if anyone else who replied is gay , but I am , so I thought maybe I\\ 'd offer some extra insight on this . \\n\\n & gt ; Is Mexico tolerant of LGBT people ? \\n\\nYes and no . As most if not all countries , Mexico has a certain \ '' macho\ '' , ultramasculine culture that can make things hard for people like trans women and gay men ( and even lesbians , since they\\ 're seen as challenging men\\ 's manhood ) . \\n\\nAlso , Catholicism still has a lot of cultural power ( although not as much political power since we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country ) . But overall , I\\ 'd say we\\ 're improving . I\\ 've had three jobs and in none of them my sexual orientation was a problem . \\n\\nBack in 2009 , gays couldn\\'t marry anywhere in the country . Right now we can get married in 10 out of the 31 states of Mexico , including 28 % of the population and our three largest cities , and those marriages are legally recognized in all the country . \\n\\nEven more so , this year our Supreme Court stated that forbidding equal marriage is anticonstitutional , and our president ( whom I hate and I think is really bad for other reasons , but he had to something good at least once ) is working on a proposal to legalize equal marriage for all the states . \\n\\nThere has been a movement against it , of course . Last weekend we had marches in over 20 cities opposing equal marriage , but I think we\\ 're winning.\\n\\nWe\\ 're still a long way to go . People from the cities have it a lot better than people from rural communities ( I met a couple of gays from the country once , and the level of self-repression they endure is disheartening ) , LGBT people , particularly trans women , are still sometimes beaten , raped or killed , but overall , I think we\\ 're getting better , so fast that sometimes we don\\'t even realize it . \\n\\n & gt ; Does Roman Catholicism still strongly influence the country ? \\n\\nOh , dear ... \\n\\nOkay , let\\ 's go there . An overwhelming majority of Mexicans are Roman Catholic . That means they were baptized , made their communion , have religious weddings , and a lot of them go to mass every Sunday . The level of involvement varies a lot , for some it\\ 's just something the do , for some others is taken very seriously . \\n\\nOn the other hand , we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country and some other people take that very seriously . I recall a couple times when our national Anthem was sung in churches and people threw a fit , or when our then president kissed the pope\\ 's hand and there was a big uproar . Overall , any open attempt from the church to intervene in politics and ( kind of ) in society finds resistance from the left . This holds true mostly for the cities , people in small towns and rural communities are way more involved with religion . \\n\\nWhen you combine these two situations you end with a country that has deep and strong religious convictions , but has them at odds with political and social trends . The bigger the city , the more the secular side wins , the smaller the community , the more power is wielded by religion . \\n\\nRecently we\\ 're seeing a some sort of power struggle between those trends , taking equal marriage as a cause belle . There have been a lot of marches against federal equal marriage proposals , and of course the church is behind them , regardless of if they admit it or not . \\n\\nI think we\\ 're reaching , slowly but steadily , a certain equilibrium , in which people with sincerely held beliefs will live by them but will let other people live their lives . \\n\\nIt will be a long time before we get there , though .",Romance,Spanish

( They reserve simple past for things that are well in the past ) . \\n\\n* One of my favorites : Spanish students \ '' give class\ '' and the teacher \ '' takes the class\ '' , while Mexican students \ '' take class\ '' and the teacher \ '' gives the class\ '' . \\n\\n* There are , of course , words that have different meanings . \ '' Coger\ '' in Spain means just \ '' to take\ '' or \ '' to grab\ '' , while in Mexico it has those meanings , but it also means \ '' to fuck.\ '' \\n\\n* Spaniards curse a lot more . We use more double entendre . \\n\\nNow about music , prepare yourself for a flood of awesome .

No one tell him ) \\n\\nPop : \\n\\nI\\ 've been a lot of touch with Mexican pop because I mostly hear European pop ( specifically , Eurovision . You don\\'t know how jealous I am that you guys are in Eurovision and we aren\\'t ) , so most of the pop I post will be slightly dated ( or very dated in some cases ) \\n\\n [ Gloria Trevi ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CjXbluRyHE4 & amp ; list=PLIS-NM3fM9AMet6qkht596KXq5l3MBWDm ) . She\\ 's an extremely controversial artists by farily good reasons . Always since she started her career she pushed the boundaries of political correctness . In the early nineties she released a string of widely successful and polemic discs in which she discussed religion , abortion , sex and a lot of other stuff Mexican society wasn\\'t comfortable discussing . \\n\\nThen in 2000 she was arrested an accused of being part of a ring of child abuse that involved most of her backup singers and dancers . Then she got pregnant in prison , she claimed that she was raped while the prison authorities claimed she got smuggled sperm from her manager and faked the abuse . At the end she was released for lack of evidence , and after ten years out of the spotlight , she returned stronger than ever . \\n\\nShe\\ 's still quite controversial , with people believing that she was part of the abuse ring , while others believe she was a victim of it . I prefer not to think about it and just enjoy her music . \\n\\nA lot of her more current songs deal with self-reliance and liberation , which is something I like a lot . Also , she\\ 's become a gay icon , kinda like the Mexican Lady Gaga ( except she was doing Gaga before Gaga was doing solid food ) \\n\\nI would be hard-pressed to name a single song of her , so I\\ 'll put several . I hope you enjoy : \\n\\n* [ Todos me miran ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TP7Kh2gWL8g ) \\n\\n* [ Me r\u00edo de ti ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=P6A-kw41eEk ) \\n\\n* [ Lo que una chica por amor es capaz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ylfUkPD3IOA ) \\n\\n* [ Sabes ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=SCGrh7Ibg6k ) \\n\\n* [ No soy un p\u00e1jaro ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=EknNH7U90fA ) ( Warning : This song is HEAVY on double entendres and sexual innuendo . It\\ 's the kind of thing only she would dare to sing ) \\n\\nAlso , a classic from my childhood is the kid/youth band [ Timbiriche . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8Sc7XgsnhY4 & amp ; list=PL2E6A9599E3C49158 & amp ; index=2 ) My favorite song from them is [ Si no es ahora . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CovfI2ij39o ) \\n\\n [ OV7 and Kabah ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pmYtefifbx0 & amp ; list=PLjMhKRttBctyPVNujwskInxGABOeIforS ) are a couple bands that were quite succesfful . ( Sorry , I found a joint playlist and I\\ 'm feeling kinda lazy ) . OV7 was formed as \ '' Onda Vaselina\ '' a long time ago but then they lost the rights to their name in a dispute with their managers , so now they just go for the initials . My favorite song from them is [ Un pie tras otro pie . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BusFo75x3NA ) . About Kabah I\\ 'm gon na go for what I know and give you a song from a former member , [ No soy una se\u00f1ora ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=j5T1cYY-s8E ) by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 . \\n\\nGaribaldi is already vintage , ( late eighties , early nineties ) , my favorite songs from them are [ Que te la pongo ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UmDBmSTbuls ) y [ Tengo una bolita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kFrD9Cidujk ) . \\n\\nPaulina Rubio is quite a successful singer .

For instance , Mexicans who cross the border daily to work in a factory at Arizona increase their productivity 500 % over the average Mexican , they are in fact more productive than Japanese or British workers , that is not because they work 500 % harder or they are 500 % more motivated . Germans who travel to work at Colombia are 600 % less productive when they get down from the airplane , and that is not because there is a magic magnetic field in the Atlantic that changes people\\ 's levels of motivation . \\n\\nLabor Productivity is defined by the \ '' context of production\ '' , which is the sum of technology + education + investment level + infrastructure in a particular area . Personal efforts are good and welcomed , but they have a small relevance when we\\ 're talking about creating wealth in a modern scale . Doesn\\'t matter how hard and how early in the morning a baker starts his work doing muffins , if other baker , lazy and unmotivated , has an automated muffin machine and a powerful software to handle the factory processes , the lazy baker will get more and more money and eventually the hard-work baker will go to the bankruptcy .",Romance,Spanish

anairam_macias,AskEurope,"I\\ 'm a Mexican , so I thought I could offer some thoughts on our end , after reading all of the comments . \\n\\nA little background on me , because this does influences the view on Spain from Mexicans , I am female , upper class , mid 20\\ 's , my last name is not common in Mexico but it is in Spain ( or at least more common than in here ) , and in Mexico I\\ 'm considered \ '' white\ '' ( people here associate skin color with social class ) , I work in politics ( translator and interpreter , but I work for a major political party ) .\\n\\nYou have to understand that Mexico is a very classicist country , there\\ 's the rich people , the work class or middle class and the poor , often people of indigenous-descent , and it\\ 's not common for people of different categories to mix outside the employer-employee relationship . Rich people\\ 's kids don\\'t go to the same schools as middle class kids , and more often than not , people from the lower social classes opt out of school to get a job and afford their food . And this is not only for which school kids go to , it\\ 's from the places people buy their food and clothing from , where they go on vacation , places they hang out , etc . This of course , makes people resentful with the upper class . And you\\ 'll find that this upper class , is mostly made up of people with Spanish or European descent . So this lower social class is ( generally ) the one that shows more resentment towards Spain and Europe in general , even to the U.S for \ '' stealing our land\ '' ( I know that\\ 's inaccurate , but that\\ 's how people see it ) , and people from my social circle tend to be more \ '' forgiving\ '' and refer to Spain as \ '' La Madre Patria\ '' ( Motherland ) . There\\ 's even a ( bad ) joke going around gatherings of a Political Party from here , that we \ '' should ask for Spain\\ 's forgiveness for attempting to gain independence from them , and beg them to take us back and get us out of the third world\ '' . Kind of fucked up , but that\\ 's how it goes . So you\\ 'll see that the resentment is wildly opposing depending on what social class is the person being questioned about it . \\n\\nNow about immigration , most people from upper class go to Europe , and lower class , to the US and Canada . Most people who choose the EU to go on vacation or for a longer stay , don\\'t have Spain as their first choice , though . Me for example , would never live in the U.S. , but that\\ 's because I have the choice not to , and can afford to live in a EU country . I was in Spain for a month , and although people in Mexico say that they treat you badly after they notice you\\ 're a mexican , I did not experienced this , but they did seemed surprised that I am white-skinned.\\n\\nAbout the whole \ '' stealing our gold\ '' thing , this is indeed common to hear among all social classes . In elementary school , they teach us that before Spain came , we had a civilization ( that some may call savage ) that worked , we lived in harmony and were happy . So comparing that to our current situation , this alone will set some resentment and idealization of our past culture , a longing for peace that was \ '' stolen\ '' from us . They also teach us that when they came along they brought disease , corruption and death , which is our current situation . \\n\\nSo in general I would say that most mexicans do not hate Spain , but we are encouraged to have some sort of resentment towards them and what \ '' they\ '' did to Mexico .

Spain\\ 's issue is its medieval banking structure . Greece\\ 's issue is government corruption and untrustworthiness .

After all , Spain does have productive infrastructure.\\n\\nWhich is why I return to my point . There is no \ '' real\ '' solution except dismantling the Euro or instituting a centralized Federal Government for Europe . The bailout of Greece , the fiscal tightening , the talk , the posturing , they are all band-aids which won\\'t last long and may make the problems worse .

Oh , also , we did not request a bailout nor did we need one after the 2008 financial crisis . Our currency is stronger than 3 years ago , too.\\n\\nFor years countries from Europe and North America had lectured my country how to do things . When we finally did it a bit differently , we are now in a better position . So , forgive me if I\\ 'm a bit judgemental . But it is my opinion that all of the PIIGs countries could\\ 've done a lot better with their management . True , Germany is on the line , but it isn\\'t at all the German\\ 's fault for what the smaller countries are going through . Germany did not ask Greece to overspend on their olympics . Germany did not ask Spain to give away Real Estate as if it was a freebie . And Germany certainly did not tell Ireland to guarantee 100 % of the deposits of the Irish banks.\\n\\nThe issue is that , now that all of these instances of irrational exhuberance are problems , now and only now have they become \ '' European problems\ '' . But they weren\\'t \ '' European issues\ '' back then , were they ? What would\\ 've Greece said if Germany or Britain asked them to be more fiscally responsible back then ? These problems are of a national origin , and now those nationalities want an international solution . It is better to have one , to be sure , but penalties must also be given , and assurances that the bailout will be paid back and that the national conditions that led to the crisis will be remedied . If you find them harsh , I am sure Germany is sorry about it , but there really is no choice . Otherwise , what incentive would countries in the euro zone have to behave properly ? \\n\\nAddition : It just occured to me , fiscal and monteray policy should be employed on matching geographies . The main issue is that you have 25 or more different fiscal policies throughout the region with one single monetary policy . If you want a single currency , you need a single government . Apparently , this is what the Euro experiment seems to demonstrate .",Romance,Spanish

hseldon10,europe,"It is called a bailout because the interest and the sum are both preferential in relation to what , otherwise , the reciever would be able to get . If Irish fell , for instance , their interest rate would be in the triple digits , and would find it hard to get even a quarter of the necessary capital . Becuase the interest and the principal are preferential , it is called a bailout.\\n\\nAlso , the Irish people are punishing the government now . Instead , they should have been more vigilant and avoid the issue all together .",Romance,Spanish

hseldon10,europe,"The problem is that it is a terrible idea for those in charge , which is why the continuously generate fear against it . Here are the consequences for the powerful : \\n\\n- Global labor competition means lowering salaries for the top 20 % paid workers in the world , and increased salaries for the bottom 80 % of the workers in the world . Obviously , the Unions in charge in the Rich Countries will oppose this.\\n\\n- Global tax rates and global transparency means less opportunities for corruption . Politicians in highly corrupt states will oppose this as well.\\n\\n- Global interest rates and a global currency reduces the ability of individual regions to direct the economic growth of their region through artificial means , such as printing currency.\\n\\n- International public schools are a threat to those that need their people to be uneducated , such as highly religious states like the muslim Middle East and Africa , and the christian Americas.\\n\\n- Universal international health care and welfare states hurt the companies that benefit from inequalities as well . Same goes for an international logistics system and all the money that goes into lawyers specializing in dealing with border-bullshit.\\n\\nThese are the reasons why , even though it would benefit most people , the rich and powerful fear a Global Government .",Romance,Spanish

hseldon10,europe,"Yes , I am from Mexico . No , I am not lecturing , simply giving my point of view . A lot of people , however , find it easy to give excuses as to why my point of view is wrong . I am merely explaining why my point of view is valid . By the way , a random comment in Reddit does not at all have the same power as , say , a condition in an international trade agreement.\\n\\nOtherwise , I agree with what you are saying , but , ultimately , it wasn\\'t the German government who sponsored this \ '' irrational exhuberance\ '' of Irish banks ; it was German private investors and banks . Let them fail . If Germany wants to bail THEM out , then that is a German decision . Germany shouldn\\'t interfere , positively or negatively , in Irish decision . If Ireland decided to , on their own , back their banks 100 % at the expense of their people , that is Ireland\\ 's problem , not Germany\\ 's . If some German investors were benefitted by Ireland\\ 's move , that is beside the point.\\n\\nMy point is , you can not be half a Super Country and half independent . You NEED to be a single government to have a single currency . You can not have a single currency with multiple governments . You either split off completely , or unite completely , but whatever it is the EU is doing is unsustainable . Note : I am not saying it is either right or wrong , merely unsustainable.\\n\\nFinally , if there is a problem , it is because somebody sinned . In the case of Greece , I think it is very much the government\\ 's fault . In the case of Ireland or Spain , less so . But , in any case , if somebody sinned , that somebody should be punished . What I find wrong is this impulse of governments to shield their banks or Cajas , or whatever from the punishment , and then expect the rest of Europe to share the burden . Let the banks fail , and after that , clean up the mess . Don\\'t avoid it , because that is worse .",Romance,Spanish
