8rax,europe,I am living in swiss ; prefer them home for sure .,Romance,French
8rax,europe,"& gt ; I think it\\ 's also important to mention that French universities do not have the same prestige as their German or British counterparts . If you study computer science / technology , we have \ '' engineering schools\ '' that are more expensive and have very strong links with the industry . Those schools work very well . But you have to pay.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; We also have a system of \ '' grandes \u00e9coles\ '' ( elite schools ) in which you need to pass an exam ( more of a contest ) to enter . Those are the cool ones which get the funding . As said in the article , these are not accessible to everyone . It\\ 's mostly \ '' I know this guy who knows this guy\ '' . Very common in France.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; In general , French universities are considered cheap education , with all that it entails . Few teachers , infrastructure falling into pieces . But if you plan to study humanities , the university is pretty much your only solution . \\n\\n\\nOh god , you say so much bullshit it is quite clear that you have no idea how the grandes ecoles/ecoles d\\'ingenieur works ... \\n\\n* Most/a great number of \u00e9coles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur are free , source : I graduated from one of them\\n* grandes ecoles = ecoles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur by the way.\\n* most of them ( if not all ) are accessible to anyone , some you can enter with good grades others with a national concours = on merit . Nothing to do with \ '' knowing someone\ '' or whatever . You can enter everywhere if you are good enough . \\n* you can study human sciences in prepa litt\u00e9raire as well , in science po ... You have also good choices for this kind of studies . \\n* Lot of top tier schools are outside or Paris ( Most of them ) \\n\\n\\nThe only points I can agree on is that the infrastructures for the public universities ( faculties ) are often quite old and not very sexy + that the universities of France have less visibility than their counterparts in England/the USA . I would blame this on the separation between engineering school/business schools and regular universities . If you combine all of them together in a city then you might have something which can stand up to big campuses in the UK . But we chose to have the faculties + grandes ecoles and business schools apart.\\n\\nSome of our Business schools are top notch ( Insead MBA , HEC paris , ESSEC.. ) , some of our grandes ecoles are also top notch but less visible due to the concurrence of big monsters like Harvard/Oxford/Cambridge.\\n\\n",Romance,French

They say that if the Italians won\\'t accept the 50/50 proposal , they\\ 'll use their refusal right.\\n\\n- The previous agreement planned for 48 % for Fincantieri , 6 % for Fondazione CR , 33 % for the French state and the rest for Naval Group ( DCNS ) . The \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' was supposed to make it so that Fincantieri wouldn\\'t control a majority , but the Italians would still be able to buy it.\\n\\n- Since the Italians now said they won\\'t accept a new agreement and want a full majority , the \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' thing is shown to be a trick.\\n\\n- The previous agreement was made in 2008 because there was no refusal right for the French state . Since then they have acquired enough.\\n\\n- The Italians argue that they should be prefered to a Korean firm because they\\ 're European . The current feedback from STX is that the Korean firm was bad financially but \ '' very transparent\ '' , without technological theft.\\n\\n- Saint-Nazaire is the only plant able to build large ships for the French Navy , and is developing well on offshore renewable energy , which is seen as an important sector for France who has the second sea area in the world.\\n\\n- Fincantieri works with the Chinese for their future ships . They\\ 'll build in Shanghai the large ships that were previously made in Italy for the American Carnival Corporation . Fincantieri defends that the technology transfer is under control , but the French doubt their ability to resist to Chinese pressure , and are very wary of technology transfer to China.\\n\\n- The entire ship industry is preparing for China to offer a huge competition , supported by their state . They are very wary of any help to cover the technology gap they currently suffer . This is also the position of the German Meyer Werft . STX is considered along with Meyer Werft as among best expert for cruise ships.\\n\\n- Concerning jobs , the agreement secures them until 2026 . But 5 years later , Fincantieri would be able to decide directly the work share between its different sites . As the company belongs for 72 % to the Italian government , the French government is worried that they would prioritize work in Italy . \\n\\n- It is observed that among the company , its suppliers and customers , nobody supports the plan to go for Fincantieri . The ship-owners even went as far as proposing an alternative to the purchase agreement of 2008.\\n\\n- The French position is that their opposition has nothing to do with the nationality of the buyer . They\\ 've been under foreign ownership since 11 years , and would have accepted much more easily a merge with the German Meyer Werft.\\n\\nTLDR : The French government is worried about jobs as Fincantieri is under Italian goverment ownership and could prioritize their plants , and more importantly about technology transfer to China because Fincantieri works with them already .",Romance,French

Similar trend is happening in french where some people go out of their way to add diacritics like . or - or ( ) and \ '' e\ '' in between grammar agreements ( to indicate feminine gender ) . French has evolved in such a way ( and other romance languages too ) that masculine gender is used for both , say , \ '' male related things\ '' and \ '' neutral\ '' settings which let feminine alone for \ '' female related things\ '' . I\\ 'm caricaturing though : feminine is also used to indicate neutral with regard to inanimated \ '' objects\ '' but since masculine is used for neutral animated \ '' objects\ '' ( I mean living things ) , it stands out and that\\ 's where the political split come from . At the end of the day , it\\ 's a matter of grammaticality and morphology for lack of better option , I guess most people don\\'t see sexism behind it and really mean to be neutral when using the masculine gender accordingly for animated objects .

Arnold_Layne,europe,"As required by the mods , here is the full text of the article : \\n\\nEVERY winter , town squares all over Europe are filled by the hum of Christmas choirs . Towns in northern Italy follow this tradition too , but with a twist . Singers abandon Santa costumes in favour of the distinctive feathered hats of the Alpini , tough soldiers mostly recruited from remote Alpine villages . The Alpini repertoire is different too . Christmas songs are swapped for haunting ballads about the cruelty of war . These canti Alpini\u2014and the soldiers who sing them\u2014have become part of the region\u2019s cultural heritage . \\n\\nAt first glance , this is surprising . After all , to start with , the Alpini were a decidedly military outfit , established in 1872 to protect the new Italian state from its enemies to the north . Their baptism of fire came during the first world war , fighting the Austro-Hungarians high in the Dolomites . Conditions were terrible : avalanches and frostbite were a constant threat . Despite this , the Alpini notched up some impressive wins . They also fought courageously in the second world war , distinguishing themselves in battles from Ethiopia to the Russian steppe . \\n\\nUp to a point , the continued popularity of the Alpini can be explained by their reputation for courage . Their songs reflect their sacrifices . \u201cAmong rocks , wind and snow , we are forced to stay awake all night , \u201d one explains . \u201cWe started out as twenty-nine , \u201d begins another . \u201cNow we\u2019re only seven.\u201d This pride transcends the songs themselves . Monte Grappa , a famous Alpini victory in 1917 , is still commemorated on street signs across the country . Other songs , meanwhile , juxtapose Alpini bravery with the supposed incompetence of other Italian soldiers . In one , the choir warns Luigi Cadorna , the Italian commander in the first world war , that he\u2019ll need the Alpini \u201cif he wants to advance\u201d . The regular conscripts \u201care too weak\u201d to do the job , while other troops \u201care mafiosi\u201d . \\n\\nBut if some Alpini songs stumble towards chauvinism , their enduring reputation is down to their stark anti-war message . \u201cA \u2018happy\u2019 death has never existed , \u201d explains Massimo Marchesotti , conductor of the Alpini choir in Milan . \u201cWe sing about the truth : of the pointless death\u2026that none of those kids chose for themselves.\u201d The results are intensely moving . In \u201cOi Cara Mamma\u201d , the Alpini ask what their mothers will do when their sons don\u2019t come back . Elsewhere , the choir tells their lover that they are buried \u201cin a field of edelweiss\u201d . The choir concludes that \u201cwhen you are alone at home , the edelweiss and I will be with you.\u201d \\n\\nThe presence of edelweiss is not accidental . Alpini songs have a deep link to the mountain culture that bore them ; some of the songs are centuries old . And unlike other wings of the Italian military , \u201cAlpini herald from the same valleys\u201d as their songs , says Mr Marchesotti . Indeed , most songs are odes to the mountains themselves . When a soldier is thirsty , \u201crefreshing snow\u201d will be there to soothe them . A dying captain asks his men to give a part of his body to the mountains so that he blossoms into \u201croses and flowers\u201d.\\n\\nThis thoughtful melancholy is popular : Alpini choirs still release albums and play concerts all over northern Italy , and interest in them extends beyond their music . Several films and documentaries have been made about their story . A book of Alpini exploits by Mario Stern , a sergeant who fought near Stalingrad , has been republished five times , and has been made into a play . While in Russia , Polenta , as well as the cheese of his native valley , and of course the mountains themselves are constantly on Stern\u2019s mind . \u201cGhe rivarem a baita ? \u201d repeats one of his men , in thick Brescian dialect . \u201cWhen do we get home ? \ '' Home , or baita in the dialect , is literally a mountain chalet . Once again , Alpini culture is less about martial swaggering , and more a vehicle for nostalgia for beauty of Italy\u2019s northern frontiers . \\n\\nThis heritage is not as secure as it used to be . Most Alpini regiments were dissolved after the Cold War . The soldiers themselves now come from all over Italy , weakening their cultural link to the Alps . Still , the troops continue to play an active role in Italian life . They fought with NATO in Afghanistan . Their avalanche training has proved useful in earthquake-ravaged corners of the Apennines . Moreover , the national Alpini association , with its 355,000 members , is still important . As well as promoting Alpini culture , local chapters\u2014encompassing both veterans and eager civilians\u2014help their communities in numerous ways . They maintain chapels , and a series of mountain shelters for weary hikers . This dedication has not gone unnoticed , even among civilians . In the Piedmontese town of Biella , 36 % of the members of the local association were never soldiers themselves . \\n\\nWith the centenary of the armistice ending the first world war fast approaching , the Alpini look set to return to the forefront of Italian cultural memory . They are in fierce debate with their Austrian counterparts about where to hold joint commemorations of the fighting . ( The Austrians do not want to meet in Alto Adige , a region Italy annexed from Austria after 1918 , and which is still mostly German-speaking . ) The soldiers have even stumbled into controversy over a new videogame . \u201cBattlefield I\u201d features Alpini fighting on Monte Grappa . The head of the national Alpini association said that \u201cdelicate themes , like war , need to be dealt with differently.\u201d The beautiful stock of canti Alpini promises to do just that\u2014long after memories of the 2018 commemorations wisp into the mountain air .",Romance,Italian

This really surprised me , but at the same makes sense : \\n\\n & gt ; Russia plays a part in aggravating the migration crisis and especially in using it for propaganda and gaining influence . When it comes to the events in Cologne or other sexual offences they are active in emphasising that the German or Western authorities and the media are attempting to cover up these crimes.\\n\\nSo , for Russia a strong united EU is really an obstacle . I guess a political obstacle because they can not influence countries that are part of it . They would really prefer if the EU was dismantled and the tool to do it exist .

MarsNirgal,europe,"I don\\'t know if anyone else who replied is gay , but I am , so I thought maybe I\\ 'd offer some extra insight on this . \\n\\n & gt ; Is Mexico tolerant of LGBT people ? \\n\\nYes and no . As most if not all countries , Mexico has a certain \ '' macho\ '' , ultramasculine culture that can make things hard for people like trans women and gay men ( and even lesbians , since they\\ 're seen as challenging men\\ 's manhood ) . \\n\\nAlso , Catholicism still has a lot of cultural power ( although not as much political power since we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country ) . But overall , I\\ 'd say we\\ 're improving . I\\ 've had three jobs and in none of them my sexual orientation was a problem . \\n\\nBack in 2009 , gays couldn\\'t marry anywhere in the country . Right now we can get married in 10 out of the 31 states of Mexico , including 28 % of the population and our three largest cities , and those marriages are legally recognized in all the country . \\n\\nEven more so , this year our Supreme Court stated that forbidding equal marriage is anticonstitutional , and our president ( whom I hate and I think is really bad for other reasons , but he had to something good at least once ) is working on a proposal to legalize equal marriage for all the states . \\n\\nThere has been a movement against it , of course . Last weekend we had marches in over 20 cities opposing equal marriage , but I think we\\ 're winning.\\n\\nWe\\ 're still a long way to go . People from the cities have it a lot better than people from rural communities ( I met a couple of gays from the country once , and the level of self-repression they endure is disheartening ) , LGBT people , particularly trans women , are still sometimes beaten , raped or killed , but overall , I think we\\ 're getting better , so fast that sometimes we don\\'t even realize it . \\n\\n & gt ; Does Roman Catholicism still strongly influence the country ? \\n\\nOh , dear ... \\n\\nOkay , let\\ 's go there . An overwhelming majority of Mexicans are Roman Catholic . That means they were baptized , made their communion , have religious weddings , and a lot of them go to mass every Sunday . The level of involvement varies a lot , for some it\\ 's just something the do , for some others is taken very seriously . \\n\\nOn the other hand , we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country and some other people take that very seriously . I recall a couple times when our national Anthem was sung in churches and people threw a fit , or when our then president kissed the pope\\ 's hand and there was a big uproar . Overall , any open attempt from the church to intervene in politics and ( kind of ) in society finds resistance from the left . This holds true mostly for the cities , people in small towns and rural communities are way more involved with religion . \\n\\nWhen you combine these two situations you end with a country that has deep and strong religious convictions , but has them at odds with political and social trends . The bigger the city , the more the secular side wins , the smaller the community , the more power is wielded by religion . \\n\\nRecently we\\ 're seeing a some sort of power struggle between those trends , taking equal marriage as a cause belle . There have been a lot of marches against federal equal marriage proposals , and of course the church is behind them , regardless of if they admit it or not . \\n\\nI think we\\ 're reaching , slowly but steadily , a certain equilibrium , in which people with sincerely held beliefs will live by them but will let other people live their lives . \\n\\nIt will be a long time before we get there , though .",Romance,Spanish

MarsNirgal,europe,"The biggest differences I can think with Spain : \\n\\n* Where Spaniards use \ '' vosotros\ '' we use \ '' ustedes\ '' . The verb conjugation changes accordingly , they say \ '' vosotros hac\u00e9is\ '' and we say \ '' ustedes hacen\ '' . \\n\\n* Spaniards use a lot more the composite past : \ '' He hecho\ '' instead of \ '' Hice\ '' . ( They reserve simple past for things that are well in the past ) . \\n\\n* One of my favorites : Spanish students \ '' give class\ '' and the teacher \ '' takes the class\ '' , while Mexican students \ '' take class\ '' and the teacher \ '' gives the class\ '' . \\n\\n* There are , of course , words that have different meanings . \ '' Coger\ '' in Spain means just \ '' to take\ '' or \ '' to grab\ '' , while in Mexico it has those meanings , but it also means \ '' to fuck.\ '' \\n\\n* Spaniards curse a lot more . We use more double entendre . \\n\\nNow about music , prepare yourself for a flood of awesome . I\\ 'm gon na give you a lot of artists , each with a whole playlist ( or a loooooong video with a lot of songs ) and then a couple links to my favorite song/s of each artist .

Here\\ 's [ Mujeres Divinas ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gfX0ijwj1mw ) \\n\\n [ Pedro Infante ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=L9WHPPPG0ak ) was an actor and singer and the incarnation of the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema . Here\\ 's [ B\u00e9same morenita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=oMpjONW-Y94 ) and a funny duet with [ Jorge Negrete ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kHEhw0DTwnw ) \\n\\n [ Lucha Villa ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=0J4mmybyi6o & amp ; list=PLEE8688C1287B9A25 ) ( I haven\\'t heard that much of her , sadly ) \\n\\nA little less known , but I love her , [ Estela N\u00fa\u00f1ez ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Amv9X-q69_c ) My favorite song from her is probably [ El sauce y la palma ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4KxLgqwjKQE ) \\n\\n [ Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MZN0fVdsN20 & amp ; list=PL0DZg7zLu-KaEwh6mNcRAeNY6tJ73_MEz ) . My favorite song from him is actually not Mexican but Puerto Rican : [ Lamento borincano . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=sj1925V7hew ) \\n\\n [ Tr\u00edo Los Panchos ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=37G9Om5RnuQ ) ( Trios are a fixture of Mexican folk music , Los Panchos are the most famous of them ) . Here are they singing [ Quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zdJ0KLJ3PmQ ) \\n\\n [ Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=05dcxPp62BQ & amp ; list=PL3EB848B98A657DE0 ) ( He\\ 's kinda modern folk mixed with pop , and he\\ 's in my opinion a great vocalist ) My favorite song from him is , hands down , [ Como quien pierde una estrella . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MXlwuZ_nEk0 ) \\n\\nOldies but goodies : \\n [ Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=S2icmNLT8B8 ) , one of the greatest vocalists from Mexico . It\\ 's hard to pick a song from him , but I\\ 'd go for [ M\u00e1s . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=yVOlIYCefq4 ) \\n\\n [ Armando Manzanero ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=2F5mJsfxWIg ) . Not my favorite song , but I\\ 'm gon na brag that [ Somos novios ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ClU-0tPHXIY ) is the original version of \ '' It\\ 's impossible\ '' by Perry Como . \\n\\n [ Luis Miguel ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c-wsjSkgoa8 ) ( This is kinda folk/pop , btw ) I like a lot his version of [ Mi Ciudad . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=juq9VYl31GU ) \\n\\n ( Yes , he officialy qualifies as \ '' oldies but goodies\ '' . No one tell him ) \\n\\nPop : \\n\\nI\\ 've been a lot of touch with Mexican pop because I mostly hear European pop ( specifically , Eurovision . You don\\'t know how jealous I am that you guys are in Eurovision and we aren\\'t ) , so most of the pop I post will be slightly dated ( or very dated in some cases ) \\n\\n [ Gloria Trevi ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CjXbluRyHE4 & amp ; list=PLIS-NM3fM9AMet6qkht596KXq5l3MBWDm ) . She\\ 's an extremely controversial artists by farily good reasons . Always since she started her career she pushed the boundaries of political correctness . In the early nineties she released a string of widely successful and polemic discs in which she discussed religion , abortion , sex and a lot of other stuff Mexican society wasn\\'t comfortable discussing . \\n\\nThen in 2000 she was arrested an accused of being part of a ring of child abuse that involved most of her backup singers and dancers . Then she got pregnant in prison , she claimed that she was raped while the prison authorities claimed she got smuggled sperm from her manager and faked the abuse . At the end she was released for lack of evidence , and after ten years out of the spotlight , she returned stronger than ever . \\n\\nShe\\ 's still quite controversial , with people believing that she was part of the abuse ring , while others believe she was a victim of it . I prefer not to think about it and just enjoy her music . \\n\\nA lot of her more current songs deal with self-reliance and liberation , which is something I like a lot . Also , she\\ 's become a gay icon , kinda like the Mexican Lady Gaga ( except she was doing Gaga before Gaga was doing solid food ) \\n\\nI would be hard-pressed to name a single song of her , so I\\ 'll put several . I hope you enjoy : \\n\\n* [ Todos me miran ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TP7Kh2gWL8g ) \\n\\n* [ Me r\u00edo de ti ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=P6A-kw41eEk ) \\n\\n* [ Lo que una chica por amor es capaz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ylfUkPD3IOA ) \\n\\n* [ Sabes ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=SCGrh7Ibg6k ) \\n\\n* [ No soy un p\u00e1jaro ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=EknNH7U90fA ) ( Warning : This song is HEAVY on double entendres and sexual innuendo . It\\ 's the kind of thing only she would dare to sing ) \\n\\nAlso , a classic from my childhood is the kid/youth band [ Timbiriche . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8Sc7XgsnhY4 & amp ; list=PL2E6A9599E3C49158 & amp ; index=2 ) My favorite song from them is [ Si no es ahora . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CovfI2ij39o ) \\n\\n [ OV7 and Kabah ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pmYtefifbx0 & amp ; list=PLjMhKRttBctyPVNujwskInxGABOeIforS ) are a couple bands that were quite succesfful . ( Sorry , I found a joint playlist and I\\ 'm feeling kinda lazy ) . OV7 was formed as \ '' Onda Vaselina\ '' a long time ago but then they lost the rights to their name in a dispute with their managers , so now they just go for the initials . My favorite song from them is [ Un pie tras otro pie . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BusFo75x3NA ) . About Kabah I\\ 'm gon na go for what I know and give you a song from a former member , [ No soy una se\u00f1ora ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=j5T1cYY-s8E ) by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 . \\n\\nGaribaldi is already vintage , ( late eighties , early nineties ) , my favorite songs from them are [ Que te la pongo ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UmDBmSTbuls ) y [ Tengo una bolita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kFrD9Cidujk ) . \\n\\nPaulina Rubio is quite a successful singer . I don\\'t listen to much by her , but I like [ Ni una sola palabra ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Kkdhtb9DVWQ ) \\n\\n ( Yeah .

The choice many illegal immigrants are faced with isn\\'t between legally immigrationg or illegally immigrating ; it\\ 's between poor economic prospects or illegally immigrating and simply saying \ '' well they should just come legally and follow the rules damnit ! \ '' is the rethorical equivalente of covering your ears and saying \ '' na na na na I can\\'t hear you\ '' .\\n\\nI repeat : This doesn\\'t mean that there shouldn\\'t be rules or proceedures or that they shouldn\\'t be followed , but the mere existence of a rule is not enough ( at least for me ) to justify its enforcement .

There is a wider gap between West Europe-Romania than Mexico-USA in even so West Europe offers totally open borders to Romanians , in part because is rational , but also because Europe is beyond \ '' we are # 1\ '' idiocracy that currently defines US mentality . In 1990 US was by far a bigger economy than EU , today Europe is the biggest economic engine in the world . \\n\\nYou say 23 % of people in Switzerland are non-born Switzerlands , so what ? There was 200 % more people in 2010 than in 1910 living in Switzerland and nothing bad happened .

aarkerio,europe,"You are getting Labor Productivity all wrong , which is , I\\ 'm afraid , a very common mistake.\\n\\nNon economists automatically link \ '' Labor Productivity\ '' with concepts like \ '' Work Ethics\ '' or \ '' being motivated\ '' which is **not the case at all** . For instance , Mexicans who cross the border daily to work in a factory at Arizona increase their productivity 500 % over the average Mexican , they are in fact more productive than Japanese or British workers , that is not because they work 500 % harder or they are 500 % more motivated . Germans who travel to work at Colombia are 600 % less productive when they get down from the airplane , and that is not because there is a magic magnetic field in the Atlantic that changes people\\ 's levels of motivation . \\n\\nLabor Productivity is defined by the \ '' context of production\ '' , which is the sum of technology + education + investment level + infrastructure in a particular area . Personal efforts are good and welcomed , but they have a small relevance when we\\ 're talking about creating wealth in a modern scale . Doesn\\'t matter how hard and how early in the morning a baker starts his work doing muffins , if other baker , lazy and unmotivated , has an automated muffin machine and a powerful software to handle the factory processes , the lazy baker will get more and more money and eventually the hard-work baker will go to the bankruptcy .",Romance,Spanish

Miguel Hidalgo screamed \ '' Viva Fernando VII\ '' , the night he declared the Independence War .

anairam_macias,AskEurope,"I\\ 'm a Mexican , so I thought I could offer some thoughts on our end , after reading all of the comments . \\n\\nA little background on me , because this does influences the view on Spain from Mexicans , I am female , upper class , mid 20\\ 's , my last name is not common in Mexico but it is in Spain ( or at least more common than in here ) , and in Mexico I\\ 'm considered \ '' white\ '' ( people here associate skin color with social class ) , I work in politics ( translator and interpreter , but I work for a major political party ) .\\n\\nYou have to understand that Mexico is a very classicist country , there\\ 's the rich people , the work class or middle class and the poor , often people of indigenous-descent , and it\\ 's not common for people of different categories to mix outside the employer-employee relationship . Rich people\\ 's kids don\\'t go to the same schools as middle class kids , and more often than not , people from the lower social classes opt out of school to get a job and afford their food . And this is not only for which school kids go to , it\\ 's from the places people buy their food and clothing from , where they go on vacation , places they hang out , etc . This of course , makes people resentful with the upper class . And you\\ 'll find that this upper class , is mostly made up of people with Spanish or European descent . So this lower social class is ( generally ) the one that shows more resentment towards Spain and Europe in general , even to the U.S for \ '' stealing our land\ '' ( I know that\\ 's inaccurate , but that\\ 's how people see it ) , and people from my social circle tend to be more \ '' forgiving\ '' and refer to Spain as \ '' La Madre Patria\ '' ( Motherland ) . There\\ 's even a ( bad ) joke going around gatherings of a Political Party from here , that we \ '' should ask for Spain\\ 's forgiveness for attempting to gain independence from them , and beg them to take us back and get us out of the third world\ '' . Kind of fucked up , but that\\ 's how it goes . So you\\ 'll see that the resentment is wildly opposing depending on what social class is the person being questioned about it . \\n\\nNow about immigration , most people from upper class go to Europe , and lower class , to the US and Canada . Most people who choose the EU to go on vacation or for a longer stay , don\\'t have Spain as their first choice , though . Me for example , would never live in the U.S. , but that\\ 's because I have the choice not to , and can afford to live in a EU country . I was in Spain for a month , and although people in Mexico say that they treat you badly after they notice you\\ 're a mexican , I did not experienced this , but they did seemed surprised that I am white-skinned.\\n\\nAbout the whole \ '' stealing our gold\ '' thing , this is indeed common to hear among all social classes . In elementary school , they teach us that before Spain came , we had a civilization ( that some may call savage ) that worked , we lived in harmony and were happy . So comparing that to our current situation , this alone will set some resentment and idealization of our past culture , a longing for peace that was \ '' stolen\ '' from us . They also teach us that when they came along they brought disease , corruption and death , which is our current situation . \\n\\nSo in general I would say that most mexicans do not hate Spain , but we are encouraged to have some sort of resentment towards them and what \ '' they\ '' did to Mexico .

Of course , the US Federal Government also debated moral hazard when they bailed-out its financial system . \\n\\nMy counter-point is that you can\\'t expect Germany to behave as the Federal Government of Europe , unless , of course , you want a Europe ruled by Germany . Spain needs to bail out its own banks , but obviously , it doesn\\'t have enough money to do this , so what do they do ? They ask for a bailout . I know that , right now , Spain is pretending they don\\'t need a bailout , but you , me , Rajoy , and everyone knows very well that they are not fooling anyone.\\n\\nIf you are implying that , somehow , this is the reason why Germany ( or Europe in general ) had an obligation to bail out Greece , so that they could in turn bail-out their own banks , as Spain will do , then you are forgetting that Greece and Spain are different countries , with different structural issues . Spain\\ 's issue is its medieval banking structure . Greece\\ 's issue is government corruption and untrustworthiness . Moral Hazard can take a back seat because the parties involved are not equally trustworthy , nor do their issues reflect similar urgencies : Spain may be better equipped to deal with the financial catastrophe than Greece . After all , Spain does have productive infrastructure.\\n\\nWhich is why I return to my point . There is no \ '' real\ '' solution except dismantling the Euro or instituting a centralized Federal Government for Europe . The bailout of Greece , the fiscal tightening , the talk , the posturing , they are all band-aids which won\\'t last long and may make the problems worse .

hseldon10,europe,"It helps that I am not a part of the EU . In 1995 , my country was the beneficiary of a bailout , but we paid it back in record time ( back then ) , and have since had continous growth . We have lower unemployment than the US , and we are going to grow our economy by 5 % this year , with minimum inflation . Oh , also , we did not request a bailout nor did we need one after the 2008 financial crisis . Our currency is stronger than 3 years ago , too.\\n\\nFor years countries from Europe and North America had lectured my country how to do things . When we finally did it a bit differently , we are now in a better position . So , forgive me if I\\ 'm a bit judgemental . But it is my opinion that all of the PIIGs countries could\\ 've done a lot better with their management . True , Germany is on the line , but it isn\\'t at all the German\\ 's fault for what the smaller countries are going through . Germany did not ask Greece to overspend on their olympics . Germany did not ask Spain to give away Real Estate as if it was a freebie . And Germany certainly did not tell Ireland to guarantee 100 % of the deposits of the Irish banks.\\n\\nThe issue is that , now that all of these instances of irrational exhuberance are problems , now and only now have they become \ '' European problems\ '' . But they weren\\'t \ '' European issues\ '' back then , were they ? What would\\ 've Greece said if Germany or Britain asked them to be more fiscally responsible back then ? These problems are of a national origin , and now those nationalities want an international solution . It is better to have one , to be sure , but penalties must also be given , and assurances that the bailout will be paid back and that the national conditions that led to the crisis will be remedied . If you find them harsh , I am sure Germany is sorry about it , but there really is no choice . Otherwise , what incentive would countries in the euro zone have to behave properly ? \\n\\nAddition : It just occured to me , fiscal and monteray policy should be employed on matching geographies . The main issue is that you have 25 or more different fiscal policies throughout the region with one single monetary policy . If you want a single currency , you need a single government .

Obviously , the Unions in charge in the Rich Countries will oppose this.\\n\\n- Global tax rates and global transparency means less opportunities for corruption . Politicians in highly corrupt states will oppose this as well.\\n\\n- Global interest rates and a global currency reduces the ability of individual regions to direct the economic growth of their region through artificial means , such as printing currency.\\n\\n- International public schools are a threat to those that need their people to be uneducated , such as highly religious states like the muslim Middle East and Africa , and the christian Americas.\\n\\n- Universal international health care and welfare states hurt the companies that benefit from inequalities as well .

By the way , a random comment in Reddit does not at all have the same power as , say , a condition in an international trade agreement.\\n\\nOtherwise , I agree with what you are saying , but , ultimately , it wasn\\'t the German government who sponsored this \ '' irrational exhuberance\ '' of Irish banks ; it was German private investors and banks . Let them fail . If Germany wants to bail THEM out , then that is a German decision . Germany shouldn\\'t interfere , positively or negatively , in Irish decision . If Ireland decided to , on their own , back their banks 100 % at the expense of their people , that is Ireland\\ 's problem , not Germany\\ 's .

Aristotle was easier to translate back in 12th century , many of his texts were translated to other languages , Arab , Medieval greek ( thanks to Photios ) and classical Latin . Boethius translated Aristotle\\ 's \ '' Categories\ '' from old-greek to classical Latin in the 6th century , and it found a way to survive in western Europe until it was discovered in the 12th century , which was the basis for the translation for all of his work , so Aristotle\\ 's work had a lot of luck , so many others\\ ' didn\\'t .",Romance,Spanish

The emptiness of streets in American cities ( with the exception of NYC and maybe Boston ) is astonishing and disturbing .

Many years ago I was in a mid-sized American city and decided to walk around to get familiar with the place . After walking many blocks on the empty sidewalks , finally a living soul appears in the distance , walking on the same sidewalk towards me . The soul walks closer to me and , when the distance between us was about 30 m ... steps off the sidewalk , crossed the street and continues walking on the other side ! I didn\\'t know back then that people there were afraid by default , and thought that person didn\\'t like me or something . Later my host said to me she was worried about me walking around because \ '' there are a lot of criminals everywhere\ '' . I was puzzled : what am I supposed to do , live in constant voluntary imprisonment ? Why did I come here then ? \\n\\nA famous Russian designer and traveller Artemy Lebedev has an interesting travel blog with pictures from most countries in the world . He noticed that phenomenon as well , in Dallas : \\n\\n & gt ; Earlier in America it was like everywhere - the riches lived in the center , the servants in the suburbs . After the abolition of serfdom segregation , blacks were allowed to live anywhere , because the separation into blacks and whites had been erased . Well of course they began to settle in the center . But to the whites , this situation was not pleasant - it is difficult to get used to that in one day . Therefore , whites en masse began buying suburban real estate , moving in in clusters . Actually , in the whole country , mixed-race areas are extremely rare , despite all the propaganda.\\n\\n & gt ; So , in the city centers there were only offices left . Therefore , the people on the streets in a typical American city can be seen at the beginning of the working day , at lunch time a little bit , and at the end of the working day . And we must bear in mind that all go only by cars.\\n\\n & gt ; Officially , the US is the third most populous country after China and India .

que_pedo_wey,europe,"- In secondary school , children learn next to nothing ( but for Americans , this is a lot of learning ) ; those who excel ( by their standards ) , go to university and give a blank stare in class at something that is routinely covered in middle school in Europe ( my teaching experience ) .\\n\\n- Universities and schools are primarily associated with sports , not intellectual activity ; it\\ 's apparently not popular to be a learner here . The exception could be a few best universities like MIT , Stanford or Princeton . I was asked countless times for which football team I \ '' root\ '' ; when I say I don\\'t care about anything of the kind , people are surprised . At my place in Europe where I grew up , none of the people I know are sports fans . The latter still exist , but mostly among working class , not university students.\\n\\n- There are places where you can be legally put to jail for having beer at home , like in some Afghanistan . Forget about having a beer in the street either.\\n\\n- Stupefying ignorance of the large portion of the population , and wilful ignorance when it comes to new information . A man tried to convince me that \ '' in god we trust\ '' is in the US constitution and most people in Israel worshipped Christ ; my attempts to tell him the facts failed . A technique very popular among Americans is this : when faced with uncomfortable facts ( not just opinions or attitudes about something that already happens or exists ) , they would say \ '' I heard you and I disagree\ '' ; understanding the absurdity of this is absent , since they also disagree with this statement about absurdity.\\n\\n- Unusually high number of religious extremists and fundamentalists - probably due to the items above.\\n\\n- Ghost-looking towns . I was once in a small town in its centre on a working day in the afternoon and I was scared by being the only person around . Where are the people ? ! Apparently , they are either indoors or in cars.\\n\\n- Cars are very popular . My lack of ability to drive and thus having no driving licence produces surprise in a lot of people . I am not looking forward to owning a car.\\n\\n- No architecture .

0ffliner,europe,"By \ '' European like minded\ '' I was referring to the liberty to critique anything , from simple things like bad parenting till the governmental problems .

And Chechens are the luckiest ones in the whole R.F.\\n\\nThe politics kind of bind together with the economics , they\\ 're angry on the US sanction because they think that US is the evil warmonger that wishes only destruction and chaos , and while they\\ 're believing that Russian culture is based solely on resistance and defensive wars ( Most of them think that they had all the rights to annex Crimea ) .\\nAbout oligarchs I\\ 'm not even talking , Putin is kind of the boss of this mafia-state , or so it seems that he\\ 's the honcho . State media is controlled by Kremlin and most Russians believe it without checking also the western channels , thus their opinion is based from one point of view.\\n\\nI\\ 'm sorry that I had to write this Shakespearean play but otherwise I don\\'t know if you would\\ 've understood my point of view .",Romance,Romanian

We have little in common with the modern French .

Instead , in order for the employee to be able to fill in the global income statement in the following year , the employer is required , according to the project , to \ '' send / disclose to each income beneficiary a document containing at least the following information : Of the taxpayer\\ 's net income during the year until the last day of February of the current year for the previous year . \ '' \\n\\nThe executive has not yet established the companies in its composition , not even the governance structure Income taxpayers for self-employment will no longer retain income tax at source , and this revenue category will be subject to the global household tax . Bankers escapes the retention of depositors\\ ' taxes The withholding obligation is also eliminated for investment income . At present , 16 % of interest income on spot and forward deposits as well as on Bauspar savings and lending in the housing sector is calculated and retained by banks at the time of registration in the holders\\ ' accounts , Being then fully paid to the state budget by the 25th of the month following the account entry . After the introduction of the new system of global taxation of households , according to the project obtained by Profit.ro , the banks escape the obligation to calculate and withhold tax , but must communicate to each deponent a physical person in written form the statement of income / losses registered annually , also submitting to ANAF Annual declarations for each taxpayer who is a customer : Thus , Article 97 , paragraph 9 of the draft , provides that payers of such investment income have the following obligations : \ '' ( A ) the calculation of the income / loss for each individual ; \\n\\nB ) the transmission to each person who obtains income / loss of information on the total incomes / losses , in written form , made in the fiscal year , until the last day of the current year for the previous year ; \\n\\nC ) submit annually , by the last day of February of the current year , for the previous year , to the competent fiscal body an informative statement on the total income / losses for each taxpayer \ '' \\n\\nTL ; DR : We\\ 're getting the American tax system , here .

Regionally , you\\ 'll find more shared beliefs and traditions , however.\\n\\nNot to mention that the EU will never , and should never , be a country . It\\ 's a big mess right now , caused by its attempts to envelop most of the functions that properly should be performed by a sovereign state : minting currency , defense , and organizing its political system.\\n\\nAlso , the bureaucracy needed to run an entire continent ( or at least a big portion of it ) will be staggering , and I know cases where ordinary people have been screwed over due to EU regulations and their ilk . Not to mention that the current of internationalization that affects us today is affecting the national identity of the states in a very negative way ; instead of working for companies in the motherland , people instead have jobs working for foreign companies , feeding more money to Germany than to Romania.\\n\\nAnd the guys in Bruxelles have no way of knowing what is best for Romania , for example . Over the time , the countries on the European continent have developed individual cultures , which , while influenced by their neighbors , are still distinct . So , what might be a good idea for some countries in Western Europe may be a disaster for the East . Attempting to smooth out the differences between East and West would never turn out well in a sane world , and it goes against the Uniunea lu\\'peste\\ 's motto \ '' unity in diversity\ '' . If the Union truly respected that , then they wouldn\\'t attempt to slowly drive us into abandoning our old , slower-paced way of life for the urban-centered hustle-bustle of the West . Both might have their flaws , but a foreign model is very bad if imported rapidly .

Refuge started fucking crying even when they realized they ended up crossing the romanian border by mistake , how dafuq do you think that felt to us ? It was very offensive , I\\ 'll tell you that . \\n\\nAnyhow , so here\\ 's the issue , it\\ 's all about politics really . When western politicians such as Merkel saw a political benefit in being the mother of \ '' refugees\ '' she went all in for it , with many politicians from Netherlands , France , the Nordic countries etc . The only reason why the western media ( which is just as much propaganda as russian propaganda really ) went so harshly on eastern states was because they did not buy into that . In eastern Europe being an all for more refugees politician was not bringing political capital , it was actually destroying you politically . Thus eastern politicians didn\\'t buy into their play , and they went to place their own opinions against it . That was all they had at the point , a different opinion , but they got called racists , bigots , nazi\\ 's and what not for it ! How would you not be frustrated at the western Euros after you get that treatment just for not being as idiotically PC as them ? Of course , some leaders saw a way to win political capital from this and they went and created a shit show from the issue themselves , such as Orban in Hungary , the current leaders in the V4 as a more extensive example . And that was probably what went in your face so much that it annoyed you , but it wasn\\'t at all different from what western european politicians did to us , it was exactly the same as a matter of fact , just on the other side . So don\\'t you think you are a bit hypocritical when you are using a clear double measure like that ? \\n\\nWhat I wanted to say is , that while I do support helping refugees and am a very educated person , I could not help but agree with most eastern politicians on the issue . They correctly noticed that the entire solution of distribution was a complete shit and only done to offer the fake impression that something is done , it was only done for the political capital of western politicians , and they didnt want to commit political suicide in their own countries just for the western once to save face , how could I accuse them for that ? For any open minded person there reaction was totally natural , even though exaggerated in some cases ( Viktor Orban ) . \\n\\nNow back to the issue , that did not stop western Euros , such as you , from shitting on eastern Euros for that , which in truth , was you throwing shit on us for having a different opinion on the issue from you . Take me for example , do you think I was against helping the refugees ? I never was , I am not even now . But the solutions proposed by the west were simply idiotic , the problem had to be solved at the core , around Syria , were most refugees live , were all those women and children who can not make the trip are . Send money to Lebanon , to Turkey , to Egypt , make those country help their brothers , they are of the same culture after all . Who could understand them better than their own kind ? And yet , for simply having this different view on the solution , I got so much shit from people like you , how could I not get sick really ? \\n\\nNow a final example , take the politicians of Romania , they were more moderate on the issue . They voted against the mandatory quotas as they believed they were not a solution , however they did not oppose the relocation as it was enforced by the EU . They even started doing it , by now I think they got like 30 refugees here . Why so little you wonder ? They should be above 4500 coming here . Well , that\\ 's because the fucking relocation hubs in Italy and Greece are not working , they are not even fucking operational . That\\ 's how much the EU actually cared about their relocation project , so much it doesn\\'t even work even if you want to do it . But of course , it was never meant to work , it was always just a facade for the masses . The only reason you are pissed is because eastern Europeans didn\\'t buy into your charade , and for that we ANNOY you ? How hypocritical is that really , and because you are annoyed by that I am annoyed for your annoyance ! Isn\\'t life really a wonder in the end ? : ) ) \\n\\nYou are also completely ignoring the very fundamental part of how much western Europe is getting from the eastern open markets and their economical growth which overflows in the west too ... . currently eastern European nations are kinda the engine behind the sluggish growth that the EU is even having as a matter of fact , but let\\ 's not go there , because I feel I would have to start another long long argument about that with you . \\n\\nPS : I agree on the LGBT issue , still lots of things to solve . It\\ 's mainly due to the people being hard core religious here , and that is a result of communist oppression of religion . You western Euros forget or ignore too much that most eastern countries were still a dictatorship 26 years ago . Actually in Romania\\ 's case I would say the communist rule only fell somewhere in the 2000\\ 's , which you can even see on our GDP graphs , the entire decade from 1990-2000 was a complete waste , nothing moved here , just things got demolished . But for what we achieved in just 16 years and the amazingly fast improvements we are doing I can only be proud of my country , and if you can not see that it\\ 's because of your long nose , not because of my peoples\\ ' lack of efforts . So I am sorry , but I\\ 'm not sorry at all ! ; ) \\n\\n Have a nice day .",Romance,Romanian

It will still happen , however . Should the referendum in November not happen , there\\ 'd be advance elections for the Catalan parliament , where parties would be polarized on the issue and people would vote them accordingly . If the recent EU elections meant anything , ERC would win again , with an absolute majority . That party has already had \ '' Independence for Catalonia\ '' as the core of their electoral program for many years , and they\\ 'd be supported by the other parties that are also for independence now ( 2/3rd of current parliament , likely more after these elections ) . After these , independence negotiations would , too , start.\\n\\nIf , even with the expressed will of the people supporting them , these negotiations failed ... unilateral declaration of independence would follow .

The article goes : \\n\\n & gt ; Under Spain\\ 's constitution a region \ '' can not unilaterally call a referendum on self-determination to decide on its integration in Spain\ '' , according to a written summary of the ruling released by the Constitutional Court.\\n\\nProblem is , there\\ 's no request for a referendum ( binding ) coming from Catalonia . Catalonia has asked for something else entirely , that is , a consultation ( which is non-binding ) . That\\ 's completely legal and that\\ 's Spain\\ 's government current nightmare.\\n\\nWhat Spanish government doesn\\'t want is for the actual numbers ( how much support independence really has ) to be known , no matter what , because they don\\'t like what the polls on the matter look like ( yes wins at least 2:1 ) . And that\\ 's a battle they can\\'t win . There\\ 's nothing illegal about a consultation in the Spanish framework . Even if somehow they actually manage to stop the consultation from happening by November 9 ( e.g . : by sending the military to kidnap the urns ... what a joke ) , that would only delay things slightly . The Catalan can and will hold elections should that happen . Parties will then no doubt be organized as independence yes/no . So what the Catalan want will be known.\\n\\nAfter that , I can\\'t picture a scenario where the Catalan want independence and don\\'t end up getting it , one way or another .

Was surprised to see there were people behind us as we didn\\'t see them when we were walking along the path.\\n\\nWe turned and saw green gooey stuff were on our back and on my friend\\ 's backpack , the stuff was runny and has an unpleasant smell , we looked at each other in disgust and not knowing what to do .

After \ '' helping\ '' me they hurried off , before I had a chance to thank them properly . I did reached into my bag and felt my wallet , didn\\'t look into it until I got home , the 700kr I had were gone . \\n\\nI didn\\'t feel or see her hand when it happened , I was lucky she only took the cash but not cards or even the whole wallet . I also know they were South Americans because of their Spanish accents when they spoke to each other . \\n\\nWhen I reported to the police they said they have not heard of that scam/trick before but there were lots of petty thef during that Summer . They said maybe because it was during \ '' Love Week\ '' , lots of tourists were in Stockholm to see the royal wedding , increasing tourists number also attact professional thieves from abroad . \\n\\nI\\ 've been to some dodgy places , that was the first and so far only time I was pickpocketed *knock on wood* .

A-mad33,europe,"I believe that the most damaging effect to the UK is going to be when the EU says banks and financial services headquartered in Britain no longer have free access to the market . \\n\\n10 % or higher of the UK economy is based on financial services and they\u00b4re mostly headquartered in London because of low taxes , unrestricted access to the EU markets , English , it\u00b4s a good city and other factors . Recently Dublin has been stealing some of these companies but lets not forget there\u00b4s over 500 foreign banks headquartered in London . I believe that the EU is going to want to make it so difficult for these banks to operate in the EU market that they\u00b4ll have no choice but to move to a EU country and this will make Britain significantly poor because most of the service sector depends on a massive economic surplus from such a beneficial amount of activity in the city of London of banks and financial services .",Romance,Spanish
A-mad33,europe,"I can appreciate your opinion and discussion but I still strongly disagree . For starters New york is a larger financial centre than London . The lack of access to the EU market is going to be a deciding factor in making these companies and banks move from London . \\n\\nUK\u00b4s GDP purchasing power is ranked 9th in the world followed very closely by France . ( The drop in the pound actually made France overtake you but I\u00b4ll concede that for now ) Germany has a far higher purchasin power than Britain . \\n\\nMany companies have been moving in the last 4 years from London to Dublin because Dublin has a lower corporate tax rate hence why per capita Ireland is doing a lot better than Britain with 65k a year compared to Britain\u00b4s 41k a year . This is particularly noteworthy seeing as Ireland had a massive financial crisis in 2008-2009 and Britain\u00b4s was quite small . \\n\\nI don\u00b4t remember what you\u00b4re talking about the ECB and it\u00b4s competencies would you be kind enough to send me a link ? Doesn\u00b4t make much sense to me really . The services wouldn\u00b4t move to the ECB because the ECB is a central bank it doesn\u00b4t house financial services it\u00b4s just a bank ... ... .. they would move to either Dublin , Frankfurt , Paris or in my hope Madrid ( i\u00b4m from Madrid : P ) .\\n\\nI can\u00b4t get my head around what you\u00b4re saying about trade , perhaps you\u00b4re right but I work at a small trading company . The drop in the pound of over 25 % has made British exports extremely competitive and yet even though your exports are more competitive your exports have not increased .",Romance,Spanish
A-mad33,AskEurope,Your comment did not change my opinion . An individual fleeing a country at war stops having a need to flee war when that individual arrives at a country that is not at war .
