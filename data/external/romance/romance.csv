8rax,europe,I am living in swiss ; prefer them home for sure .,Romance,French
8rax,europe,"& gt ; I think it\\ 's also important to mention that French universities do not have the same prestige as their German or British counterparts . If you study computer science / technology , we have \ '' engineering schools\ '' that are more expensive and have very strong links with the industry . Those schools work very well . But you have to pay.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; We also have a system of \ '' grandes \u00e9coles\ '' ( elite schools ) in which you need to pass an exam ( more of a contest ) to enter . Those are the cool ones which get the funding . As said in the article , these are not accessible to everyone . It\\ 's mostly \ '' I know this guy who knows this guy\ '' . Very common in France.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; In general , French universities are considered cheap education , with all that it entails . Few teachers , infrastructure falling into pieces . But if you plan to study humanities , the university is pretty much your only solution . \\n\\n\\nOh god , you say so much bullshit it is quite clear that you have no idea how the grandes ecoles/ecoles d\\'ingenieur works ... \\n\\n* Most/a great number of \u00e9coles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur are free , source : I graduated from one of them\\n* grandes ecoles = ecoles d\\'ing\u00e9nieur by the way.\\n* most of them ( if not all ) are accessible to anyone , some you can enter with good grades others with a national concours = on merit . Nothing to do with \ '' knowing someone\ '' or whatever . You can enter everywhere if you are good enough . \\n* you can study human sciences in prepa litt\u00e9raire as well , in science po ... You have also good choices for this kind of studies . \\n* Lot of top tier schools are outside or Paris ( Most of them ) \\n\\n\\nThe only points I can agree on is that the infrastructures for the public universities ( faculties ) are often quite old and not very sexy + that the universities of France have less visibility than their counterparts in England/the USA . I would blame this on the separation between engineering school/business schools and regular universities . If you combine all of them together in a city then you might have something which can stand up to big campuses in the UK . But we chose to have the faculties + grandes ecoles and business schools apart.\\n\\nSome of our Business schools are top notch ( Insead MBA , HEC paris , ESSEC.. ) , some of our grandes ecoles are also top notch but less visible due to the concurrence of big monsters like Harvard/Oxford/Cambridge.\\n\\n",Romance,French

They say that if the Italians won\\'t accept the 50/50 proposal , they\\ 'll use their refusal right.\\n\\n- The previous agreement planned for 48 % for Fincantieri , 6 % for Fondazione CR , 33 % for the French state and the rest for Naval Group ( DCNS ) . The \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' was supposed to make it so that Fincantieri wouldn\\'t control a majority , but the Italians would still be able to buy it.\\n\\n- Since the Italians now said they won\\'t accept a new agreement and want a full majority , the \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' thing is shown to be a trick.\\n\\n- The previous agreement was made in 2008 because there was no refusal right for the French state . Since then they have acquired enough.\\n\\n- The Italians argue that they should be prefered to a Korean firm because they\\ 're European . The current feedback from STX is that the Korean firm was bad financially but \ '' very transparent\ '' , without technological theft.\\n\\n- Saint-Nazaire is the only plant able to build large ships for the French Navy , and is developing well on offshore renewable energy , which is seen as an important sector for France who has the second sea area in the world.\\n\\n- Fincantieri works with the Chinese for their future ships . They\\ 'll build in Shanghai the large ships that were previously made in Italy for the American Carnival Corporation . Fincantieri defends that the technology transfer is under control , but the French doubt their ability to resist to Chinese pressure , and are very wary of technology transfer to China.\\n\\n- The entire ship industry is preparing for China to offer a huge competition , supported by their state . They are very wary of any help to cover the technology gap they currently suffer . This is also the position of the German Meyer Werft . STX is considered along with Meyer Werft as among best expert for cruise ships.\\n\\n- Concerning jobs , the agreement secures them until 2026 . But 5 years later , Fincantieri would be able to decide directly the work share between its different sites . As the company belongs for 72 % to the Italian government , the French government is worried that they would prioritize work in Italy . \\n\\n- It is observed that among the company , its suppliers and customers , nobody supports the plan to go for Fincantieri . The ship-owners even went as far as proposing an alternative to the purchase agreement of 2008.\\n\\n- The French position is that their opposition has nothing to do with the nationality of the buyer . They\\ 've been under foreign ownership since 11 years , and would have accepted much more easily a merge with the German Meyer Werft.\\n\\nTLDR : The French government is worried about jobs as Fincantieri is under Italian goverment ownership and could prioritize their plants , and more importantly about technology transfer to China because Fincantieri works with them already .",Romance,French

MarsNirgal,europe,"I don\\'t know if anyone else who replied is gay , but I am , so I thought maybe I\\ 'd offer some extra insight on this . \\n\\n & gt ; Is Mexico tolerant of LGBT people ? \\n\\nYes and no . As most if not all countries , Mexico has a certain \ '' macho\ '' , ultramasculine culture that can make things hard for people like trans women and gay men ( and even lesbians , since they\\ 're seen as challenging men\\ 's manhood ) . \\n\\nAlso , Catholicism still has a lot of cultural power ( although not as much political power since we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country ) . But overall , I\\ 'd say we\\ 're improving . I\\ 've had three jobs and in none of them my sexual orientation was a problem . \\n\\nBack in 2009 , gays couldn\\'t marry anywhere in the country . Right now we can get married in 10 out of the 31 states of Mexico , including 28 % of the population and our three largest cities , and those marriages are legally recognized in all the country . \\n\\nEven more so , this year our Supreme Court stated that forbidding equal marriage is anticonstitutional , and our president ( whom I hate and I think is really bad for other reasons , but he had to something good at least once ) is working on a proposal to legalize equal marriage for all the states . \\n\\nThere has been a movement against it , of course . Last weekend we had marches in over 20 cities opposing equal marriage , but I think we\\ 're winning.\\n\\nWe\\ 're still a long way to go . People from the cities have it a lot better than people from rural communities ( I met a couple of gays from the country once , and the level of self-repression they endure is disheartening ) , LGBT people , particularly trans women , are still sometimes beaten , raped or killed , but overall , I think we\\ 're getting better , so fast that sometimes we don\\'t even realize it . \\n\\n & gt ; Does Roman Catholicism still strongly influence the country ? \\n\\nOh , dear ... \\n\\nOkay , let\\ 's go there . An overwhelming majority of Mexicans are Roman Catholic . That means they were baptized , made their communion , have religious weddings , and a lot of them go to mass every Sunday . The level of involvement varies a lot , for some it\\ 's just something the do , for some others is taken very seriously . \\n\\nOn the other hand , we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country and some other people take that very seriously . I recall a couple times when our national Anthem was sung in churches and people threw a fit , or when our then president kissed the pope\\ 's hand and there was a big uproar . Overall , any open attempt from the church to intervene in politics and ( kind of ) in society finds resistance from the left . This holds true mostly for the cities , people in small towns and rural communities are way more involved with religion . \\n\\nWhen you combine these two situations you end with a country that has deep and strong religious convictions , but has them at odds with political and social trends . The bigger the city , the more the secular side wins , the smaller the community , the more power is wielded by religion . \\n\\nRecently we\\ 're seeing a some sort of power struggle between those trends , taking equal marriage as a cause belle . There have been a lot of marches against federal equal marriage proposals , and of course the church is behind them , regardless of if they admit it or not . \\n\\nI think we\\ 're reaching , slowly but steadily , a certain equilibrium , in which people with sincerely held beliefs will live by them but will let other people live their lives . \\n\\nIt will be a long time before we get there , though .",Romance,Spanish

MarsNirgal,europe,"The biggest differences I can think with Spain : \\n\\n* Where Spaniards use \ '' vosotros\ '' we use \ '' ustedes\ '' .

( They reserve simple past for things that are well in the past ) . \\n\\n* One of my favorites : Spanish students \ '' give class\ '' and the teacher \ '' takes the class\ '' , while Mexican students \ '' take class\ '' and the teacher \ '' gives the class\ '' . \\n\\n* There are , of course , words that have different meanings . \ '' Coger\ '' in Spain means just \ '' to take\ '' or \ '' to grab\ '' , while in Mexico it has those meanings , but it also means \ '' to fuck.\ '' \\n\\n* Spaniards curse a lot more . We use more double entendre . \\n\\nNow about music , prepare yourself for a flood of awesome .

Here\\ 's [ Mujeres Divinas ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gfX0ijwj1mw ) \\n\\n [ Pedro Infante ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=L9WHPPPG0ak ) was an actor and singer and the incarnation of the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema . Here\\ 's [ B\u00e9same morenita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=oMpjONW-Y94 ) and a funny duet with [ Jorge Negrete ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kHEhw0DTwnw ) \\n\\n [ Lucha Villa ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=0J4mmybyi6o & amp ; list=PLEE8688C1287B9A25 ) ( I haven\\'t heard that much of her , sadly ) \\n\\nA little less known , but I love her , [ Estela N\u00fa\u00f1ez ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Amv9X-q69_c ) My favorite song from her is probably [ El sauce y la palma ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4KxLgqwjKQE ) \\n\\n [ Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MZN0fVdsN20 & amp ; list=PL0DZg7zLu-KaEwh6mNcRAeNY6tJ73_MEz ) .

No one tell him ) \\n\\nPop : \\n\\nI\\ 've been a lot of touch with Mexican pop because I mostly hear European pop ( specifically , Eurovision . You don\\'t know how jealous I am that you guys are in Eurovision and we aren\\'t ) , so most of the pop I post will be slightly dated ( or very dated in some cases ) \\n\\n [ Gloria Trevi ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CjXbluRyHE4 & amp ; list=PLIS-NM3fM9AMet6qkht596KXq5l3MBWDm ) . She\\ 's an extremely controversial artists by farily good reasons . Always since she started her career she pushed the boundaries of political correctness . In the early nineties she released a string of widely successful and polemic discs in which she discussed religion , abortion , sex and a lot of other stuff Mexican society wasn\\'t comfortable discussing . \\n\\nThen in 2000 she was arrested an accused of being part of a ring of child abuse that involved most of her backup singers and dancers . Then she got pregnant in prison , she claimed that she was raped while the prison authorities claimed she got smuggled sperm from her manager and faked the abuse . At the end she was released for lack of evidence , and after ten years out of the spotlight , she returned stronger than ever . \\n\\nShe\\ 's still quite controversial , with people believing that she was part of the abuse ring , while others believe she was a victim of it . I prefer not to think about it and just enjoy her music . \\n\\nA lot of her more current songs deal with self-reliance and liberation , which is something I like a lot . Also , she\\ 's become a gay icon , kinda like the Mexican Lady Gaga ( except she was doing Gaga before Gaga was doing solid food ) \\n\\nI would be hard-pressed to name a single song of her , so I\\ 'll put several . I hope you enjoy : \\n\\n* [ Todos me miran ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TP7Kh2gWL8g ) \\n\\n* [ Me r\u00edo de ti ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=P6A-kw41eEk ) \\n\\n* [ Lo que una chica por amor es capaz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ylfUkPD3IOA ) \\n\\n* [ Sabes ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=SCGrh7Ibg6k ) \\n\\n* [ No soy un p\u00e1jaro ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=EknNH7U90fA ) ( Warning : This song is HEAVY on double entendres and sexual innuendo . It\\ 's the kind of thing only she would dare to sing ) \\n\\nAlso , a classic from my childhood is the kid/youth band [ Timbiriche . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8Sc7XgsnhY4 & amp ; list=PL2E6A9599E3C49158 & amp ; index=2 ) My favorite song from them is [ Si no es ahora . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CovfI2ij39o ) \\n\\n [ OV7 and Kabah ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pmYtefifbx0 & amp ; list=PLjMhKRttBctyPVNujwskInxGABOeIforS ) are a couple bands that were quite succesfful . ( Sorry , I found a joint playlist and I\\ 'm feeling kinda lazy ) . OV7 was formed as \ '' Onda Vaselina\ '' a long time ago but then they lost the rights to their name in a dispute with their managers , so now they just go for the initials . My favorite song from them is [ Un pie tras otro pie . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BusFo75x3NA ) . About Kabah I\\ 'm gon na go for what I know and give you a song from a former member , [ No soy una se\u00f1ora ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=j5T1cYY-s8E ) by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 . \\n\\nGaribaldi is already vintage , ( late eighties , early nineties ) , my favorite songs from them are [ Que te la pongo ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UmDBmSTbuls ) y [ Tengo una bolita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kFrD9Cidujk ) . \\n\\nPaulina Rubio is quite a successful singer .

European Union is something worth it to fight . There is a wider gap between West Europe-Romania than Mexico-USA in even so West Europe offers totally open borders to Romanians , in part because is rational , but also because Europe is beyond \ '' we are # 1\ '' idiocracy that currently defines US mentality . In 1990 US was by far a bigger economy than EU , today Europe is the biggest economic engine in the world . \\n\\nYou say 23 % of people in Switzerland are non-born Switzerlands , so what ? There was 200 % more people in 2010 than in 1910 living in Switzerland and nothing bad happened .

For instance , Mexicans who cross the border daily to work in a factory at Arizona increase their productivity 500 % over the average Mexican , they are in fact more productive than Japanese or British workers , that is not because they work 500 % harder or they are 500 % more motivated . Germans who travel to work at Colombia are 600 % less productive when they get down from the airplane , and that is not because there is a magic magnetic field in the Atlantic that changes people\\ 's levels of motivation . \\n\\nLabor Productivity is defined by the \ '' context of production\ '' , which is the sum of technology + education + investment level + infrastructure in a particular area . Personal efforts are good and welcomed , but they have a small relevance when we\\ 're talking about creating wealth in a modern scale . Doesn\\'t matter how hard and how early in the morning a baker starts his work doing muffins , if other baker , lazy and unmotivated , has an automated muffin machine and a powerful software to handle the factory processes , the lazy baker will get more and more money and eventually the hard-work baker will go to the bankruptcy .",Romance,Spanish

0ffliner,europe,"By \ '' European like minded\ '' I was referring to the liberty to critique anything , from simple things like bad parenting till the governmental problems . So basically I\\ 'd consider that some Russians are really narrow minded when it comes to certain political , economic , and social problems ( probably like how Amish are in US and most of Americans don\\'t get why would you want to live like this , you know ? ) . \\n\\nAs an example I can give : for social one , most bad things that happen in Chechnya , simple Russian folk would comment that it\\ 's the Chechen\\ 's wrong doing and not theirs and would like to walk over other [ nationalities ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1zQnKdcitdM ) because they\\ 're the majority ( In that video basically some individuals from the police department that weren\\'t even in their uniforms , asked 2 Chechen girls to show their passport , one of the girls was a mother that was feeding at that time , and they didn\\'t even show any documents to prove that they\\ 're actually coppers . And Chechens are the luckiest ones in the whole R.F.\\n\\nThe politics kind of bind together with the economics , they\\ 're angry on the US sanction because they think that US is the evil warmonger that wishes only destruction and chaos , and while they\\ 're believing that Russian culture is based solely on resistance and defensive wars ( Most of them think that they had all the rights to annex Crimea ) .\\nAbout oligarchs I\\ 'm not even talking , Putin is kind of the boss of this mafia-state , or so it seems that he\\ 's the honcho .

222baked,europe,"I didn\\'t say we identify as Slavic , as we most definitely do not . We identify as a Romance-speaking people of the Balkans . What I was trying to get at , is that we have much more in common with neighboring Slavs than with the people of the Italic peninsula , both in genetics and culture ( do Romanians eat mici , or lasagna ? ) . We have little in common with the modern French . Some 18th century exchange of our educated class in Paris didn\\'t really make the peasant masses French , and much of that French influence disappeared in modern times . Our academic and bureaucratic structures are some of the few things that are still admittedly French , but I don\\'t consider those culturally significant , and frankly , many countries modeled their institutions after the French . \\n\\nI have nothing against Southerners , other than the fact you generally come off as rude , and even that is mostly because the formal second person plural seems to have fallen out of common use in Bucharest , which comes off as extremely impolite ( clearly something that wasn\\'t adopted from the French ) . I am just saying that our country has regional variety and that despite the fact that that those regions aren\\'t ethnically homogenous , those ethnicities may have more in common with eachother than with those from other regions . Where I live , I see Hungarians , Romanians , and Germans all living very similar lives . Some segregation exists , sure , but that\\ 's mostly due to nationalistic and linguistic reasons . The people are identical . A Hungarian from Mures county has more in common with a Romanian living in Mures than he does with a Hungarian from Budapest , and the same can be said for the Romanian when compared with another Romanian from Bucharest . \\n\\nPeople aren\\'t very good identifying what makes them unique , we are good at pointing out other groups and defining themselves as \ '' not them\ '' ; despite their incredible similarity . Look at the Canadian vs. American culture , where the former\\ 's identity is almost exclusively based on not being the latter .

Revenue from salaries and assimilated wages , self-employment , investment income , or gambling revenue will be taxed annually through globalization at household level . \\n\\nIf employers currently have to calculate and retain employees both social contributions ( pensions , health , unemployment ) and income tax ( 16 % at present ) , 2018 will no longer retain and go to the budget than social contributions . Income tax remains with the employee , to whom the employer is obliged to issue until the end of February 2019 only a document showing the net income achieved during the previous year . Thus , the draft amendment to the Fiscal Code repeals Article 80 , which states that \ '' wage and salary payers shall be required to calculate and withhold tax on income each month on the date of payment of such income , and to pay it to the state budget until the 25th of the month following the month for which such income is paid . \ '' \\n\\nIt also removes the obligation under Article 81 for completing and submitting the statement on the calculation and withholding of tax for each beneficiary of income , replacing it with the \ '' Statement of Payments of Social Contributions and Insured Persons Record for each Beneficiary of Income \ '' .

A-mad33,europe,"I believe that the most damaging effect to the UK is going to be when the EU says banks and financial services headquartered in Britain no longer have free access to the market . \\n\\n10 % or higher of the UK economy is based on financial services and they\u00b4re mostly headquartered in London because of low taxes , unrestricted access to the EU markets , English , it\u00b4s a good city and other factors . Recently Dublin has been stealing some of these companies but lets not forget there\u00b4s over 500 foreign banks headquartered in London . I believe that the EU is going to want to make it so difficult for these banks to operate in the EU market that they\u00b4ll have no choice but to move to a EU country and this will make Britain significantly poor because most of the service sector depends on a massive economic surplus from such a beneficial amount of activity in the city of London of banks and financial services .",Romance,Spanish
A-mad33,europe,"I can appreciate your opinion and discussion but I still strongly disagree . For starters New york is a larger financial centre than London .

( The drop in the pound actually made France overtake you but I\u00b4ll concede that for now ) Germany has a far higher purchasin power than Britain . \\n\\nMany companies have been moving in the last 4 years from London to Dublin because Dublin has a lower corporate tax rate hence why per capita Ireland is doing a lot better than Britain with 65k a year compared to Britain\u00b4s 41k a year .
