In the movie the human did all the work , the aliens only imitated . I would have done completely different things in each of their communication efforts . In the movie there was minimal emotional interaction , most was done through symbolic interaction , and the aliens were also ( required by scenario ) unhelpful in that they only drew circles and no other imagery , which would be expected , kind of a human insisting on only speaking when talking to an alien , refusing to draw anything .",Turkic,Turkish

Try setting a scale in VFX Key Mapper and combine it with Channel Delay with 3 delays and a pitch offset .

He must drop the army barracks thing in taksim , that is entirely a revenge seeking mindset , most young people dont care if you build a kÄ±Åla or not , just dont do it on one of the last green places in central istanbul 2 . I believe most people in Turkey revere AtatÃ¼rk and are for secularism in government , but are at the same time muslims of various degrees . 3 . If I could for a moment believe that all the AKP were sincerely seeing themselves as Turks and were working for the betterment of the nation , without any influence from neither west or east , I would also support them as I did in the beginning of 2000s . But I have trouble with those things because since 2000 many things have happened , their people have taken bribes and they still are not punished , I have realised that their version of ADALET is not KANUN , but more like 'Revenge ' for past happenings . Some of them keep bashing values of AtatÃ¼rk and his person . Also I was personally gassed during the park riots and that was considered 'rebellion ' and we were 'Ã§apulcu ' , instead of making things right they continued and still continue to calling those who were trying to defend a park as mischief makers , that shit is still fucked up and they have not remedied the situation . And they still want to remove public access to a large part of the park ( the kÄ±Åla plans were when I last saw them four walls encapsulating a large part of the green area ) . Also another philosophical perspective is that when the sun rises it will overshadow the AtatÃ¼rk monument in taksim square , I do n't know if they really think that far symbolically . Also the guy said he was BOP eÅbaÅkanÄ± , so how can I trust him who said he supports plans of dividing the country ? AND WHY HAS NO ONE PUT AN END TO THIS DISCUSSION BY EXPLAINING OR APOLOGIZING ? If I believed they loved the country as I do , I would support them , but the distrust they have has been initiated by themselves , and is still fueled by their own efforts . Sadly . One reason is they may really want to keep the population divided for a future purpose , if they really are into the BOP thing .",Turkic,Turkish

People were not apologized to . He is also still looking for more power and he doesnt like AtatÃ¼rk one of the main inspirational forces for building a strong Turkey with or without islam . I consider myself a muslim and I research islam , according to my views there is no place for dictators or monarchy or people with absolute power . Along with many other issues that I have come to my own conclusions . RTE does in my opinion not like democracy , he has even said it is a means not a goal , I assume for him it is to acquire power . RTE has said he is BOP eÅbaÅkanÄ± , that alone is a big mystery that can not be forgotten , nothing has been said to address this issue and put an end to speculations . RTE has said when he asked his father whether or not they were turks , his father reportedly answered say we are muslims . RTE likes to take stances against AtatÃ¼rk and his values , and he has used this many times to excite people he thinks are his voters , he has also in the past along with many others from his 'team ' had ugly conversations and accusations against any and all opposition . He is a part of a team that has paid trolls to actually get into arguments with different minded thinkers . He likes democracy because in his mind it means he gets to do what he wants I have trouble seeing how his mindset changed from 2 months ago until today . His deputees have taken bribes , and so often has he been blind to such things , the investigations in usa at the moment should have been here . There are tons of corruption around him and he has not tried to do the right thing and put an end to it . He should have told his family to stay a way from extravagance and excessive spending . Just recently his mate bought stuff from poland for over 5 000 euro . Including three 7 armed chandelliers which are jewish things , not that I would normally care but he says they are muslims , and there has been tons of conspiracy theories and information that they are actually jewish . Did I mention he is still trying to acquire more power ? If he uses this coup for gaining power and control over the TSK , even if it now contains 100 % Ataturkish people , who are NOT threats to the country , how will we explain this ? If he does then the coup has been positive to his aims ! And what about all the Ataturkish people he has removed in the past from governmental institutions ? also : he is STILL the head of the party that thinks it is fun to vote down any kind of proposition from the opposition . Also they have minimal democracy inside their party itself .

Let the original islam flourish somewhere in the world without violence and weapons under the observation of whoever wants to *observe it . The problem is neither western countries nor the administrations of current islamic countries would want this . The former because of whatever reasons , the latter because they will loose control . And that control has been given and is supported by the western countries . The amish can have a country that is a neighbor to them , Im sure they will get a long well .

Islam is for the thinking people , it has no clergy , no countries , no ruling class and no kingship . Real islamic countries are few in the world , the rest are dictatorships mostly of whom live in luxury provided by western money and security provided by western weapons . An islamic country would be an ideal country if it wasnt for mindless masses who do and obey what dictators and clergy tell them , and they are too powerless to complain about their situation , they all try to balance modern living and amenities in dictatorships with the ideas of islam of which most muslims deem unimportant , while they are the most important parts of the religion . AtatÃ¼rk secularism could very well be the foundation of an ideal muslim country , if people could see what it and islam really is . When the individual disregards the commanments , 'believe and do good ' they falter . No matter who they are . It could very well be that these military trying to make a coup did it with pure purposes , because a large part of the muslim population are not given the means and opportunity to think for themselves , many are blind and grownups with the minds of children . Downvote away , I dont give a fuck . On the other hand you cant control a country with 400 men without other support . Most of the explosions in Ankara were sonic booms , and if they had real bombs why did they leave the presidential palace untouched ? The president does not like democracy that is why he has said 'democracy is the means not the goal ' and that is why he and his party supports the focus on his persona . Because one man power structure is easier to control , and he himself , not being a Turk is being guided by others .

The problem with big cities is that transportation of necessities and such become increasingly wasteful the bigger the city gets , because the transportation of food from outside the city becomes a large burden , including the energy required for refrigeration of food products . A large concrete area , in worst case scenario also creates increasingly large distances from oxygen producing vegetation . Increasingly large centralized production of food water and electricity creates an incremental increase for the need for maintenance.of the facilities . My idea of an ideal symmetric and low waste structure of the living spaces of humans is that small city-villages are created , each village houses 100-1000 people and produces it 's own electricity , water from wells and food , each village has a large amount of land around it 's central village that is used to primarily support the needs of the people in the village .

In the beginning they were all trying to gain votes from Turks by posing as a nice alternative to alternative people and such even though their own main voterbase would and probably already does kill such people , It was all for shows for the intellectual , the rejected and ethnic oriented voters . Later on I believe they screwed many of their voters over , and many of the voters have figured this out .

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"compared to other websites the capacity used would be marginal , today even small sites or businesses use tons of 24/7 online servers . Whichever project I choose I could start small , with one laptop so I guess procrastination plays a role here . one project is downloading vast numbers of websites and let people search in them aka search engine , another is less resource using , letting people just organise information / website items I have had some theories that the electromagnetic pollution is actually harmful to less dense creatures , maybe that is why they prefer to approach people in desolate areas.. I believe that the search engines and even fb has built in flaws , and they certainly dont allow for more advanced usage of their collected data , publicly . And they dont allow for knowledge gathering , only posting which gets buried in newer posts , this whole thing makes people addicted to posting in my opinion , one of the projects I want to do is a place where you can gather information on certain topics , all sorts of media from all over the web , like wikipedia but with external links instead , letting people organising the content . another reservation I have about this is , what if this will make people use their minds less , like using easy access to search engines making people use their own minds less ?

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"In my experiene , there are two types of services available today to humans , one that gives full control , lets you *browse* contents shared to a site , and the other that only allows you to search the contents based on keywords you already know . These are called filter bubbles and lets people sit in their own comfort zone and does n't let them know about things they do n't already know the concept about , all the major sites shows you content that IT thinks is important for you , and whoever does n't know about filter bubbles will possibly never know about it . https : //www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles ? language=en fb CHOOSES what it will show you , having 200 friends with 10 new posts each makes 2 thousand posts , and your newsfeed only shows a fraction and that based on what they see relevant , the founder made a video ( which I cant find now ) about how some local news would be more important to the person than a child starving somewhare . And when you search for groups it shows the list of groups and pages without sorting for popularity , sometimes showing the most popular groups several pages later , tell me if I 'm wrong , this was how it was when I was last using it . Youtube does not let you browse channels , vimeo does . The deliberate crippling of services are done by details and very subtle , but they effect a whole world of users benefiting from the services . AND without the immediate resources to produce a replica of such a site are forced to the limits of publicly available services . When a youtube video is removed , they also remove the comments section and the list of recommendation videos . Ironically there are few major alternatives to faceb . and the current major search engine . And ironically the alternative websites that could have potential somehow never get the breakthrough or are forgotten . the search engine also only shows sites in recommendation based on your personal profile . And somehow the services that are to benefit the world do not allow for alternatives to what is shown to you . Small details would provide huge power to the users , perhaps that is why . My ideas are in principle 2 separate ideas , the searching and the social media parts should both be open and allow 3rd party services to access data and provide information , INSIDE the primary service if it is the wish of the user . That is how we could move to more transparent world , I believe . The making of a search engine and a resource gathering services is very different , Search engines require a lot of resources , my intention if I make such a service is to make local for my region , and that would be a large task enough , or to limit the services to websites relevant to preconceived subject such as topics relevant to this subreddit . Trying to make it all-encompassing from the beginning would be it 's own deathblow . The other site of resource gathering would require less resources , because it would rely on the input on the users , such as reddit . People adding links and relevant information to specific topics . Unfortunately not even reddit organizes information based on the topics besides the subreddits , it relies on people finding relevant posts with links to other subreddits or posts , at least reddit has websites that lists all the subreddits . But reddit does not list the subreddits from its own site and it doesnt even search within the contents of it 's own posts , only the titles . the search engines and the social media site have internal tools for sure that lets them view and categorize content , but the tools are not available to the public . . I believe the electrical lines are barriers on the earth put on specific locations that prevent less dense beings from travelling through . In egypt there is a electrical grid along the large part of the desert , next to the nile , basically cutting off a large part of the desert which you can even hear the humming when walking under it . Electromagnetic waves increase the dna damage which constantly requires more food for repair . This is the dilemma . I think humans have capabilities of sensing higher truths through their body and hair , and this is hindered by the electromagnetic waves in our surroundings , especially AC electrical fields , which most of the electrical grids use . I think telepathy and other sensory perception is only a matter of being in a suitable environment . I was inquiring about a scooter with a 70 panel on it the other day , but I cant find the link now , making a solar car requires it to be much lighter than an ordinary car , ideally under 400 kg of weight . And that means no luxuries but I think it is possible , making it light and having a large surface area could make it possible to make it driveable with only sunlight . There are similar cars built for the solar challenge competitions in the world , but they have specific restrictions and look funny , making it larger would make it easier to have surface area for continual powering with solar energy .",Turkic,Turkish

There is no â smoking gun â linking the Government of Turkey or Erdogan directly to ISIS oil sales . It is apparent , however , that Turkey turned a blind eye to ISIS oil trade . Turkey failed to seal its border , facilitating ISIS oil exports . Turks have profited at stages of the supply chain . '' when russia provided satellite images of lots of tankers getting oil in the region , regional kurdish authorities said they were **theirs** Oil and other things has been smuggled for decades in the area , and until borders are entirely closed all sorts of people will profit from buying oil from many actors in the region and attempt to sell it in other places . As said , yes there probably are Turkish citizens who have profited from it . This does not mean Turkey is actively aiding ISIS , and the `` terror groups '' mentioned in the original post is not ISIS but **other groups** who are fighting assad and or ISIS . The situation is chaotic in the area , and Turkish borders are not perfectly sealed and they have not had perfect control over the oil trade , although it has diminished seriously . 2. says `` Turkish reporters who exposed how the ErdoÄan government has directly armed Islamist rebels in Syria `` this is **not ISIS** either . But other groups . Germanys latest shipment of weapons to north iraq peshmerga are already being sold on the black market , ISIS is using american weapons and vehicles , and many of their leaders were people let out from iraqi prisons after the us invasion . 3. says `` Smuggled fuel came from oil wells in Iraq or Syria controlled by militants , including ISIS , and was sold to middlemen who smuggled it across the 900-kilometer Turkish-Syrian border . Analysts estimate that the Islamic State group gets up to $ 3 million a day in revenue from oil fields seized in Iraq and Syria . Western intelligence officials have alleged that Turkey is turning a blind eye to a flourishing trade that strengthens ISIS , and Secretary of State John Kerry has called on Turkey to do more to stem the trade . Oil smuggling was a booming business until about six months ago , when Turkish authorities cracked down in response to media reports . New checkpoints and border controls were set-up in Hatay Province . Turkey says it seized nearly 20 million liters of oil at the border in the first eight months of 2015 , **about four times as much as in the same period the year before** . ''",Turkic,Turkish

But if you want reliability and standards you must have much larger investments . small companies are already making and selling small jet engines in europe and you can probably buy one from Turkey , they are for model airplanes , and not many people in Turkey have a need to buy such a jet engine or a larger one , so TSK makes it happen . we already produce all parts of car engines in many brands , i think but to be able to sell it , you need to make the rest of the car , making a car of 20-30 year old technology is easy , making a Ford model T is a piece of cake but people dont want to produce it because it would not be liked by customers . Because the rest of the car is what interests most customers . And you can probably build a whole car engine minus some electronics ( or the entire car engine with carburators ) from car parts already produced in Turkey . But with 100s of car brands most people wouldnt know what to do with a car engine , Fiat Aegea has reportedly required 1-2 billion dollars for investments and it is doing well now , but the factory already had lots of experience in carmaking . in other countries , like us , people build own stuff all the time , own cars , dune buggys etc , even airplanes , in Turkey there is not much of a market to build own stuff , we even pay people to put together furniture from ikea . Most people just dont have place and time to build their own machines , or money knowhow and time to invest in building engines , So to produce any working car in serial production you need some babayiÄit , because if you want it to be competitive it needs to look good and be comparable to other brands .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"( i 'm not the author of this text which is the first chapter of a book ) The Trap System is a complex cage based on spiritual and technological tools . The purpose is to keep people trapped in their physical bodies on Earth , even through many different incarnations over thousands of years . In fact , the whole purpose of reincarnation is so you stay trapped in this physical realm where you are unaware of how to connect with your soul and thus do not experience ones True Self . New Agers completely misunderstand this concept . Most of them believe that reincarnation is `` necessary '' for a persons spiritual development and that Earth is a `` School . '' It is not . Earth is a prison planet . If Earth is intended for spiritual development there are some major flaws . A large percentage of the western world for example do not believe in God and think religion is a waste of time . Also consider the fact that between each incarnation people are put into amnesia thus forget everything they ever learned in their last life therefore we are forced to start all over again century after century . I guess you could say its the `` devolution of the spirit '' rather than the `` evolution of the spirit '' . This alone proves that reincarnation can NOT serve the purpose which New Agers believe . It is the complete opposite . Most people do not develop spiritually from one life to the next because they are stripped of everything they learn . Basically we are `` reset '' at birth and are memories are wiped . The reason for this is to make sure mankind stays trapped and lose all knowledge of our higher selves , therefore we can not develop properly and reach the levels of Self Understanding , or Experience our Higher Soul and 10 True Being . We simply remain here in lower planes of the astral realm , ignorant , blinded and brainwashed . But as we shall discuss later , there are ways to avoid getting trapped in the system . The Trap System Explained I know what you are thinking : â Who created the trap system and for what purpose ? â The answer to that is other beings that retained their knowledge of the higher astral planes . DonÂ´t think that these other beings are some kind of evil aliens because they are not . They are just like you and me , after all , we all came from the same place and we are all One . However , a long time ago these higher beings decided that mankind would become trapped on Earth to serve as slaves and act as a source of money and food . We are slaves to powerful elite families the control legal and banking systems together with religions and are indeed part of the Trap System . Because these higher beings feed off our etheric energy we are also a source of food for them . These entities , or as many people call them , `` Reptilians , '' are working in both the astral planes and the physical world . They have their representatives here on Earth and have infiltrated the physical world and taken over the planet by controlling Governments , banking , religious institutions , media , food chains and various other leading corporations . As I mentioned above , the Reptilian entities that keep us trapped here feed on the etheric body energy . What I mean by this is the energy we give off through our thoughts and emotions . They particularly thrive from negative energy , which is why world leaders cause so much pain and suffering by creating wars , terrorism , crashing banking systems , disasters , inventing laws that are designed to restrict peopleÂ´s freedom , and creating paranoia and fear through media . 11 These entities can influence the minds of people through different means in order to create specific thought patterns , behaviours and emotions . This influence is done from astral telepathical connections with victims , to various technologies that alter a personÂ´s state of mind . The powers that be are doing their best to keep their designs uttermost secret , which is why you will hardly find any information on this in any publications , especially not the mainstream media which they control . Very few know about the this part of human existence and even less want to accept it . However , there are people on Earth now who have chosen to reincarnate here to let people know the truth about their existence . We have done so at great risk , which is why we are few , as we too can be trapped into the complex construction of the Trap System . Even the initiated can lose their knowledge and insights of spiritual connections and Higher Souls from one life to the next . The reason for that is because the human body is manufactured to be very limited and is not generally capable of accessing its soul to any significant degree . However , a Soul Fragment must be in place in any Human Body for that body to live and function , and it is this soul fragment that holds the key to us unlocking the doors of the trap system . The Origins of Man and the various Gods and Entities In the beginning existed only the one Mind , the Creator , the Cause of all existence . LetÂ´s go with the scientific idea and say it was the big bang . Whatever it was created powerful energies that manifested and designed other forms of existence . But these other forms of existence , what we call Gods , spawned from the Minds of the Creator . In turn the Gods created life which is how we have this physical existence on Earth . 12 The Gods had different ranks and representations together with different polarities and functions . Our ancient ancestors understood this and believed that by concentrating on those â Energies â you can ultimately enable the idea or desire to manifest . When The One , the creator , split into different fragments it caused duality â nothing can exist without an opposite . Therefore we have negative energy and positive which in turn causes Good and Evil . Since Creation has evolved through countless levels of manifestations and different life forms , it has created Beings who are different in nature from other Beings â simply because their origins of polarity are opposite . Therefore we get good and evil . It exists all over the Universe , not just here on Earth in the human race , but on many levels in other spiritual planes . This has lead to some Beings being termed here as the Good Ones , and some as the Evil Ones . It goes on at many levels between the Gods themselves , and indeed all the way down here between people of the Earth . Some of the Gods believe they are the True God because of have forgotten , or not truly realized , their true origins . It is the same for us in the physical World â we have forgotten where we came from and ultimately we do not know who we are or what we are actually capable of â and believe me , our capabilities are more amazing than you can imagine ! In essence , all Life is One , simply due to everything existing within the One Mind , the First Cause , and thus all and everything is connected to each other . Therefore all life has equal potential , meaning that even you can be a Creator , a God with the ability to manifest whatever you desire in your own World and reality . It is a complex topic , and there is a lot of confusion between Mankind and other Beings which has caused many problems for many lifeforms . 13 It is the programming of the Mind that keeps you in the physical body , yet this also is true for the astral body , as the astral body is not the Soul or your True Self any more than your physical body . Nevertheless , you are still a spiritual being trapped in your physical body because your mind has been programmed to belief you can not not exist outside of your physical body . There will always be some people who agree with what I am saying , and some who do n't . Others want it to be true , but dares not believe it in case other people think they are crazy . It is impossible to convince anybody they can explore other dimensions of the Universe if they simply choose not to believe it . And it is your choice whether you want to accept what I am saying or dismiss it . However , I must say that if you choose to ignore your gift , you will miss out on many amazing experiences ! For me it does n't matter if you believe what I say or not . This book is not intended to force you into believing anything , but to make you aware of the possibilities and to give you the tools so you can experiment . What you choose to do with this information is entirely up to you . One thing I do hope you believe is that the most important thing you can ever study is yourself ; and the best person to listen to is You . This is something that you do instinctively yet are sometimes unaware of . One word of advice : DonÂ´t listen to your head , listen to your heart . You feel that something is right , you donÂ´t think it ! This is something you can develop and learn to trust through spiritual work and rituals like the ones at the end of this book . But in the meantime let me tell you more about how the Trap System works and how we are controlled . The Illusion of the Lower Astral Realm In the lower astral realms we know as Earth , good and evil is an illusion . It has been created to keep us here . Yet , you can say they are real , as they do exist in your mind even in their illusional form . In a sense , itÂ´s the same way as a fantasy where you make something up in your mind that does not exist 14 in your physical world - yet at the same time it does exist since you just made it up in your mind in the form of said fantasy . On Earth we are part of someone else 's fantasy , but one we all contribute to because of the soul fragment that ultimately came from the Creator â The One Mind . However , you are controlled through programming and the illusions that you live in , even though the people that control us are also living in the illusion . Therefore , they have no more right to control you then you do to control them . Some of the people that control you are often referred to as the â Elite â and some of them are the ones working with the Elite because they too have been controlled by the Elite to oversee the illusions that are designed to control the rest of us . In essence , the Elite are abusing the system . The original system that was created by â God , â the original Creator , was to allow the soul fragments the chance to explore the Universe and experience different forms of life . However , the Evil Ones decided to abuse the system for their own gains by manipulating and controlling other soul fragments . And so we have the Trap System . But there is a way out and I truly believe that eventually everyone will be free . Thankfully , some people on this prison planet of ours are already free and are doing their best to teach others . These so called enlightened beings can explain what is happening simply because they have observed the Good and Evil from many points of view . However , it does not come without its dangers . Spirit guides , angels , ascended masters etc are more often than not within the trap system themselves and thus also `` prisoners . '' The difference is they believe they are from a higher plane of existence and are free . But as long they are individuals in a human body , they are not true Selves , as only Oneness is True Self . 15 Such beings are only to be found within the lower astral planes , however , they are aware of the higher trust can help guide people towards their True Self after death . Regarding your imprisonment in a physical body , I 'm talking about matters that took place in the very distant past before your first physical incarnation . It was at this moment you allowed your soul and your True Self to enter the physical world in the body of a human being . However , you were lured and blindly believed what you were told by the Gods of those times . Fortunately , some souls recognised the trap and escaped , but continue to return to help mankind understand the true nature of their origins and abilities . We find example of this in the ancient world , such as the Pyramids in Egypt , Mexico and Peru . Some of you will know these original peoples as the Atlanteans . With these amazing structures they left clues and more and more people are slowly beginning to realize that there is more to our existence than this mundane life we experience on Earth . More and more people are learning of their True Origins and returning to the Source of All One . When the evil entities created by the fragmented original Mind eventually came upon Earth and discovered how mankind is programmed , they realised that it would be easy to manipulate us . Although the rulers have changed from time to time , they have always been negative energies , power-hungry and sinister . That is why war and murder of the innocent exists right the way through recorded history . The agenda of the ruling Elite is to gain more power and control by making people work for them without even knowing it . Some are even worshipped by us as Gods which further empowers them because we give them more energy . On Earth they mostly use religious and spiritual institutions , politics , media and money to suck up our energy . Their God in a sense is money because 16 everybody relies on money to live . Yet in reality it has been created by the system and is actually worth nothing . With religions you are worshipping them under the pretence of you worshipping the Creator God . They also run the larger industries , governments and such which they can manipulate to their advantage and keep control by feeding the rest of us suggestions and lies they know we are open to believe . But these lies are merely a distraction from understanding your True Self . As I have previously explained , I disagree that we were physically incarnated here to `` learn '' anything at all . We could learn very well without these physical bodies as the astral realms of the lower levels are so close one can hardly tell the difference . So there is no need for a physical body other than to limit the True Soul so that it can not obtain or retain spiritual knowledge . If you consider the fact that most people live their present live without any memory or knowledge of their previous lives , then reincarnation is a complete and utter failure . Learning comes from Higher Consciousness and is independent of Physical conditions . We are all eternal beings with limitless knowledge and power than enables us to explore the endless areas of existence â something we are all capable of if only we learn how to separate break free from the physical body we are trapped inside . The only lesson to really learn here , is that we are failing to find our true selves , and that true knowledge comes from much deeper aspects of our Being than blindly wandering around on Earth . Simply living does not teach you anything about your true power . They Elite entities are smart and have many ways to distract us so we donÂ´t discover the truth . They manipulate and control us in many ways ranging from spiritual means to school education , news & media , foods and the mind altering substances they put in them , vaccinations and health institutions that hand out harmful medicines made by pharmaceutical companies . They control us with technology such as sound frequencies , radiations , water systems , anything they can alter and pollute . They manufacture products to 17 make your mind dull , filled with apathy , more open for suggestion , and trustworthy of the media , leaders and so on . I applaude those of you who do not blindly believe everything we are told . In fact I highly praise people who follow their own intuition and encourage people not to listen to what they are being told , but to conduct their own research . I would even advise you to conduct your own research into what I am telling you in this book . Some of the things I have told you , such as how we are controlled by a corrupt Elite is easy to discover . All you need to do is type into Google the name a major company , bank or politician plus â corruption , â and you will find numerous news items that demonstrate the dishonesty of these cheats . Other things I am explaining to you are not as well written about and thus will have to be a matter of opinion and discovery . Therefore , I suggest you take some of the things I tell you into consideration and listen to your inner guide . Over time , if you go looking for answers , you will be surprised what you will learn and the insights that you gain . This world has its share of gullible people . And many of them write about what they are told for other gullible people to believe . During your research read widely and donÂ´t just take one personÂ´s opinion as the truth . To get on the right spiritual path you have to decide what is right for you and follow you instincts . Eventually it will all become clear and you will re-establish your contact with the All , your true Oneness . Evil is a lower level reality , indeed , but because of the lower level God wanting to have the powers and control of the Creator God . The lust grew , and as his power grew he took advantage of mankind in every way he could . You are NOT here for any â purpose â - you are here because you are TRAPPED , in the ILLUSIONS and PROGRAMMING . The only time you will '' ascend '' or go `` further '' is when you realize this and manage to keep your 18 awareness with you at the time of death . The only thing you will learn here is what deception , lies and illusions really are - not because you are `` supposed to '' , but because you have been forced to . Yet your true purpose is in a higher realm of experience , your real selves are cleaner and more pure . here you are just a small grain of your own selves , if even that . You barely know even the slightest thing about yourself and your origins - and the few things you do know are mostly lies . Remember , in your current understanding of life you are in one of the lowest forms of existence . The good news however is that you can learn how to achieve higher realms of existence and create your own reality . As the Greek playwright Euripeds wrote , â In each of us is a God. â You do have these powers within you because in the end you are all One and part of the Ultimate Source , thus you can control and dictate your own lives if you want to - as long you learn how to . The first thing you have to do is accept you live in a world of lies and deceit . The second thing you need to do is to commit yourself to finding your true self , even though it takes some time to get to the core . I would expect that most of you reading this book are already aware there is '' something '' beyond your normal waking reality otherwise you wouldnÂ´t have been drawn to this book . You already know there is something beyond your `` dreams '' but perhaps you donÂ´t know how to look further than the realms of the physical world and experience a completely new aspect of yourself . There is no need for me to ask you to believe anything , nor is there any need for me to ask you to disbelief anything , that is your free will . I am here because I have experienced the many layers of the astral world and have visited other dimensions and want to pass on my experiences and knowledge to help make you journey somewhat easier . 19 My purpose here is to serve you , bring you that spark of inspiration and self- realization that you all have within . I will teach you how to connect with yourself and come into balance with your being , harmony and Creation . Personally it is irrelevant for me if you believe me or not . I have nothing to gain from the decisions you make , nor will I lose anything . Only you have something to gain and something to lose . I am not here to make you believe a single word of what I say , but for those of you that I do resonate with , you already know what you need to do . When I say there is a lot of deceit out there , I am sure most of you would agree . Am I a deceiver ? That is something you will decide for yourself . It is good to be skeptical because when you look within yourself you will find a combination of tools that help you discover great things without ever needing help from others . However , especially in the early stages many people do benefit from some guidance . I , and many other spiritual teachers are here to help you on the way towards learning about yourself and understanding the divine laws that empower you and allow you to live in accordance with them - and thus reach higher levels of insights and understanding , as well as improving your own condition in every way . In the Trap System you are designed to work against yourselves , not because you want to or chose to do so freely , but because you are manipulated to think in a certain way . You are a prisoner sitting in a dark cell with a key to unlock the door in the corner . You donÂ´t know the key is there because you have never looked for it . I am here to help you search for the key and unlock the door . There are many other spiritual teachers like me who have gained true knowledge . But there are also spiritual teachers you offer guidance with the sole gain of making money . Be cautious who you work with and what you believe . Do not believe that anything is the Truth unless you feel it is the Truth . Learn to trust your instinct and you will know the truth . 20 Even if something â rings true â it does not make it true . In fact a lot of what seems to be true on the surface has been constructed that way for you and is often the complete opposite of what can be considered â truthfulness. â Some people look up to spiritual teachers as if they are Gods , when in actual fact we are all Gods . What we understand to be God does not come here or '' visit '' you to help out . When the Bible says that God is omnipresent it is a veiled meaning to suggest you are your own God . We are all co-creators , but there is what you can consider the Creator of the physical world , as well as numerous other Creators upwards on many levels in the higher planes of existence . There are also many out there who want you to believe they are your Creator or God , higher beings such as angels and aliens . But many of these non-physical beings and forms of consciousness from other planes are â negative energies. â That poses us a slight problem and is the reason why there are so many failed predictions and disinformation coming from so-called â gurus , â â masters â and â new age channelers. â Most people will blindly accept whatever they are told by â higher authorities , â â but so do people who come into contact with entities â and like I said , some entities have negative energy and should not be trusted . This is of course is unfortunate , and those among you whom may be in contact with other entities should show extreme caution . At this level of existence everyone who is in this physical world is confronted with lies and deceit . The same is true of the spirit world . There are exceptions to this of course . You will find spiritual gurus in the physical world and spirit guides in the astral planes that are here to help and guide you . Very few people existing in this level of existence are in contact with higher beings or the Source , but there are plenty who are in contact with lower beings that pretend to be `` higher '' and thus give you false ideas of 21 what they are - and what YOU are . And that is how you can identify negative entities . The same goes for your so called after life - in fact most people who find themselves free of reincarnation after death are located at lower levels of existence and are very close to the physical world . In most cases they live their lives there almost identically to how they did when they were here . The surroundings and landscapes and structures of the lower astral realms are very similar to those of the physical one . Here too the deception and lies runs deep . This can be useful to have in mind both for your remaining time here as well as when you cross over to the next experience of existence - if you will just be able to keep yourself aware when doing so and remain conscious . In essence , to put it simply , Life is a preparation for Death . To break free of the Trap System when you die and cross over into your next stage of existence you should request yourself to experience your True Form , your Real Spiritual Essence , and immediately fly as far away from Earth as you can . In order to do this you need to practice spirit travel in this life on a regular basis . By practising spirit travel you will be able to retain awareness and consciousness of your true Self at the time of death . What you need to avoid is falling into an unconscious dreamy state of being and go through reincarnation again . You also want to avoid being trapped in the lower levels of existence such as the lower astral planes which serves the purpose of keeping you trapped until you once again get reincarnated . You need to venture away from all familiar forms , towards realms of only pure consciousness where no being has any form and no form exists . Though , a being that is self-aware , can maintain himself in a state of freedom even in lower astral planes , and avoid the cycle of reincarnation , there are people living in astral realms that are wonderful and beautiful in every aspect , and have been so for thousands of years and longer . But these planes 22 are still part of the lower level illusion of existence and not the True Form of Self . It is not even a merging with ones Higher Soul . You need to merge all your soul fragments with your Higher Soul , the real True Self that exists on a higher plane which is outside of the system that keep people trapped here . Then you are truly free , then you are truly One , and Yourself , ready to explore the real existence and freedom beyond all the deception and lies , and move on towards the Source itself . You can retain memory of past lives , of the spiritual realms , of your Higher Soul , and so on even here in your physical body . There are meditations and exercises one can perform that puts you in direct contact with your true self so that you will be able to explore and understand yourself and gain great insight on reality and illusions . Many of these exercises can be found on my website under the Topic â Meditations , rituals & self development. â The famous `` light '' at death also seems to be part of the trap system . There is no need to enter any light to go anywhere . When you die , simply tell yourself you want to experience your true spiritual essence , your real higher self . Tell yourself you want to merge with the Source , or experience the true God above all Gods . Remember also that your loved ones are always with you as they are all part of you and All , so you can always reunion with them for a while on the lower astral planes where you still find yourself experiencing life . Now you know about the trap system you can start to take your first steps to freedom and connecting with your Higher Presence . And I will explain more about that in the next chapter .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Gnostic,"https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocryphon_of_John ... . Despite the fact that Yaltabaoth possesses only a single parent and was created without the consent of the Spirit of the Monad , he is powerful enough to mimic the creative processes of the superior Aeons . He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither â light nor dark â but is instead â dim â . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad â s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the â waters â that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the â plenoria â or the â Epinoia â , and later as the â pleroma â , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth â s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth â s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish

Even without that choice , in it 's opposite , people choose to cling on to this reality , all because you still have n't developed all your capacities and you think your temporary current salvation is in the polar opposite of exiting , is to STAY and do what society expects of you . In time you learn to overcome certain things , and you dare more and more to either be original here or leave completely .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Dreams,"I am gon na share a theory with you Heaven is a everlasting dream where individuals dream whatever they want wherever they want , you dream with other intelligent beings and you do it all the time , this heaven awaits all . Food and action is the thing that delays the experience of living on earth . All particles around and in us are individual particles that have individual intelligence , they all origin from the universe above , with sufficient energy each particle can take any shape or form Each particle is a shape that is physically connected to the shape above in the chain , the connecting thing between all is information coming down from above , the original source of all . The particles can in the above universes be any shape and form , when in sufficient numbers , they are physical matter in our world . These shapes form universes and are chain-connected with every other part . Each part is connected to the previous link , and the only thing regulated is the connection between each part which delays the information . Once upon a time the human form , the earth form and the tree form was created When we ate the apple , we disrupted the flow of energy from the source , forcing the whole system to enter into an avalanche of random events causing disruptions and forced rearrangements from the source , this was because we opened our eyes and started sending light through our eyes to parts that were not designed to handle it . Each time a disruption happens , it may cause separation somewhere , needing time for the system to readjust . This entire earth is a glob of connected universes that once entered an avalanche of chain reactions that found another solution to the system , which eventually and continually is this world we live in . All the time as we open our eyes we continue to reiterated the disruptions . I have witnessed something that is very interesting , since the most efficient structure for this connected-particle-universe is a chain of beings , perhaps you can guess what the being subsisting of such beings can be shaped like . There are such beings that consist of many individual beings , they are chain linked , dreaming the many collective dreams with eachother and this being is at the same time capable of interacting with the world below it . So it is both individual and many . When this kind of being is communicated with it can alter , modify your world and make changes to it according to your wishes , and because it has a higher perspective , it can make it easier . If you have noticed , dreams can be random , or designed , and there are beings that can design your dreams here and in the worlds above . If you have seen it , dreams or lives in higher energy seem to be cartoon-like , this is because there are less particles that make up the same objects and they seem to be intelligent , this is because they are . Just like humans can create scenarios and events for other humans or animals , these beings can do so for humans .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,solipsism,"Give me your whole awareness , and concentrate your thoughts , for Knowledge of Atum â s Being requires deep insight , which comes only as a gift of grace . It is like a plunging torrent of water whose swiftness outstrips any man who strives to follow it , leaving behind not only the hearer , but even the teacher himself . To conceive of Atum is difficult . To define him is impossible . The imperfect and impermanent can not easily apprehend the eternally perfected . Atum is whole and constant . In himself he is motionless , yet he is self-moving . He is immaculate , incorruptible and ever-lasting . He is the Supreme Absolute Reality . He is filled with ideas which are imperceptible to the senses , and with all-embracing Knowledge . Atum is Primal Mind . He is too great to be called by the name â Atum â . He is hidden , yet obvious everywhere . His Being is known through thought alone , yet we see his form before our eyes . He is bodiless , yet embodied in everything . There is nothing which he is not . He has no name , because all names are his name . He is the unity in all things , so we must know him by all names and call everything â Atum â . He is the root and source of all . Everything has a source , except this source itself , which springs from nothing . Atum is complete like the number one , which remains itself whether multiplied or divided , and yet generates all numbers . Atum is the whole which contains everything . He is One , not two . He is All not many . The All is not many separate things , but the Oneness that subsumes the parts . The All and the One are identical . You think that things are many when you view them as separate . but when you see they all hang on the One and flow from the One , you will realize they are united - linked together , and connected by a chain of Being from the highest to the lowest , all subject of the will of Atum . The Cosmos is one as the sun is one , the moon is one and the earth is one . Do you think there are many Gods ? That 's absurd - God is one . Atum alone is the Creator of all that is immortal , and all that is mutable . If that seems incredible , just consider yourself . You see , speak , hear , touch , taste , walk , think and breathe . It is not a different you who does these various thing , But one being who does them all . To understand how Atum makes all things consider a farmer sowing seeds ; here wheat - there barley , now planting a vine - then an apple tree . Just as the same man plants all these seeds , so Atum sows immortality in heaven and change on Earth . Throughout the Cosmos he disseminates Life and movement - the two great elements that compromise Atum and his creation , and so everything that is . Atum is called 'Father' because he begets all things , and , from his example , the wise hold begetting children the most sacred pursuit of human life . Atum works with Nature , within the laws of Necessity , causing extinction and renewal , constantly creating creation to display his wisdom . You see the things that the eye can see are mere phantoms and illusions . Only those things invisible to the eye are real . Above all are the ideas of Beauty and Goodness . Just as the eye can not see the Being of Atum , so it can not see these great ideas . They are attributes of Atum alone , and are so inseparable from him . They are so perfectly without blemish that Atum himself is in love with them . There is nothing which Atum lacks , so nothing that he desires . There is nothing Atum can lose , so nothing causes him grief . Atum is everything . Atum makes everything . and everything is a part of Atum . Atum , therefore , makes himself . This is Atum 's glory - he is all-creative , and this creating is his very Being . It is impossible for him to stop creating for Atum can never cease to be . Atum is everywhere . Mind can not be enclosed , because everything exists within Mind . Nothing is so quick and powerful . Just look at your own experience . Imagine yourself in any foreign land , and quick as your intention you will be there ! Think of the ocean - and there you are . You have not moved as things move , but you have travelled nevertheless . Fly up into the heavens - you wo n't need wings ! Nothing can obstruct you - not the burning heat of the sun , or the swirling planets . Pass on to the limits of creation . Do you want to break out beyond the boundaries of the Cosmos ? For your mind , even that is possible . Can you sense what power you possess ? If you can do all this , then what about your Creator ? Try and understand that Atum is Mind . This is how he contains the Cosmos . All things are thoughts which the creator thinks . from The Hermetica , attributed to Thoth translated by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,answers,"( *the illegality is when people try to enter a country , not when they leave one ) wiki : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_smuggling : '' Internationally , the term is understood as and often used interchangeably with migrant smuggling , which is defined in the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land , Sea and Air , supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime as `` ... the procurement , in order to obtain , directly or indirectly , a financial or other material benefit , of the illegal *entry** of a person into a state party of which the person is not a national '' . * Human smuggling is in most countries illegal because they bypass entry procedures How can human smuggling be illegal when exiting a country ? So the illegality of smuggling ( not trafficking ) is where people try to enter a country , never when then they try to leave it . Besides endangerment ( lack of lifevests etc ) and tax evasion I can not think of any other reason for it to be illegal in the west coast of Turkey people travel to Greece by paying some boat captain money , and this is done legally all over the coast for tourists . and https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights Declaration of human rights article 13 states Article 13 : Right to freedom of movement Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State . **Everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . ** Thus I conclude it must be legal to leave a country and no country has any right to stop a person if they are not committing a crime . **and I think that if Europe pays Turkey money to prevent people to enter Europe , then they are both committing crimes . Or they are in violation of their own commitments to the UNHR declaration** Please explain if you think im incorrect . only a few countries require exit visas for people to leave that country .",Turkic,Turkish

'' But their question was foreign I could not understand When then suddenly I 'm ripped up and placed into a mouth And it swallowed me down at which time I head south So I said Hey ya e ya Hey hey hey Well I woke up to see them , these two mighty steeds With their mouths grinning wildly expressing my needs As they stood there above me , being flanked on each side I felt no need to fear them , no reason to hide So I reached up to touch but they faded too soon Yet their mouths still remained and stacked up towards the moon How that ladder of mouth waved so soft in the night And I looked up in awe at that beautiful sight And I dreamt about climbing into the night sky But I knew had I touched them they 'd mouth back 'bye bye' So I got up and walked down the path in the dark And there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark Of a crab twice my size with incredible strength Oh it greeted me kindly and then we all drank And we drooled out together right onto the ground And the ocean grew up quickly right up all around And the earth looked at me and said `` was n't that fun ? '' And I replied `` I 'm sorry if I hurt anyone '' And without even thinking cast me into space But before she did that she wiped off my own face She said better luck next time do n't worry so much Without ears I could n't hear I could just feel the touch As I feel asleep softly at the edge of a cave But I should have gone deeper but I 'm not so brave I said Hey ya e ya Hey ya e ya Hey ya e ya Hey hey hey",Turkic,Turkish

'' up to how many bytes you want and then you can do a `` read drive x pos y '' since the buffering and commands are instantly sent out to the switch the network hardware takes care of the rest , all you have to do is put it out on the network with this you can have literally thousands of SATA drives connected to a single computer What do you think ? someone should make it . edit : ok this wont be the fastest system but I aim for cheap 10 usd per drive + 1x4 gbit ethernet adapter ( 45 usd ) + 2x48 port ethernet switch ( 200 usd each ) + cables +the drives themselves would cost I think very little edit yes this is Ata over Ethernet but I have not found a single product on the net that goes between a network cable and a sata interface edit : thanks for the comments",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,AskReddit,"I 'll add few more things that are deep The definition of a Muslim by the quran is being righteous . Moses and Abraham were Muslim because they were righteous . Ie they were shown the teachings after they lived righteous lives . They were Muslims before the quran came in the year 600s . Therefore one can be Muslim without even knowing it and following some instructions but forgetting the rest is not guaranteed to make you defined as a Muslim . Islam is for the thinking man , according to the quran . It is said children are born Muslim , why because they most often follow their hearts and try to be good , they are often in the state of purity of the heart before often being distorted by life and teachings of others . If you live with the intention of being good and true and do those things then you follow the category of Muslim not the other way around This post may be controversial for all sides but so be it . Islam is for the thinking man who is not supposed to accept or reject anything in an instance anyway . Not all Muslims will enter heaven according to the quran . But there will be those from other religions like Christianity who will . It means they will be Christians when they enter . I believe this means they are not supposed to be converted . See : there is no compulsion in Islam . It means : there is no compulsion in Islam . Ie there is no compulsion in Islam . Also you can not in the right mind do something unmerciful and ungraceful in the name of the merciful and graceful when you often do Things in life of Muslims you recite that very thing .

1980sumthing,answers,"disclaimer : this may have errors . Most is correct to my best knowledge . tl ; dr : Without the decoding executable or a codec it would be very difficult , unless it has visible similarities with known codecs . A sufficiently 'home-made ' pack of data would be indistinguishable from garbage , but with the program or codec that decodes it , it would be possible . It all depends on what the worlds have in common , language , common ancestral tech etc . Pulses of commonly visible light may be a common base , even if there are no common cultural/scientific heritage , but that is slow and a codec also requires many underlying systems that can build it up , and all need to conform to same standards , even the bit byte system must be same assuming you assume codec as in video stream on earth pcs , and also the ascii and such . I remind you that most of the tech and codecs are invented by individuals , for a really common base of communication something much simpler should be considered . End tl ; dr. A datastream with radio adds other issues , requirements for checksums , error correction and even registering the start and end of streams , unless of course it has known elements inside it . Also they can have amplitude and or frequency modulation each with limiting characteristics such as distance and bitrate , on earth the radio signals often have underlying systems such as manchester encoding and more than one 'symbol ' per bit . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_rate Varied pulses like from a pulsar star could imaginatively be interpreted as morse code If they were controllable . Even the issue of the stream being base 8 or other system is open for variation if the other system uses unknown characteristics . Although for sake of simplicity if you can assure a basic mutual base , and character set , say ascii , then sending streams that are easily recognizable by the other side is not so difficult , but this requires that it has little to no compression or other algorithms , it would still be a stream of a video but instead of compressed it would be actually inflated . I am talking about a stream of x by y squares of ascii characters , that can be put together to form a video if briefly investigated . IF the video has characteristics of continuous frames and or frames for synchronisation . http : //www.romanm.ch/ascii-movies without 2 directional feed for resending data ( like the protocols the internet uses ) , assuming losses , each frame would benefit from a constant signature or logo for attempting recalibrating of losses ( actually if it is time stable it may be unneeded but still may be beneficial in some cases ) notice that datastream over radio will send individual bits instead of bytes so that will be even more difficult than having a byte feed . given your comment you may want to consider several streams the most basic describing the structure of the one more advanced . **question : do the civilizations have common past , common science , language , letters , order of letters in alphabets , number system , same base number system , same symbols for numbers and letters and mathematics , artistic wording structure ( haiku poems for example ) , etc ? do they have similar technology , are there computers on both ? ** instead of codec/digital , analog transmission may be even preferred because each more advanced set of standard requires the ones below to be known and common . theoretically assuming no issue with losses , a very fast and clear stream of pulses that can be interpreted as 0/1 may be decoded into usable data such as video if investigated , this assumes the base of communication is non existent and the intention is for the transmission to be decodeable with no / minimal ( initially ) compression . **A very clear source of electromagnetic pulses could be decoded , if the frequency was distinct/known/visible and if the stream was slow enough for the decoding system and fast enough to provide valuable transmission , but this isnt codec as we know it and perhaps no underlying subsystem , this could be interpreted as a b/w video feed** As far as I know , even visible light may be preferable over RF . This communication thing gets very complex very quickly if the two parts have little in common . Codecs add a HUGE amount of complexity to the stream . And it assumes it must first even be visible , if like earth computers it would require a bit/byte structure to be common to both worlds . And as it is used on earth , and digitally it would require many many underlying bitrates to be able to achieve that . disregard the rest . Im now fascinated by this subject . There are so many variables , one must assume a base for common communication , for example if this is ascii , this can give a structure that is obviously visible in 2d if decoded properly but again this is not compressed at all in fact inflated , so it would require a much higher bitrate and long distance requires lower . /_/\ / /\ \ / / /\ \ / / /\ \ \ / /_/__\ \ \ /_/______\_\/\ \_\_________\/ would be like /_/\ / /\ \ / / /\ \ / / /\ \ \ / /_/__\ \ \ /_/______\_\/\ \_\_________\/ but as said this requires ascii being known/ achieved . but most pure digital ascii transmissions on earth are based on systems that have 2 way error correction which requires underlying systems and 2 way communication .",Turkic,Turkish

But one could have a offline copy of the generated internet minus all the extras , including litterature , it can include simple svg graphics for informational purposes perhaps on websites like wikipedia for example . I believe the Internet is very much smaller in reality when you remove all uninteresting websites and unessential content , graphics , sound and video media . And many sites just generate webpages for the sake of it . I dont think a copy of ebay would be needed in this system right ? I think we can start right away with building an essential library that can be put in drives with different capacities where the users can select themselves their starting capacity ie 64 gb / 128+ gb etc , and at the same time demand all sites give an alternative fetching system like accessing raw relevant data , like m.wikipedia site gives a minimum page but even less then that alternatively we can change it with scripts . I disregard email , any realtime interactivity ( unless syncing ) , practically all graphics ( except svg ) , all music ( except midi ) , all spam sites link farms and empty sites , and all the web must be reduced until the bare minimum is left . Instead we 'd have a system that can carry the rest . Basic messaging may be added later but skipping that initially will make it faster .

1980sumthing,answers,"1. flat , round and spherical are different independent properties of eachother from various viewpoints a table tennis ball is both flat round and spherical 2. depending on the observer , as is described in a certain writing and videos , the faster the observer is approaching earth , the more flat earth will seem , the writing speaks that each planet is seen as a plane ( disc ) as seen from a higher dimensional being . the proper word describing earth is not flat but a disc shape . 3 . Ive learned of many experiments ( like different lengths of shadows at different longtitudes ) that show it has spherical properties , but knowing that each perspective even if proven by experiments is still is bound by the mechanics of reality , giving the possibility of there being a model that still allows for the experiment 's outcome of showing that it is spherical while in reality it is much different from our prelearned set of alternatives of what the options are . The flat earthers are open to researching the topic and learning alternative viewpoints giving that what information given to them may be incomplete or distorted . Observe that flat earthers mostly find intellectual amusement in learning alternative theories in this subject and are actually learning about and weighing the evidence either way and it is an exercise ( in which most may not be successful ) in critical thinking , if living in a simulation you didnt know what was what and the real physics was completely different from what is taught , a critical stance towards all evidence would be healthier than simply accepting what is taught , and most who do defend the current acceptable notion of reality are 99 % not people who have personal experience of experimental approach to this reality , keep in mind flying in a plane and seeing a curvature is still the limitation of what most people can assess the situation , and even in that case the observations are limited to the phenomena occurring under certain conditions of observation .",Turkic,Turkish

Why are cars not made modular ? do you have to have a new rounded complicated shape of the bonnet and roof etc ? The design choices of cars today are made by very few people it seems if I had my way cars would have obligatory auto stop start feature , tomorrow , every car would have a slightly larger electric startmotor , they are already designed to assist the engine as it is ! and make the cars run on them under 10 mph make the brake and steering hydraulic pump electric so that you can turn the engine off when cruising without any problems , and add a bigger battery with these solutions you can reduce global consumption of petroleum in cars by at least 30 % . but that is not what car manufacturers have in mind . nor is it what petroleum producers want . it is the same reason decentralized offgrid PV panel systems are still not taking off . if every house shared one 250w panel with all neigbours everyone would have access to a huge grid this would eliminate most needs of batteries in daytime , and the entire distribution network , all powerplants , all maintenance people , and more . it would also reduce the tax income on electricity . the perfect world of zero expenditure and no waste , would lead to no income states and common expenditure . the countries can not live without taxes , but that world is possible . thus the problem is not the perfect system but the *system of expenditure . ~~I 'll shut up before we get too deep.~~ I actually would prefer a ugly car if it was my own design the chassis can be designed and lasercut from 1 cm steel , it can be designed in 30 minutes and cut to less than 1k usd .",Turkic,Turkish

In Turkey , police beating civilians has become something politicians turn a blind eye to , because it helps and has helped the current regime at many times . They dont have the humanity to make the laws clear to the police and tell them specifically what they can and cant do , so they see themselves as someone who has monopoly on violence against people and they then think this is a privilege they have to be used at whatever time they like on and off duty . Thus the police force in Turkey deteriorated in trustworthiness the last years specifically after the gezi park riots .

1980sumthing,worldnews,once again my questions remain unanswered rest assured Turks did not care about specifically killing Armenians . But Turks did have real problems with people cutting off supply lines and telegraph lines in Anatolia and other issues when they were fighting a war with Russia . That is why they were expelled . My questions are still not addressed 1. were the populations in aegean and istanbul left to live there ? 2. was there guerilla warfare in Anatolia by Armenian gangs when there was a war in the east ? 3. did the ottoman government order the logistical basic necessities of the Armenians during the expulsion ? 4. did the ottoman government trial and execute those deemed incompetent and responsible for people dying during the expulsion ? 5. did most survive ?,Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,answer my 5 questions,Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"& gt ; I have n't found info on that but the Ottomans had committed several massacres of the Armenian population beforehand , so I would n't be surprised . & gt ; maybe ? ? ? ? ? 518,000 muslims are documented to have been killed by armenians . Guess why ? because the wanted the populations removed from central anatolia , is that also genocide then ? Yes there was guerilla warfare and it is the reason for the shitstorm in the beginning , the armenians saw ottoman empire as weakened and wanted to take advantage of the situation , get help from russians and create a new armenian nation in eastern anatolia . So they attacked convoys cut off telegraph lines . This is the reason for the deportations '' 25,000 insurgent Armenians actively conducting military operations against the empire . '' says one source If the Turks had wanted the armenians dead , 100 % of them would have died . The intent was to remove them from a place of opportunity of causing harm here is more '' none of the Ottoman armies on the fronts in Caucasia , Mesopotamia or Palestine was self- sufficient in food , fodder , ammunition or medical supplies , and all were dependent on the roads and railroads leading west to Istanbul and Thrace for those supplies . Moreover , none of these forces had much in the way of prepositioned supplies available and all required the continuous flow of war material . The Armenian revolutionary committees began to attack and cut these lines of communications in the spring of 1915 . Ottoman army messages regarding the interdiction of the roads and lines of communications in the spring of 1915 clearly demonstrate both alarm and concern for the acute danger presented by the Armenian insurgents . The cutting of the road networks for more than a period of several days had a severe impact on the amount of material getting through to the armies on the active fronts , thereby denying them the means to fight . Thus , the Armenian insurrection was seen as a genuine security imperative requiring an immediate solution , and it was an existential threat to the survival of the empire â s armies.The mobilization and the concentration of the Ottoman army in 1914 brought the entire regular army to the fringes of the empire â s frontiers . The army stayed on the frontiers and by April 1915 was heavily engaged in the Caucasus , at Gallipoli , in Mesopotamia and in Palestine . This drained the army â s strength and left almost no trained regular army combat units in the interior provinces . Moreover , the Hamidiye cavalry had been disestablished previously and its successor , the light cavalry corps , likewise was dissolved in November 1914 . Even the well-trained and mobile field gendarmerie ( Jandarma ) were activated for war and deployed to the active fighting fronts to assist the regular forces . Thus , the Ottoman Empire had sent all of its available military combat strength to the frontlines and in the spring of 1915 had almost no military forces left in the interior . '' they did not have the military strength to forcibly end rebellion in anatolia so they ordered the deportations and the choice was made because of armenian rebels had they not done so they would lose their supply and communication lines to the 3 fronts that they were fighting at the same time , and armenians taking side with russians and trying to negotiate cooperation with other sides . and partially because many of the armenian gangs had caused deaths of muslims , they were also attacked by muslims during the deportations and sometimes they had few guards watching sometimes hundreds of armenians because almost all forces were in the front lines . any lack of logistics from the ottoman side is the fault of the ottoman side , they were responsible for the well being of civilian but you can not hold someone responsible for genocide when they are ordering the well being of the armenians , neither was the general population responsible . And the events of 1915 are incomparable to 1945s . terming it genocide is part of the long term plan of demanding money and eventually land from Turkey .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"Despite the fact that Yaltabaoth possesses only a single parent and was created without the consent of the Spirit of the Monad , he is powerful enough to mimic the creative processes of the superior Aeons . He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither â light nor dark â but is instead â dim â . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad â s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the â waters â that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the â plenoria â or the â Epinoia â , and later as the â pleroma â , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth â s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth â s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,worldnews,"The park riots were a good example of people coming together , for various reasons . After that people havent come together publicly for protesting ( in large numbers ) , because unless it is a huge event , the police are prepared to oppose any gathering of people if it is not done bureaucratically correct way , and they take care to outnumber the gatherings and use excessive force , teargas and watercannons are almost standard . Especially if the topic of the gathering is someting they may have personal reasons to oppose , which is fucked up . ( the ) Park riots was one of the times the people outnumbered the police and they could not enter the park . Not the opposite . The people are by nature opposed to harming others , the police are by nature trained to cause harm , and unfortunately even turn a blind eye when unlawful methods are used . That is where the maturity of lawmakers and upholders is shown . After it became publicly known that people were opposing the police , all sorts of people came to start barricading themselves into the park area , for many various reasons , initially it was to protest the park being damaged , then to protest the excessive force . Thats why the riots began , and police could not do much . ( the ) Park riots are not a reason for people to not riot because they are afraid of something , in fact many turkish people are by now even expecting teargas and water cannons when protesting something . Also , it wasnt a revolt . The protests was against the current party , not against the state itself . Though people may have tried to hijack the topic towards revolting , most were there to protest the administration . And they were doing it becauee they think the administrations heading was detrimental to the country .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"The kiÄºlings made people more adamant to making the people in power leave positions , but seeing that they made their point in making the police unable to have control over the people if they so decided , they saw that the proper way to get rid of them would be with proper methods like elections . The aftereffects of the riots are still lingering on and people work on many different fields towards his goal . It is not that they are afraid of rioting or protesting , the latter they do still for various reasons . But they see that it is pointless to force change in office because if you dont have a person who feels inclined to make *all* people happy , he will hold on to his position . They know that hurting police , who do what they do because it is their job , is not the answer and they could have if they wanted . They think that after all the police is not the enemy and would still be needed for a functioning society . Here is the difference between the riot and revolt , though i may be wrong ( in what the words mean in the dictionary ) , the park protests were against the administration not the state . And they stopped because they found it pointless to keep trying to fight people who are not your enemy and whom you are ( mostly ) trying to not hurt seriously ( police ) . And the people found other ways to channel their wants of the administration being removed . Like forums where people in many areas got together and held meetings to decide what to do to mobilize the 'wants ' . People were mostly not afraid in fact a lot of the people considered it fun and saw it like adventure . They left because they lost interest . A lot of the people had jobs and school at the same time . And came up with more realistic ways of changing the situation . Many people do care but dont know other ways of making things happen besides voting , and this has changed the results in the elections .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"as much as Turkey is a 'democracy ' there are not many channels for people to even make their voices heard . This is a flaw built into the system democracy it seems . If the people in charge dont want to improve the democracy and further the participation of the people , the progress slows down . At the moment there is only one official site that people can write requests and have other people vote on them , and it has no guaranteed official effect . The only alternative now is ranting and yelling and protesting unfortunately . Besides this in recent elections since the park riots , there has been many NGOs formed to safeguard election ballots and the counting of them . The people put their effort and hope in organising people through facebook and twitter , but those offer only limited options in doing that . If people really would have wanted revolt they wouldnt be trying to avoid killing people who are knowingly defending the current administration . This is the difference between the actions of the park riot protesters and other terror organisations who are actually trying to kill people to accomplish this . The protesters didnt do much harm to official buildings or even try to actively harm police . They consciously and knowingly chose to do it this way because they know being a police is a job , the main problem were some idiots who stepped over laws , relaxed interpretation of them , those who turned and still turn a blind eye of the unlawful actions by police , and those who gave the orders to use exessive force . And those who even defended those actions .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Turkey,"Democracy is compatible with the rules in the Quran , but not with the behavior of all men . Power corrupts , and ego pushes people in power to strive for more power . Under God everyone is equal and their personal righteousness is what separates them . If all men stopped striving for control power and violence over others the situstion would be ideal . I am sad to say democracy is maybe incompatible with islam but this doesnt mean that democracy is the right way . There are other systems that are better than democracy , but we use the word democracy as chewing gum in arguments because it is all we know . Giving someone you dont know full control over a country for 4 years is not logical nor sane . Because if they see themselves as emperor and prioritize personal benefit above the people 's then you end up with a dictatorship like tendencies . Not everyone listens to otheers opinions if they dont have to . There are those who do but not everyoneis capable of this . Especially if they have hidden agendas . The warning signs are the simple signs . These people do n't stop at red lights , it is that simple . And no i dont consider the people in charge more muslim than others . The rules in the quran are more sophisticated , and more humble than most men can dare to be . If you want to be scientific , you have to see the difference between the quran and those you think are following it , because they are not always . It is either that or the problem is democracy and it being incompatible with them . The basic essence of being muslim is simple and described in bakara in one sentence only . There are many who are unable to discuss this subject and they ca n't see the essence , the basic western mind can not see the good without the controversial , and the basic muslim mind can not put aside the controversial and see the important good parts . They all choose to focus on details they see fit their own perceptions . Go beyond this please . You are not supposed to read the quran to win arguments over others . The ideal system is not parlamentary democracy , and dont presume that those in charge are in a select group who act perfectly according to the quran .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,Turkey,"If you are talking about Turkey , we are almost dictatorship *because* of this representative democracy , dont forget . It means if somone with means and intent comes , they can make democracies into dictatorships . Direct , electronic democracy is the original democracy in new form , and possible since Internet came . but not everyone wants it . And even more consume oxygen by saying it is impossible . Ideally if everyone helped everyone and was good to everyone , we would n't perhaps need democracy . Democracy is giving a man 4 years of kingship with good intentions and this because you can not put 75 million people into an arena to make decisions which is the original democracy . But now you can put them in a virtual arena orat least some part of the population can participate .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,Turkey,"It is not difficult to find a reason that would make it not work is easy , Finding a formula for making it work is the real work . There are tons of issues that can be brought up , and tons of arguments to make it work . What is important is to have a discussion and agreement platform for the entire population , and we dont have it . Even if this was not for edemocracy , we still should have a public discussion platform to make our wants heard even if it didnt have direct legal power . That we dont have such a platform is the strange thing . In the platform experts and science people can give expert info and data on the subjects and everyone can read and discuss and vote on them , How can this be worse than 1 leader having 10 experts telling him what they know and him deciding , and all this behind closed doors ? ? And you only having 1 chance every 4 years to have any opinion ? ? E-parti.org is working on these things . Giving the people opportunity to learn , discuss and vote on subjects empowers people and encourages them to make enlightened decisions , the opposite would be to make them ignorant uncaring and uneducated in the subjects , and this is exactly whats happening today ! And possibly even on purpose . If you want your people to be caring , enlightened on the issues and capable of making educated decisions , then you must give them the tools and opportunity , and you must work to cut off those who work towards the opposite .",Turkic,Turkish

EU has banned animal import from US because they use estrogen supplements . I wonder why . http : //www.survive-and-thrive-cancer.com/Beef.aspx # .VixhDkFQY90 https : //www.newscientist.com/article/dn10517-red-meat-linked-to-breast-cancer-risk/ Women in the study who ate more than 1.5 servings of red meat per day had nearly double the risk of developing hormone-sensitive breast cancer as those who ate three or fewer servings per week , the team found . A single serving equates to a quarter-pound hamburger , for example , or 100 grams of red meat . The hormones or hormone-like compounds in red meat may promote the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer by attaching to specific hormone receptors on the tumours , Cho suggests . She notes that hormone sensitive cancers are increasingly common in the US â particularly among middle-aged women â while the rate of hormone insensitive cancers has remained relatively stable . The chances that women between the ages of 40 and 49 years would develop oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer in 1992 was 65 in 100,000 , but it increased to 75 in 100,000 by 1998 .

1980sumthing,answers,"I was thinking of making a fpga circuit although I never learned it properly . It would receive from the main PC a simple image , the static page of a website for example and only send back 2 types of data , mouse clicks and keyboard clicks to the main server . This device would only output 1 single image to the connected display as long as it was on , and change only when a new image is sent , for a decent programmer this is something very doable in fpga . and this would be connected over ethernet . So in reality for showing static images on several displays , it would practically have no limit for amount of displays connected and controlled by the main server . All webpages that are static would be easily sent and shown on the terminals . The mouse clicks xy coordinates and other buttons would be sent to the server and a new instance rendered and sent to the terminal . So if one nice pc can handle maybe hundreds of webpages open at the same time , it would be able to handle hundreds of terminals and the processing power would only be required for an instance when rendering the html to a visual output , removing all animations and videos , would make the pages suitable for this . Or just show one image on 1000 displays at the same time because that would also be possible . so a ETHERNET port , mouse input , keyboard input , vga/hdmi output , holding only a single image in HD for example would require only a minimal Fpga chip",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,todayilearned,"https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_ ( aeon ) Buddha had not spoken about the exact length of the maha-kalpa in number of years . However , he had given several astounding analogies to understand it . 1 . Imagine a huge empty cube at the beginning of a kalpa , approximately 16 miles in each side . Once every 100 years , you insert a tiny mustard seed into the cube . According to the Buddha , the huge cube will be filled even before the kalpa ends . 2 . Imagine a gigantic rocky mountain at the beginning of kalpa , approximately 16 x 16 x 16 miles ( dwarfing Mount Everest ) . You take a small piece of silk and wipe the mountain once every 100 years . According to the Buddha , the mountain will be completely depleted even before the kalpa ends . In one situation , some monks wanted to know how many kalpas had died so far . The Buddha gave the analogy : If you count the total number of sand particles at the depths of the Ganges river , from where it begins to where it ends at the sea , even that number will be less than the number of passed kalpas . * A variation of the description of Kalpa that got me interested : Imagine the biggest mountain made of the hardest material in some place Imagine a bird with the softest feathers travels over the mountain every 100 years and each time it passes , one of its feathers touches the mountain somewhere just slightly . The time it takes for the bird to have reduced the entire mountain to nothing , is One Kalpa .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,gifs,"I thought second hand on clocks would be one use but no '' One application of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors : the film does not run continuously through the projector . Instead , the film is advanced frame by frame , each frame standing still in front of the lens for 1/24 of a second ( and being exposed twice in that time , resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz ) . This intermittent motion is achieved using a Geneva drive . ( Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or stepper motor , which allows for fast-forwarding the film . ) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul . Previous projectors , including Thomas Armat 's projector , marketed by Edison as the Vitascope , had used a `` beater mechanism '' , invented by Georges DemenÃ¿ in 1893 , to achieve intermittent film transport . Geneva wheels having the form of the driven wheel were also used in mechanical watches , but not in a drive , rather to limit the tension of the spring , such that it would operate only in the range where its elastic force is nearly linear . If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded , the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited . In watches , the `` drive '' wheel is the one that winds up the spring , and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding ( and also complete unwinding ) of the spring . This so-called Geneva stop or `` Geneva stop work '' was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers . Other applications of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in plotters , automated sampling devices , banknote counting machines , and many forms of indexable equipment used in manufacturing ( such as the tool changers in CNC machines ; the turrets of turret lathes , screw machines , and turret drills ; some kinds of indexing heads and rotary tables ; and so on ) . The Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings . A Geneva drive was used to change filters in the Dawn mission framing camera used to image the asteroid 4 Vesta in 2011 . It was selected to ensure that should the mechanism fail at least one filter would be usable . [ 1 ] '' https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_drive",Turkic,Turkish

There were doctors at the site who checked their body stats before and after the 30 day period . That is what they base their evaluations on . I supposed they are not up to your criteria either . But that doesnt matter for you either , because you say that even if they were giving them proper medicine , because it is a documentary we could assume it is all fake , therefore we should assume it is fake . And you think the medicine men because they have no formal western education , they have been fooling around in the jungles for 2000 years just for laughs . again that doesnt matter because they could all be faking it . if they werent faking it you automatically assume it is still bullshit because you think the medicine men have no knowledge and studies or formal western education . The medicine your ancestors got was also from medicine men before there was universities , and those who gave them the medicine were medicine men . Also why do you say one man died if you are sure they were faking it ? And why do you think they actually had the diseases if they were faking that as well ? You think they went to the jungle so that they could participate in a fake documentary when they know they wouldnt get cured ?",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,Psychonaut,"So you say it is possible the medicine men know about plants that can cure cancer but the documentary makers are just trying to fool everyone into thinking.. that they actually can do it ? Assuming you assume they really were patients with illnesses , the reason they would go to a jungle would be to test out alternative medicine because normal medicine and doctors has not found solutions to their problems You go to a doctor but if that doesnt solve it you either die or find someone who can provide an alternative , not a priest , these guys did not chant away the problems alone , disregarding the chanting and energy stuff , they actually give plants to the people because they think they contain correct cures . Plant substances are also given by western doctors because they have tested them . You assume they have not tested anything for all that time in the jungle And there were doctors from the country that did checkups before and after to see their stats But that doesnt matter either because if it is fake then none of these discussions matter and is not a basis for any verdict for or against medicinal plants . you uphold 2 viewpoints one excludes the other",Turkic,Turkish

And armenians want Turks to feel responsible because thats what armenians tell the entire world . No matter if there were Turks who saved armenian families or if our ancestors have been here for centuries . Would armenians blame hittites and lycians for expelling armenians ? Because they are Turks of today . But it doesnt matter to the genocide proponents because it is the children of Turkey today that armenians want paying a price . And even if a Turk is born on the other side of the world this mentality will blame them as well . The thing is what happened was their only military solution according to them , armenians in edirne istanbul izmir were mostly left alone according to my information , and most armenians who were deported DID survive correct me if im wrong .

1980sumthing,answers,"/u/madpainter : Knowledge of what is possible and where you need to go is only one part of the equation ; the ability to put the knowledge into practice is as equally as important , and then there is the matter of raw materials , food supply , the mix of available talent , leadership etc . I suspect there is also a critical minimum number of scientists and engineers you would need , a sort of critical mass that will be able to get the work done within the balance of their lifetimes . Do n't forget the politics that will surely come into play , especially if there is competition for limited resources , and a host of other things like premature deaths and illnesses . Let 's make some assumptions so at least we can move forward . Assume you will have enough people in all the various sciences ; assume in that group there will be people capable of doing practical work and not just theoretical ; assume they have access to water , metal ores ; and other materials needed to get boot strapped up to a basic industrial level , say Level 1 . The first thing they will need to build will be a power supply driven off a flowing water stream . No big deal ; they can do that will wood for gears and tanned leather hides from animals for drive belts and packing . They will have rudimentary machines fairly quickly . The next jump is much more difficult . Next up they will have to build a steam engine . This step is huge . If they can accomplish this , they stand a good chance of succeeding overall . But to build a good steam engine they will need some moderate to advance metallurgy , and of course , sufficient raw materials to make the alloy blends . Someone will have to be able to make castings for machine parts . The goal here , after the steam engine is made , I think would be to produce a functional lathe and milling machine , and of course the tooling needed to use them . So now that we have a steam engine we can begin to build other machines and piggyback on them to create a new industrial society , but wait , we begin to run into the human problem . Let 's assume everybody gets along ( big assumption ) , there is still the division of labor and available hours . Most of the initial bootstrapping will fall on the shoulders of a small percentage of the group , nuclear and chemical engineers will be pretty much idle during the first mini industrial age , as will many of the other more advanced scientists and engineers . Computer coders ? They will be emptying the latrine trenches for a long time before they become useful . Since we have a limited number in our group , at some point , in the early stages , the people doing the initial bootstrapping are going to run out of available man hours . They can only work so long , and they have a limited shelf life . It would be great if your group was heavily skewed toward certain sciences and skills , but I am assuming it will be a random distribution covering all the sciences . So , how long will it take to get up to basic level 1 , water driven power ? A couple of months perhaps . That 's not too hard and actually requires only a skilled mechanic to do it . Level 2 steam driven power ? Hard to say , but at least 3-5 years if everything goes right ; 10-20 worse case . A new nuclear age ; 100 years but I am just guessing . It really comes down to how many people are available for the tasks that need to be done . I think if your group of scientists and engineers is only 100 , they will not succeed in their lifetime , and it may take hundreds of years to get back a a basic industrial society . I do n't know what the critical mass number is , but a hundred seems barely adequate with all the other factors figured in . You also have to solve the problem of food . Areas rich with mineral ores needed to reach stage 1 may not be suitable for farming . Are you going to have food scientists or actual farmers in your group . Could be critical in the outcome . There is the issue of medical care . Certainly your doctors will be able to produce penicillin easily , but will the current msra and other resistant bacteria continue for a while . A simple injury or cut could be fatal . An injury to a critical engineer or scientist might derail the timeline . Bottom line is that there are far too many variables to say with any certainty how long it would take . It could be done in as little as a 100 years , it might take a 1000 years if the group dies out or ca n't reach that steam level stage quickly . I think that is the key , how fast can they get back to the new steam age . If they can get that far , and the population of the group can be increased , then eventually a return to the modern age would be possible .",Turkic,Turkish

However , Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only Â£1,000 , because she had sent only Â£2,000 herself . & gt ; So the Sultan sent only the Â£1,000 , but he also secretly sent five ships full of food . The English courts attempted to block the ships , but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors . That Â£10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately Â£800,000 ( $ 1.7m ) today . source : http : //www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/Little-known-tale-of-generous-Turkish-aid-to-the-Irish-during-the-Great-Hunger.html",Turkic,Turkish

Ottoman Empire is in control of most of the Southern Balkan parts where Christian people are feeling occupied for centuries . -Armenians start an uprising in 1880s and found a rebellion movement called Dashnak ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation ) to create a greater Armenia . -Armenian armed militas fight against the state and/or local Kurds and Turks like here ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanasor_Expedition or https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1894_Sasun_rebellion ) -their resistance gets suppressed -1915 comes and during the war the eastern part of Anatolia gets invaded by Russia . Russians and Armenians commit crimes against local Turks and Kurds . Local Turks and Kurds commit crimes against Armenians . The time has come for Armenians to create finally a greater Armenia with the help of Russians . -Ottoman Empire orders to evacuate Armenians out of Anatolia to the southern part of the Empire . Along the way a lot of Armenians die , a lot of Armenians get also killed . -Decades later Armenians form a terrorist organization ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia ) and perform terrorist attacks on Turkish diplomats and on Turkish people ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esenbo % C4 % 9Fa_International_Airport_attack ) -during 1990 's they start a war with Azerbaijan , occupy Azerbaijani territory , massacre local Azerbaijanis and displace 700k Azerbaijanis . There 's two sides to this story , this is no 'poor Armenians were killed because they were Armenians ' , there were some legit massacres done by both sides . And the Russian & amp ; Armenian atrocities are heavily ignored . Also another issue is , the first claims were 300k people , then it rose up to 1.5M .

( eg . Abel Xavier using Dianabol ) - top top doctors are involved who know how to use drugs effectively - pre-season is n't drug tested , giving players enough time to 'prepare ' for the season - top players get off ACL injuries for example after 4 to 5 months , which can only be explained by the use of HGH - drugs are used in all sports , it 's not some conspiracy I 'm basing my arguments on . I 'm basing it on the fact it 's used in other sports , too . And those sports are not even half as big as football .

But every time I start to improve my French and start with Spanish , I do n't keep it up , I do n't have any motivation for that . Sometimes I expect too much from myself , sometimes I feel that others expect a lot from me . I feel so much pressure from others and especially from myself , I wan na become successful in life but I also am not ready to put in the work because I lack motivation .

I still believe that he played his best when he was a LW for us and I still believe that it 's the position he 's most comfortable at .

It 's a bit more expensive compared to the others ( double the price ) but it 's worth it . Of course you could take any low fat quark because the recipe makes it tasty anyway . By the way Bio stands for organic . Then I add about [ 15g of organic muesli ] ( https : //d9gkwhfwam31p.cloudfront.net/0296776/4775570_lightbox.png ) . Then 30ml of milk ( 0,3 % fat ) , and 30g of Whey protein powder and here the taste matters , because I 'm using strawberry protein powder which gives my quark the strawberry taste . I 'm eating my quark in the morning , so it 's my breakfast ( therefore Whey ) but if you eat your quark in the evening ( quark contains up to 80 % casein protein ) then you should of course use casein protein powder . And the last ingredient I use , is the [ calorie free strawberry syrup ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/Walden-Farms-Syrup-Strawberry-Ounce/dp/B000W7GXZ2 ) , some drops already makes a difference .

19O5,exmuslim,"As a former moderate Muslim who grew up in a not-practising family ( with an Atheist father though which I found out eventually ) , I am still amazed at how people do n't bother to know about Ä°slam but still believe in it wholeheartedly . Moderate family members and friends totally dismiss my arguments although they have never read the Quran in Turkish which is infuriating . However , in my case , I 'm somewhat of a perfectionist , I 'm pretty sure I could have become a Wahhabi type of Muslim , but I can not understand the hypocrisy others are living . Anyway what is the reason in the case of yours .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,exmuslim,"They feel like we as human beings , the earth and everything around us is supposed to have a purpose . And the other thing they strongly believe in is that the aforementioned are created by God which seems logical for them . Secondary they believe that such a God might have sent a message or a messenger to them , which makes them become vulnerable to indoctrination and eventually leads to them reject scientific explanations to the big bang or evolution . I mean when we think about it , most of us I guess , have become deists or agnostics before becoming atheists eventually .",Turkic,Turkish

Later when I read more about this , I realized that Israelis put a lot of force into making the Brits leave the region by terrorist attacks ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) which seemed to be successful . However , the region was still British per se , and the Brits left the decision to the UN , so it never was under Arabic rule for hundreds of years . Why do they claim it 's theirs ?

19O5,exmuslim,"And she was surprised and confused and denied it . She said it must be some western conspiracy by Christians to separate Muslims from their faith . Because she finds pedophilia disgusting . Then I showed her the hadeeth and some Turkish scholars saying it on YouTube . She was confused but did n't admit it . I asked her if it was legitimate , what would she think . She said that it was a different time and that the messenger was perfect , I asked her if she would give her daughter to marriage at her being six , she said no . I told her how hypocritical her statement is and that Islam since it 's perfect should n't be defended by a different time since it is meant for all times . Then she told me that we should see a scholar , because those information I showed must be rigged . I told her she should find one and I will destroy the scholar with evidence and facts . She then told me to stop talking about it since she seems confused I agreed . It turns out that my mother does n't care much about the fake miracles and how illogical Ä°slam is , but she cares about stuff such as women 's rights . Also , she did n't like the fact that men would have 72 hoes in heaven and the woman would only have her latter husband . She completely denied the sex slave thing as well . She said that I was talking about sex all the time and what 's wrong with me . And I told her that it 's Ä°slam which is talking about sex all the time . I feel sad for my mother to accept Islam unconditionally , but I feel that I have influenced her belief in Muhammad 's greatness in favor of my view .

Because I felt like that - is it sure to say that *b* which is now pronounced like a *v* , the reason that *b* exists as *mp* ? - is there any reason why *au* and *eu* become pronounced like af or ef although there is *ph/f* ? By the way last question not language related . So AFAIK Greece is Ellada , but I see people using hellas . What 's the difference ? By the way I think that the Greek alphabet is the most beautiful alphabet after Arabic . I really love it and learnt it because it looks so pretty . Now it 's a bit useful to read Greek road signs .

The intervention followed a decade of ethnic strife between the Greek and Turkish communities and a coup aimed at bringing about unification with Greece . The Maronites left behind them ancestral villages such as Agia Marina , Asomatos , Carpasia and Kormakitis . The latter is the only remaining place on Cyprus where Cypriot Maronite Arabic - **a dialect infused with a melange of Turkish , Italian and Greek words** - is still spoken.The dialect 's long isolation from the main currents of the Arab world has caused it to develop on a track of its own , to such an extent that it is practically unintelligible to native speakers of Arabic . Linguists are puzzled by the characteristics it shares with the medieval Arabic dialect spoken in Baghdad by the Muslims and Jews , even as they point to evidence that it has reached an advanced stage of language death .

Seriously ? If they did n't have oil , all that place would have become some desert for some fucking camels and bedouins . The Islamic mind is backward minded because Muslim people are Chauvinists , they want to compete with the West , and yet they are inferior on every fucking level . It is because western people have created and invented stuff since industrialization while Muslims fought each other or fought others . Islam and Muslims are backward minded .",Turkic,Turkish

All you see is Muslims being in war since Muhammad . And still people will jerk off to maps of Ottoman times , all because of warfare . And when the industrialization kicked in in the West , they fucked us basically , became superior . And you see the West nowadays , and you see the Muslims nowadays and realize how backward minded Muslims are . And yet chauvinist Muslims will still jerk off to some other Muslims having discovered something . Yeah great , but how did you benefit out of that ?

She considers herself being from Turkey , but being Christian Arabic though , but is in full solidarity as being from Turkey . That 's very common by now , and due to Kurdish migration , it is very much inhabited by Kurds and by Turkmens also . What I love about Turkey is , we have places with influence of different ethnicities , Anatolia has Hittite , Lydian , Byzantine , Greek , Armenian , Assyrian backgrounds , and nowadays provinces and local cultures are influenced by different Kurdish , Arabic , Turkmen , Albanian , Bosnian , Circassian , Lazuri , Turkish people and cultures . We differ a lot , but in the end we are people from Anatolia , people from Turkey . I really find it annoying that people of the Arab World still claim parts of Turkey , due to the fact that most of the Arab states themselves have uncertain borders , and yet they claim , claim and claim . Funny , last week a Syrian dude I was talking to was saying , 'but you know Hatay is ought to be ours , right ? ' .

But when it comes to creatine , people still think they have to have a loading phase , and then have a still higher dosage than 5 grams , that 's all total BS . If you wan na support the supplement companies financially , go ahead , because your loading phase dosage of 20-30g of creatine is 4 to 6 times of creatine you should take a day . Supplement companies know that we know how much protein we should take , but they can fool around with creatine , and too many BroScientists still believe in loading phase and higher dosages , because they want to believe it , or they went through it successfully . But 5 grams a day will have the same effect as 20 grams a day , because your body ca n't take up more than 5 grams anyway .

So we have short vowels , and every vowel is short , but if you want them to be pronounced like a long vowel , ^is used to make them longer , or double *a*s or Ä . For example : alÃ¢met ( pronounced like alaamet ) . So this is an Arabic loan word , and you 'll find ^a lot in Arabic loan words , but ^ is n't used any more , so you will just know by speaking it that the second a is a long vowel . aa : kaale almamak ( to play it down ) : again we have an Arabic loan word here with a long vowel .

It 's a lot of upheaval . & gt ; When I say do n't write down vowels , I mean , unlike in the quran , where pronounciation is dictated strongly and every vowel spelled out , common writing does n't really have that . But some scholars see this as a transition state to a future form of farsi where it 's more codified . That 's what I meant by not writing down the vowels , makes it harder for our language . Well it 's impossible for us Turks to read old texts in Ottoman archives , because it 's Turkish , but in Arabic script . That 's write , but the latin script is fitting our language really well , and a transition back can be considered as ruled out . & gt ; I do n't see why turkish could n't use a modified version of the arabic alphabet tbh . It was used in that way in Ottoman times though .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,iran,"& gt ; I do n't know why any language could n't use another alphabet . Well , if we did n't use any vowels like you and the Arabs in the written form , there could be heavy misunderstandings . For example : 'sÄ±kÄ±ldÄ±m ' means I am bored , and 'sikildim ' means I am fucked . Well , there 's not that much of a different between the latin and the cyrillic alphabet except for that the cyrillic alphabet is used the way it is written . That of course does not fit to French , English or some parts of other LatÄ±n languages like Spanish ( gue vs gÃ¼e ) or Ä°talian ( cia vs ca ) for example . Turkish is pronounced the way it is written so Turkish would totally function with the cyrillic alphabet .

Well it was n't our culture anyway . So it is quite legitimate , is n't it ? Turks had an alphabet before Islam : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_inscriptions Turks had another religion before Islam : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengrism With Islam and Osman Bey , the Turks adopted more and more Arabic and Persian culture . AtatÃ¼rk brought us back to our Turkish roots . The latin alphabet fits Turkish more as well . While you guys mostly do n't use any vowels , we have to do so . For example : sÄ±kÄ±ldÄ±m ( I am bored ) , sikildim ( I am fucked ) . We are Turkish , not Arabic , not Persian , and AtatÃ¼rk did the great step to bring our nation forward and to cut a border to Islam which is a backwarded religion in my opinion . Those Turkish wannabe Arabs like ErdoÄan and his followers who read for example and pray for example in Arabic although they do n't understand shit ; these want that kind of Ottoman times back .

And it amalgamated many farsi and arabic words into it . Are those still as common or were they culled during reforms ? Well , the TÃ¼rk Dil Kurumu ( Turkish language institution ) started at some point after the foundation of the republic simply by replacing used Arabic and Farsi loan words by their Turkish word . So we still have a lot of Farsi originated words , but there were definitely much more . & gt ; I also disagree with your `` harder for turkish '' argument , Even someone here commented that reading Farsi in Arabic alphabet is a bit harder . I learnt how to read Greek and Cyrillic and can say that I can read by now relatively very fast Serbian for example . And if I read Croatian or Bosnian , that 's even faster .

Armenia has seven times less GDP than Azerbaijan for example . About 50,000 Armenians entered Turkey illegally within the last years due to unemployment . With that attitude your government and your nation , will continue to be isolated and play no role in the future . And Armenia has Noone to blame but themselves .

About end of the first decade of the Millennium ErdoÄan realized that it is pretty impossible to become part of the EU , and changed his policies internally , but also he changed his attitude externally . ErdoÄan lead the country in the first years to economic stability , but with the general election in 2007 where his party won the absolute majority of the seats , he realized that he has the ultimate power and is accepted by the people . Out of fear , he started to weaken the army by processes where generals and important people were told to be part of the 'state within the state ' , so they were jailed . ErdoÄan had by that the control of the army again . Fearing a coup d'etat , he had to go the direction the army wanted before , with the US and Israel . After this , he literally did what he wanted . ErdoÄan started a neo-Ottoman line . Wanted to become the hegemon of the Middle East and the Balkans . But except for Macedonia and Bosnia , we do n't have much influence in the Balkans . In the Middle East he supported Mursi , and said that Sisi became president by a coup who needs to be sorted out . He 's a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood who wants people of his Islamic Ideology around him . He supports Hamas , the terms with Ä°srael are at the worst right now , Although he was friends with Assad he said that Assad needs to be removed from his throne . He makes very weird steps , I 'd say that he actually has no clue of the long run consequences of them . Turkey came closer to Iran , China and Russia within the last five years .

Great attitude , great father ! & gt ; I am aged 46 [ ... ] I found out that Islam is man made at the age of 15 . Have been in the closet since . Same for my father , I guess , although my father never admitted to be ( in public ) Atheist or Agnostic , but does n't say that he 's a Muslim as well , or believes in Islam . His parents were all Hajjis , so he always kept it for himself . But he was criticizing a lot of times how Muslims ( esp . Turkish politicians ) use Islam for their benefits . He 's 53 , and he told me he 's a non believer since he 's 16 . When I was younger , I was very much influenced by my maternal grandparents who we 're living close to , they would every time they had the possibility bash my father for being not religious ( enough ) . I did n't like my father very much between the ages of 15 to 18 where I was quite religious , and I was always like 'I wish my father would have taught me how to pray properly , would have gone with me for Jumah 's prayer ' etc . Now , I really have interesting conversations with my father , and I 'm proud of my father for being free in his thinking to accept that Islam and religions in general are man made . My sisters and mother are quite religious in their thinking , but not very active , so they fasted this Ramadhan , and went from time to time to Teravih prayer but still they do n't practice in their daily life . If my father was n't around , it would have been much more complicated for me to tell my family that I have become an Atheist . So , everyone should go his own path , I wanted to show you , although I hated my father 's attitude towards religion , now I love him for thinking freely . But do n't forget , if your wife and the people around you ( relatives ) were n't Muslims , your kids would n't have been Muslims as well . So what I 'm saying is , people are brainwashing , influencing others for their own benefits ( sevap/sawab ) .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,CasualConversation,"It 's mostly not the colour , but the shape of the clothes . I have an older sister who has a great sense for fashion . And I started dressing fine with her help mostly . Since you 're fourteen I do n't know how you 're gon na feel my fashion advice , but if you 'd go with that , then you 'd definitely stand out among your friends . The thing is to look classy , casual and nice . Let 's start with shoes : Of course we all like sneakers , do n't we ? But everyone wears them , especially in your age , so we wan na look a bit different , not just normal . Therefore I recommend two types of shoes : [ These kinda boots ] ( http : //i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v2/1070167088_1/Wholesale-Best-Seller-Discount-Top-Class-Mens-Lace-Up-font-b-Suede-b-font-font-b.jpg ) [ these kinda shoes ] ( http : //www.restposten-germany.de/shop/images/product_images/popup_images/934_2.jpg ) or [ these ones ] ( http : //sp-product-images.s3.amazonaws.com/31599/pic1.jpg ) . Both shoes are relatively cheap , you do n't need to buy $ 150 shoes and be a burden to your parents , and they look classy . You can find these kind of shoes for a very cheap price on the internet ( mediocre quality ) or for a higher price in shops ( very good quality ) . Let 's continue with pants : Well , I was wearing jeans basically till I was about 18,19 , then I stopped wearing jeans and started wearing pants . I still have like two or three pants in my wardrobe but I almost never wear them . So depending on the colour of your shoes , you could go with [ these pants ] ( http : //cyt.mytrends.de/eb/m1chinohose1/s4.jpg ) [ or these ones ] ( http : //cyt.mytrends.de/eb/L5502mzui/s1.jpg ) . The difference compared to the [ kind of cloth pants looking like trousers older men would wear ] ( http : //cdnb.lystit.com/photos/2013/11/28/tommy-hilfiger-patent-yellow-slim-fit-graduate-chino-pants-product-1-15378425-219827562_large_flex.jpeg ) is the shape and how it 's cut . It needs to look cool and not too 'formal ' . t-shirt : Well I mostly prefer t-shirts with only one colour , but nicely cut/slim fit , and having a v-neck . Like [ this shirt ] ( http : //lp.hm.com/hmprod % 3Fset % 3Dsource % 255B/environment/2014/3BL_0126_001R.jpg % 255D , rotate % 255B0.3 % 255D , width % 255B3969 % 255D , height % 255B4640 % 255D , x % 255B739 % 255D , y % 255B29 % 255D , type % 255BFASHION_FRONT % 255D % 26hmver % 3D1 % 26call % 3Durl % 255Bfile : /product/full % 255D ) . And to top it off a nice cardigan : [ Like this one ] ( http : //www.wholesale7.net/images/201302/goods_img/69310_P_1361251657297.jpg ) , although it looks like for a bit older people . Or [ this one ] ( http : //4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TMUCxG6RunI/AAAAAAAAAOk/yLNa3BNNKCw/s1600/cardigan14.jpg ) . Jackets are usually more expensive , but you can still find a nice coat for not that much : coat : [ Something like this ] ( http : //www.mlo.me/upen/v/201403/20140310/Modern-Stand-Collar-Cotton-Blend-Mens-Pea-Coat-205538-859174.jpg ) , I do n't like the color though . Start wearing stuff which fits your body size . If you 're an M guy then wear Medium , if you 're an S guy wear Small . Try to stand out , and you 'll get the attention , but the other way round .

I , as well as many other secular Turks , think that we as Turks should neither fully support Israel nor the Arabs . Considering that both have harmed , and supported our enemies in the recent past , it 's important from a Turkish point of view to NOT try to justify and support one state 's issue , as it was ours . Every state is self-interested , as human beings are . Therefore , Turkey should not have a different policy towards Israel , as well as to Arab states , because of their mutual conflict . Nevertheless , as a human being I ca n't support human rights violations occuring in Israel and Palestine . We , as a country , should neither focus on the West ( USA , UK , Germany , Israel ... ) nor on the 'new ' east ( Russia , China , Iran ... ) , we ( from the state perspective ) should simply live freely , and focus on our own interests , and not interfere on other countries ' issues , they are not ours , and our issues are not theirs .",Turkic,Turkish

[ 52 ] According to J. Rummel at least 128.000 Muslims were killed by Russian and Armenian troops/irregulars during the war . [ 53 ] During JanuaryâFebruary 1918 some 10,000 Muslims were killed in Erzincan and Erzurum by retreating Armenian troops . [ 52 ] War of Independence & gt ; Cilicia was occupied by the British after World War I , who were later replaced by the French . The French Armenian Legion armed returning Armenian refugees of the Armenian Genocide to the region and assisting them . Eventually the Turks responded with resistance against the French occupation , battles took place in Marash , Aintab , and Urfa . Most of these cities were destroyed during the process with large civilian suffering . In Marash , 4.500 Turks died . [ 54 ] The French left the area together with the Armenians after 1920 . T retribution for the Armenian Genocide served as justification for armed Armenians . [ 52 ] I saved my time to evaluate the whole by myself . My point is , in both wars , the Armenians popped up with the help of a mighty nation to kill Turks , remove them from eastern Anatolia and to create a larger Armenia . They failed , and they have to bear the costs . However , KarabaÄ , is completely different , the Armenians attacked Azerbaijan to take over KarabaÄ and not the other way round .",Turkic,Turkish

Long story short , America strengthened Saddam , weakened him , directly led to his execution , forbade any former Baath party member to become MP ( previous party members were mainly of the Sunni Arab Iraqis and had to be member of that party to become powerful because it was the party of Saddam ) , this led to a rule of Kurds and Shia , the Sunnis felt not represented , this led to terrorist attacks and sectarianism , finally ending in support of radicals in either side such as ISIS , Hezbollah and whatsoever .

In the stadium there were more than 1000 cops , imagine that , We had to win , it was more than a match . Juventus scored , and we equalized in 90+ with a header by Suat Kaya , probably one of the smallest on the field . Ä°t was season 98/99 . Season 03/04 : We have Juventus again in our CL group , and they basically qualified for the next round but we are trying our best to qualify at least for UEFA , so in November 2003 there were terrorist attacks in Ä°stanbul , targets : a synagoge , a British bank and the British embassy . Juventus should have played us in December 2003 , however they did all their best to not play in Ä°stanbul , this time they were successful . So the match had to be played somewhere else in Europe with a high distance to Turkey , and it was decided to be played in the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund . Galatasaray 's European supporters turned Westfalenstadion to hell and Kral Hakan ÅÃ¼kÃ¼r scored two against them , making us win 2-0 against Juventus , and we were so happy . Again Juventus could n't profit out of the situation . And the third controversy was last years CL campaign in Ä°stanbul , we needed a win to qualify for the next round , and Juve needed either a draw or a win . However the snowfall led to the game being postponed to the day after . The pitch was unplayable in my honest opinion and Juve tried again to get the match postponed to another time or place , however the match was played the next day and Sneijder scored during the last minutes of the game , and we qualified for the next round . Juventus were pissed at us again . So I guess our international rival is Juventus .",Turkic,Turkish

After Turkey was played , ErdoÄan literally turned 180Â° away from the West , and started his Islamic campaign . Well , first of all , he is very conservative , and so are his followers . He uses the feelings of the public for his own purposes and loves to create a 'we vs them ' situation . Secondly , he 's corrupt as it was proven by hidden recordings , which is no surprise actually , since he and his family got rich , basically over night since he got into power . Turkey is built on the ideals of AtatÃ¼rk which separates religion from state . AtatÃ¼rk said once a sentence like this : 'If my words and science collide , believe in science , it is our guide to the future ' . For fact that he was a closet Atheist and abolished the caliphate , invented the Latin alphabet is pretty much enough reason for any conservative to hate AtatÃ¼rk . Islamic progression you were saying ... is it Islamic to steal the money that belongs to your state ? To build a palace and claim it is the palace of the people ? Is it Islamic to celebrate young students getting attacked by cops for protesting ? Is it Islamic to jail people who do n't agree with you ? I do n't know if that is Islamic progression , it 's a dictatorship , and his sheep will follow him as long as he mentions the prophet , Islam every third or fourth sentence .

19O5,Turkey,"My feelings : Azerbaijanis , Turks from Europe , Turks from Balkans , Cypriot Turks , Turkmens from Syria and Iraq , and Turkic people from South Azerbaijan , we are the same - culturally and lingually . We might differ in religion though . Tatars ( Volga , Crimea ) , Gagavuz people and Turks from the rather western part of the Russian federation are relatively close to us , especially Crimean Tatars . The others ( Central Asia , Siberia , East Turkestan ) , well we have the same language roots and we can understand each other enough to understand the context but we differ a lot culturally . I really do n't feel any special connection to them except for knowing that we have the same roots lingually and racially . I consider central Asian Turks to be our relatives . However , they 're more like the cousins we never meet . Like the cousins in your family you have almost no contact to , but you meet once or twice a year for a family fest .

A lot of politically oppressed people ( my father as well who was an active socialist and one of the leaders of the socialist group of his university ) had to flee or went to jail . Most of these people had the thought of going back sooner or later to the motherland , the first wave after they 've made enough money and they were n't needed anymore by Germany , and the second wave after Kenan Evren , the chief of general staff of the Turkish Army who became president by the coup d'etat , would have handed his position to a democratically elected head of state . However , it did n't turn out how it was supposed to be and people stayed . People seem to forget that Turkish people of Germany , especially the first two generations , experienced a struggle not many people know about .

19O5,arabs,"& gt ; why Arabs dislike Ataturk Please enlighten me . & gt ; Ataturk `` saved '' your country and your people . He threw the Arabs , and every facet of Arab culture he could , under the bus just to be more similar to Europeans . The rest left of the country was mainland Anatolia . Back then it was mainly populated by Greeks , Turks , and Kurds , and in the South a minority of Arabs . What is your problem with AtatÃ¼rk ?",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,arabs,"On the other hand the Egyptians were cool with that . The problem was that the Empire declined under the rule of Sultan AbdÃ¼lmecid . Especially his legitimacy was damaged with the Young Turks gaining more power . You have to see it from a different perspective . The Empire was declining , but that does n't mean that the solution created out of this mess of the WWI was the best outcome for Arabs and the Ottoman Empire . It was the best outcome for the foreigners for sure though .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,arabs,"& gt ; What ? You 'd rather we join the great Turkish Republic with Ataturk ? Oh boy , AtatÃ¼rk back then was a commander busy fighting against the British in Ãanakkale . So you think it was a right decision to fight against the Ottomans , with the British and the French ? Wow , I 'm quite surprised about that . Because first of all , the intentions of the British and the French were to destabilize the Middle East for their own benefits . They partitioned a whole entity , and created states within states within states . With the creation of the British and the French , there 's no and there will be no Pan-Arabism . Why ? Simply : 1 - The foreigners divided the states to create a larger influence and to control them . If those states were as big as the initial Arab states like [ The Kingdom of Syria ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/FEisalkingdom.png ) they were seen as a threat to their own benefits . Who the fuck destroyed that Kingdom ? The French . Why would they do that ? Because it is against the colonial mentality of divide & amp ; rule . Do you really think those foreigners wanted the good for you ? 2 - Puppets : The foreigners installed puppets of them in office in the created Arab states . 3 - Filistin : Jews started to migrate to Palestine after it was under British control . Later they fought against the British , but when it was under Ottoman control , there was no such thing as the wish of Jews to create an independent Jewish state . It came later with the Arab-British conquer of Palestine . Great job . With your first question , I see that you have no clue about WWI and the Turkish War of Independence , but let me enlighten you . Turks basically lost WW I and lost most of their territories , outside of Anatolia . The WWI ended in defeat for the Ottoman Empire and the [ Treaty of SÃ¨vres ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/TreatyOfSevres_ % 28corrected % 29.PNG ) was signed . The treaty included the partitioning of Anatolia as you can see on the map . So we were basically fucked . But Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk as a commander could n't accept the circumstances like the Turkish people . And he formed the TÃ¼rkiye BÃ¼yÃ¼k Millet Meclisi - the Grand Assembly , and declared war on the occupiers . The Ottoman Sultanate and the traitors who signed the Treaty of SÃ¨vres were overthrown and AtatÃ¼rk 's victory ended in the signing of [ the Treaty of Lausanne ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne ) . This treaty reinstalled Turkey in its form before it was occupied , leaving only the question of Hatay open . I do n't know why there 's so much hate towards AtatÃ¼rk among Arabs , but he saved our country and our people . If he would n't have started our War of Independence we would have been cocksucking some foreign dick right now , trust me ! He 's the greatest person who 's ever lived , at least in my world .

19O5,arabs,"Arabs fought with the British against the Ottoman Army , because the British promised them independence in return . However , the Turks still feel backstabbed by the Arabs for supporting the British . The Palestinian flag and the Pan-Arabic colors were invented during the Arab revolt by a Briton . The flag was seen as the flag of the Arab revolt and became later the flag of Palestine after its independence . The British and French have replaced the leaders of the Arab states with their allies . For example [ this guy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali , _Sharif_of_Mecca ) is a good example . Most of the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire did n't necessarily want independence , since back then the religion shaped the identity of the different peoples . However , the British accomplished to convince some Arabs to start a revolt , which lead to a wide spread war against the Ottomans . For example the Egyptians were not supportive of the revolt , it was more the Levant , and especially the Hejaz . Sadly the Arabs shot into their own foot ( that 's how I 'd say it in Turkish ) , and today we can see the struggle of the Arab World as a consequence - especially in the case of Palestine .",Turkic,Turkish

The thing is , and I 'm pretty sure about that , that these people do n't hate the Syrians that they 're Syrian and in our country . So I would rule blind fascism against immigrants/refugees out . Why ? Because there are quite high numbers of Kurds , Turks and Arabs in South East Anatolia . The thing is , the government literally put large numbers of Arabs at some critical places . And since Syrians have taken some places over , or offer work for less money , there are places where Arabic is spoken and people would n't understand Turkish . That kind of stuff you know . And when it happens that a Syrian does some bullshit ( a Syrian killed his landlord recently , some Syrians beat up a child ) it 's easy to gather and chase some Syrians . This kind of stuff makes me really sad , I want our people to not be a burden to already suffering Syrians , but our government fucked up . First of all they involved themselves in the Syrian Civil War , they supported/support ( ? ) the FSA , Al Nusra , ISIS . Why ca n't fucking ErdoÄan keep his nose out of a crucial situation ?

19O5,arabs,"& gt ; Ataturks downside is that he was a racist supremacist with a vision that simply did not match with reality . Wow , actually I 've never heard AtatÃ¼rk being called a racist supremacist , so that 's interesting . I 've heard him being called : gay , Greek , Macedonian , Crypto Jew , Crypto Armenian , alcoholic bastard , Islamophobe , Arab hater , Kurd hater , French cocksucker , wannabe western . And probably more that I ca n't remember . But if you are hated that much , you either did a pretty good job , or a pretty bad one . And I 'm sure that it 's not the latter one . So you were talking about the 'de-Arabifying ' as a racist aspect . What 's racist about giving your nation a whole new identity and taking it back to its roots ? We are Turks , we 're neither Arabic , nor Persian . We are neither Western , nor Eastern . We are neither fully for Islam , nor fully against it . We are stuck in between east and west , between Islamic World and Christians . Imagine that we lived side by side with Armenians , Kurds , Greeks , Arabs , Persians , Georgians and later the Soviets . And all of them except for the Persians and the Soviets wanted a piece of us . AtatÃ¼rk generated a Turkish identity that was more than more or less the religion of Islam . And I 'm very glad for that . He created a secular state , so our people wo n't get beaten with lashes like in most Arab countries . I 'm an Atheist , so , as an Atheist , can you imagine how fucking great it is that I can be freely an Atheist and do n't have to fear for my life ? So that said ; & gt ; Arabic culture It was n't particularly Arabic culture but Islamic culture . For example our elders wash their butts after defecation . You 're talking about Persian or Arabic culture , yet we have different cultures within Turkey . These would n't have existed if AtatÃ¼rk 's reforms would n't have been executed so successfully . The West Turkish culture differs from for example the South East Turkish culture , but how can u know it ? You 're ignorant , and talk about our culture . And all you have seen is probably Istanbul . & gt ; Ataturk 's actions are simply racist , and are akin to Hitler 's dream of purifying his Aryan people . What the fuck ? ? ? We Turks are mostly a mixture of different races . I know my ethnic origin , and my [ forefathers used to be Nomads ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y % C3 % B6r % C3 % BCks ) . However most of the Turks either do n't know their ethnic origin , and do n't care , or they know their ethnic origin and still consider themselves Turkish . You 're talking totally Bullshit , there was no such movement like purifying the Turkish race . WTF ? ? ? What you mean by Turkifying though , is a whole another aspect . That was no part of AtatÃ¼rk 's policies though . Turks are and were predominantly in Anatolia . We have people of different ethnicities in our country from the Balkans , Caucasus , Middle East . What you are probably trying to say is actually exactly the same Arabs did with the Berber people . I have the feeling you 're mad at AtatÃ¼rk for giving us an identity that would have been lost with the downfall of the Ottoman Empire . I really feel that there 's a lot of ignorance and hatred towards AtatÃ¼rk , mostly from people who hate him for being successful .

19O5,Turkey,"Well , we ca n't say that the Westerners simply drew the borders along ethnicities or religions/sects . So therefore the situations emerge like we have nowadays . There 's a 'balkanization ' of the Middle East about to occur . As someone who has knowledge about the end of Yugoslavia , I can see that happening in the Balkans as well . Although the people might have different sects , religions or languages , ethnicities , they can live together - until they demand complete self-determination in form of a state . Maybe , maybe the Iraqi Kurds should be governing themselves as a state , at least they are the ones deserving it most in my eyes . I actually think that if the Kurds became independent , who 'd be next ? But if it should be only one state , I 'd say Iraqi Kurdistan . But that would lead to problems within Turkey though . Ca n't imagine the wish to hold a referendum among Kurds and such kind of political demands . I think that your points make sense though , and your time has come now to show the people that you can function along all that fuck that is going on in your region .

19O5,Turkey,"Hi , My view on KRG : Pro : KRG could be a reliable partner in a region full of terror and fighting . They seem to have no or much less troubles within their region , and it is quite expectable that they wo n't have any in the future . Con : I am first of all supporting the territorial integrity of Iraq . I see Iraq as a failed state since the US decided to fuck Saddam , and therefore I support Iraq and want them to unite their own people and to live in peace and harmony . I think Iraq should become a federal state , so the different peoples in Iraq - Kurds , Turkmens , Assyrians , Shiites , Sunni Arabs can live in peace and harmony . The KRG are trying to make use of the fucked up situation right now in Iraq - they try to extend their territory by claiming cities which were left by the Iraqi army . I do n't like this policy at all , since most of the oil fields are in the north anyway , and they want to claim the most , and they try to assimilate the other ethnic minorities . They either tolerated or supported the PKK for decades as well . Also an established independent state of Kurdish Iraq would lead to the wish to extend their territory . Especially the Kurdish minority of Turkey would want to 'unite ' with them , so that could be dangerous for Turkey , Iran and Syria . Minority language : Well , that 's a bit different compared to other states . Turkey was founded after the Turkish War of Independence and by that time the percentage of Kurds was much less compared to nowadays ' numbers . The desire was to have a united country , no matter of the ethnicity . So nowadays you can find people of different ethnicities like Laz , Circassian , Albanians , Bosniaks , Arabs , Crimeans , Tatars , Kurds , Zaza . The thought to have only one language was simply to keep the different ethnicities united . And that pretty well worked , except for the Kurds . What I criticize is that the Kurds were forbidden to speak Kurdish , which is wrong . Everybody should be able to speak their mother tongue , but the official language should be remained as Turkish .",Turkic,Turkish

We speak Turkish at home , but my sisters who are about my age ( I 'm 91 , they 're 89 & amp ; 93 ) can speak in Turkish as well , but rather prefer to talk in German or sometimes mix the languages up . My mom often uses some German words as well , so u can hear a sentence like 'bu regalÄ±n Ã¼stÃ¼ndeki ... ' , regal means raf in Turkish . So from a younger age I decided to not mix up languages . And I still do n't . You know what you should do imo ? Look for some Turks from Turkey and talk to them in Turkish for example via skype , and maybe a tandem , where they 'll speak in English and you in Turkish . So it 's a win-win situation . I do that to improve my French and Spanish , and it really works , cause there are tons of people who realize how important English is and they wan na talk in English . Not to forget that reading is really important as well , so is watching movies . Those three are my methods to improve my language skills .",Turkic,Turkish

What did he do ? Sign for fucking Ä°nter on a free deal . And when he was playing for Newcastle and called a black player the 'n-word ' and was accused for being a racist , Galatasaray backed him from Ä°stanbul not only by supporting him , but trying to tell the media , that he 's a nice guy and whatsoever . After Newcastle he signed in 2008 for FenerbahÃ§e , because 'he always was a FenerbahÃ§e fan ' , at that time we had financial problems and FenerbahÃ§e had overtaken us not only financially but sportive as well . It was like being stabbed at the back . And his words before the derby were 'Galatasaray is no special team to me , it 's just one of our opponents like the 16 other teams ; so I do n't see a reason why I should n't celebrate if I score ' . He was my greatest idol of my childhood after Hagi ended his career . And it felt like there was one lion in Italy who was not only representing Turkey hut Galatasaray as well . God I was wrong .

We won against Juventus under weird circumstances ( snow ) and won against Copenhagen , played a 2-2 in Turin , and lost to Copenhagen and Real Madrid both away . We won the Turkish Cup without playing against any of the big teams . But it was his decisions , which made him controversial . He for example bought shitty players with the budget he got . He bought for example Salih for 2.75 Million , Hajrovic for 3.5 Million , and these players , though , he gave these players no real chance ! On the other side , he played Burak the whole season as a right winger , and Sneijder as a left winger . And that did n't work out at all . Destroyed Burak 's performance as a striker , and Sneijder could n't shine as a left winger . The team did n't have the confidence we had under Fatih Terim . Of course on the sheet it might look like he did an okay job , but as a Galatasaray fan , I got ta say , that it was a good thing we got rid of him .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,Turkey,"As a Turk born in Germany , I have to say , that I feel exactly the same way you feel . The only difference is , that Turks are allowed to have a dual citizenship in Germany , now for 3 months . Before , they wanted us Turks to prove our loyalty by sticking to the German citizenship . However , I 'm gon na grab the German citizenship next month , and I really look further to leave this country , after finishing studying . What I hear a lot for example is : -Oh ... . you are so different compared to other Turks I 've met -You are German , because you were born in Germany -Turks in Turkey dont accept you AlmancÄ±s anyway , this is your home which I see as a positive assimilation For example I do n't cheer for the German national team during the World Cup , my team , Turkey , is not participating . But these people do n't get that the location where I live does n't change my nationality . However , the thing is : a successful Turk is a German or a German with Turkish roots like Mesut Ãzil ; a failed Turk , who eg . killed someone , he should be deported back to Turkey . Although bother motherfuckers were born and raised in Germany . Funny thing is that , Mesut Ãzil , ca n't neither speak proper Turkish nor proper German . That kid is a total failure , but is incredibly talented when it comes to football . But they see him as a perfect model for integration . In my point of view the most important thing is , living peacefully next to each other . I ca n't deny that I get better along with Turks than with Western Europeans .",Turkic,Turkish

However , my point is , you can have a dominant majority and still have secularism . It 's just since Tayyip , it 's not legitimate as much as it was anymore .

Usually the elders pray , and the parent generation ( people who are 30-55 ) are busy working anyway . The younger generation is not that much interested . So we can see that it 's actually declining , but recently there 's a very weird shift I 've recognized . How was it with the family and the environment of your brother-in-law ? What kind of a relation did you have to these people ? And last but a bit unnecessary question : What was your motivation to go to Germany ? Do you speak German ? Because Turks in Germany do n't speak usually much English or English at all , so it must have been hard to communicate with them . As far as your brother told us about you , you seem to be a typical young adult who enjoyed being young and free . What was the 'oh shit , got ta get out of here ' moment for you ? Were you told to stop drinking , stop talking to guys etc. ? As a Turk I 'm really sad when Islamic fundamentalism is associated with Turks .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,syriancivilwar,"Well Ä±n Iraq the Kurds have their own autonomy . That 's the biggest difference . Although the Iraqi Kurds diverse a lot as well , they 've been mostly united by their fight against Saddam , or now by their fight against ISIS . There 's the Barzani and Talabani clan . Talabani used to be/is president of Iraq , Barzani is leading the KRG . Although most of the Kurds in Iraq are Sunnis , there are a bit more than 500,000 Ezidis which makes about 10 % of the Iraqi Kurdish population . The KRG seems to be relatively stable , and they are committed to the unity of Iraq . Recently though , they 've declared anti Iraq statements , and it can be observed that the Peshmerga are fighting for the flag of Kurdistan and not Iraq . They are also in some bigger cities like Erbil assimilating Arabs , Turkmens and Christians , to create a bigger influence on the occupied territory and claim bigger lands , especially the areas where oil is . The Syrian Kurds , I actually do n't know much about them , but they do not play a big role as far as I know , even in the region where they are , they do n't play much of a role , since those areas are not homogeneous . I know that they are mostly Sunnis . The Turkish Kurds , well I could write a lot about them since I have much more knowledge of them compared to Kurds in other states . But I 'm gon na try to keep it relatively short . They were discriminated in the past , mostly because they are a very big group , and claim to have the right to have special rights as a big minority group . Well , the Kurds were promised an independent country , in nowadays South Eastern Turkey by the treaty of Sevres . However , AtatÃ¼rk won the war of independence , and created Turkey under one flag , one language . So some Kurds were upset , and some started an uprising in Tunceli in 1938 , but the government suppressed that . Kurdish became a forbidden language . But for example Ä°smet Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ , the president after AtatÃ¼rk , and AtatÃ¼rk 's closest partner in during the war of independence and after the independence , was even partially Kurdish . But that 's quite common , and not a big deal . Even Ãcalan , the founder of PKK is only half Kurdish , his mother is Turkish . So we Turks and by Turks I mean people from Turkey , are very mixed , and that 's why AtatÃ¼rk created a state under one language to stop any separation by forbidding minority languages , and by centralization . Nowadays Kurds have got special rights to some extend . I am neutral about this , so are many Turks . But most of the Kurds do not support PKK , though , they 'd like to have more rights . So it is twisted , since PKK claims to serve in the interest of those Kurds . The main problem is though , that the education level in South East Turkey is the lowest in Turkey , so unemployment and ignorance are the biggest issues .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,syriancivilwar,"ISIS is less of a threat to Turkey than PKK . It is easier to take control of a state that is in a civil war . As a matter of fact , ISIS took most Syrian territory simply from the FSA . There might be suicide bombings in Turkey , true ... But the same could be done by PKK as well , right ? The fact Turkey is not supporting any air strikes from Ä°ncirlik Air Base , is the same as in 2003 , it 's because the government is militarily not on good terms with the American administration . Turkey is not interested in supporting America . Simple as that . Politics is about interests not about solving problems like Reza Aslan said , I really liked this sentence , and I think that this sentence is pretty much a good explanation why some things happen although they could be prevented . For example the US supporting Saudi Arabia , which supported ISIS .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,syriancivilwar,"There was no such thing as a genocide against the Kurds . The only 'massacre ' committed by Turks was the Tunceli events , which was actually an uprising by Kurds , destroyed by the Turkish forces . The thing about the PKK is , that most of the westerners I am referring to , do n't care about their history , because they are ignorant , or because they are fighting ISIS . Turkey could n't do anything because of the hostage situation . And still , Ä±t 's not any issue of Turkey . As long as Turkey is n't attacked , I see no reason for involvement in Syria . In Iraq Turkey could have involved in the situation of the Ezidis and Shia ' Turkmens . Considering that ErdoÄan and Barzani are close to each other , but again there was the hostage situation . Syria declared that they 'd declare war to Turkey if Turkey involves in any kind of situation in their country . So Turkey should not get involved in Syria , but they could have got involved in Iraq . PKK burnt down more than 25 schools in eastern Turkey last week , because some letters the Kurds use are banned , how can that be justified ? Anyway the support for PKK is declining in South East Turkey . But among western Kurds they are very liked since they do n't have to deal with their bullshit .",Turkic,Turkish

Fact is , every nation did more or less crimes in the past . But to bringing a topic up , that 's quite irrelevant here does n't solve the issue . If you are so keen on researching 'genocides ' , then look up the so called 'Assyrian Genocide ' which was mainly committed by the Kurds ! ! ! ! ! Kurdish was forbidden until mid 2000s , they were not allowed to teach in their language , and they were not given any extra rights , while they always had the same rights as the Turks or any other minority in Turkey . That 's why the PKK was founded and that 's why they were supported . But since the PKK committed crimes in Kurdish villages , collected money from the people against their will , recruited kids or young people against their parents ' will by propaganda , the Kurds are not supporting PKK as much as they did , nevertheless they support BDP and HDP to seek the power on a political level .

19O5,exmuslim,"& gt ; I literally have n't heard a single good thing about him until now . That 's really sad . I 'm gon na give you a tldr version . AtatÃ¼rk grew up in Selanik/Salonica , went to Ottoman military school and became a commander in the battle of Gallipoli . He became one of the leading figures in this war defending the Ottoman Empire against the English during WW I but unfortunately the Ottoman Empire lost WW I among Germany and Austria-Hungary , so Turkey was split among different countries . The Ottoman Empire was occupied and would have probably lost about 1/3 to 2/3 of its territory . [ Here 's the map of distribution of Turkish land ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/tr/2/21/Sevr_Antla % C5 % 9Fmas % C4 % B1_T % C3 % BCrk % C3 % A7e.PNG ) . The Ottoman Sultanate accepted the defeat and signed the treaty in SÃ¨vres , Switzerland . AtatÃ¼rk and many other Turks could n't accept that , and the Turkish awakening started with AtatÃ¼rk going to Samsun , leading to the start of Turkish War of Independence against the occupiers and the traitors of the Ottoman Sultanate in 1919 . AtatÃ¼rk and his followers won the war , and AtatÃ¼rk created a republic , demolished the caliphate , the sharia law , implemented Switzerland based humanitarian laws instead . He reformed the Turkish language , adapted it to the latin alphabet , and even prohibited the Quran and the Adhan in Arabic , from then on it was in Turkish . So people could understand what they are praying , and that makes sense , does n't it ? ? ?

What I want to say is , there are millions of people only judging other people for being not the way they want others to be although they are morally shit . And that 's typical among Muslims because Ä°slam is not a religion between you and God , it 's an obligation , a commitment , therefore people will judge what kind of a Muslim you are . & gt ; Religion is like a cancer . If not treated ( with education ) , it will spread to the entire body ( society ) and destroy it . Ä° like this , Kinda reminds me of that one famous TÃ¼rkeÅ quote ( Ä°slamiyet ruhumuz , TÃ¼rklÃ¼k bedenimizdir . Ruhsuz beden ceset olur . ) but you 're absolutely right with education .

People were mad at the management for not getting Ibra or Konoplyanka or any other transfers . I 've seen people criticizing the management for extending Sabri 's contract and transferring Jem Karacan , Bilal KÄ±sa and for going after Niasse . For example in the case of Niasse : First 'amk Fener van Persie'yi ve Nani'yi aldÄ± bizimkiler Niasse'yi istiyor , bavulunu topla da git Hamza , dÃ¼Å artÄ±k yakamÄ±zdan' Ä°bra rumours : 'Ä°bra'yÄ± alÄ±n da forma alalÄ±m , bize Ä°bra Åart' then Niasse started to perform excellently in the Russian league : 'bari bunu alsaydÄ±nÄ±z yÃ¶netim , amk ne beceriksiniz' you see that ? At what time these cunts deserve Ä°bra ? As a matter of fact , they think they are vizyonlu when they want a 32 year-old Huntelaar or 35 year-old Ä°bra , but 25 year-old Niasse is vizyonsuzluk . The Turkish fans are fucked up in their minds because they want names , transfers and think with that success will come . These are the same people who wrote after a season with Bruma 'Ãabuk satÄ±n da elimizde patlamasÄ±n' and then they get mad that he has a 8M buy out clause in his loan contract . Or the same people who write stuff as 'Yekta'nÄ±n sÃ¶zleÅmesi feshedilmeli nasÄ±l topÃ§u bu ' after photos of his fat shape was posted online , and when his contract got terminated with him getting 600kâ¬ for it , people went like 'Amk , oyuncu bile satamÄ±yoruz , nasÄ±l berceriksiz bir yÃ¶netim bu ' . These people get mad at the president for not signing Konoplyanka or Gignac and go like 'elimizden kaÃ§Ä±rdÄ±k , amk beceriksiz yÃ¶netimi ' but they forget the fact that these people probably earn much more where they are .

Lol , the Bush government did it itself , and decided to genocide the Iraqi population shortly afterwards . & gt ; Blacks and Native Americans have guaranteed rights like ANY American under the US Constitution Kurds do have any rights , a Turk has , too . & gt ; Meanwhile , what is Turkey doing in comparison ? Literally waging wars one of its minority groups . That 's wrong . PKK is fighting a war against Turkey , not other way around . Saying that PKK is **the Kurds** is horribly retarded and narrow minded . The Kurds have extra rights , they have universities in their own language for example . Do native Americans have universities in their own language ? Kurds were n't enslaved like Black Americans , or segregated like them .

There 's a Kurdish party in the parliament which is ought to represent the Kurds . & gt ; when you consider that Turkey had suppressed the Kurds in the past . When you consider that Black Americans were suppressed for centuries ; where are their rights ? When you consider that Native Americans have been genocided for centuries ; where are their rights ? & gt ; Also , the fact is , the PKK have done more to free people from the Islamic State than Turkey or al-Qaeda ( who has received support from Turkey ) ever has . Because they were attacked by them , they have n't done it because they care for the people . The PKK has killed more people in their history than ISIS has . See , you support the PKK because they fight ISIS , that means I can support Al Qaeda because they fight ISIS , too . The fact that you support a Marxist separatist terrorist group would n't make you less of a terrorist supporter if I supported a Islamic group .

I 'm not saying this because I 'm obv . a Turk but because the 'Balkanization ' is only in the interest of greater powers .

Would you think that Sorbs of Germany should have their own state ? & gt ; Do we let an area decide for itself or do we protect the individual minorities from the tyranny of the majority ?

19O5,soccer,"Kosovo was apart from the northern Serbian part Albanian . At times due to the political situation their autonomy was even taken away from Belgrade . From this perspective it was pretty legitimate that they fought Belgrade . My take on their independence : Obiously there are power games played on . And since NATO 's Balkans/Eastern Europe enlargement , it 's quite obvious that they want to not only remain their control in that area but widen their control and interests . Therefore I 'm against such a Kosovar independence , being a realist and an anti-imperialist . The school of thought of realism tells us that states will always look for their own interests ( US controls Balkans ) and that IOs are of lesser importance ( they 're there so the powerful can voice their agenda ) . Therefore I am against it . The AZ-AR situation : Karabakh was not homogeneous like Kosovo ( except for Northern Kosovo ) , they ( Armenians and Azerbaijanis ) in the same area but in different villages . Until the Armenians decided to invade the area , resulting in massacres and displacement of 700k Azerbaijanis . Although the majority of the territory was Armenian , there was never the legitimacy for Armenians to take over KarabaÄ . The UN has oftenly voiced that they are supporting Azerbaijan 's territorial integrity and that the occupation is illegal . The same ca n't be said for Kosovo . But I 'm not supporting any country invading another country in any matter . As a matter of fact I believe that the Turkish army should leave Cyprus , too . In the case of Cyprus , it 's just that the Turks are portrayed as the bad people . The Greek Cypriots massacred Turks and were about to make a coup so they could unite with mainland Greece . But an internationally not recognized TRNC is not helpful for neither Turkish Cypriots nor for Turkey . The status quo sucks , and the solution could have been the Annan Plan . I assume you thought since I 'm a Turk I 'd support the Kosovar independence , but you have to see the reasons behind the acts of greater powers . Obv . Russia is helping Armenia a lot in the KarabaÄ issue as well .",Turkic,Turkish

There is more behind than admitting something . Turks are - feeling not treated equally because powers such as the French , the US , Belgium and many more have commited massacres and genocides , yet they wo n't admit it themselves - claiming that there was no systematical genocide attempt , but the deportation which resulted in deaths which were not intended and bottom-up massacres which occured on both sides - Armenians rebelled and had to be evacuated . Also they fought AtatÃ¼rk 's TBMM from 1919 to 1921 in South East Turkey . Assassinated Turkish diplomats and influential Turks by a terrorist organization they founded called ASALA . They also massacred local Azerbaijani population in Hocali 1992 and expelled about 1 million local Azerbaijanis from KarabaÄ during the KarabaÄ war and since then they have occupied illegaly Azerbaijani territory .

I tell you from the Turkish POV , that there are big factors , I do n't want to repeat my words all over again , since I 've done it a lot today but the main points are - Turks were in war with Russians . The Armenians started their rebellion and sided with Russians - Massacres were done both ways , Turks and Kurds were killed by Armenians and Russian forces . The other way round as well . - Armenians were not loyal to the Empire and had to be evacuated , so they were deported to Syria , which was still part of Ottoman Empire those days - While being deported , due to circumstances deaths happened , but they were not planned and executed like the Holocaust , but they occured due to bad implementation - Turks accept that massacres happened , Armenians never talk about massacres Armenians have done - Western European powers have commited genocides en masse , such as Belgium in Congo , or the French in Algeria , but they wo n't get mentioned . - Armenians , especially Armenian Americans , have politicized the event so much that it is used for mainly discriminatory reasons . There 's no possibility for empathy towards Armenians . - Armenians occupy Azerbaijani territory and have commited massacres such as the Khojaly massacre in 1992 , they are no angels So my friend , this is the general Turkish view of the events . There 's a slim line between a massive accident , such as deaths during deportation and a planned and executed killing of an entire race . Turks claim that the second one never happened and was never intended . Such documents were never found as well . The biggest issue is that it is a very complex issue which is mostly simplified by media and people .

The tragedy for Armenians was October Revolution because they sided with the Russians in WW I to take especially Eastern Anatolia . Meanwhile Turks and Kurds chopped off Armenian heads , and Armenians chopped off Turkish and Kurdish heads . All , as loss of trust and loss of rational thinking . The Turks decided to evacuate Armenian population into esp . Syria which was Ottoman those days . Ä°t is true that people lost their lives on their way , but it would have had ended very differently if this evacuation did n't happen . Such a tragedy .

A lot of people with Anatolian background are still mentally and traditionally stuck in the old times . Those were working class people who had max . primary education . Then there 's especially leftist people who left Turkey in the 80 's due to political reasons whose kids of course had a different upbringing .

Jews are proportionally the most powerful people , there are not much of them , but they dictate important decisions , so therefore it is not a cultural thing , but has a much deeper reason which is more political .

That 's why the US has tried for decades to kill Fidel by some sort of contract killers , organized coups ( Playa Giron ) and in the end there was nothing they could do except for isolating them by cutting off foreign relations and by embargos .

He even started crying in front of the camera when he was complaining about that . I love Arda 's personality , and wish him all the best . He 's just trying to pursue his dreams . And he won the UEFA Cup , was in the CL final , and won the La Liga with Atleti , so he made the right choice to leave us . I just hope he 'll be back in a few years .",Turkic,Turkish

So one of them was about Beirut , and they focused on Beirut before the Civil War . They were saying it was called the Paris of Middle East and how beautiful it was . Well this documentary I watched was shortly after the Israel-Hezbollah War in 06 . I felt sad about it , that it will probably be never as beautiful as it was before all those wars . Then I saw a following documentary about Aleppo , and I was like damn , one day I 'm gon na make a tour in Turkey and visit all the great cities , and will visit Aleppo , too . Now it 's all in pieces . : (",Turkic,Turkish

I do understand quite a lot of Spanish and Ä°talian because I do understand French . & gt ; What is the cultural , linguistic , genetic similarity between Azeris and Turks ? Well , we 're Oghuz Turks like the Azerbaijani people . We only differ in religion . They are Shia , we 're Sunni ( mostly ) . But obviously we 've mixed up with other ethnicities than them . I 'm from the West , so I guess I have probably some Greek blood . One from Gaziantep has probably some Arabic blood , and the Azerbaijanis have probably other Caucasian ( region ) blood . But they do speak perfectly Turkish , and a standard Turk will at least understand 60 % of what they 're saying .",Turkic,Turkish

Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth , but understanding , making , and healing , to preserve all things unstained .

911Mitdidit,lotr,"& gt ; Aragorn 's comments at the Council of Elrond have more to do with pride in the Rangers and the attitude of the elves who look down on men . aragorn actaully made that speech to boromir after his complaining about gondor being bulwark of the west and recieve no thanks . â If Gondor , Boromir , has been a stalwart tower , we have played another part . Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay . You know little of the lands beyond your bounds . Peace and freedom , do you say ? The North would have known them little but for us . Fear would have destroyed them . But when dark things come from the houseless hills , or creep from sunless woods , they ï¬y from us . What roads would any dare to tread , what safety would there be in quiet lands , or in the homes of simple men at night , if the DuÂ´nedain were asleep , or were all gone into the grave ? â And yet less thanks have we than you . Travellers scowl at us , and countrymen give us scornful names . â â Strider â â I am to one fat man who lives within a day â s march of foes that would freeze his heart , or lay his little town in ruin , if he were not guarded ceaselessly . Yet we would not have it otherwise . 324 the fellowship of the ring If simple folk are free from care and fear , simple they will be , and we must be secret to keep them so .

911Mitdidit,lotr,"'frodo and aragorn scaring nazguls off ' thing only mentioned in the unfinished tales ( hunt of the ring ) but it doesnt follow up the narrative of lord of the rings since its clearly stated that aragorn has no clue why nazguls fled and did n't attack again when nazguls are able to overcome aragorn , frodo , glorfindel and even gandalf .",Turkic,Turkish

911Mitdidit,Turkey,"i get your point but do kurds really think pkk is any good for them in 2015 ? kurds were safe in south east of turkey , they talk in kurdish teach in kurdish , and even turkish goverment formed a kurdish tv channel with turkish taxes . so i feel like the whole point of these clashes are to gain independence in south east rather than basic human rights .",Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,kurdistan,yeah probably wrong . i dont think anyone researches the ethnicity of a spesific city but the election results can give a little bit clue about it since kurdish parties never get more than 15 percent ( max 5 percent before 2014 ) of the votes in antep .,Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,kurdistan,lol at 'anti-capitalism ' nonsense . the only way for kurds getting autonomy or independence for real in turkey is to let these every single capitalist allies of turkey to turn on them and support kurdistan instead .,Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,kurdistan,"to be perfectly honest , anything can happen this time ! people usually admitted that akp is the dominant party of turkey so they didnt give a shit about elections but this time we saw that they are pretty vulnerable and ready to crack down like ANAP and other center right parties did in the past . so i expect this to be the highest voter turnout elections ever . akp can lose or win huge percentage of the votes from nationalist or conservative voters . if mhp or hdp cant pass trough 10 percent treshold we are all doomed . on the other hand hdp will remain the same . will lose the votes from west because they didnt really condemn pkk but on the other hand can take out all kurdish votes unless there wont be a stockholm syndrome . i dont expect any improvement for chp , it will be arround % 25-30 for sure . its already a high voter base and cant reach to like 50 percent without any alliance like akp+cemaat+kurds did .",Turkic,Turkish

First off , I 'm not a Christian , I 'm a Muslim , but I do have a good enough understanding of Christian theology to understand that even your Bible does n't support that idea . Open the Bible and read Titus 1:13-14 which says , `` This witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ; Not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth . '' Revelation 2:9 quotes Jesus as saying , `` I know that works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan . The First Epistle General of John , Chapter 2 , verses 22-23 say : `` Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is anti-christ that denieth the Father and the Son . Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also . '' The jews do not acknowledge Jesus Christ so they have not the Father and therefore could NOT possibly be God 's chosen people . Also ask any Christian Arab living in Palestine and Lebanon what they think of Israel . **Hint** : They will tell you that Israel does n't care what religion they are , they will discriminate and bomb them regardless of what faith they are .

After that , she turned off the lights , and we laid in bed for around 3 hours , in which we cuddled and kissed while we talked about everything , from our hopes and dreams , to what music we liked , to our ancestral heritage . Eventually we fell asleep , and two hours later , she woke me up , asking me to leave because my snoring was annoying , and I reluctantly agreed . I asked for her number , which I later found out to be fake , and belonging to someone completely different .
