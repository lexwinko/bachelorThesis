Roadside bombs are everywhere thanks to some local government support ( paid with our own tax money ) Numerous civilian and construction vehicles are burned .

If Cyprus is considered , geographically , an EU country then Turkey should be also considered European . \\n\\nCulturally I am afraid Turkey is kinda divided into two . There is this at least 40 % of Turkey that is secular and more westernized than the rest . Look at Istanbul or Izmir ( or any western cities ) for example . However I believe with time , we can change . Just like we did in 1920s when Ottoman Empire disbanded and a whole new country born with more based on western values . However with the current government emphasising more on Islamic culture , things doesn\\'t look so well right now . Now I come from a what you might call the elite part of Istanbul but everybody I know is either secular or are not associated with Islam . I don\\'t believe 99 % percent of the population is Muslim . If there was no peer pressure and more freedom of speech , we would be way more secular than most of the countries in the World . \\n\\nYes , Turkey is big . And we are gon na need a whole lot of investment on the eastern part of Turkey to prevent any drug or immigrant trades .

Well at least not militarily . My father side is Cypriot so I think I have more say to this issue than the European people have . Now all most of my family lives either in UK or in Turkey with frequent travels to Cyprus because of the conflict . In this issue I believe both sides are wrong . I believe what Greek Cypriots did was a big NO-NO around 1950s-1960s and Turkey tried its best there to protect its people . Now Turkish military may have used a little excessive force but it isn\\'t any different what US did to Iraq or Afghanistan or what European countries did to rest of the world for colonization ( what I am trying to say that anything country would have done the same thing if they were in that position ) . If Turkey did really intended to invade Cyprus , they would have done it by completely taking the Cyprus . Anyways the fact is the northern Cyprus is really in shitty condition compared to the Southern Side . I have been to both places . I have seen the difference . The fact is I don\\'t like the Turkish or Kurdish immigrants to Cyprus from Turkey anymore than Greek Cypriots do . And I know that is one of the reasons Turkey can not settle on any resolution with the Republic of Cyprus . But you can\\'t just ask the 200 thousand people to leave and go back to Turkey . Especially to those that actually born in Northern Cyprus . The Greek Cypriots are not really excited about any settlements either . They are acting to overaggressive to the issue and are not really trying to use any kind of empathy ( What I am trying to say that they are looking at the issue on only one point of view ) . I can\\'t blame them because probably they were taught like that after the \ '' Invasion of Cyprus\ '' . \\n\\nThe connection to the US isn\\'t something that will make a big difference to EU . Lets all be real , It\\ 's not like US doesn\\'t have any influence on any EU countries . \\n\\nThe closeness to the war-zones never effected the people of Turkey . Except the issue in Syria . That is the result of the bad decision of our government and the fact that other countries are not doing anything to help Turkey to protect and feed the immigrants from Syria . The issue with Kurdish terrorists ( \ '' seperatists\ '' ) doesn\\'t seem to be resolve with any military force unless we fully attack on the terrorist group as well as the cut the funding from the kurds in Europe . Not to mention , we have to stop the drug supplies to EU which basically funds the whole kurdish terrorists . \\n\\nAnother issue with Turkey for joining to EU is that people in EU sees EU kinda like a Christian union . And lets all be really people are also afraid of Muslims from the Middle East because of those live in EU ( even though they are different ) \\n\\nThere are more things to talk about but I am tired .

If you\\ 're fine with conquering foreign lands when you win a war , why do you think the Treaty of Sevres was unfair ? It\\ 's nothing else than what you did to others right ? I\\ 'm asking you and you keep avoiding the topic.\\n\\nByzantine fought with Ottomans directly whereas Treaty of Sevres granted Greece and Armenia huge lands although they were never the major powers that fought agaisnt Ottomans . There is a difference . Treaty of Sevres is unfair because these major powers ( British , French , Italians ... ) were never in Anatolia . Whereas Muslims/Turks did have origins . Yes some of their ancestry came from Central Asia but that doesn\\'t mean they didn\\'t integrated with the locals there . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is exactly what the Ottomans did . Turkic people were not native to Anatolia before they got there and \ '' disturbed the land\ '' as you put it.\\n\\nDo you honestly believe we are completely native to Central Asia ? This is the result of nationalistic propaganda in your country . Visit Turkey and see how similar our people are to yours then decide whether we are completely Asian . Fact is majority of our ancestry lies on Anatolia and surrounding reasons.\\n\\n & gt ; Dude this is exactly what you said you were fine with , a few posts above when i replied to you . You literally said \ '' so what if we conquered them ? \ '' I\\ 'm trying to understand if you agree with the right of conquest or not but it\\ 's obvious that you only agree with the right of the winner when you win and when you lose the war you think that being occupied is unfair . If you think that it\\ 's not right , then you should also agree that what the Ottomans did in Anatolia was not right . Pick one.\\n\\nI was fine with that when it was between 1300-1700s as did everyone else . Everything until the 1800s or even later is a totally different world than it was in 1920s . People and human society changed so did my opinion on the subject . Problem is you people are still continuing that irredentism in 21st century.\\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish

This garden we have does not really have a gardener . And more of a forest-kinda , plants their own gardeners type of deal . Now from nature , we know that single species systems don\\'t always work . Even a human being isn\\'t a single specie system . Best way to have a stable ecosystem is to have a bunch of species all at the same place competing and supporting each other.\\n\\nSo a decision has to be made .

They were about resources . Hell , according to some historians has been always and still is about resources . Some argue that what Germany and Japan did in WW2 was to avoid food shortages that they experienced in recent history . Nationalism is something that mostly follows industrialisation and urbanisation as a city-dweller needs the protection of a state more than a farmer . That is possible to solve . \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' wait a minute , wasn\\'t this our land ? Why am i not feeling safe walking down these streets ?

Did it add anything to our debate ? \\n\\n & gt ; Except there is a world of difference , and everyone who were attacked by racists or Islamists would agree . Europe has itchy trigger fingers for racists - a well deserved reflex honed due to history . Racist attacks are covered extensively and everything that can be done to prevent them is being done . However , violence fuelled by Islam in Europe is hushed , not covered by the media , rapes committed by immigrant groups doesn\\'t even make it to the papers . If you question this , you immediately get called a racist . That is a huge difference right there.\\n\\nI would argue otherwise . You have still attacks by Muslims covered by the media , it has been several months we still talk about Charlie , right ? \\n\\n & gt ; I find your arguments laughable , because they are not very different from the arguments of the people you mock so comfortably .

You go on and on with labels , \ '' conformists\ '' , \ '' intolerants\ '' et cetera . I think that explains your disdain for \ '' nitpicking\ '' , because it\\ 's mighty easy for you when you can do everything over labels . And talk about dishonesty as icing on the cake . \\n\\nThe same way that nitpicking is useful , labels have its uses . It allows the use of abstraction in the discussion . When discussing something so big , you need to discuss abstracts . You can not discuss generalities using individual cases .

Alpy94,europe,"While I do not have much knowledge about Netherlands , here in France most Arabs are mostly well integrated . But my definition of integration is more open than many Europeans . For me integration would be finding people of immigrant descent in different positions where they interact with locals . And in France you have many arabs doing that . On the wikipedia page for Dutch Turks , there are or were 18 different politicians . [ Hell with a definition similar to mine , this study suggest that Turks are well integrated in Netherlands . ] ( http : //eucenter.berkeley.edu/files/tol-a-compariative-study.pdf ) ( interesting study . You should read it ) \\n\\nNow might I offer a different point of view ? While many Turks are integrated , some aren\\'t . Now a question : Would you notice that the person who next to you on the bus was Turkish or of Turkish descent or not ? Turks do not look very different from other Europeans . The only cases would be that of not-so-well integrated ones . So chances are you interact with a lot of well integrated Turks but you don\\'t notice well because you are integrated ! Unfortunately therefore it is natural that people assume that Turks aren\\'t integrated into Dutch society.\\n\\n & gt ; Perhaps it came across as sinister , not my intention.\\n\\nIt came across as very very sinister , though I assumed it wasn\\'t intentional.\\n\\n & gt ; I consider all ethnic and racial backgrounds as having equal worth and rights , but i also believe that the traditional homelands of those groups should be where they remain the majority . That way they all have a place in the world to feel safe among people they can identify with . That would avoid a lot of conflict and violence . ( On that note : # America4NativeAmericans ! ) \\n\\nNow I disagree . People should move around a lot more . It helps to avoid echo chambers in societies for one . It allows for more culture . More ideas . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Anyway i hope that explains my worries about the future of my own people/culture and the incessant whining of our governments about how we should become a \ '' multi-cultural society\ '' . \\n\\nTurks worry about the same thing , about their future . Only their ancestors were poor and migrated , while yours were wealthier . Can you judged them for doing the same thing ? \\n\\n & gt ; Completely ignoring the fact that history has shown how that often leads to fear , hatred and ethnic cleansing . A multi-cultural planet would be a far more viable goal.\\n\\nYou mean having multi-cultural societies leads to hatred ? I would argue the opposite . Societies with a single monolithic cultures tend to be more intolerant as their ideas of natural/usual is more concretely defined , and any thing outside that thin slice is considered wrong . So any interaction with an outside culture will end in catastrophe . In a harmonious multi-cultural society , your idea of usual is wider so you consider a lot more things to be acceptable .

But in actual fact I would argue that Islamic ways of living are not inherently involved in the way the average Turkish person lives their life , and I would even go further and say even the average AKP supporting Turk doesn\\'t live their life with much real Islamic influence.\\n\\nI imagine I will be getting weird stares at the moment . \ '' But Erdogan is Islamist , he is bringing Islamism to Turkey , Sharia Law , headscarves etc.\ '' . It\\ 's true yes . He is using Islamist populism to garner support . The Turkish demographic that supports him easily fall for the plea to emotion . A few Islamic phrases here and there and they are swooning for him , because these are people doe eyed for the days of their ancestors village and since their ancestors saw these words as noble and associated with good deeds , they automatically see it that way as well . This certainly is a problem that causes a division between the way people vote in Europe and the way they vote in Turkey , Turkey still has an electorate that can be exploited with religious populism . \\n\\nBut then in terms of the lifestyle of these AKP voters ... are they actually 100 % living lives that are not redeemable with the West ? I would say no they are not . A religious AKP supporter who does his 5 times a day prayers is not incompatible with the West . Forcing this religion on others is , and to be honest in my experience of AKP voters among my relatives I have never experienced any force or anything in their lifestyles that would see them as being fundamentally different from their humble socio-economic equivalents in Europe ( especially those in the Balkans who are probably much like them but with the Church replaced with the Mosque ) . \\n\\nThere is a minority pocket of hardcore Islamists that are fringe compared to AKP mainstream standards and who actually are most certainly not compatible with Europe in any way shape or form . These are similar to the Islamists we see protesting on the streets of London , Paris or Berlin , who I like to call \ '' the Saudi pocket\ '' . These people shouldn\\'t be in the conversation if they are talking about mainstream Turkish culture and its compatibility with Europe , as they are not representative of Turkish Muslim cultural norms.\\n\\nFor me Turkey\\ 's incompatibility with Europe starts and ends with politics . The fact that a right wing conservative government is in power , voted in by people who see their religious identity like a football team and a Fascist President who resembles a leader from the days European states were riddled with Fascist leaders . The fact that the political institutions and state apparatus\\ ' of Turkey are not up to European Union standards , judiciary etc . things like this . This is the main difference between a Turk and a European . It\\ 's not that there is a deep cultural difference . \\n\\nBut away from politics , if we look at the general Turkish life map , it is the same as a European life map ( and I imagine this life map is true of the whole World ) . Born , go to school , hopefully do well at school and go to university , get a well paying job , get married , have kids , rinse and repeat etc . all while participating in the capitalistic free market along the way . This is just as true for Erdoganist Turks as it is for Europeanist Turks . It\\ 's not as simple as poor working class people from Anatolia VS rich educated Istanbul/Western Coast elite . Much of the bedrock of AKP support is by the \ '' Anatolian Tigers\ '' , the noveau rich who come from humbler backgrounds than the \ '' old money\ '' Kemalists . \\n\\nI guess what I\\ 'm essentially saying is this . Let\\ 's say we lived in a wacky alternative history where Turkey was a historically Christian country . All of the things in Turkish politics could still be the same as they are . There is nothing inherent in Islam that makes Turkish politics the way it is , you can substitute any religion and it would work the same , especially the Abrahamic religions . Erdogan could be a Christian leader using Christian rhetoric to drill the masses up in the same way . A Jesus here , a Jesus there . \\n\\nTurkey\\ 's problems and incompatibility with Europe therefore are not with Islam itself , but with the meta-problem of religion being mixed with politics and with problems in its State apparatus not being up to European standards . Europe could in theory have countries that are Christian equivalents of Erdogan\\ 's Turkey and they would be just an antithesis to \ '' European Culture\ '' as Turkey is . \\n\\nI wrote more than I intended to but there\\ 's my opinion . I\\ 'm very interested to hear other peoples opinions on this topic .",Turkic,Turkish

Scorched Earth Tactics by the Poles buy the Americans and British forces time to set up forward operations.\\n\\n & gt ; By 2053 the US has launched a new Battle Star network ( for now consisting of only a single next gen Battle Star ) , and a next-gen fleet of hypersonic UCAVs that level Coalition military forces .

They invariably found themselves sidelined.\\n\\nGreece\u2019s international creditors , the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund , have long been insisting that the country push forward , ignoring vested interests , with \u201cstructural\u201d reforms.\\n\\nThey are demanding deep changes to the rules and habits of government , both within the state apparatus and in its interactions with citizens and the private sector , for example via taxation , professional licensing or pensions.\\n\\nSince the eruption of Greece\u2019s debt crisis in 2010 , successive governments have prioritized fiscal austerity\u2014trying to raise government revenue and cut expenditure\u2014instead of tackling deeper reforms of the system head on.\\n\\nMany foreign officials involved in Greece\u2019s ill-starred bailout efforts over the past five years say they have learned what Greece\u2019s past would-be reformist politicians always knew : In Greece , hurting vested interests is harder than taxing citizens to death.\\n\\nMr . Papadopoulos learned that early on.\\n\\nHe held three senior cabinet positions between 1993 and 2002 , and passed key reforms as finance , home affairs and health minister.\\n\\nAs finance minister , he brought in a team from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , which consulted Greece on how to set up its own tax-crime squad.\\n\\nHe introduced Taxis , the digitized tax platform Greeks still use today . His tenure marked some of the first important steps Greece took toward a modern tax system . They were also among the last . Tax avoidance , evasion and fraud are now fingered by Greece\u2019s international creditors as chronic problems keeping Greece from recovery and growth.\\n\\nBy 2002 , Mr. Papadopoulos , who was elected with the center-left Pasok party , could see Greece was veering off the track he had try to put it on as finance minister . He had been part of the Pasok effort to lead Greece into the euro area , and felt at the time that the country was bingeing on the cheap credit that had come with the common European currency.\\n\\nJust as the euphoria of spending euros was spreading through Greek society , Mr. Papadopoulos told Mr. Simitis the country\u2019s finances were out of control . They fell out and Mr. Papadopoulos resigned from the cabinet.\\n\\n\u201cMy fight with Simitis came because in 2002 , instead of accelerating reforms within the euro , they stopped completely . The way things were being managed in the economy was leading us straight to bankruptcy , \u201d he said , resting his head on his hand at a quiet cafe in central Athens.\\n\\nMr . Papadopoulos\u2019s cotton-white hair is testament to his battles : \u201cI was attacked in brutal ways even by my comrades inside Pasok whose constituents were upset because of the reforms I was passing . It came at an enormous personal cost.\u201d\\n\\nTassos Giannitsis is no stranger to this kind of war : His tenure as labor minister was more short lived , and the battles against him even more visceral . Mr. Giannitsis in 2001 , again in the Pasok government led by Mr. Simitis , put forward a comprehensive proposal to reform the pension system.\\n\\nTrade unions , opposition parties and Pasok itself unleashed menace on Mr. Giannitsis.\\n\\n \u2018They called me \u2018the Cassandra\u2019\u2019\\n \u2014Former Greek Labor Minister Tassos Giannitsis \\n\\n\u201cGiannitsis was annihilated after his pension-reform proposals . There are few precedents for this kind of universal attack on a politician , \u201d said Loukas Tsoukalis , a prominent economics professor here.\\n\\nMr . Giannitsis\u2019s proposals , which would have reduced the pension levels Greeks receive and made the system overall more sustainable given the country\u2019s demographic and labor-force trends , were never taken to parliament.\\n\\n\u201cFrom the fridge to the bin ! \u201d said the front page of newspaper To Vima on April 28 , 2001 , as the frozen pension-reform plan was scrapped for good.\\n\\n\u201cWhen I told my colleagues in the cabinet about the reforms I was proposing\u2014which mind you were not the toughest available\u2014the attitude I got was that I was spoiling the party , \u201d Mr. Giannitsis said in an interview.\\n\\n\u201cThey were , like , \u2018everything is going great right now , why are you bothering us with a problem that may implode in a decade ? \u2019\u201d\\n\\nMr . Giannitsis had one supporter in that cabinet meeting : Mr. Papadopoulos , who not only agreed that the reforms were necessary , but famously added that they should be tougher , with deeper cuts to pensions and an overhaul of benefits , because what Mr. Giannitsis was proposing was \u201cpeanuts\u201d compared with what was needed.\\n\\nStefanos Manos , a market-oriented politician on the conservative end of the political spectrum , came before Messrs Papadopoulos and Giannitsis and left a legacy of overhauls in privatizations , tax administration , opening of closed markets like mobile telephony , and reforms of the murky land registry\u2014a key institution in any modern economy that however continues to be a problem in Greece.\\n\\nFew senior politicians in Greece have been as unpopular as Mr. Manos , Mr. Tsoukalis said . In 1998 , Mr. Manos was kicked out of the conservative New Democracy party for supporting a proposal by the opposition , Pasok.\\n\\n\u201cHe was the one key person who so early on talked about the bloated state , the unsustainable pension system , and was blocked repeatedly because of resistance from his own party and from society , \u201d says Mr. Tsoukalis of Mr. Manos.\\n\\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand how so many people would want to have so much , to the detriment of the public good , \u201d Mr. Manos wrote in the foreword of his book . \u201cI made an army of enemies.\u201d\\n\\nThe firebrand Mr. Manos has since been involved in liberal politics in Greece , with parties that seldom get more than 1.5 % of the popular vote.\\n\\nToday , more so than in their times in government , these three politicians and a few others are coming to be seen as among the minority of officials who spotted and attempted to change early on some of the core problems that have led to Greece\u2019s almost intractable crisis today.\\n\\n\u201cThey called me \u2018the Cassandra\u2019\u201d said Mr. Giannitsis of the headlines during his unpopular push for reforming the pension system.\\n\\nCassandra , in the Greek myth , was a clairvoyant doomed to always be right , but never believed .

Atopha,europe,"Copying the article due to the paywall : \\n\\n Vladimir Putin is not the master strategist some make him out to be . He\u2019s a gambler and maneuverer whose bold moves are not testaments to vision or cojones but to the unhealthiness of his domestic political situation.\\n\\nHis choice of words in reaction to Turkey\u2019s downing over Syria of a Russian jet\u2014he called it \u201ca stab in the back\u201d\u2014was redolent of another leader who spoke of stabs in the back , and not one whose regime broke any records for longevity.\\n\\nMr . Putin presumably has two immediate goals : Remove sanctions so Russian companies can start rolling over their debts again , without which many may collapse . He also needs higher oil prices to stave off the eventual insolvency of his state.\\n\\nThe Putin regime , let\u2019s recall , arose to loot the benefits of Russian integration in the world economy , not as a reaction against it , despite claims by some today that Russia is motivated by eternal geopolitical insecurities prompted by ( largely mythical ) Western expansionism.\\n\\nHe needs conflict with the West to justify his people\u2019s privation and his failure to allow the diversification and modernization of the Russian economy under a rule of law . He also needs the West\u2019s complicity , which he has mostly gotten . It\u2019s hard to fathom , for instance , why his cheating athletes were allowed at the London Olympics , much less why he was allowed to host the Sochi Olympics . Both would have been unthinkable if the West had publicly recognized his regime\u2019s likely complicity in nuclear terrorism on British soil in the polonium murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko.\\n\\nHis salvation , though he would not phrase it this way , is to become the West\u2019s client regime , while masquerading as a superpower-equal.\\n\\nTruth be told , there are Westerners who would like to accommodate him , but Western politics is not likely to allow it , especially the politics of a post-Obama America.\\n\\nA related problem likely guarantees failure in any case : There is quite probably nothing that U.S. or Western appeasement can do to save the Putin regime from itself in the long run.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the shootdown . Whatever he woke up thinking on Tuesday morning , Mr. Putin now appears to be contemplating playing the victim of NATO aggression ( Turkey is a NATO member ) . Where he goes from here is hard to forecast . Pathological gamblers who get themselves in holes tend to double down . KGB colleagues recall that as a youthful agent Mr. Putin was sidelined to an East German backwater because his recklessness and propensity for miscalculation were unwelcome at a time when the Soviet Union was weak and the KGB had become risk averse.\\n\\nOtto Dietrich , Hitler\u2019s press aide , noted the Fuhrer\u2019s own devolution from \u201cdomestic reformer\u201d into a \u201cforeign-policy desperado and gambler in international politics , \u201d who \u201cbegan to hate objections to his views and doubts on their infallibility . . . . He wanted to speak , but not to listen.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s not exactly reassuring that Mr. Putin\u2019s reaction to Turkey\u2019s defense of its airspace seems to have emerged almost instantly , unlike the shilly-shallying that proceeded his reaction to the blowup of a Russian airliner over Sinai ( perhaps partly because Mr. Putin was trying to figure out if his own security apparatus was involved ) .\\n\\nIf he\u2019s paying attention , Mr. Putin should by now have learned his leverage is much less than he imagines . At least while Angela Merkel is around , he has only managed to turn his important German friend into a quasi-enemy . He has turned a formidable Turkish friend into an actual enemy.\\n\\nOn Friday the Turkish government called in the Russian ambassador for a tongue lashing over Russia\u2019s bombing of ethnic Turks in northern Syria . Tuesday\u2019s downing was clearly not an accident . The Turkish government doesn\u2019t seem to find Mr. Putin quite as impressive as some of his American admirers do.\\n\\nThen again , only the misguided ever did . By March of this year , Russian economist Sergei Guriev estimated that Russia had already spent half its 2015 military budget . Russia\u2019s spending plan was premised on $ 100 oil . This year\u2019s budget hopes for $ 50 oil . Meanwhile , capital flight is running at perhaps $ 100 billion a year . Meanwhile , some of Russia\u2019s biggest companies are verging on default . The Russian army has had to cease recruiting in the fertile Caucasus region due to a worrisome overreliance on Muslim troops . Moscow also faces a growing liability in economically failing Crimea and eastern Ukraine , complicated this week by partisan sabotage of Crimea\u2019s electricity supply.\\n\\nGlobal stock markets dipped only modestly on the Turkish shootdown . Oil jumped a buck . This muted reaction should not be seen as a testament that Mr. Putin or his regime have much of a future .",Turkic,Turkish

Kind of like how Italian Americans speak English rather than Italian.\\n\\nAlso , recently , government gave the option to families to choose their native language as a second foreign language to be taught to their children , provided that at least three families opts for that option . However , I don\\'t think many families chooses Albanian to be taught to their children . \\n\\nThe reason is simple , Albanians aren\\'t concentrated in one area , which means there are often not many Albanians in one classrom . Also , even if some of them want to learn Albanian , it won\\'t be helpful to them since they will rarely see any Albanian speaker in their hometown.\\n\\nIt is sad , I really dislike people who just don\\'t bother to learn their ethnic language , but it\\ 's not entirely the state\\ 's fault .

Turkey passed the \ '' Tevhidi Tedrisat Kanunu\ '' , which could be translated as \ '' Unity in Education Law\ '' , early on in 1924 . Before that , there were religious schools , secular schools , schools of non Muslims , schools funded by Western countries . This made the whole education system a mess , every school system having a different curriculum and an agenda . Schools of non Muslims left a bitter memory in the minds of Turks , when they celebrated the occupation of Anatolia before our War of Liberation , and the religious schools too , when they tried to suppress the Liberation War in favor of the Sultan . Atat\u00fcrk closed the religious schools and brought every school under one secular education system . This law is still present today , which means nobody is getting a school for his own .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; Having it as a museum is by no means disrespectful to you . If anything it\\ 's a compliment and that\\ 's the kind of thing people respected Kemal for . How is it disrespecting to you by having it as a museum exactly ? Because you pass on a great opportunity to flaunt your dominance over a great monument ? \\n\\nWhen Istanbul was occupied after the WW1 , christians ( both local and foreigners ) flocked to Hagia Sophia , trying to pray inside . Again and again they got permissions and support from British and pressured Ottoman Administration . They did this despite it being clear that it was a mosque and the Imperial Mosque at that . They came to our lands and spit on our face ( figuratively ) . Yes , giving respect and forgiving those that disrespected you is a virtuous action and deserves respect . BUT doing it at the expense of your ancestors and people is anything but virtuous . I consider the situation of Atat\u00fcrk making it a museum suspect and do not believe he did it with full knowledge . If he actually did it then he should be ashamed and I would consider such an action as unbefitting for someone like him.\\n\\n & gt ; As far as i know mosques in Greece or Bulgaria aren\\'t turned into churches.\\n\\nThey were simply destroyed outright or left to disrepair ( for much of Ottoman heritage in Balkans , leaving it is same as destroying them ) .\\n\\n & gt ; On the other hand , Turkey is not only trying to turn Hagia Sophia into a mosque , it has already done this with other churches but we\\ 're not talking about that . \\n\\nIt is already a mosque.\\n\\n & gt ; We\\ 're talking about Hagia Sophia because it\\ 's a huge monument that you could preserve as a museum unlike what you\\ 're doing with other churches.\\n\\nWe can also preserve it as a mosque and my people can go and feel the same things as their ancestors did . I fail to see how using it as a museum is preserving anything . Taking it and turning it into a zoo ( not much different ) only preserves building and nothing else . Culture is something that lives , and continuing traditions for centuries while keeping to their original meaning is the thing we should do . There are traditions around Hagia Sophia that we still know and can save before it is too late.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's gold considering the Ottoman Empire used the Parthenon as a gunpowder storage and was half responsible for the single greatest of our monuments getting blown the fuck up.\\n\\nI won\\'t say we cared about your heritage , we didn\\'t . For us it was same as any building . And that explosion also caused deaths of hundreds of people but I guess it was our fault for using \ '' gunpowder storage\ '' . I can understand that it was negligence but it was certainly not on purpose . Many many sites made by Greeks still exists and slowly restored . We don\\'t destroy them because \ '' muh evil Greeks\ '' . \\n\\n & gt ; Name one Ottoman mosque of the scale of Hagia Sophia in the balkans for me please . Don\\'t tell me about random irrelevant mosques cause we\\ 're not telling you about random irrelevant churches in Turkey either . We\\ 're talking about something the size and importance of Hagia Sophia.\\n\\nI thought it was about history and culture but as you clearly show it is about symbolism . Those \ '' random irrelevant\ '' mosques are part of our history and they are the \ '' history and culture\ '' of Turkish people . Funny how you disregard them because of their size . And yes , I realize you don\\'t give a shit about neither your own \ '' history and culture\ '' or ours , it is all about \ '' size and importance\ '' aka its symbolic value . Had you actually cared about it , you would have spoken about hundreds of Greek historical sites that are actually in danger unlike Hagia Sophia . But no , not even 1/1000th care is given to them . And that is exactly my point about you people being hypocrites . We are honest about what we are , we will continue to be so.\\n\\n & gt ; Honestly it\\ 's pointless to debate with someone that sees the Hagia Sophia as a spoil of war and as a \ '' trophy\ '' of conquering another civilization\\ 's city . You have zero respect for the building , for you it\\ 's only something to fuel your warmongery . \ '' Look what we took from you ! It\\ 's ours now and it\\ 's a mosque ! Suck it ! \ '' It fully shows what i meant about the kind of message you\\ 'd be sending out . It\\ 's sad really.\\n\\nYes , I am completely open about it . We will continue to remind those who claim what is ours , that they will never have them.\\n\\nI actually respect many Greeks because they are wary of us for correct reasons , unlike other europeans who do so because of racism.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nTBH we can continue this back and forth forever . Result will be this ; if you want to be respected , first deserve it by actions . You can start by giving us an equal \ '' goodwill\ '' action instead of demands and shit . Considering the \ '' size and importance\ '' of Hagia Sophia , you should start with restoring at least a hundred Ottoman sites ( mosques , shrines , tombs , etc .

It is still owned by the waqf ( fund ) created Mehmet II the Conqueror . He put Hagia Sophia under his private ownership after the conquest instead of the state ownership . State barely have any right to manage Hagia Sophia and its estates and can only do so because all wakfs were put under collective management . Technically all those wakfs are still required to keep to the will of the person that created the wakf . And AFAIK it specifically states Hagia Sophia is to be used as a mosque.\\n\\nIn addition , the order from the council of ministers which decided change to museum is also suspect . The signature wrote \ '' K.Atat\u00fcrk\ '' but was signed before Mustafa Kemal\\ 's got the Atat\u00fcrk surname legally . ( Something like that . [ Here is a discussion about it if you know Turkish ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KvR9q_Bbssk ) . Warning : It is long ) \\n\\nSo Hagia Sophia is still legally a mosque but people are \ '' illegally\ '' prevented from prayers . Though it being used as a museum is not actually exclusive of it being used as a mosque.\\n\\nTo add to this no one other than Turks has any right to speak against our decision . Orthodox Christians could have some justification to ask for a goodwill but they lost it after what they have done to mosques/masjids/tekkes/shrines/tombs on the lands they gained from us . Catholics lost it after they looted ( literally everything , they even took parts of walls thinking it would heal them . WTF ? ! ) and made prostitute sing on inside it .",Turkic,Turkish

Retaining \ '' **political and legal institutions**\ '' doesn\\'t change ethnicity , only state system . It was the rulers that Turkified not peoples . Even if they did , their ethnicity is Turkic now , simply because language is the main factor of ethnicity for much of the world . And only thing that really divided Mongols and Turks were language as they came from the same region and lived side by side for who knows how long . \\n\\nIt is absurd to call them Mongols .",Turkic,Turkish
CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; Ethnicity of the ruler does not determine that.\\n\\nOf course it does . It is not the only thing that determines it but is an important part . What determines being a Turkish state is how much of the state apparatus was created and led by Turks . Also how much Turkic influence the state had . Many Turkic ruled states from Ottomans to Safavids to Mughals had quite a lot common with how they came to power and how their state apparatus worked . Population itself is not the main determinator . Indeed , it is not the citizens that create the state but the ones in power . Citizens merely participate.\\n\\nFYI the first Turkic state in middle east was Tulunids . AFAIK they literally minted coins calling their state Turk . ( I remember it mentioned by the Prince Abbas Hilmi who , by the way , is of Egyptian dynasty.Whom are also Turkic : P ) \\n\\n & gt ; I mean we are not discussing his theological views here.\\n\\nAnd I didn\\'t say anything about theology . Founding ideology of Safavid Empire was based on Safaviyya Tariqah and also Shia sect . Shah Ismail who was a Turk was the person solely responsible for decision to adopt Shiism . Thus he and his followers were the pivot that created the Safavid state . It was Iranians that bowed down to Turkmen , not the other way around . \\n\\n & gt ; Just because Shah Ismael was of Turkish origin , and it had some religious mumbo jumbo , the Safavids do not become Turkish . \\n\\nIt does . One doesn\\'t lose his ethnicity after conquering some place . We conquered eastern roman empire and we are still Oghuz . Todays ancestors of todays Azerbaijani Turks were the ones that created the Safavid state . And those ancestors include thousands upon thousands of people that came from Anatolia and other Turkmen groups nearby . \\n\\n & gt ; Safavid Empire was not Turkish state . \\n\\nIt was . Did it become more Persianized as centuries passed , yeah . But its foundations stayed same . It can be either considered Turkic or Turco-Persian . Just like Ottomans . By the way all Turkic beyliks in Anatolia ( Including Karamanids ) used Persian for their state work , do you also consider them Persian ? This is ridiculous.\\n\\n & gt ; For your information , Mehmet the second was half Greek . Does Ottoman Empire become Greek or what is this logic really ? \\n\\nBlood doesn\\'t determine ethnicity but culture . Mehmed was culturally Turkish . His native language was Turkish , he was the leader of a cultural branch of Oghuz , called himself Han , etc.. Pretty much every outsider saw him as a Turk . Anatolian Turks are genetically closest to the native Anatolians but we are not fucking Hittites . I certainly am not a Greek or a Lycian . IMHO those that became Turks out of choice were smart ones , those that did through sword were weak shits . Better this way.\\n\\n & gt ; Safavids were referred as \ '' Ajams\ '' by the Ottomans . Care to know what Ajam means ? Iranian in Arabic.\\n\\nAnd central anatolia was called \ '' Rum\ '' until few centuries ago . Does that make Turkmen tribes and beyliks Greek ? Iran was predominantly populated by Iranians for centuries . That is why we called it Ajam . Yet they were ruled by Turks until very recently . ( Even today , some people call Azerbaijani Turks are sometimes called \ '' acem\ '' . ) \\n\\nAlso no , Ajam has a complicated history and meaning . Certainly not just used for \ '' Persians\ '' . \\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's like saying Turkey is full Kurds . Ridiculous . They are minority in Iran.\\n\\nTurks were minority in Ottoman empire for a while as well . Doesn\\'t change anything . Iran was ruled by Turks for centuries and they did it while being a minority . Power of sword changes a lot . Albanians taking roles in the government didn\\'t make Ottomans non-Turkish . ( Not to say they don\\'t have a share . It is not a zero sum game . ) Safavids were at least Turkish as it was Persian . \\n\\n & gt ; This has nothing to do with Safavids not being Turkish , I did not say our history started with Ottomans . Seljuks and Ottomans were of Turkish dynasties , granted . Safavid ? You got ta be kidding me.\\n\\nAnd are Azerbaijani Turks not the other branch of Oghuz Turks which made up the Seljuks ? \\n\\n & gt ; Fetret means period of leaderless rule . History is full of these . Hungary had a baby king for fuck sake.\\n\\nIt was a civil war with Ottoman state being split up and fighting against each other . It was completely different than regular dynastic wars between princes.\\n\\nEdit : I think I explained my points quite well . I am not gon na argue for minute details .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"So am I understanding it correctly that \ '' keeping\ '' it a mosque as its owner decided 600 years ago is being disrespectful ? I fail to understand how keeping/making it a mosque causes a disrespect \ '' history and culture\ '' . Especially considering it was not a museum in our \ '' history and culture\ '' . I guess it is only important when it comes to how it was in european history and culture . Place of Hagia Sophia in our history is as a trophy , the greatest of trophies . It is the symbol of our ownership of Istanbul , our victory against Romans and making their achievements ours ( both for past ones and for others continued to be made under ottoman empire ) .

I don\\'t see the world as being white and black . \\n\\n & gt ; Regardless , like i\\ 've mentioned before , both are wrong the way i see it . Turning a church into a mosque or a mosque into a church are both shitty and petty.\\n\\nI agree that it is shitty but pettyness depends on the circumstances . Hagia Sophia was turned into mosque to declare Islam being supreme and the conquest of Constantinople . It had a big propaganda effect which continues today , albeit diminished.\\n\\n & gt ; A lot of old small churches are left abandoned and without repairs as well . There\\ 's a shitload of them sometimes it\\ 's not possible to restore them all . There are many more important and bigger mosques that are being preserved in many countries however . That\\ 's not a justification for what Turkey is doing . \\n\\nYeah , not repairing them because of the lack of resources and other priorities is completely understandable but I am not talking about such cases.\\n\\n & gt ; Not repairing a mosque is nowhere near as insulting or provoking as converting it into a worship site for a different religion ( considering it\\ 's being done out of spite like you\\ 've admitted ) .\\n\\nYes , but question is why should we be the ones that stomach the insult when the other side did/does similar stuff . Let\\ 's see what you think about these ; \\n\\n [ This ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KvR9q_Bbssk ) is from a discussion about Hagia Sophia between historians .

[ Sixth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=21m40s ) show how its dome looks today.Ibrahim Pasha must have loved Jesus a lot for making a mosque with his picture . /s\\n\\n- [ Fifth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m18s ) is tomb of Beyazid Baba . They even turned tomb of a **muslim guy** into a church . Mind that his remains are still inside . I would say worse could happen but as we can see it already does . \\n\\n- [ Seventh one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m29s ) is from macedonia about a mosque ( known as Imaret Mosque ) that got destroyed and replaced with a church.\\n\\n- [ Eight one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m48s ) is Faik Pasha mosque ( they pronounced the location as \ '' navra\ '' but I couldn\\'t find the transliteration ) . It was used as a brothel . Yes , a **BROTHEL**.\\n\\n- [ Ninth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=23m12s ) is S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque ( It think was a church before and returned back to a church ) . This one is actually understandable and justified , others are not.\\n\\n- They also talk about mosques in Thessaloniki that were tuned into night clubs.\\n\\n- [ Tenth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=23m48s ) was Musa Baba Shrine in Chios . It was destroyed or more like demolished with explosives . Here they comment about it like this ; \ '' There were things that got destroyed here ( Turkey ) as well\ '' , \ '' We wouldn\\'t be sad about ones that get destroyed but these ... \ '' , \ '' We demolished some as well but not this way ( referring to purposeful destruction with explosives ) \ '' \\n\\n- [ Eleventh one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=24m8s ) is called Hasan Baba Shrine and it seem they tried to destroy it with explosives but failed : /\\n\\nI guess we were both wrong when we assumed mosques not being turned into churches . Much worse stuff is being done . Only difference is our side pretty much forgot ( or was forced to forget by the state ) about them yet your side continue to whine . As if it was not enough , europeans continue to whine about it as well.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nI won\\'t answer other parts because it is pretty much fallacy and insults . ( At least you real feelings are showing through . ) Kinda funny that you are continuing to act as if I reject not caring about culture . We are not pretending about our intentions . We mostly care about our culture and marginally about others . We also changed those churches into mosques to humiliate our enemies.\\n\\nDifference between your people and mine is that we are honest about what we are , yet your people are not . We do not try to whitewash the history with falsehoods and coverups , in our view reality is quite fine . We do not say \ '' muh history and culture\ '' instead of our real feelings . We say \ '' if you insult us , we will return it back\ '' . Let\\ 's be honest , your people are as bad as mine . Be open about it and give us truth , then we will respect you . Let\\ 's not pretend as if your people don\\'t actually want Istanbul and Anatolia back.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to answer back if these don\\'t change your view at least a little bit .

In Istanbul there are thousands of disused old fountains every few streets . And every old mosque has a place for storing water in the middle of courtyard .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"I shall try to explain it as much as I understand . I must ask you to not come to conclusions prematurely because when it comes to islam things are a lot more complicated and context changes many things . I guess this is true for everything but if you take Islam and evaluate it in comparison to christianity , you will surely misunderstand even most basic parts . And yes , it will be long ... . \\n\\n & gt ; I heard that Islamic State are killing their fellow Muslims in Syria for minor violations of Islamic custom , like eating in daytime during the Ramadan , and that they justify it by accusing them of being apostates . \\n\\nISIS follows a relatively modern reform movement called Salafism/Wahhabism . It is kind of similar to what Protestant movement is to Catholicism . They are claiming to take islam back to its roots and purify it from later additions . Now , you have to understand that islamic law works , is similar to how modern law works with Quran and Sunnah being the framework , then building upon precedent rulings by other judges to decide on laws . This is called taqlid ( imitating ) . So these people reject these rulings and try to do it again but instead of taking past rulings they want to use primary sources ( Quran/Sunnah ) to decide on everything . They are also literalist and strict as in they consider whatever is written should be applied even in cases of metaphors and application is without excuses . This \ '' without excuses\ '' part is very problematic for mainstream islam as sinning doesn\\'t make someone non muslim . \\n\\nAnother problem is declaring people apostates . Yes , there are precedents of such thing happening but it was extremely rare occurrence . Because as in many islamic laws , repentance is an important part on how judge decides . One couldn\\'t just declare another person an apostate , only way for such a case to occur is it the perpetrator is openly declaring islam as a false religion . Anything less he will most certainly get away with lesser punishment . And so long as someone says they are muslim , no one can really say he is not . others can say he is a sinner and tell wrong things but he will still say a muslim . In Turkey many people drink and flaunt every principle of Islam but they are still muslims according to Sunni ( specifically hanafi ) school.\\n\\nIn theory people could be punished with death for thievery but in practice unless there were other big crimes accompanied , it never applied . Randomly googling I found [ this article ] ( http : //dokuman.tsadergisi.org/dergiler_pdf/2008/2008-Agustos/4.pdf ) talking about number of people accused with thievery during 16th to 18th centuries in the city of Bursa ( one of the bigger cities in turkey ) . Across 2 hundred years , 1 to 9 people got killed out of 29 thievery cases . What are the changes that there were only 29 thiefs in a big city ? You have to understand one of the main intentions of law during that time is to make a warning to other people who might try . So in practice only few people got killed even for such laws . But if you look at ISIS they judge dozens to death every day . \\n\\n & gt ; Are Islamic State really practicing an authentic version of Sharia Law ? If not , then how can Muslims even believe that there is only one \ '' true interpretation\ '' of the Quaran ? \\n\\nIn one of the suras inside Quran tells that God will protect the Quran from being corrupted unlike other holy books . So for a muslim , Quran is protected in case of both its writing and its meaning . So whatever meaning Quran has ( single or multiple ) , they are intended and it is still commands of God.\\n\\nNow , there are many differing views on this , but my own understanding ; \\n\\n**Single** : There is no reason for God to put different views so there must be one meaning that is right every time . Just like how rights and wrong don\\'t change so must the teachings of Islam must be universal.\\n\\n**Multiple** : Times and cultures change so God must have considered its teaching to be right for each and every one of these cases . So all interpretations can be true depending on context.\\n\\nSo how do people decide on any of these ? Usually it differs between theological schools and which sunnahs they accept , other theological principles they accept , also different levels of emphasis they put on different techniques of lawmaking , etc . It is fucking endless ... . So every different movement decides on this and thing are also very fluid , there are many in betweens . And this is also so hard to generalise for 1.9 billion muslims , so might as well try to generalize human culture . \\n\\nWhat you should get from this is that they will never agree on what is the exact \ '' true interpretation\ '' , you might as well ignore it . Islamic laws and theology is a lifetime study and even then you can only understand a very limited portion of it . \\n\\nWhen people ask for sharia , they are merely asking their own interpretation of world to be made into law . Does this seem familiar ? Yes , it is how laws are made right now , by popularity . Only difference is they want Quran and Sunnah to be framework for laws ( kind of like constitution ) .\\n\\nSo No ISIS doesn\\'t follow any authentic version and they don\\'t even follow mainstream version . Most people here in Turkey consider them monsters , few agree with some of what they do but even that is varied and have different nuances instead of supporting ISIS . ISIS people are pretty much outcasts of Islam.\\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm genuinely confused here . I keep hearing about how we Europeans are in danger of Sharia from all the Muslims coming here , yet I can\\'t figure out what it\\ 's even supposed to mean in practice . There are Muslim Arbitration Tribunals in Britain , for example . So , why do British Muslims want Sharia law when they basically already have it ? \\n\\nAs an atheist , I had housemates and friends from all kinds of muslims from conservatives to fundamentalists and have spent half my life arguing with them . Result is , even I have no idea how it is gon na be in practice . pretty much very few people disagree on how to do it . So say it will be like how it was in Ottoman times but when it comes to exact details , they all differ . And Ottomans changed so much through time and practiced differently depending on region , how are we gon na choose any of that ? Some pass the problem to scholars but as far as I know situations like Iran where islamic scholars rule are very rare . Instead there were usually a secular ruler who were also the highest authority , so ruler and sacred . \\n\\nNow , my interpretation of people asking sharia is like people who want to live in utopia . My mother who is vehemently secular also says if you can get her \ '' True Islam\ '' , she can accept it as it would be perfect harmony or something . No idea what it means in practice.\\n\\nIn reality though , satisfying people who want sharia is not really hard to do . I can give some suggestions on how I think it can be done ; \\n\\nYou see in modern nations , autonomy and special laws apply by geography but in places like Ottoman Empire special laws differed by your religion and local judges ( called [ Millet system ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_\\\\ ( Ottoman_Empire\\\\ ) ) ) . There were a pretense of universality but in practice groups were sharply divided but also applied locality . \\n\\nLet\\ 's say you were a greek . I meant you personally were subject to the law of Greek Orthodox church and you didn\\'t follow sharia law . And an armenian followed laws of Armenian church . If there were a problem between two groups , laws of injured party applied ( unless one party was muslim then sharia applied ) . These religious authorities decided on taxes and many other parts , so in practice they were autonomous so long as they didn\\'t act against Sultan . It is kind of odd compared to modern law where if you move somewhere , that provinces laws may apply to you . Imagine that everywhere in the empire , people were subjected to laws of their own group . This is present in many countries in the middle east , past and present . It is kind of why this area is so diverse and homogeneity is uncommon . So what muslim people want is for their own laws to apply when there is a problem between two of them . They don\\'t want universal civil laws between everyone but their own civil laws . Of course there would be some laws above this as in constitution , human rights , etc but when they have a problem about their marriage , they don\\'t want to be beholden to secular laws based on christian laws of the past . They have their own thoughts on how marriage , inheritance , defamation , etc laws . Islamic law being above others are of course wouldn\\'t be possible but I don\\'t think there would be any problem because some suras ( or sunnahs ) also ask people to obey the laws of their country so long as it allow them to practice their religion . \\n\\nI must admit I have a lot of sympathy to these kinds of laws . Kind of different laws for different demographics . This can get very complicated , of course but if people hundreds of years ago managed to do it , we can do it too . In a limited context it can work great.\\n\\n & gt ; I realise that you can\\'t speak for all Muslims , as a Turk , but in your opinion , is there any way we could coexist with the migrants ? Because it doesn\\'t seem like they\\ 're going to stop coming anytime soon , and everyone is really upset about it.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any reason for you not live together . There will be some tension as is usual when people of different values meet but all these can be handled with proper state and civil guidance . What is important is to make sure these people don\\'t get confined to ghettos and low-income trap . I heard in germany many turks can\\'t integrate because of how system favors selecting people from early age and makes transfers between good schools and bad ones very hard . So you have make sure these people who are less educated and have less means to be able to improve with state support . Not for everyone but for successful children like scholarships , etc.\\n\\nWow , I wrote so much I hit the word limit and had to shorten some . And I need to sleep as it is 4pm here .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"Whole point of creating secular nationalist identity was to keep people together as much as possible with a single unifying idea . They tried to steer it away from Islam , not for the sake of itself but because it was not working . Islam was simply too loose of an idea and it was not keeping anyone together . Also Arabs had rebelled ; our muslim brothers stabbed us in the back . Wouldn\\'t people ask \ '' what about them ? \ '' ? \\n\\nBUT secular nationalist identity was still based on Sunni Islam ( a subset of it , namely muslims loyal to the Ottoman state ) . That is why Diyanet doesn\\'t include Alevis . ( At least % 10 of population . Why would they not include them inside Diyanet and connect cemevleri/dedes , etc to the state ? ) That is why Turkish speaking Christians were included in population exchange with Greece .",Turkic,Turkish
CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; It\\ 's relevant because a group of people that is institutionally discriminated is the victim while the other is the oppressor , it\\ 's pretty clear-cut.\\n\\nI disagree . Even if they were privileged citizens , classification of what happened wouldn\\'t change . And no , it is not clear cut at all . At least not as clear-cut as the genocide in Srebrenica . Armenians using guerilla warfare , committing massacres and joining Russians is a thing . \\n\\n & gt ; Fortunately , your opinion isn\\'t what decides the meaning of genocide , people like Raphael Lemkin do.\\n\\nYes , and regardless of whether it was genocide or not , my position stays same . You won\\'t find any apology unless you are ready to give same to those were killed ( or more specifically burned ) by your people . ( edit : Just to be clear I am talking about either official or widespread informal apology . ) \\n\\n & gt ; There\\ 's your problem , you don\\'t have enough information . What happened in the Balkans is completely irrelevant and I see this whataboutism all the time from Turks.\\n\\nHow is that whataboutism ? Whataboutism is a defense with an unrelated issue against criticism . I merely said that I am wary about accepting such claims ( \ '' ..defences against Turkish orders of deportation ... are **retrospectively depicted as Armenian rebellions** ... \ '' ) so easily because the implications are quite far reaching . There being an actual rebellion or not is very important and what happened Balkans is quite relevant to the motive and possible continuation of how such rebellion might end . \ '' Armenian national liberation movement\ '' didn\\'t come out of thin air , they were quite informed at what happened in Balkans . \\n\\n & gt ; It doesn\\'t matter how people use it , this is not about your reputation or what random people who have no education in this matter think . Yes , genocide is a crime in itself and by international law it does matter if you classify something as a genocide or not . I know there are people who call every massacre a genocide because it sounds more dramatic to them but that\\ 's not relevant to this discussion . There are scholars in genocide studies and only their verdict needs to be heeded . I don\\'t even understand what your point is . We should just stop distinguishing between genocides and massacres because random people with no credentials throw the word around nowadays ? \\n\\nDude , all I am saying is that it is \ '' too connected with Holocaust , politically charged and used ambiguously\ '' . It is fucking ambiguous because right now you are talking about the \ '' genocide the crime\ '' as if it is same since the crime happened before being defined and AFAIK the court didn\\'t give verdict on it . Then you talk about genocide scholars like they somehow have right to decide . Many of them use different definitions for \ '' genocide\ '' which makes all these more and more ambiguous . Seriously , I merely said I dislike the term ... only to be shown why I dislike it in action.\\n\\n & gt ; Holocaust\\n\\nWhether the word Holocaust is exclusive term doesn\\'t matter . What matters is that the word \ '' genocide\ '' is \ '' too connected\ '' to it . \\n\\nEdit : Where did I say it doesn\\'t fit the definition ? I think it can\\'t be proven but it fits the definition ( at least some of them ) . If it happened today , it would certainly be \\n",Turkic,Turkish

If you check [ here ] ( http : //www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,31977/ottoman-sultans.html ) , you will see most of them added \ '' *han*\ '' to their names . Like \ '' *Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Han*\ '' meaning \ '' *Sultan Suleiman Khan the Law-giver*\ '' ( europeans used Suleiman the Magnificent ) .\\n\\nFirst sultans used *ghazi* meaning veteran and warrior of faith . But after Ottomans got bigger became more than a mere frontier principality , they started using *sultan* and *han* titles together . \\n\\n & gt ; It all means that the word \\'khan\\ ' although might be used to title a king , is far from being the equivalent of the European title.\\n\\nI think you are right about this . While we continued to used *Khan* for Crimean Tatar monarchs , it is not really same with european title . Difference is , there were some kind of hierarchy with european rulers but there was no such thing for us . Nobility passing and inheriting titles between dynasties didn\\'t happen for Turks . After all , we didn\\'t have aristocracy except for the main dynasty members . ( If Egypt governor [ Ali ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt ) had managed to win against Ottoman Sultan , he could have taken his position . Even though he was originally son of a merchant , no one would care . ) \\n\\nClosest thing to hierarchy for rulers was *bey* which literally meant *lord* .",Turkic,Turkish

You take you preconceptions and act as if they support it . Maybe they do but then you didn\\'t give any source showing that . And I explained that when muslims say they don\\'t support equality , they can also mean something else than what european people understand . We are not you , we have a different culture and mentality . And you have to take into account who said this , where they said it , and whom did they say this . Else you take it out of context and risk slandering people.\\n\\nYou take things you heard about muslims then fit them into a stereotype and act as if Erdogans also support it . How do you know it is \ '' actually oppression\ '' ? I know people ( including women ) that support similar things and they are quite sincere about their thoughts .

Who is to judge this ? *\\n\\nSame ones that decided it before . For Turkey it is Turkish people , not you or anyone else . Did europeans ask us when they were doing their laws ? No they did it themselves according to their own culture and situation . Now they are trying to force their values unto us . Act as if we are monsters for being who we are.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; As far as mr & amp ; misses Erdogan ... it looks like an oxymoron one to say that not all \ '' roles\ '' are proper for women ( actually says stay home with the kids ) and the other one to call women to take more \ '' roles\ '' in society . One of them is a hypocrite it seems.\\n\\nI don\\'t see him asking to ban women from taking different roles . Where did you read this ? Not on the articles of OP and you posted .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"Just watched bit of the stream to learn what happened in other players . And it seems people didn\\'t get why I did those release vassal stuff . I would like to explain myself and give my reasoning as to why it could have been good strategy . ( /u/hajutze here ) \\n\\nI was honestly expecting to play as Hosokawa since the excel sheet showed it like that . So when I discovered I got Ottomans , it was kinda late to strategize . I expected a coalition so asked few \ '' helpful spirits\ '' and they confirmed it some of coalition members . But I didn\\'t expect so many big powers joining it . Now , no one really told me the exact coalition but looking at the excel sheet and seeing how so many of them played nations close to each other in last game ( Morocco , Andalusia , Tunis , Mamluks ) , I connected the dots . Some of those didn\\'t really have any reason to attack me . So I tried to reason with them but it seems they didn\\'t do it because it would be beneficial but for \ '' roleplay\ '' reasons . As if those nation ever really cared for ERE in real history . I tried to offer them complete peace and no movement into europe but all I got was \ '' sorry\ '' , silence and \ '' Deus Vult\ '' . I tried to enlist eastern powers but they didn\\'t want suicide with me . ( IMHO this is literally ~~nation ruining~~* fucking up another player\\ 's game . It is also very rude . ) \\n\\nAt this point I didn\\'t really have much choice . I could just give up and choose another nation but , meh , that\\ 's pathetic . So I did what I only could , I tried to make it as hard for my enemies as possible . In the last game I was Qara and Timurid rebels fucked up my army very badly during the game . So I wanted to do something like that . I also didn\\'t want to give them lands they want . After few trials in SP , I realized scutage prevent your vassals from being annexed in a war . Thats why I released Bulgaria . So that Hungary and Poland wouldn\\'t be able to gain anything . I wanted to release Epirus and give it balkans to prevent ERE but I realized the force limit penalty for having vassals too late . I also planned to fuck up my nation and generate rebels when war started . But it seems Ottomans are too stable for that shit . \\n\\nThe reason I attacked the Knights was to finish one of them before the coalition started . In the first startup which failed , the Knights actually had allies so I couldn\\'t attack him . But after restart , it seems they forgot to ally the Knights . His only ally was Byzantium and I wondered if the Byzantium player might join the war by mistake . It would have been great so I tried it . Then the game crashed and the Knights player didn\\'t join . Since I didn\\'t really need the land , I just white peaced . But after learning , the player joined in the next break . Fucking knights , they were always sneaky ... \\n\\nIf I had enough time to test it before the game , I am sure I could do it . If we have priority for veterans in the next game , I will do it 10 times better . IMHO given smart strategy , Ottomans can actually take so many enemies with them . It might not win , but it can turn it into Pyrrhic victory . ( If Lithuanian , Bohemian and Byzantium armies were to be destroyed . It would be a good lesson . ) I also made mistakes . For example , I expected them to move quickly against me but they actually waited until the truce ended . I could have taken advantage of this and declared war first . Stability hit is actually exactly what you want when you need to generate rebels . I could have devastated Byzantium and quickly moved to one of the others and make sure their army is destroyed . It could also fuck up their coordination . Just like how it happened when one of them fucked up and attacked against me across straits.\\n\\nEdit : By the way it was actually fun .

If Muslims in Europe didn\\'t feel any need , they would go to NGOs for their social sensibilities . Question you need to answer is how can you make people care less about their religion ? There are few ways to do it and most of them are quite distasteful . And very very hard to do without breaking basic human rights . Even then it might not work.\\n\\nIf you are dreaming about some ideology that encourages integration/secularization , IMHO you will find nothing people would willingly follow . It is simply do not answer any of their problems in a way they would be happy . \\n\\n & gt ; These people are not flocks of sheep looking for shepherds . If the societies they exist in think and act as though they are this special kind of sheep then that approach itself is a problem and needs to be recognized as such.\\n\\nThey are people , living in a place where their religion is not accepted thus they feel their lack of it more clearly . They are people wishing to be better muslims but can not find established movements they can reach . Calling them sheep is such a generalizing thing . Are people following political ideologies also sheeps ? Are left and right simply product of someone introducing it ? Or are they simply already existing ideas that was organized and structured by others . \\n\\nAlso I think you are contradicting yourself . You say they are not sheeps and then talk about secularizing them . There is already nothing preventing them from secularizing . If they wished to integrate/secularize , they can simply take up the dominant culture and ignore religion . The fact that they do not do this , despite having the alternative is the reason we are talking about it . \\n\\nAll I am saying is that , these people can not reach alternative religious ideas . Money simply allow such movements to reach people more easily . These radical ideas are largely denied in greater Muslim world and the places these people immigrate from . If Europeans allow and encourage these kinds of alternatives to exist , they will not have to see such radical groups . This is not about let\\ 's fight this with that , more about evening the playground . No one is forcing these people to go to mosques . But if the only mosque they can reach is salafi ... \\n\\nThey can also invite other established organizations like Turkish Diyanet but I doubt they are willing to do it . We already protect our people from radicalizing and the problem is largely about other Muslims not having such establishment.\\n\\nEdit : Grammar . I write too fast : ( \\n",Turkic,Turkish
CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; Security forces simultaneously embarked on largescale security operations in the southeast , escalating military activity , arresting hundreds in Kurdish areas , and imposing strict curfews that left civilians trapped in their homes . In response , some residents dug ditches and built barricades to stop police vehicles entering , and armed youth known as the YDG-H , which PKK leaders have told VICE News are not under their control , fought police with guns , rockets , and Molotov cocktails.\\n\\n\\nWhile the article looks like a good outline , this part is wrong ( probably on purpose ) . Barricades were not in response to curfews but the opposite . Young militants recruited from locals and directed by PKK members began barricading some neighbourhoods then government declared curfew and operations started . These young militants were armed with military style guns including sniper rifles and considering the amount of IEDs used , they must have been trained beforehand about how to make them . It is widely believed that PKK stored weapons during the ceasefire and were preparing for this . Another thing is only few PKK members seem to be part of this \ '' barricading neighbourhoods\ '' so they only directed but ones that fought were young people ( many of these are 18- , so children ) .",Turkic,Turkish

I am not particularly informed about the extent of the event but I know how things went in Balkans which is enough to make me wary . Your leaders decided on the course of exclusive nationalism , your people supported them and many worked for foreign powers . I do not need to be a seer to guess what would happen to my people if they succeeded . And considering the event at the end of the war , I am sure it would not be without hundreds of thousands of my people dying . I think there was enough risk that it can be considered a justification . But it shouldn\\'t matter . Innocents died and there should be justice for them even if the perpetrator had a reason . That\\ 's all I will say in the matter . \\n\\n & gt ; And this is you being ignorant . The lawyer Raphael Lemkin who coined the term \ '' genocide\ '' quoted the Armenian genocide as a a prime example of this crime.\\n\\n\\nYes , so ? I know about it and I already consider the event as a genocide.\\n\\nBut how does that falsify what I said ? Is it not connected to Holocaust which was by far more monstrous than most massacres . ( It was an industrialized massacre . ) Is it not politically charged ? And doesn\\'t pretty much everyone uses it ambiguously ? The fact that you even bring up the number of victims already show me that you simply use is as a bigger/worse massacre . It is ambiguous because if we take the meaning most people use , then pretty much every war would be a \ '' genocide\ '' .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"I am not sure about the official stance but I don\\'t think there is any denial about people dying . There are probably excuses , underestimations , propaganda , etc .

I mean our history is quite full of bloodshed and usually we are not particularly ashamed of it.\\n\\n & gt ; Also note that there was never any court judgement for the Holocaust to have been a genocide . The Nuremberg trials were largely about war crimes . The accused were never punished for genocide . The genocide , specifically committed in time of peace was deemed lawful . The Holocaust also was committed prior to the coining of the term genocide which was sometime in 1944 . For all intents and purposes these ( non ) arguments ( need a court judgement , genocide was invented after , ... ) apply equally to both genocides.\\n\\nBut the term \ '' genocide\ '' is still too connected with it . No one can accept it without being put into the same level as Nazis . \\n\\nAnd there is also the matter of it being selectively applied because the western countries only care about some of them . I consider this to be the most denigrating part of such acceptance . Frankly , even though I consider it a genocide , I would be reluctant to ask my state to accept a resolution which apologizes for it . Simply because similar things done to us by others are not considered as such . ( Of course Armenians were not part of those so it is kind of unjust toward them ) Anyway , I think there should be mechanism that researches and declares which past massacres were genocides or not ( not as \ '' crimes\ '' but as historical facts ) .

Some of Turkish people opposed these but Erdogan ignored them and since majority of Turkish people supported him they got away . Few years ago Gulen and Erdogan had a conflict . Gulenists published some tapes that prove frauds of some ministers\\ ' and Erdogan\\ 's families and themselves . They are now seen as terrorists . And majority of Turkish people ignored these tapes and he won next elections again ( We have this retarded mentality that called \ '' Yiyor ama \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131yor\ '' . Roughly translates into \ '' he takes bribes but he does good things/works so we don\\'t give a fuck\ '' ) . Erdogan started purging Gulenists slowly . After two and a half years the coup happened . Erdogan has the support of people more than ever and coup was made by Gulenists ( It is claimed that the Gulenist commanders were going to purged in the high military council later this year . So they made this coup attempt as a last chance ) . So , this massive purge happened . \\n\\nAnswer of your questions are : \\n\\n1 . Most people are ok.\\n\\n2 . Well , we can say that he is cleaning but it is more than likely he will use this to also \ '' clean\ '' the opposition against him .

To give an example from myself , my high school was private and it was owned by Gulenists . And I have Gulenist friends and they are most likely innocent .

If Anatolia were still under orthodox greek rule the accepted European/Asian border would not be the Bosphorus but somewhere around the Syrian/Iraq/Iran border . \\n\\nSecondly , Cyprus is on the Asian continent so their issues needn\\'t be included in this sub either then correct ? \\n\\nThirdly , the Greek island of Rhodes and several others in the Dodecanese are further south and east of some of Turkey\\ 's biggest \ '' asian\ '' cities . \\n\\nFourthly , \ '' Asia\ '' was the name of a small province of Greek Anatolia and was not used to describe the continent as a whole until after Ottoman conquest . \\n\\nFifthly , lets take a country of similar size to Eastern Thrace , say for example Holland , then lets give them a whole swath of territory that they own anywhere else in the world . Because they own territory that is \ '' outside of Europe\ '' no matter how vast it may be , does it make the part that lay within Europe any less european ? Was The United Kingdom and less a part of Europe because ( percentage wise ) a similar portion of the empire existed outside the bounds of Europe ? \\n\\nSixthly , I don\\'t care what you think but Izmir and Antalya feel more European than many parts of Europe do even though they\\ 're \ '' Asian\ '' .\\n\\nSeventhly , Did I mention that Cyprus is an Asian island ? \\n\\nEighthly , Isn\\'t it funny how the bounds of Europe ( politically ) stretch north , south and around Turkey but take extra care to exclude as much of Turkey as possible ? To include Georgia and Armenia which are so obviously east of Anatolia and Cyprus which is south and east , it makes the intention of political cartographers so apparent . If you\\ 're Christian you\\ 're in but if you\\ 're Muslim then don\\'t mind as we carefully draw a circle of exclusion around you . [ My Point ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/vDOVKr9.png ) Just admit \ '' Europe\ '' is a religious designation and leave the geographic argument out of it.\\n\\nNinthly , this is a sub that discusses the issues that face Europe , not issues that take place solely within the confines of Europe .

So seemingly is the operative word in your point.\\n\\nContrary to what EU media would like you to believe Turkey and North Cyprus have been more willing to engage in negotiations to solve the Cyprus issue than Cyprus and Greece have been . It\\ 's almost as if the Cypriot nationalists want to keep this feud going just to rally support for elections . Greece/Cyprus rejected a federation solution proposed a few years back with no counter offer or ideas of their own . Cyprus won\\'t be trusted by Ankara to rule the island fully under complete autonomy as Turkish persecution is the official policy of many Cypriot politicians . It was the very reason for the Turkish invasion decades back . Guarantees must be put in place to protect the 1/3 Turkish majority before Turkey will remove its \ '' Northern Cyprus\ '' presence from the island.\\n\\nBy German law a third generation German born in Germany into an ethnically Turkish household should automatically have German citizenship . The rules get fuzzy when dealing with second generation Turkish Germans . This doesn\\'t seem like a huge issue that should prevent a country\\ 's accession though.\\n\\nThe border issue has always irked me the wrong way . As if Eastern EU doesn\\'t border an unstable region , Cyprus is a short boat trip from the Levant , Malta from Africa , Spain even has exclaves in muslim Africa . These other holes in the EU\\ 's castle gates serve as entry points for just as many radical muslims as Turkey\\ 's border with Greece and Bulgaria .

And worst 99 % of the time they were your neighbours who converted to islam .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Why the hell would we have it in a country where the football is not the real football ? !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What should we be aware of ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"The hell ? Why dont you let Turkish people vote ? They are living there , they have the right to vote . They dont have to support erdogan .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,lol,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . But some may pat your shoulder or arm . Why so scared of that ? : P,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea that goes even farther . And what about them ? They \ '' removed\ '' their Turkish populations .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Look at all those hypocritic westerners who are peak of their human rights , culture and power having fun with weak brown India . They have fun now but when it comes to Turks everyone goes crazy and tells them to pay reperations .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,So I just looked through your comments ...,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Aha , losing ourcreativity , eh ?",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Nobody cares if luxembours is sanctioned or not . They can not endure to sancture Turkey especially after Russia .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,You are right . He knows how to control masses . I hope we get rid of him asap .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Meh , Erdogan sadly doesnt give a fuck about accessing to EU since he ( and pretty much whole Turkey ) knows that we will never ever be admitted to EU . NEVER !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,We pick the guy who is there . And surely government here wouldnt send a crazy guy to veto stuff this would decrease our prestige . People here can still give one more push for EU if we do get in it will only increase more . If we cant it will drop drastically .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,But why would channel do that ? Greece gov must have a role in it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Well as a Turkish it does look like provocation . Elections are approaching so attempt to steal a bit votes ? \\n\\nAnd just saying , Greece doesnt completely control airspace . There are leaks between those islands . We will probably exercise there and be legal but nonetheless its a stupid provocation .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hmm interesting . Then why did this channel do that ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Thanks ! : ) \\n\\nWe played very well on the first half . We were always ahead of them and there was even 16 points difference between us . We played well as a team , made great defense and forced them to play 1on1 . Gallinari played heroically ( like the only reason why Italy carried on ) but he also acted like an asshole when he moved on on one of our players , luckily referee broke in . It was very exciting in the last few mins and we could have even lost but anyway we deserved it . Also i feel as if italians underestimated us in the beginning . Tonight we will play against Spain and sadly , surely we will lose : (",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,How about the atrocities comitted to us ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Indeed , Erdogan is the uncool one there .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Relatively , to UK .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No respect for those who defend pkk . How would an American feel if a journalist in their country defended Al Qaeda ? She can rot in prison .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Only ? Hahah . Are you kidding yourself ? ? ! Dont you know what the hell happened to Indigenous people ? Yea grass is always greener on the other side . But its so damn terrific that you can even say that . And no you would be just as heavily taxated as you were during Ottomans . As for blood tax , yea but on the other side christians were completely exempt of military . So yea you were giving your first son but at least you could do more and live with them . But with Turks if you had no money , occupation or simply a villager you would have to go to military and die possibly never to come back ... at least not as whole . \\n\\n\ '' Unfortunately\ '' \\n\\nDont worry you killed , displaced most of them . INCLUDING my own grand grandparents .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ok i am leaving you alone,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea yea we came to the top of cycle i guess,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Do you have a book where you have written all these words ? Or are you just randomly making on your mind ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea . Of course ! Lets compare centuries of Turkish rule vs a few decades but very very intense British rule . Look at the map British went and then compare their indigenous population . They killed their language , culture and people . But of course yea ! Everyone hop on the Turkish hate wagon ! ! !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,UN doesnt recognise the name because of Greece . However still i was faulty on my part . Sorry .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea , especially after Russia they can not do anything . They need to gulp it down .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hmm no,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea nothing happened .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"Nope i am from istanbul : ) \\n\\nThat city was once the capital of ottoman empire before 1453 . It has a cultural value , it was stagnant for a long time now its only growing again .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea : /\\nWe should cooperate stop this petty piss fight , we are both weak compared to europe .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Next millennium it is then ! ! ! ^I ^hope,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,He was brainwashed . It is sad that he was killed in such a way . Such a shame .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Greece , obviously .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes . DO NOT GIVE ANY MORE IMMIGRANTS TO TURKEY ! North european countries are way more wealthier than us , they should act like it and take our immigrants .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Things dont work easy like that . Nato has no obligations to interfere .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes couldnt . They sucked manpower from their dominions ( gallipoli-defeated ) \\nThey used Greeks as a tool to dismantle the Ankara government ( failed again ) \\n\\nThe people at home ( England ) didnt want a war either because they had already lost a lot in the WW1 and nobody wanted their sons/husbands to die so far away from home for some gain . Yes , they couldnt hold it and tried every stunt to keep it .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No i havent met a single guy who dislikes armenians and i have met die hard conservatives . One even had a sympathy saying they were last to put rebell against us and stayed loyal for a long time .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Oh USA . Thanks for strengthening my arguement . They got their own independence by fighting against you , a colonial power . But of course it doesnt mean a country will be good if it was untouched by a colonial power .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Wow . Unbelievable ! Your comment is just ... .i am speechless . I dont know if you are aware but you were basically the fire nation of Earth . You destoyed , raped , manipulated everything so you could profit more and you claim to have the higher ground ? And what that world would be a darker place if we were somehow bigger than you . You are unbelievable . Whatever you did , you did it so you could gain more . Ottomans at least had the policy of tolerance . It didnt nudge its subjects personal life as long as they paid their taxes and stayed loyal . And you dare to claim the moral ground by saying we abolished slavery first ? ! Let me tell you : You abolished slavery because you could no longer benefit from it ! Not because \ '' oooh sweeeet human rights\ '' America already had their independence and dominating the trade . You could also no longer benefit from your slave based colonies in africa and they were starting to be more problematic as successfull revolts were taking place in Africs . You just couldnt bother supressing them anymore . It wasnt worth it anymore . There was also a global shift towards anti-slavery . Dont even dare to be seem like the good guy here ! \\n\\nOttomans were using slavery before you and kept using after you abolished but it was never-not even in close ! - the cruelty you have shown to your slaves . Want a proof ? Go check ottoman history . Lets see if you can find slave revolt . And then check your own country\\ 's damn history . If it wasnt for you we would be still prscticing slavery ? How ignorant can you get ? !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ooh yeaa now i see why africa is the most developed continent in the world s./,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Lets live in a country where there is no pride or shame because they havent really done anyhing then . I am going to Liberland .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Its a good thing that British ( for themselves only ) exploited indigenous people as much as possible . Ottoman empire may have abolished the slavery later but in no way it makes worser than UK at that time . Stop whitewashing your country and try to grab the moral high ground . Your whole empire was built on maximizing exploits . I am not blaming you but this was how things were centuries ago . Ottomans did NOT force them to work in as terrible conditions as you did . Those who worked in mines , farms etc were their own people NOT slaves .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,God ! Get your facts straight ! Even with their ultra reproduction . ( Them having between 4 and 10 kids ) You are between 12 and 15 % of the whole population . And there are 2 million kurds in istanbul where most kurds are inhabitated .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,We are only considered in europe if its something bad . If its something good we are brown middle eastern islamist camel fuckers .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Doesnt matter . People hate erdogan , people hate Turkish people . Likewise .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Kurds are between 12-15 % even if add greeks , armenians and assyrians it would only make 16 % max . There should be one official language but that doesnt mean they can not teach or learn their language .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Why does USA have so high rate of agreement ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Maybe one day . Thousands of years later .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"God . That conversation made no sense ! And why were all the museum guards were black ? ! Its hard to find s black guy even in a city as big as Istanbul ! And the way they painted Istanbul , oh my god ... .if they hadnt said Istanbul i would have thought as some random arabic city ! What the hell Naughty dogs ? ! ! Anti-Turkism right there !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,That is why you should take us in the EU . So you wouldnt be the worst in some subjects . This goes to any and all balkan countries : ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Because we are acting like YOUR GATEKEEPER even though we are not a member of your precious union . Unless you dont want your precious cities to be flooded with immigrants you got ta listen us .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Supports praising a dead man ? What ? Whats that ? \\n\\nSupports military coup . u wot m8 ? USA was behind both coups , they do NOT want a coup.\\n\\nSupport oppressing the Kurds . NOPE . Where do you get your information ? www.dailysabah.com or sth ? LMAO",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Stability ? North Korea is pretty stable or saudi arabia . Where nobody expects something else to happen you can live there if you want stability . You need to brake down first to make it better . Yes for the sake of solidarity everyone should compromise something and focus on cleansing shits in Turkey . However MHP is not the worst at all .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes . We were the ones who bought them lol : D\\n\\nWhatever , whatever happened in ottoman empire western powers did it MUCH worser .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hey ! We aint bully ! Its mutual .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Okay ! Searching for a Turk who gives the slightest f*ck ... \\n\\nIslamists ... ... ... 404 Not Found\\n\\nNationalists ... ..404 Not Found\\n\\nLeftists ... ... ... ..404 Not Found,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I dont want them either . I wish we could simply be rid of those areas . Nationalism i guess ... .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Lmao implying western powers had not done faar worser things than this .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Racism ? Against armenians ? What are you even talking about ? And about those \ '' hidden armenians\ '' they are much much smaller than they are made seen . There is literally no reason for them to live their lives as christian armenians .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea \ '' thanks\ '' to our eastern and southeastern population ...,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hdp is not the future of Turkey . A party who supports a terrorist organization can not be the future of any country . Mhp is not racist a d has never said Turkish superiority . They used to be fascist but now they are neutralised . You obviously know nothing but west propaganda .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Wow that would be such a huge loss .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea exactly : ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Lol . What i had in my mind was Uncharted 2 sorry : (,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Well if you only follow greek news . Our jet fighters skydive . This is mutual , not us bullying . Lol",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I am surprised by my own country as well . I was expecting something bad but turns out we take science above faith ! Wow ? ! ! Really ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Because we didnt assimilate and forced our language and culture to the people . We did favor them converting to islam but in no way forced that or destructed their culture to be replaced by ours . Whatever happened , happened passively as a result of hundread years of living together . When you force your culture to people of course they will be with you because they have forgotten their past and they only feel connected to you because you destroyed all links connected to their own culture/heritage . They didnt peacefully wanted to join your commonwealth its because they had no other option . If ottomans had done the same then the Turkey as we know would have been MUCH bigger and MUCH stronger . But we get all the shit .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Noooo . How could we not ? We dont even have deserts , we are horrible bad , bad kebabs .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No i am not . Of course we cant pin all of them to British empire . That would be ridiculous . \\n\\nHowever pick any colonial power and they were used far worser than how ottomans used them . People would go and buy slaves from slave markets and use them as housemaidens or even marry them . Yes marrying a slave not raping her . It would also make them free of course . They werent brutally used like any colonial power . They didnt had their handcuffed and worked in the fields day & amp ; night for just enough food to survive . It was the individuals who bought slaves not big corporations or governments .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Gibraltar should be a part of spain ...,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,See ? Same mindset . You dont want us . You wanted to wipe them all in the past and so the same now . Well Turks WILL stay there .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Forcing your language and your culture is one of the things colonial powers did . Look at N. Africa and middle east Ottos ruled those lands for centuries and Turkish language and culture is very low whereas brits ruled for a few decades and they ASSIMILATED people to their likings . This is how .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . I guess you have no idea how western powers exploited indigenous people .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Then you are very wrong . Your kid could live a much better life with ottomans than staying at home . Whereas in western you , your wife , your children were all a property of your colonial power and they were free to use/abuse you however they wanted . Yes better indeed .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,This is not an excuse for your thievery . I wouldnt expect anything less from the United Kingdom though . Your whole empire was built on the tears of the non-British people . This would be one the least bad UK did in her history . Before you start whataboutism Ottos never exploited people like you did .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Colonials ? God i am so sick of this . People migrate over time ! Noone called anglo-saxons colonial did they ? THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR CENTURIES IT WAS THEIR HOME NOW ! Turks challenge the word genocide . We completely accept massacres . Many people deny that greeks burned izmir . There you go ! An example !,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Well all muricans are conquerers and natives are pretty much all dead . Lets kick you out back to europe then . Hypocrite .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea and this was what i meant .

We would never want to be associated with that level of muslimness .,Turkic,Turkish

It was not a given that one more push by the fleet would have resulted in passage to Marmara Sea.\\n\\nHow could an ambassador know that the main mines werent even used and that the ottoman defenses were still up and ready ?

Dracaras,europe,It is alright to be worried if gbr could break through the defenses as you are facing the greatest naval force of that time . But i just quoted that main minefields were not even used and many well protected defenses were not even used yet . If brits had kept attacking use their naval force it would probably end up like that you underestime the capability of ottoman defense force and that the terrain itself is very much suitable for a defense . If it was that easy as you had said the naval commander would have kept attacking but he knew that defenses had to be removed via land assault first .,Turkic,Turkish

We dont want them too if they dont want us , we can always be allied with eastern countries anyway ! ( china , russia , india ... ) \ '' \\n\\nHowever I understand they dont want us . Population .

Dracaras,europe,Yes to get into our national embassy a party has to pass 10 % threshold . If they dont all their votes are discarded and their seats are distributed among those who passed 10 % .

Dracaras,europe,"Yes I can feel how armenians feel . Our loss was cut from them i guess . After that huge set of losses , ottoman was getting paranoid about losing any more lands .

When you took smyrna ( except some nationalists ) people were happy that the suffering was over and they thought they could live peacefully from now on . But then your army stupidly started killing and raping us which made population uneasy and hostile towards you and then brits decided to use you as a lapdog and attacked ankara with warcry \ '' to the angora\ '' with more loots , pilages in villages along the way . In the end you lost everything whereas you could have taken eastern thrace ( sorry western powers would have never give you constantinopolis ) and even smyrna if you had patiently waited and being friendlier to the locals . Well thank him i guess : D anyway we should leave these behind and cooperate in the future since both of our countries are pretty much weak and crippled.\\n\\nOh and yes you had a good navy which was one of the reasons we lost balkan wars because reinforcements couldnt pass from smyrna to the balkans because you blockaded ports : & lt ;",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"And what were they all happy before invasion ? Turkish cypriots were being butchered by EOKA-B and those people were trying to run away from the island . To Britain , Austria .

Dracaras,europe,"What do you mean its not as bad as you did to armenians ? ! 6 MILLION PEOPLE DIED throughout the entire empire mostly in balkans and especially by bulgarians in balkans . Whereas 1-1.5 million armenians died . Does the life of an armenian worth more than a Turk ? \\n\\nDude we came into Anatolia 1079 . Its gon na be like a thousand years soon ! And fyi we are far more indigenous than Turkic . Only 13 % of our genes are Turkic . While the rest is caucassian , middle eastern and european . \\n\\nAnd what we are responsible for ending the \ '' legendary\ '' byzantine ? You are hilarious ! It was fucking WAR ! How the hell can we be responsible for ending a nation ? Nations rise and die in history . Deal with it ! This is like a joke , this guy is blaming us for conquering lands ! Do you blame alexander the great for conquering all the way to India ? No you dont because he is greek , but oh hell we are devils for conquering the legendary capital . How nice for you ! \\n\\nYea this is your problem europeans ! You still blame us for conquering your lands at the past . How hilarious and funny ! You still can not accept us for winning our war of independence and would gladly kick us back to central asia if you could . \\n\\nAnd fy there will be NO , COMPLETELY NO saints if we are to judge people by their past !

Dracaras,europe,Not a muslim but Islam embraces and accepts Jesus as a true prophet . Not even extremists would say bad things about him .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Because we are talking about NKR and that massacre happened in NKR . Others are irrelevant in this case . Do you really think NKR can live like that ? They have to join to a country . De facto states can not go on forever . Look at North Cyprus , their people want to unite after everything happened between them .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . There will be times has changed . Both sides wouldnt resort to ethnical cleansing . Only thing azerbaijan would do is to send back khokaly massacre survivors .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,There is literally no azerbaijani left in Armenia and no armenian left in Azerbaijan ( except NKR ) . So there can be no \ '' threats\ '' NKR can not live on its own . It has to become a part of AZ in the future no matter what .,Turkic,Turkish

I am not racist , i just wanted to point out that those brown people are pakistani origin . \\n\\nWell about ethnic identity , we call ourselves turkish but we are more than anything but turkish . We mixed up with the indigenous people . Only 13 % of our genes are Turkic . Rest are caucassian , middle east and european . The most obvious way to understand that the actual Turkic people have slanting eyes while we have round eyes . You can google yakutistan , yakut Turks in Russia . Probably one of the most preserved Turks . Half of them even still practice tengriism ( which is awesome ) and the other half atheist .

Dracaras,europe,Wait . We arent the worst in balkans ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Even though Erdogan controlled pretty much everything even his power was not enough to completely dominate the highest court on Turkey ( Court of Constitution ) because of some pesky democratic laws we have . Thats why he was calling for a new constitution to assert total dominance but he needed 400 out of 550 mps in the grand assembly but he even failed to make the majority in the recent elections by taking only 258 mps .

Dracaras,europe,"They did . They also claimed responsibility for fake calling police and then murdering one of them and then heavily injuring the other . But of course you wouldnt know and even if you did you woulndt accept because you are a typical westerner who sees Turks as evil oppressor and pkk freedom fighter , pro lgbt , secularist , pro sunshine and rainbows fairies .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Oh lmao.\\n\\nEdit : would you be convinced if i sent you my body pic to make you see the colour of my skin ? Nope you would stil call it brown . I know colors and i am certainly \ '' white\ '' not that it makes things different . It just disgusts how westerners try to push us away by calling us brown-like arabs .

Am i right /u/tubeyouer ?,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Ok. Got it . Thats true,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Drop that unrelated armenian topic . \\n\\nKurds were oppressed nobody denies that . But terrorist attacks can not be justified . A few years ago two soldiers who were doing their mandatory conscription was out dressed as a civilian going to buy something . They were both young . One of them had his wife pregnant waiting for a child . Some bastard follows them from barracks and executes both of them by contacting his pistol to their neck and firing at the middle of a street . What is this now ? ? ? Are you happy ? Because some kurds actually celebrated this . Nothing wrong with defending your rights and being nationalistic but this ... terrorism , faschism ? NO !

Dracaras,europe,"True . Turkey was a refugee state . But those times are past now .

Dracaras,europe,"Yea . I am sure it does . I mean not in camps under control of government but there are 2M syrians . Those on the streets the muslim ones wouldnt pity christians and use them for their own gains . Stupid religions , all of them are useless .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Do you realise that we have 2 MILLION DAMN SYRIANS ? ? ! ! FAAAAR MORE than your \ '' pinky good\ '' countries . Yet eu does nothing other than saying \ '' yeah well good for you\ '' Turkish soldiers WILL stay in Turkish soil we have no business in that war . Do you think there is an end to that ?

Dracaras,europe,Ooh right sorry . It was a deal between europe and turkey where we could make them stay and in return they would give our citizens visa . It is NOT about EU . Nobody here wants your precious EU anymore .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Well Turkic tribes did not contribute much to our gene pool only changed its culture . So we are the sons and daughters of the people who lived here since forever . Also we took in a lot of muslim refugees from balkans , caucassia and middle east which all became turkified in decades . We are genetically close to greeks and armenians .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,And what you think executing random innocent people is justifiable in a time where they are not even oppressed anymore ? \\n\\nTurkish intervention of Cyprus was a result of Greek Cypriots being killed by Greek Cypriots . Yet noone ever accepted this intervention .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,So its not freedom of speech if he doesnt agree with you ? Where will you draw the line ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea , of course you would . Why are we trying to be friendly against a bunch off assholes who wish seljuks disappeared before they made to europe ? Screw EU . They are alienating us . We must seek closer relations with Russia and abandon EU",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I dont agree with you most of the time but at least you are solid guy when it comes to Ataturk . I think he was even too kind to idiots . He shouldnt have just get rid of them he should have also killed his children and relatives . Pea doesnt drop far away from the tree .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Oh yea i have forgotten we are not even european lol .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yeaa too cold . Even though it barely snows where i live so i like snow but i know it will be overwhelming in canada , still a great country . And french is mainly in quebec afaik . Toronto is a better alternative for living .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,He didnt but the hate is there nonetheless because he was Turkish .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Nobody would call them turkish city if it existed 5K years ago as well as not greek/armenian/assyriam/syrian/bulgarian/georgian/russian bla bla bla ... \\nBut just so you know modern day Turkish citizens are far more indigenous than Turkic .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Why ? Us and Canada are pretty good .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,So . Turkish news are okay but the news of the kurdish people who live in Turkey are not ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,You are right . The reason is some islamist thinkers influenced that area a lot throughout history such as Mevlana . Now i would be okay if they minded their own business but they do not . Assholes\\n\\nRemove Konya . Konya of worst kebab .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . It was ethnic cleansing .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"And what do you think the people at Ottoman Empire knew what was going on let alone approve it ? \\n\\nOE was ruled with 3 pasha regime . They wanted to relocate them not to kill them . OE was a hell at that time . Murders , wars happening everywhere in the country . How did you expect them to protect them where they couldnt even protrct their own country .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Do you think Ottoman Empire was stable at that time ? Deaths were the most normal thing that could happen .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"And what are you claiming that greek cypriots stay put and did nothing and evil Turkey invaded an island which USA did NOT approve ? Are you denying bloody sunday , EOKA , einosis and UN desperately trying to protect Turkish citizens but failing ? Whatever our intentions were doesnt matter we had a reason and it was greek cypriots . \\n\\nEurope would find Turkey guilty anytime they want but they wouldnt do shit if we were the the victim .

Dracaras,europe,Are you fucking kidding me ? Do you really think Nazi action and our intervention was same ?

Dracaras,europe,"Turkey can not turn more islamic than Iran . Our westernization started long ago before we were founded . Military backs Ataturk\\ 's values so they wouldnt let that happen .

Even their muslims are not hardcore . \\n\\nCities names change through time . Should we all go back and use the old names of cities ? Especially for america ?

Dracaras,europe,Turkey is not deep down very muslim . West Turkey is pretty secular . Most if not all my friends wear in european style dress and nobody is having a problem with it .

Dracaras,europe,Yea . So ? Just because they have access to black sea doesnt increase their signiriance .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,It is all about armenians nobody knows this where more Turks were killed than armenians any many more forced to run leaving their everything behind.\\nhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ottoman_Muslims\\n\\nPlus massacres were conducted by local kurdish beys mostly .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Yea but still we should take pride of how successful they were ( at some time ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ataturk did everything to remove ottoman influence from people . He didnt want any ties with the people and the empire .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Istanbul had and still has many secular people but they are outnumbered by those who arent . Yea conservativeness increase from west to east .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"I am a bit nationalistic and everyone should be . I am faithless and i literally hate islam . It is one of the main reasons why we are sooo fucked up.\\n\\nWoah i am impressed .

On behalf of Ottoman empire ( or its successor state Turkey ) cleansing of armenians and assyrians were horribly wrong and i apologize it . \\n\\nThere . See ?

Dracaras,europe,Can you give examples of this \ '' human rights abuse\ '' or this another screw Turkic countries thing ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Ahahaha . Ottomans ? Imperialism ? Colonialism ? Britain of balkans ? Aaaha maan you are flattering me . Whole balkans have a culture on their own only difference is that they also mixed with the turkish culture . And we have bits of armenian and greek cultures as well . Whats the point ? Cultures mix by the time.\\n\\nYes ottomans stayed technologically inferior and this made them weaker and made easier for you to rebel . So you should be happy ? \\n\\n\ '' Poor misunderstood imperialists just wanted to civilise the barbarious Balkans with their unrich history and unvibrant culture.\ '' \\n\\nLol i have not said anything like that .

Dracaras,europe,"Mostly hard . Very hard on eastern cities . They can not marry , afaik they can not adopt too i could be wrong though . It all depends on people . Some people and families are completely cool about it , most are idiotic .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,It is erdogan who set us backwards .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Turkish people are different in many areas . West/central anatolian/black sea/east/southeast/ all are different . West Turks are pretty much like Turkish cypriots .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What the ducking duck ? Did they poll this in southeast Turkey ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea obviously secular Turks are different in regions as well . Pretty sure Cypriot culture also affected and changed those cypriots in a way and maybe even greeks changed by somehow . \\n\\nYea they are conservatives in west unfortunately but they are mostly immigrants from the lesser developed regions of turkey ( particularly east and southeast ) I was talking about those who were really native to their region .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ooh here is a proud murican .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I havent seen a single headline about kurds involment in the genocide nor heard anyone speaking about kurds involment in massacres .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Stop misleading .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Its a mixed bag . Those who have coast to aegean and mediterranean are developed and secular turks used to be majority . Why \ '' used\ '' ? Because those cities were literally bombarded by the people from east ( conservative ) and southeast ( conservative , tribalistic kurds mostly ) and whats worse is instead of integrating to the western society those people build up their own little communities and screw up everything ! They refuse everything we stand for . And whats even worser ? Your average western couple would make 1 or 2 children whereas a guy from east would make 3-4 and another one from southeast would make up to 10 damn children ! ! ! Wtf ? ? ! How are you going to raise those kids ? You wont , thats the answer . Crazy assholes ... \\n\\nAnd this is how cities fell one by one . Mediterranean is pretty much lost except Antalya which is a very tentative balance between two sides . And 2 other Adana and Hatay who are still can be salvaged but sad defeats.\\n\\nIn the aegean Izmir ( and a few other cities ) shines like a beacon of light with secularists outnumbering religious conservatives by a great margin . \\n\\nIstanbul ( despite having a great deal of good people ) with its 14 damn millions of population eastern migrants vastly outnumber than those who are not . \\n\\nYea i made that a bit overly depressive and they are not \ '' that\ '' evil : P but you got the point .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Aaah ! This is true . Not \ '' most\ '' since there was already secular people there . But some of the balkan muhacirs made it here and they were secular mostly . But i was talking about internal immigration from east to west .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Thank you ! Wish more people had actually seen us instead of living with stupid prejudices .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Believe it or not . It was better to be at ottoman than some western europe nation . YOU GET TO LIVE ! What else can be said ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes i do not find it right that we are sending settlers . It is an ill thought . But Cyprus refused the annal plan whereas Turkish Cypriots agreed so you cant really blame us for not being cooperative . Turkey should withdraw its force or at least negotiate with Cyprus so that a few bases stay and the rest goes , since every power has force in that island such as uk , nato , russia ...",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Thats a good thing , we both need good relations .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Oh please ottomans funded all over balkans . The mostar bridge in Bosnia is an example .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Wish the ridiculuous \ '' big 5\ '' rule could be removed .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Did you know most albanian and bosnian parents willingly gave their kids to ottomans even after they have converted to islam ( which they dont have any obligations anymore ) because those kids would take the best education possible in ottomans and they could rise to be a greeat statesman or a military commander .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Okay . Sure . Give back our Turks and take our Syrians . I am all in for this solution ! WIN-WIN !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I am not shifting it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yes . Yes.\\n\\nYou can find lots and lots of examples of this ; ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hmm interesting . Moldova looked like landlocked and stuck between ukraine and romania also . Arent you a mod ? Why is your name peasant blue like us rather than flashy green ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Agreed . Right now the Turkey which matters is the western Turkey . Seriously n-o-b-o-d-y cares about the eastern turkey . Wish this nightmare had never happened and i dont care about losing our eastern territory , this would even solve our Kurdish problem .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,They did hate -and still do- because religion . Religion is still an important factor but it was extremely important back then . For example catholics were under protection of ottomans because they were minority compared to orthodox churches and they choose muslims rather than orthodoxs .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"people burned this is the major point , minor killings by irregulars are irrelevant .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea eastern Turkey gets incredibly lot of snow in winter .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Well Kurds were minority in that region they wanted to be dominant and they were so willing about killing massacres they jumped to it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"No greeks in izmir who hasnt fled the city yet ignited the fire and the wind contributed to burn the city . Most of the city was left in ashes , a big damage to already weak Turkey .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea ! Istanbul , it can get cold and wet but little snow : (",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,But persecutions mainly happened before the genocide and nobody will even think of doing anything about them since they completely hate us .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea we are literally worse than hitler . World will be a better place if we all die right now .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"See ? Why would we burn a valuable port city ? Your army followed a scorched earth policy and burned wherever they spotted during your retreat . Izmir was just one of them . Use your logic ffs . We should be the one hating you for damaging us soo much but we dont . \\n\\nArmenians do they are crazy about Turkey . They want property ( as if it was possible ) money , land whatever .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Ooh . Got it . I thought it was simply a landlocked country which borders only other 2 countries . Ok that makes a lot more sense.\\n\\nGrrrr you have shown your true face , i knew you were a mod ! Kill him ! Kill him with fireeeee ! ! !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Most of the people still hold us responsible for the great fire of smyrna and we dont ask reperations for what happened in balkans . My wealthy great grandfather fled from bulgaria to save his own life i dont sue or hate bulgarians now or ask them to give me money or property .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Whats that ? No sane guy would say that ? Our cunterdogan pulled a stunt to get attention and made it and he said muslims not turks . He doesnt care about Turks all he cares is muslims,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea . It is interesting how climate is so much different in not so big country . To the west Izmir literally never sees snow while to the east snow blocks your entrance to the house . What was your business there ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . We are fed up with your refugees . You will take care of them from now on .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Nobody destroyed your culture its still there . Ottoman empire did horrible things but they were were good to the minorities COMPARED to their time . You cant just simply think with your 21st century logic . British and french were massacre-ing because they were in opposing sects of the same religion whereas you could peacefully live in ottoman empire and do WHATEVER you wanted to as long as you pay your tax .

Dracaras,europe,No no i am not saying that its great i am saying that it was great compared to other empires at that time .

Do you think that the majority of people that voted for him still support him ? \\n\\nAKP\\ 's propaganda tools can change every negative thing into a positive thing . Those arrests actually increased Erdo\u011fan\\ 's support . Coup especially skyrocketed AKP support thanks to rhetorics such as \ '' we are the defenders of democracy against evil coupists\ '' and \ '' foreign countries fund , arm and shelter terrorists to hurt Turkey\ '' and \ '' everyone wants to destroy Turkey\ '' If people feel threatened because of external threats , they vote for AKP . This is why AKP is barking at Greece these days . Only retarded neckbeards jerking at WWIII scenarios would believe AKP actually intends to invade Greece.\\n\\n & gt ; Election fraud is something that has already happened or something that you afraid it will happen in the future ? \\n\\nIt\\ 's something that has already happened . Ankara voted for CHP during regional elections , but AKP took it anyway after recounting . They just do re-elections or recountings if they don\\'t like the result . Electric blackout throughout the country during election , dead people voting , boxes and boxes of votes being found in places and other similar suspicious things or outright blatant fraud is common.\\n\\nI have no doubt something fishy will happen during the referendum .",Turkic,Turkish

Yes voters say \ '' because I\\ 'm against PKK/HDP/FET\u00d6/DHKP-C/Foreign powers.\ '' or \ '' because of No voters\ '' or \ '' because of strong turkey\ '' or \ '' because I want better economy\ ''",Turkic,Turkish

Elatra,europe,"Letting PKK secede would be regarded as a political and military defeat , meaning any politician who doesn\\'t want to suicide their career wouldn\\'t talk of it .

Both sides are too much invested in this conflict with decades of emotional baggage so nobody is going to compromise . Hatred and desire of vengeance fuel this conflict.\\n\\nI\\ 'd say if PKK is destroyed there would be more hope for a diplomatic solution to Southeast but we are way past that . Last ceasefire and diplomatic process was more like a breather period for PKK to recruit and get more supplies for the inevitable continuation of the conflict . It\\ 's all-in or nothing at this stage . Hell , if we were living in an ideal world I\\ 'd want Aegean coast of Turkey to be independent and move there so Islamist authoritarians can fuck up their lands without dragging the more open-minded and secularist Turks with them.\\n\\nWhat Erdo\u011fan needs to do is make sure Southeastern region has better infrastructure and education , but it\\ 's not gon na happen because both PKK and Erdo\u011fan has an interest in keeping the region uneducated and poor . PKK gets more recruits this way and the conflict bolsters nationalist sentiments which means more votes for Erdo\u011fan . Educated , free , safe and happy people who are hopeful of the future don\\'t make good militants . It\\ 's easier to radicalize the ignorant , this goes both for Turks and Kurds.\\n\\nBesides , PKK makes up a minority of Kurds .
