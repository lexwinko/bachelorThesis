Upgrading anything software wise on the trading units was always a process that took few months .

Therefore , a thousand hours of video of a man dressed as a cat running in circles around the Eiffel tower that cost 15 $ to make fulfill that demand the same as a multi-million euro production . Because creating such a terrible \ '' movie\ '' fulfills the criteria for the least amount of cost , it is the path of least resistance , which Netflix will take.\\n\\nIt protects local content from competing with international content in runtime .

Aliencreature1,europe,"I am not talking about living like a billionaire or something . But relatively small dividends could afford everyone a basic level of living *without being dependent on the government* . One has to look no further than Greece to see what happens when a large segment of the population is an economic vassal of the state : the system will inevitably be abused by politicians promising higher and higher handouts , bankrupting it and leading to effects far worse than letting the market take its course.\\n\\nThe tax refund is gained through cutting public spending during a transitional period . Those people who are going to be affected by automation the most are also the ones who pay the least taxes as a proportion of total tax revenue ( I recall seeing that the top 10 % of earners in the US payed ~75 % of taxes , but I can\\'t be sure about the precise figures until I find the article ) , and so their contribution to public revenue is not as significant . By offering full tax refunds for investment , everybody wins . The workers are \\'future-proofed\\ ' against automation , since the gains from it are passed down to them , the government can save on social security , and the industry flourishes because of the resulting *incentive to invest* . For the worker , the act of acquiring stock becomes \ '' free\ '' , since he would have lost that money anyway.\\n\\nAnother tool is to privatize public services - don\\'t scroll down yet , because I don\\'t mean it in the way that most people mean it . Lets take for example the Greek Public Power Corporation . It could be broken into smaller corporations , privatized and split into shares that would be equally distributed amongst the population . Those shares can be freely traded or kept . The estimates I have seen on the value of its assets are at around ~15 billion Euros , and that\\ 's just one service . If you combine it with the tax returns for investments , you could easily get most of the population in the game of investing instead of working , and they don\\'t even have to manage the assets yourself - just hire someone to do it ! It could easily replace basic income with some tweaking , and everyone is satisfied . Well , except the Marxists , but who the fuck cares about those lunatics anyway.\\n\\nThe economy of the future shouldn\\'t be about \ '' how many hours you work\ '' , but \ '' how many robots you own\ '' ( as roughly as I can put it ) . Start giving people incentives to invest in automation now , and you secure their future while also removing their dependence on the government .",Greek,Greek

I took the decision to write this , because I want to share some stories and \ '' get them out of my chest\ '' , and also because out of curiosity I wander if similar phenomena exist in other countries of our continent , and hear some input from others . So without further ado , let\\ 's start.\\n\\nOK so one thing has to do with the relations of employers and employees . They\\ 've become worse . There are two reasons for that . One is the high unemployment rate which makes it easier than ever for an employer to fire someone and get someone else , and the second is the structural changes that according to Troika will make the market more competitive . So many bosses now take the role of the \\'boss\\ ' quite further than they should , accompanied with a feeling of smug superiority . The less bad thing is that bosses now ask you to do all kinds of chores . Like for example say you are hired as a front-end web developer , and the employer asks you to go buy him coffee , take his dog for a walk etc ... And of course you will spend more time at work , without getting paid for it . At worst , employers keep postponing pay you FOR MONTHS . Sometimes after some months of not paying , they fire you and they never pay you for all the work you\\ 've done . There are some cases in which people demanded to get paid for the months they worked got attacked and injured . Perhaps you might have heard about the story from 4 years ago when at a strawberry field the boss started shooting at Bangladeshi workers that were never paid and demanded their salaries : https : //www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/bangladeshi-strawberry-pickers-shot-at-by-greek-farmers-win-european-rights-case\\nBut this is just one case that got popular because of its size and the fact the attacked were Bangladeshis . There are more incidents of attacks , that don\\'t get to international news . Like for example recently a Greek woman was attacked with punches and kicks by her ex-boss for demanding the salary for her work , but this news story was \\'disappeared\\ ' . Of course quite usually people who do work and are getting paid are harassed daily by their bosses with name calling and what not , and workers swallow their pride and accept it because they are afraid of losing their jobs and not finding another one after . A job has become something rare , and if you are lucky to find one you are expected to do whatever you are told , even things not related to your profession , and being harassed , and feel lucky about it because you have a job while others don\\'t . \\n\\nAnother phenomenon is the rise of fringe political groups , and political extremism . Politicians that were once thought to be clowns now have got into the parliament . Neonazis have become the 3rd strongest party in the parliament . A bunch of neonazis murdered a man some years ago , a group of anarchists walked into the offices of some business and broke machinery in it like computers etc with hammers , recording it all with a cell phone and uploading it to Youtube ... https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6MByeh3soKU\\nThese are just hand-picked incidents , there are more like these.\\n\\nA third phenomenon is people believing easier than ever in conspiracy theorist charlatans . We are perhaps the only country in the world where an elected parliamentarian asked the government if it secretly \\'sprays\\ ' people with a chemical , following the popular \ '' chemtrails\ '' conspiracy theory . Aside from that , a few years ago a man appeared on TV saying he had 3 trillion euros ( ! ) , and that he would give 600 billions from his wealth to end Greece\\ 's debt . When asked where he found all that money , he said that the \\'gods\\ ' of ancient Greeks were aliens , and that he discovered an abandoned spaceship of them , and that he sold the technology of that aircraft . He promised that not only he would pay Greece\\ 's public debt , but also that he would give each Greek 25.000 euros once he becomes the ruler of Greece . Because of course he wanted to rule Greece as a return for his favor ... And people believed him . And they went to find him , and he convinced them that he can only use the money after he becomes the prime minister . And asked people to pay so he can start a political party . And some people paid , and hundreds of offices of his new party popped up at cities and towns all over the country . Eventually one of his organization\\ 's members ( who are all nutjobs ) murdered another thinking that the other member was plotting to steal his place in this organization of nutjobs . And the organization was banned only because of that . http : //www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2017/03/17/artemis-sorras-the-man-to-buy-greeces-debt-with-600bn-sentenced-for-embezzlement/ \\n\\nAnother thing , is religious people acting more than ever . In the last years we saw a muslim trying to convert people through Youtube https : //www.youtube.com/user/GreekMuslimEldin , the same thing done by a Jew https : //www.youtube.com/user/JewishIdea77 ( these two often speak about one another in a bad fashion as they see each other as competitors ) . We also have lately some Christian dude believing that the antichrist is here , and he attacks ATMs saying credit cards are the mark of the antichrist , he breaks cell phones because these are Satan\\ 's too , and does other similar stuff : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zALLL-azSOM and of course there are people marching through the streets with a statue of Dionysus and beating drums : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=q8uARn0do4I\\n\\nHere is another phenomenon : Lots of Greeks now open their businesses on other countries like Cyprus , Bulgaria , or Malta . And although the headquarters are there , they live and practice their professions in Greece . They do it so they can be taxed in these other countries because tax rates there are shorter . Globalization allows them to do it , and it\\ 's an argument against austerity , as if the taxes are too high on one country , businesses just move to another one now that it\\ 's easy . This way the Greek government collects even less taxes because the number of businesses is reduced.\\n\\nAnd there are more ... I got tired up a bit writing all this for now . Perhaps I might edit this post to add more later . Tell me your opinions about these . Do you have similar phenomena in your countries ? If so , for how long , and do you think that there is something in particular that leads to them ?",Greek,Greek

But then the time he is allowed to stay as president was coming to an end too , so he changed the constitution again with the recent referendum , so he can become the prime minister yet again , for infinity.\\n\\nHe\\ 's been the leader of Turkey for 15 years already , and if things keep going that way , he will remain for perhaps another 15 years , or even more . He just makes up laws and changes the constitution any time he wants , so he can forever stay in power without practically becoming a \ '' dictator\ '' .

Which supports my point .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,europe,"That made me curious . Because it seems that the names of the colors mean only the colors at these languages.\\n\\nAt Greek , at least ancient Greek and not the bastardization that Greeks speak today , most if not all names of colors had names related to stuff that had these colors.\\n\\nFor example the word for black \ '' \u039c\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\ '' ( Melan ) is related to \\'melani\\ ' , the squidd\\ 's ink .

Alithinos,europe,"No , no , no.\\nThe reason that there are attacks by muslim people in some European countries has nothing to do with the existence of not of an Ottoman Empire.\\n\\nIt has to do with European countries putting their noses where they doesn\\'t belong , try to control certain \\'muslim\\ ' countries , and bombing many of them.\\n\\nOf all the countries of Europe , those that were hit were countries that in the recent past took part in bombing some muslim country , be it Libya , Syria , or Iraq . The European countries that didn\\'t took part in such activities had no such attacks , and I guess they won\\'t have in the future either.\\n\\nAs for the question if it was a good thing that the Ottoman Empire ended or not , ask the Armenians , the Greeks , the Assyrians , Slavs , Bulgarians , Albanians , and the rest minorities that lived in it . Each one will have Holocaust-like gruesome stories to share . Northern Europe is lucky enough to have had a Nazi like empire ruling it for just 5 years . Others weren\\'t so lucky , and had similar kind of occupation for much much more.\\n\\nSo this article is rubbish to me . Its like saying \ '' Oh there are neonazis causing trouble here and there , perhaps if we had accepted Nazi Germany to rule us it would be better because there wouldn\\'t be neonazis now\ '' .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,europe,"Ilias Kasidiaris , a member of the parliamet of Greece of the nationalist Golden Dawn party , teared up the papers which described the new deal of Greece\\ 's government with the Eurozone.\\n\\n\\nhttps : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=urpfCfp02MQ\\n ( tearing up occurs in 3:30 of this video ) \\n\\nHere is his speech : \\n\\n\ '' For many months now , since Tsipras became a usual goer to all the international forums of the international loan sharks , and the foreign plutocracy , from Texas to the London School of Economics , Golden Dawn had said that this human had took the job of destroying Greece , and today we are absolutely justified . Because in just a week they ( SYRIZA ) come here to pass two seperate anti-national legislations . The third , unwanted , antihellenic bailout , and the illegal immigrant legislation which legalizes the illegal immigrants , and will turn Greeks to a minority in their own country . The antihellenist Schultz , this shameful trash of the Europarliament , also verified to us . He said that Tsipras is the only one who can make the third bailout happen . He is the man for the special operations of international usury , his the man that will destroy Greece , through the unwanted bailout , through its economic destruction , and through illegal immigration which will make us the minority in Greece . You lied before the elections , you lied for 6 whole months , you sold us a big fairy tale , a theater act , with the supposed negotiations , which were a few small trips ... A few small trips in which you vacated in Brussels and Strasburg , and had fun being photographed for Marie Claire , and other lifestyle magazines , you promoted yourselves , and you come here today to say that you absolutely accept the sellout of Greece . Having already destroyed the market , thousands of our co-citizens have lost their jobs in just a few months , and most importantly , after a resounding NO , a NO that expresses the vast majority of Greeks , a NO that constitutes illegal any decision of the parliament for the acceptance of the memoranda dictatorship , the international loan sharks . Minister Tsakalotos talked a while ago for the \\'rich\\ ' . \ '' We will hit the rich\ '' he said , who are the rich ? Isn\\'t he himself rich ? Having more than 800.000 euros deposited in offshore banks ? Minister Stathakis ? With more than 800.000 euros deposited ? Papadimoulis ? With more than 1.300.000 in deposits and 28 houses in total all over the world ? Who are the \\'rich\\ ' you are going to hit ? When you don\\'t even dare to touch the benefits of the parliamentarians . We gave a battle , during the second bailout when we revealed to the public about the benefits parliamentarians received , and New Democracy was lying . And you today crush the farmers with these new measures , you crush the freelancers , and you don\\'t even dare to touch the wages , and benefits of the parliamentarians . You gave us a paper not even worthy for us to spit on it , a shameful paper written in English , which refers to a fund of 50 billion euros , that will be bidding the public assets . Where do these 50 billion euros come from ? What are you going to sell , SYRIZA\\ 's offices that are on Koumoundourou street ? The fifty billions are our oil , the natural gas , the natural wealth of Greece that Germans want to take from us . But they won\\'t take ANYTHING from Greece , and these shameful , odious memoranda that the Greek people refused , will send you and your policy to the trash bin of Greek history . The parliamentarians of SYRIZA are right to be afraid that Golden Dawn will become a giant through all this , through all this 180 degree turn , through your bailout policy , we will grow like a giant , because now only Golden Dawn expresses the honorable NO of the Greeks , the National Resistance of Greeks , the National Sovereignty of the Greeks , the Greece that belongs to the Greeks.\ '' \\n",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,europe,"Excuse me but I haven\\'t travelled much to different countries , so I will only write some facts I think interesting about my own , Greece.\\n\\n\\nIn Greece there is a legal term , that is also written on the ID cards , which translates to \\'indigeneity\\ ' . ( that\\ 's different from citizenship ) For a person to have full rights and be considered Greek , it has to have Greek indigeneity , and to have that , it has to have at least 1 Greek parent.\\n\\n\\nThere is a considerable amount of Greek people who relate themselves more to the Roman Byzantine Empire than Ancient Greece , and they feel that the capital of their nation ( Constantinupolis / Istanbul ) is still \ '' under foreign occupation\ '' .\\n\\n\\nAlthough most Greeks will tell you that they are Christian Orthodox , a large amount of them doesn\\'t really believe in any God , and name-call Jesus and Saint Mary every day . They still baptise their children and marry in churches , but they do it for tradition\\ 's shake.\\n\\n\\nThe reason the Euzonoi ( presidential guards ) wear skirts , is because pants at other countries started becoming mainstream as a horse rider\\ 's clothe , and social sexism didn\\'t allow women to ride horses , so pants got associated with manliness . But when in the rest of the world this was happening , Greeks were isolated living in the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\n\\nGreece sits right at the point where the African , and European tectonic plates meet , and because of that it has the highest earthquake frequency in Europe.\\n\\n\\nLast time Greece made in invasion was in the 3rd century B.C. , the one Alexander started.\\n\\n\\nWhile the large majority of modern Greece\\ 's population has mixed features , and mostly Roman / Etruscan , there is a very short amount of population ( a few thousands perhaps ) that have all the bodily shapes and features that can be seen on ancient Greek statues . ( \\'Greek nose\\ ' , curly hair , \\'Greek feet\\ ' , etc ) \\n\\n\\nEvery mountain , every lake , and every cave in Greece , has its own legend or myth . Some God or Fairy , or other being will be somehow related to any place.\\n\\n\\nIn the WW2 , Italy which was an ally to Germany , send a letter to Greece , asking its submission and co-operation , to allow Axis forces to pass through it , to get to Palestine / Israel , to attack the British forces that were stationed there . Greece replied with only a single word , \ '' No\ '' . This day is comemorated in Greece every year , and it is known as the \ '' No Day\ '' .\\n\\n\\nIn 1996 there was a dispute between Greece and Turkey , about the belonging of an island known as Imia to Greeks , and Kardak to Turks . When some Turkish journalists went on the island and removed the Greek flag that was there , the Greek minister of defense said to the medias that were asking about it that \ '' The air took the flag away\ '' , to calm the tensions of Greek people .

Logic is related to Logos , the same way politics are related to polis . So logic isn\\'t a thing of its own self , but something that is immidately related to Logos , and couldn\\'t exist without Logos . Logos is the \\'mother\\ ' of logic , reason , and words , as the process of thinking involves words , as we think in our language .

The term \\'nation\\ ' as we mostly use it , means a total of people who feel like they have something binding them together that differentiates them from other people . So someone can belong in the American nation and be a Muslim , or have a 100 % African ancestry , if they feel Americans . But Ethnos is reffering to a total of people that have the same ancestry , language , religion , ways , customes , and worldview . Those people who have all this in common , will belong to the same Ethnos , even though they might belong in different nations . \\n\\n\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 ( Theos ) : This word is translated as \\'god\\ ' , but lot of its meaning is lost in translation . Greeks called Zeus , Hera , etc with that word . But the literal meaning of the word means \ '' one who travels fast\ '' , and they called these beings like that , because people from one village would say that let\\ 's say Apollo visited them one day , then people of a village 10 days away would say that Apollo visited their own village one day after he visited the first village ... So they they thought of calling these beings with a word that kind of means \ '' Fast traveling individual\ '' .",Greek,Greek

He spoke about the need of having a non exclusive public education system ( school ) , he defended that slaves weren\\'t born inferior but given the same luck and benefits a \\'free man\\ ' had , a slave could do as well as any other \\'free man\\ ' , and he also defended that women shouldn\\'t be closed and isolated inside houses , but that they should join men in education and working . He had made some realisations and proposed things , that only the last 1-2 centuries we got to materialize in our world , and what\\ 's most interesting in this man\\ 's books , is that what he wrote 2500 years ago , is mostly still relevant for our modern societies .

That there will be infighting between Muslims if this happens on who is going to lead and control the Mosque , and not only that but in turn that quarrel will generate a climate of Islamophobia for the rest non-Muslim people , and that in the end only harm and problems will come out of it . In another video he has called Sufis \ '' mystics that do magic and dress like women\ '' pejoratively.\\n\\n3 . He calls one of the groups that is included in this list ( Harigit ) a dangerous heresy that out of it have spawned terrorist groups like Al Quaeda .

The first factory\\ 's production would be through the roof . Does this mean the 4 part-time employees work *harder* because their output/hours worked is larger ? \\n\\nor\\n\\nYou have a person owning a small cafe . He works there 16h per day chasing flies most of the day . Is he more hard working that a miner doing 4-6h shifts ? \\n\\nor\\n\\nYou have two exact same factories catering to local needs . One is located in Luxemburg , the other in Zimbabwe . Are the Luxemburg workers more hard working than the Zimbabweans because their products are worth more in their respective markets ? \\n\\n -- -- -\\n\\n & gt ; and more importantly average pension how well a pensioner has it . Pension is fixed , you do not have to worked for it , therefore you can move anywhere in the world and enjoy a great lifestyle . I do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life.\\n\\nAgain , wrong . Say you\\ 're on a pension at \u20ac1000/month . Now you have two options , live in Luxemburg or live in the Philippines . Where would you be better off with that amount of money ? \\n\\n & gt ; I do not care how you spin it , pension income is a good indicator , of ones quality of life.\\n\\nBy itself , no , it is not . And it\\ 's not \ '' spinning\ '' . Without taking into account the actual purchasing power among other factors , it says **nothing** . \\n",Greek,Greek
Anergos,europe,"Again we have to make a distinction here and I\\ 'll present it in the form of an example : \\n\\nA government of a country was elected based on the mandate of increasing the basic wage to \u20ac500.\\n\\nA government of another country was elected as well , but with no mandates of basic wage increase . Their citizens though ask for a basic wage increase to \u20ac500.\\n\\nIf the govt of the first country fails to apply their mandate , it\\ 's undemocratic to continue as a govt . It doesn\\'t matter if raising the basic wage is wrong , bad for the people or anything of that nature . They were elected on the premise of wage increase.\\n\\nNow lets examine the second country . \\n\\nIf they deem that a wage increase is not good for the country and do not cave in the demands , it\\ 's **not** undemocratic . They may suffer in the next elections but they did what they were elected to do - look out for the good of their people.\\n\\nIf however they deem that a wage increase is not good for the country but still cave in the demands , it\\ 's not because of \ '' democracy\ '' . It\\ 's for political reasons - ie to get elected in the next elections.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\nOn to Germany now.\\n\\nMerkel\\ 's party is pro-european . That was/is their mandate . The German people may not want to bailout Greece . If Merkel deems that a Grexit would be harmful to the EU/EZ and to Germany especially , it\\ 's not undemocratic to bail out Greece , even if many of her people don\\'t agree . That\\ 's the role of leaders , to make difficult decisions.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Give a hiatus on debt repayment for X years on condition of following the \ '' plan\ '' . Put that 3.5 % primary surplus back inside the economy . Let the economy grow *with a balaced sheet* ( so no extra debt created ) for that time . After said amount of time has passed start repaying the full amount . Even if we put only 2 % back into the economy , in 20 years we\\ 'd have a 150 % larger economy better able to copy with the payments **with no extra debt**.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

It\\ 's not in their purview . What they can do however is make it that it\\ 's the only real viable solution . When they accepted the Greek junk bonds held by the Greek banks as a collateral , they were bending their own rules . They could have done a swap , pristine EU bonds for Greek govt bonds at a favorable rate for them , but they weren\\'t interested in a \ '' solution\ '' , but a leash on the economic system in Greece . If we\\ 're not happy , we\\ 'll stop closing our eyes on the fact that junk bonds are used as collateral . Which it happened in February and forced Greek banks to rely on ELA . \\n\\nSo while it\\ 's technically true , as it\\ 's not in their mandate , the actual result of their actions promoted the cap controls .

How is that fair towards the rest of the Eurozone that you guys borrowed and now refuse to pay us back.\\n\\nLet me enlighten you to some facets of economy . When a country \\n\ '' needs money\ '' one thing they can do is sell bonds/bills etc . The incentive for people to buy said bonds is their interest rate . The interest rate reflects the amount of risk of non-payment that bond has.\\n\\nSo if a country is almost assured to pay ( say Germany ) the bonds will have negligible yields . If a country might not pay , then the bonds will have large yields.\\n\\nSo when your banks bought Greek Dept , it carried a risk . So in 2009-2010 it turned out that Greece can\\'t pay . Well your politicians - since a bank bailout was pretty recent - decided to transfer that risk from your banks to the government . \\n\\nSo now can we stop with the childish \ '' you borrowed money now pay us back\ '' bollocks ? **Every** investment carries a risk .

Anergos,europe,There are no hard stats for tax evasion . Only estimates .

Anergos,europe,"Let me preface this by saying I am not pro-Syriza . They did a bad job but I\\ 'll get to that and how it is explainable.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\nAusterity is one of the proposed set of policies that aim at deficit reduction . As such , there isn\\'t a single political party in Greece , there isn\\'t a single Greek person who disagrees with the notion that Greece needed some policies of austerity . Our budget was messed up and everyone acknowledges that.\\n\\nThe problem is with specific measures and how they were called to be applied . Anyone claiming that Greece \ '' didn\\'t try hard enough\ '' should be metaphorically slapped silly . There hasn\\'t been a single country able to almost eliminate a 15 % budget deficit in 5 years time . France has a ~4 % deficit and they\\ 're asking for an extension to 2017 to drop it to the \ '' required\ '' 3 % GDP , just a 1 % drop.\\n\\nThe problem was that this was - and I am using Varoufakis analogue - a bad medicine . While it worked , it was full of destructive side effects.\\n\\nSo Syriza\\ 's promise was to try and negotiate a new package that eased on those side effects . Of course they would not go in a new spending spree , there aren\\'t any money.\\n\\n\\nNow something else , pretty minor , but still . The \ '' troika\ '' didn\\'t enable Greece to spend \u20ac240BN more than it could have spend . The banks did , they were the original lenders . And that wasn\\'t the face value of the debt . \\n\\nNow enough with these things , let\\ 's talk about Syriza and what happened by starting with a little background.\\n\\n**ECB**\\n\\nIn order for central banks to provide liquidity to the banks , they need to have collateral , usually govt bonds . But ECB does not accept junk rated bonds , which unfortunately the Greek banks had . However ECB bent their own rules and deemed they were acceptable . That was till Syriza came to power.\\n\\n**Syriza**\\n\\nSyriza came to power with a promise of a new deal , a deal with better terms that would allow the Greek economy to recover . \\n\\nTheir tactics were pretty aggressive . But they were amateurs in the negotiation and overestimated both their negotiating position and ECB\\ 's stance . \\n\\nThey shouted left and right that they do not accept the 2nd bailout terms , that the program will not continue etc . That was enough to push ECB to revoke their current stance of accepting Greek junk bonds as collateral - even though nothing had actually changed in that regard . \\n\\nSyriza\\ 's politicians didn\\'t expect that . That was during February I think , and that\\ 's when things started going sideways for the new government.\\n\\nGreek banks had to rely on ELA , which among other things has a bigger interest rate and can be frozen at a moment\\ 's notice without special justification . A 2/3 vote on ECB\\ 's governing council and that\\ 's that.\\n\\nAdd the fact that Greece did not have access to the markets , could not receive any of the bailout trenches , and the debt kept pilling on . \\n\\nFast forward further fuck ups from Varoufakis , the unexpected hard stance of the creditors , the *catastrophic* ELA freeze and the idiotic referendum and we reach today.\\n\\n -- -- -\\n\\nSyriza *had* honest intentions . I mean **everyone** knew that the debt was not payable . They just had the balls to say it out loud . But the way they went about things was amateurish . Syriza\\ 's politicans are inept , that\\ 's certain.\\n\\nSo now it\\ 's time for a question : \\n\\nWould you support the same old parties that partook in the destruction of the country for so many years now ?

Greece is snap-passing every law dictated that they can get through quickly , but many \ '' reforms\ '' ( example : \ '' find equivalent of X % and cut\ '' ) is unreasonable to assume it can be found in a few days.\\n\\nSo a \ '' bridge\ '' loan was given to stave of the first wave of payments .

The previous govt had fired them using an existing law on the basis of extenuating circumstances and of them not being needed . The court found that the circumstances were not that \ '' extenuating\ '' since at that point , the primary budget was mostly balanced . Their not being needed was countered by the fact that after firing them , a private company was hired to fulfill the role of the fired servants.\\n\\n & gt ; You said it yourself : it\\ 's the deficit that causes debt increases ... \\n\\nEgg and chicken debate , but the issue is not what causes what , but what is easier to combat at this point . The Greek govt now is pretty close to primary surplus . That means if they ( we ) didn\\'t have to pay interest rates on the loans , there would be no deficit . That happened in just under 5 years.\\n\\nHow many years with a 4.5 % primary surplus do we need to reach sub 100-120 % debt to GDP ? Around 50 ?

Anergos,europe,"Let me explain how some parts of the banking sector work as simply as I can : \\n\\nBanks in order to function need collateral . Those come in various forms , one of them being loans . What happens when a bank over extends itself and a single loan is a big part of their collateral ? If the borrower defaults , the bank might have trouble functioning and could be in need of a loan itself , in order to raise capital to use as collateral . But what happens when the other banks have the same problem ? That would mean that raising money will be *expensive* . That would mean investor uncertainty . That would also propagate the issue further into a circle . \\n\\nSo , now you\\ 're saying that Germany very well could have lent ( or \ '' given\ '' as you put it ) money to the banks to save them if that would happen.\\n\\nWell , here\\ 's the problem . They\\ 'd either have to lend them before the banks actually need it , or after.\\n\\nIf the banks took a loan from mama Germany , that would mean they *need* a loan from Germany , that would mean they\\ 're in trouble , investor uncertainty circle yada yada.\\n\\nIf the banks took the loan after , that would mean the banks had already failed . That the damage was done . That money would be spent on repairing that damage . Recovering the public trust etc.\\n\\nGermany did the correct thing for Germany . They did not let it happen at all .

How much value can you assign to 5 years of life more ? \\n\\nHome ownership is - again- not a good statistic to compare social classes . In some cases it doesn\\'t make economic sense , even for those who can afford it , to own a house . Housing prices in Hong Kong for instance are exorbitant .

After just a couple of days , the same house would have half that value . \\n\\n -- -- \\n\\nSo you must lay ground rules on how you will compare those social classes , using variables that can be compared and make sense . Income vs PPP after every day expenses , availability of and quality of services in that region etc . After that , you can add those aforementioned variables that can not be assigned a definite value and leave it at the discretion of each person to judge how much they\\ 're worth . \\n\\nExample : \\n\\nThe top 5 % in Norway have X economic power with great availability and quality of services .

That includes [ Greece ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/H3CKQky.jpg ) , just to dispel certain myths.\\n\\nSee that point in 2008 ? Anyone remember what happened then ? How about after ? Why isn\\'t the debt to GDP shrinking even after that many cuts ? Increasing austerity in times of crisis increases the debt/GDP . It\\ 's a denominator problem , austerity = smaller GDP = larger Debt/GDP . In a crisis , the more you cut , the larger the debt becomes . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's talk a bit on how we got there . It was a problem of bond yield convergence . You see before the euro , government bond yields were higher . And I mean HIGHER , for instance French bond yields were ~15 % . Why were French bond yields that high ? It\\ 's not as if France would skip payment ... Well Exchange rate risk plus inflation risk . The euro project meant no such risks . Markets priced accordingly and since the risk was too low , the yields were getting smaller and smaller.\\n\\nWell that\\ 's a problem for banks . You see , back then , they were getting good money from bond yields , but that was about to disappear . Banks loved sovereign debt , the more they had the more collateral to borrow more in the repo market financing . But with the price of bonds going up ( yields going down ) how could they make money ? Well , grab as much as you can before other banks do . Which meant every banks wanted bonds , which pressed the interest rates to become ever smaller , which meant they *needed* more and so on . \\n\\n70 % of the European funding are repo transactions . But when the European Council said that all sovereign debt withing the euro would be treated the same banks went berserk . They doubled their balance sheets and became very big very fast . But that is a problem . What would happen if the banks went into trouble ? \\n\\nBefore the euro , if say French banks went into trouble , it was an \ '' easy\ '' fix . Print more francs . Job done . But this isn\\'t the case with the euro . Everybody assumed it was the ECB\\ 's job , a lender of last resorts . It wasn\\'t . \\n\\nRating agencies started to rate down on sovereign debt .

Anergos,europe,You probably replied to the wrong comment . \\n\\n\\n,Greek,Greek
Anergos,europe,"& gt ; No , it wasnt . Germany was controlled by the allied forces for a significant amount of time , with the allied forces basically being able to pull the plug on the German government for a while afterwards if need be . Nobody gave Germany a bunch of money and told them to just do what they thought was best with it.\\n\\nGermany\\ 's debt repayment was tied to their exports . That gave incentives to creditors to buy German goods.\\n\\nCompare it to tying Greek Debt repayment to growth . That will give incentives to creditors to invest in Greek growth . That\\ 's pretty similar in my books.\\n\\nI will not delve into how German govt hands were tied compared to the Greek situation now . Suffice to say Greece needs approval for every economic measure they pass through parliament and there is no fear of Greece becoming an aggressor country.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Greece is still a democracy , and regardless of how this thing goes , actual meaningful change that gets Greece to becoming a country capable of actually sustaining itself is going to mean a lot of hardships for the population , more than there are now . Its not unreasonable to believe that the Greek people might not be willing to do that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you mean by more ? You don\\'t seem to grasp the situation in Greece right now . There is no more . That\\ 's why Syriza was elected . 25 % unemployment , 40 % of populace below poverty line , salaries taking a 30-45 % dive but price of goods remain the same , what more ? Increase unemployment ? How\\ 's Greece going to make money for the payments ? Decrease salaries ? How are Greek people going to buy food and medicines ? Do you see Lidl or any other exporter rushing to drop prices on their primary goods in Greece ? \\n\\n & gt ; Because the claim has no legal value , and Greecce knows it . Otherwise they would have taken it to court . The issue is that you dont throw what you know to be a bogus claim into someones face while also effectively asking for donations . Greece is ultimately reliant on goodwill from other nations , and theyre doing a stunning job at pissing it away.\\n\\nHow exactly are you sure that it has no legal value ? Are you expert in international law and have examined the Greek documents ? Up until they actually put those documents under examination by experts , no one can tell , not me , not you.\\n\\nAnd what donations are you talking about ? Who\\ 's giving Greece free money ? IMF ? 30 billion loan over 5 years netted a healthy 2billion profit , I wouldn\\'t call that a donation . No one is giving \ '' free money\ '' .\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Im pretty confident they could , its not an impossible thing to do like you make it seem . The reason they dont is because its much more reasonable not to do so , so long as you can afford it . Greece cant afford it though , because they simply have too much debt , so their total deficit is too high if they dont manage to run a pretty high primary surplus.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a single economist that says it\\ 's doable . I mean , your country , the epitome of austerity , with the lowest unemployment in EU , in a top economic shape and with excellent efficiency , reached a 3 % surplus ONCE from 1995 . You expect a country with 25 % unemployment to sustain itself for that long a period of time with 4.5 % ? Let\\ 's be reasonable now ... \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Greece hasnt \ '' followed a program\ '' . Greece has been given parameters they would be required to meet in order to receive financial help . Greece has failed and keeps failing to meet them . That doesnt automatically mean that the standards are \ '' unrealistic\ '' , considering that Greece has not managed to actually nail down its tax evasion problem in that timeframe , for example.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not a program ? Well EC thinks it is . Why would they name it [ \ '' Economic Adjustment Programme\ '' ] ( http : //ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2014/op192_en.htm ) .

I don\\'t know whether you\\ 're Greek or not and whether you\\ 're familiar with our politics , but the 2004-2009 government was a centre-right wing one . That government was lying about the deficit ( on the 2nd of October of 2009 , the Karamanlis administration reported a prospected deficit of 6 % of the GDP to the EU Commission and the next Government after the 04/10/09 elections , revised that to 12,5 % . That number would again be revised and finalised in 2010 , when the newly formed ELSTAT ( Hellenic Statistical Authority ) and Eurostat announced the 2009 deficit to be 15,4 % of the GDP ) and things went really out of control . So the problem was the deficit.\\n\\nHowever , the reasons that Greece had such a deficit and its causes , have yet to be recognised and accepted by the public and tackled by the bailout programs . Early retirements at 55 ( or younger for women ) in the broader public sector with pensions and benefits immeasurably ( literally ) inconsistent to what someone has paid during his working life . A 10 people job in 1980 , was a 3 people job in 2005 . No one cared to reorganize the public sector . I don\\'t know up until which point the government didn\\'t even know how many people were working in the public sector . Huge deficits in public-held companies , railways , energy , water , banks . As for the sleeping giant that is the Greek agriculture ( which undoubtedly can produce of the highest quality exportable products ) , the bulk of the money that was given by the EU throughout the years , ended up becoming 2-story houses , a couple of Mercedes E-class and lovely nights with lovely girls from the former communist countries ( also , they used to declare their crops to be many times larger than they actually were and the state didn\\'t have the means of checking that .

We keep raising the taxes to achieve the targeted primary surplus , but noone seems to care about the other part of that calculation , government spending . And I am not talking about low-income pensioners.\\n",Greek,Greek

Apolitikal,europe,"The urban planner responsible for rebuilding Thessaloniki was Ernest H\u00e9brard . However a friend ( who is into this stuff ) once told me that the plan was left incomplete . If it was completed , Thessaloniki would be much more beautiful.\\n\\nBut you\\ 're right , Salonica has a special place in anyone\\ 's heart . The food , the people , the view .

Apolitikal,europe,"This is a day of great significance for Greeks , both in terms of the athletic success ( the first of such caliber ) as well as the social aspect of that Championship . Today , many people take a step back and remember \ '' what they were doing that night\ '' , how different Greece was at the time and how for the first time in its modern history all Greeks went out on the streets for a common cause , celebrating without end . \\n\\nIt marked the turning point for sports in Greece .

Apolitikal,europe,"I completely agree . And to be honest , I feel that the left-right discrimination is obsolete , at least it has become , in Greece . You have on one side the reformers and on the other side what we call \ '' \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2\ '' ( from kratos , meaning state ) , the people who want high public spending , privileges for the unions , are against privatizations and so on . On the one side is the \ '' Macron\ '' type of politician and on the other side is the \ '' opa\ '' type of politician . Karamanlis was definitely the latter . \\n\\nThe left and right are terms that have their historic reference in the Greek civil war . It has fueled the partisan debate for many years and I hope we are moving towards the end of that era . \\n\\nPersonally , I firmly believe that Greece can become a completely different country in just a year . Just ask for help , technical help from the other EU countries . How to organise your public sector , how to crack down on tax evasion , how to reform your education system , how to promote clean energy , how to protect your environment . It\\ 's easy , it doesn\\'t cost anything real ( except for the abstract bs of \ '' national pride\ '' : I won\\'t have the German tell me what to do ) , the EU partners would be glad to help and the solutions have been proven to work .

Arathian,europe,"# Full Text\\n\\nFRANCE\u2019S most pro-European presidential candidate took his campaign to London this week to a rapturous welcome . Emmanuel Macron , a 39-year-old former Socialist economy minister , was there to court the French vote abroad , and is exactly the sort of upbeat , international-minded tech enthusiast that London\u2019s latte-drinking French voters adore . Campaigning as an independent for votes on the left and the right , Mr Macron has pulled off the astonishing feat of hauling himself up from rank outsider to joint second place in the polls . But the closer he gets to a shot at the French presidency , the tougher his campaign is turning out to be.\\n\\nA few days before Mr Macron turned up in London , he had been in more hostile territory : the Mediterranean naval port of Toulon , traditionally held by the right . The entrance to his rally was blocked by scores of enraged National Front ( FN ) supporters and pieds-noirs ( ethnic French who resided in Algeria during colonial rule ) , chanting \u201cMacron traitor ! \u201d On a trip to Algeria that week , he had called France\u2019s colonisation of the north African country a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d.\\n\\nThe rally went ahead all the same . Mr Macron told the audience that he was \u201csorry\u201d if he had \u201cwounded\u201d anybody , but that France needed to confront all sides of its history . The venue was a little over half full , and the atmosphere flat . The crowd seemed motivated as much by curiosity as conviction . Jean-Luc , a high-school maths teacher , said he had never been to a political rally and was \u201cintrigued\u201d by Mr Macron . Robert , a retired salesman , said he voted for Fran\u00e7ois Fillon , the centre-right candidate , at his party\u2019s primary but was now \u201clooking for a way out\u201d . ( Mr Fillon is under investigation for having employed family members on the parliamentary payroll , despite little evidence that they did much work . ) It was Mr Macron\u2019s \u201cdifferent way of doing politics\u201d that appealed , said a retired naval worker and Socialist voter ; he was not yet sure of his vote . \\n\\nWith two months to go before the first-round , the French presidential election has become more unpredictable than any in recent history . The only near-certainty is that the FN\u2019s Marine Le Pen will win one of the two places in the run-off . This has turned the election into a race to face her . Though she has staged almost no rallies , Ms Le Pen tops first-round polling , with about 26 % of the vote ( see article ) . Over three-quarters of her voters say they are sure of their choice . For Mr Macron , who is neck-and-neck with Mr Fillon in second place , this share is just 45 % .\\n\\nThat Mr Macron is in this position is remarkable enough . This , after all , is a young man who in July 2014 , after quitting his job as deputy chief of staff to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , could be found in his top-floor office at the Elys\u00e9e Palace cheerfully mulling over plans to write a book , or perhaps teach philosophy . Today , the offices of En Marche ! , the movement he founded last year , are filled with young people in sweatshirts , and feel like a cross between a start-up and a student society . He has attracted policy heavyweights , such as Jean Pisani-Ferry , an economist , and the support of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou , a centrist who has declined to run himself . And he is recruiting candidates from all backgrounds to stand at parliamentary elections in June . The objective , says Mr Macron , is to reject \u201cyesterday\u2019s choices\u201d , pursue \u201cradical novelty\u201d in politics , and build \u201ca new France\u201d.\\n\\n**Not your regular Gilles**\\n\\nYet , besides his inexperience , two obstacles in particular lie ahead if Mr Macron is to beat Mr Fillon into the second round . One is whether he can find a way to speak to a broader electorate , beyond the metropolitan voters with a university degree who favour him . \u201cHe\u2019s too intellectual , \u201d says a retired antique dealer , in a caf\u00e9 overlooking the port in Toulon , where the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is docked while undergoing repairs . Mr Macron\u2019s overtly pro-European politics are unfashionable in parts of France these days . His support for Germany\u2019s open-border policy towards Syrian refugees\u2014he says it \u201csaved our collective dignity\u201d\u2014collides with a popular mood of rising nationalism . And Mr Macron\u2019s embrace of technological disruption does not resonate with those who fear they will be its next victims . \u201cHe is quite weak among manual workers and employees , and it\u2019s not possible to construct a successful candidacy without them , \u201d says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet of Ifop , a polling group.\\nThe second is how far his poll success is down to an engaging personality rather than a convincing programme . The country , he says , needs \u201cvision\u201d , not scores of policy ideas that promptly get shelved by presidents in power . But his reluctance to be too precise has left Mr Macron open to the charge of ambiguity . Asked which of his policies they liked best , supporters questioned in Toulon were unable to answer . Mr Macron is due shortly to unveil more specific plans which , perhaps tactically , he has long avoided . Yet this carries fresh risks . Some of the ideas he sketched out in \u201cR\u00e9volution\u201d , the book he published last year , are profoundly radical , certainly for France . He wants to curb the overall level of public spending ; have the state take over the employer- and union-run unemployment benefit system in place since the second world war ; and devolve most negotiations on working conditions to companies . He is liberal , he says , \u201cin a Nordic sense\u201d . Getting the right balance between what France needs , and what the French will vote for , will be perilous.\\n\\nA historically unusual opportunity is within Mr Macron\u2019s grasp : the chance of beating all established party candidates into the second round , and from there into the presidency . Polls suggest that he would be a more solid run-off candidate against Ms Le Pen than would the damaged Mr Fillon . Under the Fifth Republic , no independent has ever pulled off such a feat . Then again , none has had such a remarkable opportunity to do so .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're being sarcastic and patronising in both your comments which I find unnecessary.\\n\\nI was not being sarcastic at any point . Nor patronizing , I would like to think . I am just pointing out the facts.\\n\\n & gt ; As you said , the individual wants something deleted , not the government . Just because the government is acting on behalf and for the benefit of the individual does not make it \ '' government censorship\ '' . You highlighted government in your sentence as if having the word in there makes it so.\\n\\nThe government enforces the law to delete information . That automatically makes it government censorship since compliance is obligatory under law . The point of highlighting the government was to show the enforcer of said law.\\n\\nThe fact that a private individual requested the government to censor something ( which happens often , I might add ) does not make the government\\ 's actions not-censorship magically.\\n\\n & gt ; The censorship aspect of this can be argued for , but it\\ 's certainly not \ '' textbook\ '' as no such law or situation has existed before.\\n\\nIt is textbook censorship since the government is actively censoring information . The law being new is quite irrelevant to that . If the government introduced a law dictating that you can never talk about ducks , that law would also be textbook censorship despite the law being a new one.\\n\\n & gt ; There are arguments that can be made on either side , I don\\'t understand the conviction some have on how this is some big government conspiracy somehow.\\n\\nNobody here is talking about conspiracies . I am just pointing out that this is a plain censorship law and I hate censorship laws . I don\\'t think the government here is \ '' conspiring\ '' to do anything in particular .

Arathian,europe,"Mm , as I said above , the problem with civ is that it has to have set players and \ '' spots\ '' as there are limited countries that can be played , so it takes way more organization than eu4 where there are hundreds of countries and people can drop out without much changing.\\n\\nYou will probably need to create a steam group for this to work properly.\\n\\nOn the other hand , civ has the advantage of not having trash netcode and being turn based rather than pseudo-turn based so you won\\'t have the problems with disconnects that eu4 has.\\n",Greek,Greek

[ here is the full subthread ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ddrww/holy_war_of_isis_arrives_in_germany/cjornuf ) \\n\\nMy comment to someone asking why I think multiculturalism objectively failed : \\n\\n\ '' First off , diversity is an acceptance of mass immigration without a particular pressure to immigrants to assimilate or change their culture within the host country and instead a pressure to locals to accept said cultures . Tell me if you disagree with this definition so we can speak from a common ground.\\n\\nNow , the objective failures : \\n\\n-It brought over the worst qualities of the other countries along with the good ones and did nothing to pan them out . This is in stark contrast with other immigration models like the American melting pot . This thread is a good case in point of this.\\n\\n-It created strong cultural tensions and locals are not the only ones to blame . The immigrants themselves are not interested in interacting with the locals because most of them come from cultures that don\\'t pressure them into acceptance . Since the policy , by definition , doesn\\'t try to change it , it remains that way.\\n\\n-Strong cultural tensions brought strong cultural backlash . This IS a failure of policy . If a policy brings on such a strong backlash something is done wrong , regardless if you agree or disagree with the backlash.\\n\\n-It increased crime . Yes it did . You might say it is the fault of the locals for not accommodating immigrants but it still did . Sweden is the rape capital of the world and it isn\\'t Swedes that are doing the raping.\\n\\n-It distorted local cultures . I left this for last because it isn\\'t exactly an objective one since many don\\'t actually care about it , but I do . So this is a failure for me . Many smaller cultures within the countries got homogenized the past 2 decades in a push of grand cultural change by the governments of Europe and that is a loss.\\n\\nedit , also a particularly bad one I forgot : \\n\\n-Mass immigration was not controlled in any way for most of the past decade which led to a vast increase of unskilled labour that severely saturated the low skill labour market with no corresponding increase in low skill labour availability . This led to severe lowing of wages , and even unemployment , of the poorer strata of locals as well as a deterioration of lifestyle.\ '' \\n \\n\\nAs far as I am concerned , my comment still stands and , if anything , it is stronger today .",Greek,Greek

In his apology for the remarks last month , Mr McDonnell claimed he only made them to promote the peace process . In fact , however , Mr McDonnell told the IRA\u2019s official newspaper that he opposed the peace process negotiations to create a power-sharing assembly in what became the Good Friday Agreement.\\n\\n & gt ; Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell \u201cwork closely\u201d with the Wolfe Tone Society , according to its convenor , Dennis Grace , speaking at the 2006 event.It was at the Wolfe Tone Society\u2019s 2003 commemoration that Mr McDonnell made his now notorious comments calling for Sands and other terrorists to be \u201chonoured , \u201d adding : \u201cIt was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of Bobby Sands that brought Britain to the negotiating table.\u201d\\n\\netc etc\\n\\n**Hamas : **\\n\\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11749043/Andrew-Gilligan-Jeremy-Corbyn-friend-to-Hamas-Iran-and-extremists.html\\n\\nthis article has most of what you need but it mostly focuses on Corbyn ( who is even more crazy in the Hamas front being the chairman of the \ '' stop the war\ '' foundation which is a whole different set of whackos ) \\n\\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11840793/jeremy-corbyn-hamas-praise-israel-palestine-conflict.html\\n\\nAlso the \ '' respect\ '' is two ways with Hamas.\\n\\nIf you want any further sources , please do tell.\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"The problem with Greece is that due to the crisis , everything is extremely complicated nowadays.\\n\\nIf magically I became the prime minister tomorrow ( assume with a relatively majority right wing government that roughly follows my ideals ) : \\n\\n-I would follow the current deal with the EU to the fullest extend.\\n\\n-I would appeal for EU countries to provide us with tax collectors and officials charged with looking for public corruption . The EU had actually suggested that before but we declined . I wouldn\\'t necessarily put them directly collecting taxes ( since they would probably not be many of them ) but instead advisory and overwatching rolls , especially for higher level corruption.\\n\\n-Would probably start a \ '' good will\ '' tour up north immediately to try to fix Tsipras\\ ' diplomatic fuck ups . Not just Germany , but I would also focus on Poland/Slovenia/Finland/Baltics . Sign a few cooperation deals , say a couple of nice words in public along with a German official to calm the markets down.\\n\\n-After about 6-8 months of implementing the current deal , I would secretly start talks about actually making the debt reasonably manageable while not creating a situation of potential political suicide for European leaders . Basically , debt cuts would be given constant disguises or even provided indirectly ( for example , EU funds could be increased and redicted towards there ) . The point would be for the cuts to happen without anyone noticing . The goal would be that by the end of the first year , a solid guideline towards reducing the debt would be established that would essentially replace the current deal.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nAssuming this goes well , and it very well might not since the situation is so volatile , after that I would focus on crushing corruption and reducing state expenses . I would probably tax , to some extend , the church and reduce millitary spending by a bit . Hopefully , by then the foreign bureaucrats overseeing the Greek collectors will have helped stem tax evasion quite a bit which would afford small tax cuts to benefit the wider population , especially in food.\\n\\nMy pet project would probably be to digitize state expenses , so literally every Greek could see where the money are spend and then advertise the shit out of that . The idea would be that at least 1/10 Greeks will be checking that place occasionally and start to give Greeks a \ '' our tax dollars\ '' mentallity for watching over the state so we don\\'t go back to being a cleptocracy when the crisis is over.\\n\\nAlso start an anti-corruption organization similar to Romania\\ 's . It has had great success and , as far as I am concerned , should be immitated . The bigger problem would be to find uncorruptable people .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text : **\\n\\nA DEADLY car bomb in Ankara on February 17th just a few hundred metres from Turkey\u2019s parliament has fanned the flames of the war that Turkish troops are fighting against Kurdish insurgents in the country\u2019s south-east . It also threatens to pull Turkey yet deeper into the chaos in Syria and to sour its relations with America . Most worryingly , it has brought Turkey one step closer to a direct confrontation with Russia.\\n\\nOn Thursday , Turkish officials identified the man who detonated a car packed with explosives next to a military bus in the heart of the country\u2019s capital , killing 27 military personnel and one civilian , as a member of the People\u2019s Protection Units ( YPG ) , a Syrian Kurdish militia . \u201cA direct link between the attack and the YPG has been established , \u201d said Ahmet Davutoglu , the Turkish prime minister . He claimed the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party ( PKK ) , a Turkish-Kurdish group that has fought Turkey\u2019s government for decades , provided logistical support for the attack.\\n\\nThe YPG has no history of attacks inside Turkey . It denied any role in the bombing , and said the government was blaming it as a convenient excuse for launching a military operation in Syria . A senior PKK commander claimed ignorance of the attack , but did not exclude the possibility that other Kurdish militant groups were involved . \u201cWe know that previously such acts have been carried out in retaliation for massacres in Kurdistan , \u201d Cemil Bayik told a Kurdish news agency . The PKK has been battling government troops and police in Turkey\u2019s south-east since last summer ; the fighting has left hundreds dead , including over 200 civilians , and displaced more than 100,000 people.\\n\\nMetin Gurcan , a military analyst and columnist for al-Monitor , a website , finds the PKK\u2019s denial unconvincing . \u201cThey have a record of trying to franchise violence without taking responsibility , \u201d he says . \u201cThey may be trying to export the violence [ from the south-east ] to the west of the country.\ '' \\n\\nOn Thursday , a PKK roadside bomb killed six troops in Diyarbakir , a south-eastern province . The same day , Turkish jets pounded PKK bases in the highlands of northern Iraq.\\n\\nThe Ankara bombing has widened the rift between Turkey and its allies over the YPG . Turkey , which regards the group as a front for the PKK , wants America to suspend its co-operation with the militia in Syria . But Washington considers the YPG an important partner in the war against Islamic State ( IS ) . It has acknowledged ties between the YPG and the PKK , which it labels a terrorist group , but refuses to place the two in the same category.\\n\\nSince the attacks , Mr Davutoglu has doubled down . \u201cWe can not excuse any NATO ally , including the US , of having links with a terrorist organisation that strikes us in the heart of Turkey , \u201d he said on Thursday . The same day , his ministry of foreign affairs summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.\\n\\nTurkish warnings appear to be falling on deaf ears . Late on Thursday John Kirby , a spokesman for the State Department , suggested that Ankara had yet to provide conclusive proof of the YPG\u2019s involvement in the attack . He also ruled out ending American backing for the group . \u201cI think I\u2019ve said that they\u2019ve been some of the most effective fighters against Daesh [ IS ] , and they have been supported by the air from the coalition , \u201d he said . \u201cAnd going forward , I would expect that that sort of support\u2026would continue.\u201d\\n\\nThe two NATO allies will probably find a way out of the dispute . But the far deeper row between Turkey and Russia has now reached uncharted waters . Having traded threats since late November , when Turkey shot down a Russian jet that had briefly entered its airspace after a bombing run in Syria , the two sides are now embroiled in a proxy war . In past couple of weeks Russia has effectively provided the YPG with air cover , paving the way for the group\u2019s advance against Ankara-backed rebel forces north of Aleppo . The Turks have responded by raining artillery fire on the YPG for several days in a row , hinting at a possible ground operation and allowing as many as 2,000 rebels to cross into Syria to check the Kurdish offensive.\\n\\nOn February 19th Mr Davutoglu stopped just short of accusing Moscow of engineering the bombing in Ankara . \u201cI would like to warn Russia , which is giving air support to the YPG in its advance on Azaz [ a key rebel stronghold ] , not to use this terrorist group against the innocent people of Syria and Turkey , \u201d he said.\\n\\nMeanwhile , the YPG has started to leverage its budding relationship with the Russians . In an interview , the head of the newly opened Syrian-Kurdish representation to Moscow , Rodi Osman , warned that any Turkish incursion into Syria would result in a \u201cgreat war\u201d with his hosts . \u201cRussia will respond if there is an invasion , \u201d he said . \u201cThis isn\u2019t only about the Kurds , they will defend the territorial sovereignty of Syria.\u201d\\n\\nFor that reason alone , a unilateral Turkish offensive in northern Syria has hitherto seemed highly unlikely . Whoever staged the Ankara bombing hopes to have made it less so . \u201cFor an actor , or a group of actors , who want to draw Turkey into Syria , \u201d says Mr Gurcan , \u201cthis was the perfect attack.\u201d",Greek,Greek

If that was the case , a shitton of people who we do not consider terrorists would be terrorists.\\n\\nResistance against the Nazis in WW2 ? Terrorism . Revolutionaries in France ? Terrorists . Most independence movements in Europe ( like the Greek independence movement ) ? Terrorists.\\n\\nIf we accept all these people are terrorists , the only thing it would do would be that \ '' terrorism\ '' would no longer be a negative term but a neutral one that can have negative or positive ( or well..neutral ) connotations depending on the situation.\\n\\nI personally prefer to define terrorism as violence whose purpose is to intimidate populations or organizations and that primarily targets civilian targets and infrastructure.\\n\\nUnder my definition ( which I don\\'t think is outrageous ) this attack would not be a terrorist one but simply an attack under the general context of the war in Kurdistan.\\n\\nHowever , as you correctly pointed out , that does NOT mean PKK is not a terrorist organization . PKK has , in the past , targeted civilians specifically and thus those attacks were clearly terrorist in nature . Just to make that clear .",Greek,Greek

France put an 80 % tax on only the ultra-wealthy and it was almost never implemented and it still managed to halve the income from taxes out of those people since a large amount of them moved out of the country ( mostly to Belgium ) . A 100 % tax as well as a wage cap would kill any large investment in the country and destroy London as the financial capital of the world .",Greek,Greek

I don\\'t think there is a \ '' grand conspiracy of left wingers\ '' in this sub\\ 's moderation . In fact , I would go so far as to say that it is pretty much a fact that there isn\\'t such a conspiracy.\\n\\nAs a right winger , I would have the \ '' legitimacy\ '' to do something the current mods can\\'t do due to calls of \ '' censorship\ '' : I can properly moderate immigration threads .

What do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? \\n\\nI strongly opposed it . I still strongly oppose any such solutions . Immigration is a very complex story but the basics ( people going from X to Y ) has been talked about to death and anything worthwhile has been said . The point of immigration threads is to discuss specific *events* that happen as they happen . That is not possible in a megathread . Megathreads are ... .okey for single events , not great , but okey .
