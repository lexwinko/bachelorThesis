0xKaishakunin,europe,"Different schools and degrees can be compared in a scientific way , that\\ 's what my research is about . \\n\\nHowever , this is a very complex task even without corruption and bribery . Different countries have different educational systems . Due to our strong TVET system in Germany only ca . 25 % of population hold an academic degree . The Universit\u00e4ten in Germany do scientific training , not vocational training . The Unis in Germany also have the same high standards of teaching and research , there are no Mickey-Mouse-Colleges and Ivy Leagues as in other countries . \\n\\nOther countries have a different approach eg . Spain and France relying heavily on universities for training with a more differentiated university system . \\n\\nSo comparing an engineering degree from a German Universit\u00e4t and a Spanish Uni is a task on it\\ 's own . Very complex . \\n\\n & gt ; the fact that Michalovce with population of 40 000 has 3 ( or more ... ) universities ( by that I mean few departments of them and you do \ '' long distance\ '' studying ) is ridiculous.\\n\\nDepends on what those Unis are doing .

So if you study Marketing at a German Universit\u00e4t , you will get a lot of theory , models and math . \\n\\nSince the 1970s we also have Fachhochschulen in Germany , former Engineering Schools . They also follow scientific principles , but teach a more practical approach . They also don\\'t teach Humanities , Social Sciences , Law or Medicine . \\n\\nFachhochschulen are usually a bit smaller and also located in smaller towns . \\n\\nThe German companies know about the differences and use the graduates accordingly . \\n\\n\\nI really like the work done with EQF/ECVET , but I fear comparison will only be done on paper ignoring the different standards and training systems . \\n",Germanic,German

Today the city is unrecognizable , he writes , Islamists had conquered streets and shops : report of a stunned . *\\n\\nFor 21 years I live in Saint-Denis . Here , a few kilometers from Paris , I have found asylum in 1994 . My friend , Professor Abderrahmane Fardeheb , was assassinated on September 26 of that year in Oran in front of his daughter , whom he had accompanied to school , by Islamists . At that time I had decided to leave my country.\\n\\nIn Saint-Denis , this situated on the River Seine city of diversity , hospitality and tolerance , I could be at home with my family , finally free from the threats of the Islamists , who piled up in my mailbox . I was 48 years old and left a beloved radiant city where I had worked as a physicist and taught - full of pain , but convinced that I would no longer be exposed to the horrors of political Islam in France.\\n\\nIn recent years , the fear grabbed me again . Saint-Denis has nothing to do with the Saint-Denis at the time . And the land of human rights refuses to look . In Saint-Denis , a gap has opened up , which brings back memories , it does so on the sidewalks , in the market on Sunday . And yet many citizens refuse to recognize that here gnaws a counter-project to the democratic foundations of the pluralistic society.\\n \\n*Veil for a four-year old*\\n\\nWhere , in this downright summery Sunday of November , are lightweight tops and short skirts ? Wherever I look , veil , veil , veil again - simple headscarves , shawls , also cover the forehead , and great for the whole body . Recently , there in the street that bears the name of the communist resistance fighter Gabriel P\u00e9ri , shops for Islamic dress . They are called Duba\u00ef Center or Daffah - a thriving Saudi company . This is the law of supply and demand , which is bad about it ? , ask the naive , to whom I can no longer count myself . My wife asks naively : \ '' Do you have a scarf for my eight year old granddaughter who is small for her age , \ '' The shop assistant shows her models : \ '' I\\ 've sold one to a four year old.\ '' \\n\\nIn between are books , they convey , together with the \ '' Wahhabi fashion\ '' , the proselytism of an Islamist fringe group , whose ideology many keep out of weakness or ignorance , for the message of the Qur\\'an . This aims to hold \ '' Muslims\ '' in the Islamist orbit , dominate and control the community , to promote the secession from the rest of society.\\n\\nIn addition to the giant fast-food business Mak d\\'Hal , that mimics the look and McDonald\\ 's hamburgers , one hundred percent halal , the hair salon Coiffure Mixte is hardly noticeable . The owner explained to me : \ '' Mixte is here that there is a separate room for veiled women , where they are hidden from view.\ '' This woman is like me from Oran . I say : \ '' How did this idea come from ? I have not even seen such a thing in Oran.\ '' Then the hairdresser : \ '' You will probably not compare Oran and Saint-Denis.\ '' Here in Saint-Denis , she told me that Muslims would live their faith without compromise.\\n\\nHow often have I not heard that lately ? Friends of mine come back in disbelief from Algerian cities like Algiers or S\u00e9tif . \ '' In the market of Bab-El-Oued lovers hold hands ! \ '' , A friend told me , as if he had seen an English speaking duck . \ '' Women who have a drink on a cafe terrace with girlfriends , they are normal , here we would wonder about it , \ '' complains another . French people who recognize my origins from my appearance and accent , ask me : \ '' And , you eat pork ? \ '' , as that would be weird . I do not ask neighbors or colleagues whether they fast or go to the Latin Mass ! Why does one lock me in a cage of religious identity ? When my daughter-in-law filed for her daughter at school , she crossed to the canteens questionnaire , the child eat \ '' everything\ '' . A few days after the start of school , a supervisor adressed her : \ '' You know that you have by having everything ticked , agreed that your daughter eats foods that are not halal ? \ '' \\n\\nMy city has re-instilled in me in recent years the suspicion that I wanted to leave on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea 21 years ago . The stream of people that every Friday pours into the Rue de Boulangerie is not an ordinary gathering of believers . From the Tawhid-center that attracts so many believers that their prayer rugs temporarily brought the traffic brought to a standstill , in 2000 the preacher Tariq Ramadan launched his France-activity . This prayer room , which some consider to be a simple mosque , is the center of those who follow the political ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\nI am in France , I go on a road that still daresto call itself Rue du Jambon , street of ham .

As a personal note , I appreciate the sober new course of Western policy towards Syria , focused on the foundation of civilized society and washing down the totalitarian political ideology of islamism and its agendas in the toilet of history .

2A1ZA,europe,"*Translation of the submission \ '' Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims\ '' by Zafer Senocak*\\n\\n**Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims**\\n\\nHow to describe great loneliness ? Greater than the one which occurs when one has been abandoned by a loved one . Unlike the loneliness to which the poetries care . A loneliness that no longer will be outweighed by the world in which we live , can no longer be mitigated by what you believe , by promise and hope.\\n\\nIt is about the loneliness of those who come from the Muslim peoples and cultures and grew up in enlightened families who are religious or not , but always knew one thing , that they belong to the large global family of the enlightened . They want to live in a secular and open society , in Turkey as well as in Egypt , in Syria as well as in Iran . These enlightened mostly formed the middle class in their countries . They had a happy childhood . Half a century has it been since.\\n\\nOn the Bosphorus , there was this happy childhood , and also in Tehran . The happy childhood of bastards . Where did the bastards belong to ? They listened to the Beatles and more and more often overheard the muezzin . Where would they be at home when the world was open to them ? Has happiness a home in the world ? \\n\\n*The happy days of youth*\\n\\nIt was lived outdoors . Back in Cairo , Ankara and Tehran . Joy was the name of a dance . You could feel the stranger\\ 's hand , that prepared meals , on your own skin . It was also a time in which the prisons were filled and emptied with political prisoners . But the air outside did not smell like grids.\\n\\nThe air smelled of light effects . In the movies it was talked , laughed , music made . As on the streets . The houses all had a window on the streets . One grew out of one\\ 's house , to discover the world . The world of different people , the world of the other gender , the world of strange odors.\\n\\nThe child grew up free , because the adults had not yet fully furnished their world . You searched for the course of events , found snippets of photos , tried in memories , but they did live in the future . They lived in their children that they had rather than the ideas in their heads , the wild and horny ideas , the dangerous and the harmless . It was a time when you went to Paris for a weekend , because in Paris was always spring , a spring of the fragrance and love.\\n\\nThe preacher , who accompanied the dead came back to life and smelled like roses . Life and joy belonged to the existence of mortals , because they had the time and leisure to think about themselves and others . It was a time of learning . Foreign languages , the art of numbers and the art of living.\\n\\nToday in many places people have no life any more . Why even the graves ? The people no longer have a home . Why even have a garden ? The people have no land . What still limits ? Freedom can be as homelessness . In childhood , freedom smelled like freedom . The muezzin sounded as if he would sing of freedom . He called the people to prayer . Prayer smelled like freedom . Now , where the muezzin calls for death , to death and to kill , it would be to remember the smell of the prayers . Can you remember smells ? Will prayers help ? \\n\\nYou do not smell good anymore . They smell musty . We will no longer be free , meet together , but not free and be together . We are prejudiced , lifeless or false . We have no more childhood . The trains no longer go to Europe . The ships that reach Europe pour children overboard . But also those who live on do not travel any more . They emigrate , emigrate from their childhood , their lives , their hopes , from the joy of living . Can you live with these people ? Or is the hope that they have lost our death sentence ? \\n\\n*The Disappearance of Childhood*\\n\\nThere is no longer this childhood , which one could remember together . The alphabets are without secret . Freedom is a word . Words give life . We split the words in our bodies and have no word left for the happy childhood . Who belongs Paris ? Who owns my childhood ? Mother Asia , Father Europe ? \\n\\nTo whom does the bastard belong ? It was a happy childhood , the childhood of the bastards . I want my childhood back , my spotted by executioners childhood . I want to put on like a torn dress . It\\ 's perfect for me today , my mood , for my heart torn , for my pain . Without childhood we are naked.\\n\\nThe enlightened experience for a generation how they are pushed back in their own countries , but increasingly also rejected and abandoned by their non-Muslim sympathizers . They learn how the memory of their childhood increasingly gets into oblivion.\\n\\n*Massacre of Ankara*\\n\\nNowhere is this amnesia , which is accompanied by great loneliness , so noticeable as in Turkey . And no other event makes this loneliness feel more than the assassinations by deluded Islamists . Only a month ago , a suicide bomber killed more than 100 people in the heart of Ankara.\\n\\nHundreds of people were injured . A massacre of people who had come to demonstrate for peace . This event is perhaps hardly remembered . Otherwise , the Turkish President would have a harder time after the Paris attacks with his self-assured , arrogant appearances before the world public.\\n\\nThe fight against terror he wants to receive , together with the leading nations of the world . Would it not be about time first to uncover the backers for Islamist terrorism in his own country ? \\n\\nThe performances of the Turkish President in recent years were not without effect . Turkey has gradually left the Western community of values . The law is broken , continuously . It is threatened and sweared , against critics , against all those who can not be put on line.\\n\\n*Erdogan\\ 's arrogance*\\n\\nNow the country shall again get closer to Europe ? How come ? Is it not rather true that the unsettled enlightened elites of Turkey stand in the rain just like the proponents of a European Turkey in Europe ? Where is there left any discussion about the common values that go beyond lip service ? \\n\\nThe press which is close to the Turkish government has denounced such a community of values for a long time . They served the masses with conspiracy theories . The situatuion of the journalists and intellectuals of the country is sufficiently well known.\\n\\nThe enlightened Turks were and are left alone in their opposition to the rancor of their President and his ruling clique . This also contributes to the great loneliness , whose shadow falls on the representatives of a free and open Europe . It is high time to rid our hearts of this solitude . Because there is a common world to which we must fight , a world as it has been built after 1945 in Europe.\\n\\n*The devastating impact of the Saudis*\\n\\nBut the inhuman ideology of the Nazis is wearing a Muslim caftan today . There is nothing to interpret . Unfortunately , to many Europeans today this caftan appears to be closer , for power political or other reasons , than the stuff of which the dreams of the Enlightenment are sewn.\\n\\nWould one otherwise be photographed , shortly after the Paris massacre , with the Wahhabit king , representing ideologically and economically the hinterland of what is now the Caliph State . Not only that , the young people from the suburbs in Paris , in Brussels and elsewhere are poisoned by Salafis , Wahhabis and other Islamic sects .

It is common sense that smoking things is bad for your lungs , that is not what I\\ 'm denying . \\n\\n & gt ; Again , just for you : There are people in this world who only started smoking anything , because that\\ 's the way of consumption of cannabis of their choice . Some of those people die of smoking caused cancer .

I don\\'t understand this reasoning.\\n\\n & gt ; Let me say this again for you too : The point is not that cannabis is bad because you can die from it . You can probably die from pretty much literally anything in this universe in some way . The point is that defending \ '' You can\\'t die from cannabis\ '' is making parts of the the legalisation movement seem ridiculous . Because it\\ 's factually wrong ( for whatever indirect reasons , cannabis smoking caused cancer , fatal crash from driving under the influence ) and unimportant ( lethality alone isn\\'t a valid argument , you can die from driving a car ) . \\n\\nI think I clearly said : \\n\\n & gt ; No , their deaths are not directly attributable to cannabis , but to smoking burning stuff . You can vape without burning . You can eat weed brownies/cakes/whatever . There is no one forcing you to smoke a joint/blunt . Just to be clear , I\\ 'll say it again : Cannabis can not kill you . **It is the smoking that kills you . **\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything else , of course you can die if you crash your car after you drove high , or if you were too high to notice the stairs and fell down , but that still does not make cannabis kill you . It is because you were impaired due to the cannabis . If someone dies during a drunk driving accident , people don\\'t say he died due to alcoholic beverages , but he died while driving drunk .

For this year one of the better songs.\\n\\n\\nBut there\\ 's one thing that annoys me a bit in this song : \\n\\n & gt ; How \\'bout , we just go out for a drink .

Starting with the first five seconds , making you think this is going to be a upbeat song when suddenly *there\\ 's a piano* . \\nThat \ '' No.\ '' gets me every time . Then you get this Sammarinese Rebecca Black , with a voice that totally doesn\\'t fit that boy\\ 's voice.\\n The way she says \ '' Wa-ays\ '' makes me cringe and laugh at the same time . And the moment those shining smartphones appeared , I just lost it . Then their failed \ '' rap part\ '' ... \\n\\nThis whole song is like San Marino just pulled two kids from the street , and obligated them to sing in Eurovision . With lyrics that look like a four-year-old made them.\\n\\n & gt ; Just light up the candles . Let them shine on deep inside.\\n\\n & gt ; a chain of lights for you , and a chain of lights for me\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe we\u2019ll find out that many people feel the same \u2013 oh yeah\\n\\n & gt ; Together hand in hand , we will feel the love inside\\n\\n & gt ; If we all walk together we will feel the love inside\\n\\nAnd so on and so on ...

Would be a nice and accurate slogan for them at Eurovision . With 46 previous participations their best result is 6th.\\n\\nThis song is not going to change anything about that . \\nThe singer is standing really strange , like she wants to show her vagina ( espacially from [ 1:42 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xowMYNzYWbE & amp ; t=1m42 ) ) .\\nBut this rock ballad is doomed to fail and to stay in the semis , I cringed during the last refrain.\\n***\\n\\n08 Czech Republic : Marta Jandov\u00e1 & amp ; V\u00e1clav Noid B\u00e1rta - Hope Never Dies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=s31Ho7I64Os ) \\n\\nThis is the best song Czech Republic has ever sent to Eurovision . This song will guaranteed get their best result ever in Eurovision , \\nsince their best result right now is 18th in the Semi ( which isn\\'t possible this year ! ) . So congratulations ! \\n\\nBut about the song : It doesn\\'t really amuse me . This is a too mediocre , standard ballad.\\nAlso , they don\\'t really suit together for a duet .

STOP \\n\\n1:40 Phew , you almost ruined your song\\n\\nHe may not look like that , but he\\ 's just 16 years old . Yes , 16.\\n\\nThis is my favorite song this Semi-Final , this song saves this semi for me ( together with Sweden ) . This MUST be in the final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n10 Latvia : Aminata - Love Injected [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=fnVbR98J7Q4 ) \\n\\n*That beat is really stolen from Lean On* . Weird thing is , Lean On was released two weeks after this won Latvia\\ 's final\\nThe chorus is a Latvian combination of Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Katy Perry\\ 's Roar.\\n\\nThat beat gives a strange touch to this song , but it also removes the boredom in this ballad ( if you could called it a ballad ) \\n\\nProbably in the Final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n11 Azerbaijan : Elnur H\u00fcseynov - Hour of the Wolf [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kYsj1fFE1Xw ) \\n\\nA well-thought Eurovision song like only Azerbaijan and Sweden can . \\nFor me , this song is the border tonight between the songs that I like and I don\\'t like , nothing special.\\n\\nThis will reach the final for sure ( it\\ 's Azebaijan ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n12 Iceland : Mar\u00eda \u00d3lafs - Unbroken [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8pYueOpzswg ) \\n\\nAfter Iceland\\ 's Teletubbie band last year , they sent a song this year that I quite like . \\nI wouldn\\'t classify this as a ballad , but more as a medium fast pop song . I hope this will be in the Final , but I\\ 'm not sure if they will pass.\\n\\n***\\n\\n13 Sweden : M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w - Heroes [ link - with free tolk ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MaDob2RQldM ) \\n\\nLooking at the act alone , Sweden it by far the best . However there are accusations of plagiarism for the stickymen they use in the performance.\\n\\nAbout the song itself : Many people say this sounds like Lovers On the Sun , but I don\\'t think so . It\\ 's only a very small part that sounds like it.\\n\\nThis song is the favorite at the bookmakers , but I doubt if they were first if the act was less spectacular . But all in all , this song one of my personal favorites.\\n\\n***\\n\\n14 Switzerland : M\u00e9lanie Ren\u00e9 - Time to Shine [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ooDmr3Jtw5o ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n15 Cyprus : John Karayiannis - One Thing I Should Have Done [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=W39Qrusgp5E ) \\n\\nIf John Mayer sung this song , it would probably be a big hit .

I really don\\'t like those Duffy-sounding singers , but that\\ 's just my personal taste.\\nI like the rest of this song though , at least no ballad , but more upbeat .

In this \\'summary\\ ' , I have listed the songs in tonight\\ 's performance order , and added my own thoughts on the songs , being neutral.\\n\\nThe links next to the songs won\\'t spoil the performances of tonight ( no rehearsals and such ) , abut if available will go to a good-quality live performance ( mostly performances of national finals ) , but you don\\'t have to see them to understand me.\\n\\n\\n01 Moldova : Eduard Romanyuta - I Want Your Love [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=mz655avMYyo ) \\n\\nIf you watch Eurovision and see this as the first song , you will probably think \\'What the fuck is this show\\ ' , but don\\'t worry , this is one-of-a-kind.\\nWith this song Eurovision goes back 10 years in time . It reminds me a lot of [ Dirrty by Christina Aguilera ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4Rg3sAb8Id8 ) . \\nBut this song is different than all other entries , and maybe that\\ 's why I like it . I would be really surprised though if this will finish top 10 and get through the finals , many people dislike this one\\n\\n\\n02 Armenia : Genealogy - Face The Shadow [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=VVVvgD0-Mu0 ) \\n\\nThis is the first of many ballads you\\ 'll hear this Eurovision , and definitely not the best one . It\\ 's sung by a group of six singers made for Eurovision , who come from 5 different continents , and Armenia itself . I\\ 'm afraid however they won\\'t sing really good live.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what this song is about ( and you have lived under a rock the past ~~100~~ 101 years ) , it\\ 's about the Armenian Genocide , which happened in 1915.\\nIn my opinion , political things like the Armenian Genocide shouldn\\'t be discussed on Eurovision . It also surprises me that this song is allowed to enter Eurovision without any changes , while Georgia had to change a song called \\'We don\\'t wan na Put In\\ ' ( similar to Vladimir Putin\\n^ ( sidenote : This song was first called \\'Don\\'t Deny\\ ' , but they changed it voluntarily to prevent the connection with _denying_ the Genocide ) \\n\\n\\n03 Belgium : Lo\u00efc Nottet - Rythm Inside [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=J9B3a7A7tbk ) \\n\\nAfter one of my least favorites , we go to one of my favorites . This \ '' Lorde-y\ '' song ^ ( no not Lordi ) is pretty refreshing in Eurovision . The first couple of seconds will make you think you are listening to Royals , but after that it just sound like a very good song you could easily hear on a hit station . This will definitely go to the final.\\n\\n\\n04 Netherlands : Trijntje Oosterhuis - Walk Along [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JO1cqzPWrVI ) \\n [ For those who don\\'t know to pronounce that name , here\\ 's how she pronounces it herself ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KdApGEC7fmM & amp ; t=5s ) \\n\\nThis year The Netherlands has sent one of their more famous artists to Eurovision , with a song that hasn\\'t any climax or something . This song , written by 2013 participant Anouk , could be best described as \\'medium\\ ' . It\\ 's not going to end very high , but I think ( and hope ) it will go the finals . There was however a lot discussion about the dress she was about to wear ( looked like someone played on it with a scissor ) , and I hope she won\\'t wear that tonight.\\n\\n\\n05 Finland : Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t - Aina mun pit\u00e4\u00e4 [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ePhjs-3q068 ) \\n\\nI can assure you , there aren\\'t any worse songs than this one this year . This is the definition of awful . The best thing about this punk song is that it\\ 's the shortest song ever in Eurovision : only 90 seconds long , so if you want to do a toilet pause you got to be quick.\\nNote that this band was made before Eurovision , so they didn\\'t group them for Eurovision alone . However , they only reason that this song will get any points is because of the fact they are mentally disabled ( and maybe some Bloc-voting ) . But for me , this song is a 1/10 . Finland , if you want to win with something _special_ , you have to make the song at least a bit good.\\n\\n\\n06 Greece : Maria Elena Kyriakou - One last Breath [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=v7xKMnNcVdM ) \\n\\nEvery year , there are one , maybe two songs that try to repeat the success of the top songs the previous year . Greece is one of the examples this year . \\nThe main reason this got to Eurovision is because all the other participants on the national final sing good.\\nBut she had a good voice . A very good voice . Talking about voice , she won the Voice of Greece . The first two minutes of this ballad are a tad boring , but then the song suddenly becomes pretty good.\\nBut of all ballads , I think the only ones that can beat her are Spain and Albania . It\\ 's very likely that this will reach the final.\\n\\n\\n07 Estonia : Elina Born & amp ; Stig R\u00e4sta - Goodbye to yesterday [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JNXtXZM0QcA ) \\n\\nSpeaking about repeating successes , this one is the other example . The first thing that came into my mind was Calm After the Storm , as this also is a country-ish song , but this not a copy or something.\\nI like this song very much , it has hit potential and , more importantly , it has winning potential . For me , the best song of this Semi.\\n\\n\\n08 Fyr Maceodnia : Daniel Kajmakoski - Autumn Leaves [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=t8QCt6CJCHc ) \\n\\na pretty good song , sung like it\\ 's a fairytale . However , I\\ 'm very afraid that the live performance will ruin this song and thus result in this song not getting to the final\\n\\n\\n09 Serbia : Bojana Stamenov - Beauty Never Lies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qJrJVsOQwEc ) \\n\\nIf you would mix Conchita Wurst and Susan Boyle , you\\ 'd hey Serbia\\ 's act this year . Her voice is astonishing , but there\\ 's is one thing that will probably affect thist song\\nnegatively : she\\ 's dressed \ '' very old-fashioned\ '' . It really depends on the act for whether she will get to the finals or not\\n\\n\\n10 Hungary : Boggie - Wars for Nothing [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=WETXc5Z7Cng ) \\n\\nCan soneone wake me up ? Seriously , this song is perfect for letting someone fall asleep . I feel bad for you Australians who will have to see this at 4AM or something , trying to stay awake . Very boring ballad about useless conflicts , which isn\\'t a bad subject but a bit standard ( don\\'t get why they put Ebola on the background though ) \\nnothing special . Not the way a ballad should be IMO.\\n\\n\\n11 Belarus : Uzari & amp ; Maimuna - Time [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dVv_BmOqPWg ) \\n\\nThe beginning of the song strongly reminds me of Not Alone ( Armenia\\ 's song last year ) , but at least this song is more upbeat than all other songs this Semi.\\nBut overall , this song is very medium , and is one of those song that you would easily forget about . Don\\'t really know what to think about this one\\n\\n\\n12 Russia Polina Gagarina - A Million Voices [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jBVY7Glcd84 ) \\n\\nShe looks like a crossing from Kate Ryan and Ellie Goulding . \\'Hopeful\\ ' ballad about humanity , but to me it comes over a bit hypocritical , \\nescpecially with those kids in the clip . This is a song you would hear when having breakfast in a hotel in another country . Sorry Russia , but this is not my favorite.\\nBut because it\\ 's Russia , this will be in the final 100 % sure.\\n\\n\\n13 Denmark : Anti Social Media - The Way You Are [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RA-A_uvE1ss ) \\n\\nLike last year , Denmark sends a \\'Poppy\\ ' song . It sounds similar to something , but I don\\'t know what His voice isn\\'t the best of tonight , and I worry that he will miss some tones tonight.\\nNot my favorite.\\n\\n\\n14 Albania : Elhaida Dani - I\\ 'm Alive [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=lZJdWUmxxZw ) \\n\\nWow . Just wow . This song got me from the first to the last second . Just beautiful . Her voice , divine . A cheerful upbeat ballad . One of the best songs this year . This must end in the top 5 in the final . If we\\ 're listening to voice alone in this Semi , she and Greece\\ 's singer are the winners.\\n\\n\\n15 Romania : Voltaj - De la cap\u0103t [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Nw6sKQbwQOM ) \\n\\nWhat the fuck is this staging in their national final ^ ( ( disclaimer : I don\\'t know how Romania\\ 's performance of tonight will look\\\\ ) ) . The singer looks like a TV chef , or that person you would see in those telemarketing commercials . but then it changes to a rock song.\\nOne of the few song that is not in English , and unfortunately it doesn\\'t do this song any good .

Ahrily,europe,"& gt ; During this period [ Islamic Golden Age ] , the Muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations that had been conquered . Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from Greek , Persian , Indian , Chinese , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations into Arabic and Persian , and later in turn translated into Turkish , Hebrew , and Latin . \\n\\n & gt ; With a new and easier writing system , and the introduction of paper , information was democratized to the extent that , for probably the first time in history , it became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books . [ 38 ] The use of paper spread from China into Muslim regions in the eighth century , arriving in Al-Andalus on the Iberian peninsula , present-day Spain in the 10th century . It was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries . [ 39 ] It was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . [ 40 ] \\n\\n & gt ; Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds . Ibn Sina and other philosophers such as al-Kindi and al-Farabi combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam .

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Good to see that Asscher his proposals are getting some attention and that Corbyn responded in a positive way .

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Interesting article because it refutes the notion that the terror attacks are retaliation to the ongoing attacks against ISIL . It has more to do with attacking the European model for co-existence and trying to elicit a response which will help their recruitment efforts . The part about ISIL its frustration with being unable to hit Germany for a long period also says a lot about the whole strategizing mentality that are behind the attacks . It ends with an ominous message saying that as long as Raqqa stands Europe will continue to suffer from attacks like these .,Germanic,Dutch

Amanoo,europe,"The UK has some policies , cultural aspects or traditions that are much more similar to American culture than the culture of most other European countries . For example , the UK employs a voting system based on First Past The Post . Ever seen people complain about UK politics being manipulable and all of that ? Things like gerrymandering ? That just FPTP at work . It\\ 's a system that\\ 's completely alien to most other non-English speaking countries , which often use parliamentary systems based on things such as Mixed Member Proportional Representation . FPTP is known by some for being highly manipulable , unrepresentative and for its tendency to degrade into a bipartisan system ( it hasn\\'t really done so in the UK yet , although the UK does have two big parties , one of which usually holds the majority ) . For detailed info , CGP Grey has a series of videos that explains things in a simple but very good manner . He\\ 's also been very vocal about it in his Hello Internet podcast ( can\\'t remember which episodes though ) . [ Dooblydoo ] ( http : //www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/ ) . \\n\\nAnother example would be the GCHQ , which quire a few would regard as barely more than the lackey of the NSA . Not exactly friendly to things like personal freedom or privacy ( which I\\ 'd argue is fundamental to freedom ) . People often forget that other countries\\ ' organisations , such as the AIVD , aren\\'t that great either . \\n\\nThe UK is also more likely to come up with proposals for draconian policies than the rest Europe . I can\\'t remember any specific policies , though , although I know there are some . Every so often , something pops up again . I\\ 'm willing to bet that there\\ 's something similar to SOPA or PIPA that , if it hasn\\'t been implemented , was at least proposed . I wish I had remembered more specific examples , though . I just don\\'t have the type of memory that holds on to that kind of specific information . \\n\\nI\\ 'd argue that English speakers also have a strong tendency to beat around the bush or to sugar-coat things . I might be a bit biased though , as I\\ 'm Dutch . My own culture has a tendency to just speak their minds . We have a blunt honesty that\\ 's often meant to be either helpful or efficient ( or possibly both ) . For example , if you were to try to speak Dutch , and told us that you sucked at it , you\\ 'd be fairly likely to hear \ '' yes , you really do suck\ '' . But it\\ 's often followed by tips to help you get better . We also don\\'t like too much chitter chatter or insincerity . A \ '' how are you\ '' by a supermarket worker is borderline offensive to us , as it\\ 's not a sincere question and may even be interpreted as prying into someone else\\ 's life .",Germanic,Dutch

The content of that account is rather inciting , and it\\ 's focused only on that type of content.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; Note that the police did not arrest him or press charges , they did what they do when they see someone in public shouting that stuff : go talk to the guy and remind him that he\\ 's close to crossing to line of inciting violence .

Amanoo,europe,"I have to wonder how much different Dutch humour is . Apparently , there were orange Nazi hats at a football match between Germany and the Netherlands once , and I can definitely remember a few stand-up comedians being rather racist or sexist . Not to mention just jokes that people just tell each other . I have a somewhat too well integrated Chinese friend who likes to ask very loudly \ '' is it because I\\ 'm black ? \ '' , which is not something I\\ 'd recommend doing if there are people of African descent nearby . And also jokes like \ '' what do you call a gay Muslim ? An islamietje\ '' ( islamiet translates to islamite , mietje means whimp in dutch ) . And of course we have a lot of other jokes about Chinese and other groups . Also about Dutch regions . People from Groningen , for example , are generally depicted as slow-witted farmers . The Groningse bank robbery sketch is particularly famous . Unfortunately I couldn\\'t find a version with subtitles ( or one that isn\\'t potato quality ) , but [ here ] ( https : //youtu.be/g6pjTxD8SiA ) is the sketch .

Amanoo,europe,"Yeah , you have the most educated people , but that\\ 's not because your education system is any good , buy just because any sizeable country that\\ 's at least somewhat developed will have a few highly educated people . Hell , our education system can barely be described as \ '' adequate\ '' , if you ask me , and we\\ 're supposed to be among the world top 10 education systems . You don\\'t even have something I could call an education system , just a few quality universities that only a lucky few get to attend . Just a small fraction of the population , which is only a lot in absolute numbers because we\\ 're talking about one of the largest populations on the planet . \\n\\nAnything meaningful the US has is because the US has a large population . You have a big army , but there\\ 's also a large population to draw soldiers from . You have a lot of big corporations , because you have a lot of people who could potentially start a successful company . You have a lot of money because A ) there is a small percentage of people who hold most of it ( which is still a relatively large amount of people ) and a lot of average Joes , each with a few bucks to spend .

Amazingamazone,europe,The irony is that Roma and Sinti are the original Aryans as in descending from tribes originating North of India .

Those blonde and blue eyes traits are inherent in some bloodlines of the travelling people although most have olive skin and brown hair.\\n\\nThese real Aryans were of course not a good example to the race theories of Hitler and Mussolini so they had to be exterminated too . Relatively there were even fewer survivors after WWII than Jews.\\n\\nMy point is that those fair traits are more common than you think . This is just a continuance of the prejudices and even harassment and petsecution that the Sinti and Roma have undergone through the ages . Just accept that they just do some things other than us and especially our red tape that got them persecuted no less than a century ago.\\n\\nMost important though : do you even realize how traumatic it is for a child to be taken away from their family ?

But that\\ 's also similar to what you described in Basque Country as well . \\n\\nAnyway despite the extra sounds , Catalan bilingualism has to be more manageable than Euskara , considering it\\ 's probably the closest related language to Spanish at the end of the day , and Euskara is well Euskara - cool language though especially the way some of the text looks is just so unique and indeed ancient looking , and actually I also find Catalan to be the prettiest of any language when written , so I like both for the record ( I hope all you \ '' Andorrans\ '' are reading this ; ) ) \\n\\nBack on topic , I think maybe like you said even to some of the most English basque speakers , they still have to use Spanish with frequency ( perhaps even in the countryside ) whereas I\\ 'm pretty sure in Lleida it\\ 's not too hard to get away with almost never speaking the language ?

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Despite the total ripoff of my previous thread , I\\ 'll answer for shits and giggles . \\n\\nHmm , I think the UK has a lot of distinct accents , and usually I can pick out Scottish , Welsh actually throws me off because there\\ 's a lot of variance in their accent , some have an accent that is distinct , others sound quite English imho , North-South distinction usually isn\\'t too difficult . I can definitely recognize the \ '' truest\ '' ( modern ) London accent , it\\ 's one that I\\ 've seen most commonly transcend ethnicity/race ( think it might be West London ) as lots of mixed Carribean , White English and South Asian people are seem to display it.\\n\\nIn the US , there\\ 's actually a lot of subtle differencres , even to an extent in certain Southern accents ( and that\\ 's not even including Louisiana which despite also having many general Southern accent speakers , also has some of the most atypical accents in the country in Cajun country and New Orleans area . \\n\\nAlso the differences between somebody in Colorado , Ohio , Maryland , Washington , Arizona , Nevada , Nor-cal - all of these are accents which I think most of us Americans would consider to be neutral ( notice I left out Socal , which while sounding somewhat neutral tends to be a bit ditzy/surfer esque with some vocal-fry ) , but all have subtle nuances that make them accents within themselves . I can recognize the difference between the major regional accents no problem though . \\n\\nI think the major regional US accents can be divided into a few families though : \\n\\n* Southern ( Texan , Cajun , Creole , Southern-ebonics , Appalachian , Gulf Coast and Atlantic coast being the main groups but some of these are only subtly distinct to the untrained ear ) ; \\n\\n* Great Lake States ( Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan being the most distinct sub-accents ) .\\n\\n* Northeast ( New York - further divided into Brooklyn , Long Island , there\\ 's more sub-accents but those are arguably the most distinct ) ; New Jersey basically like NY accent but with everything bad about it amplified ; Boston ) \\n\\n* General ( neutral but not a geographical but linguistic area , States like the generally neutral accent ones mentioned above ) Sub-category SoCal accent - because of vocal fry .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Hmm gon na have to at least partially disagree with that . \\n\\nFirst of all , in Spain the second highest level ( after federal/central ) of governance/administrative regions is an \ '' Autonomous Community\ '' , that\\ 's just the nomenclature they use , just like we say States , Canada say provinces , Italy says Regions , Germany also says state . \\n\\nAndalusia for example , is also an \ '' autonomous community\ '' meaning that it is on the same level of governance as Catalonia . It\\ 's like comparing California to New York . \\n\\nCatalan is a nationality in the sense that they\\ 've made great strides in more global recognition of their language , identity , culture , etc . but it still like Andalusia IS an AC ( and still has yet to attain independence ) , furthermore in a more purely physical geographical ( not geopolitical ) sense they both can be considered \ '' regions\ '' of Spain.\\n\\nAnyway , if you\\ 're being purely political in your definition , from an IR standpoint neither Scotland or Catalonia are true sovereign nation-states , so again that calls that into question how legit your label of nation is based on your very arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a nation or community , but thanks for telling us twice your condescending tone was duly noted . \\n\\nCase in point , both Scotland & amp ; Catalonia the the second-highest tier of administrative REGIONS in their respective countries ( sovereign nation-states ) .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Truth is , as an American to my ears only the top tier of speakers truly develop a distinctive marked accent in either direction . I think since general American tends to be more \ '' neutral\ '' ( re : unmarked ) it\\ 's also harder to find late learners that can imitate the accent as well , I\\ 've met many more second-language speakers that have mastered UK accents than US ( obviously not counting those that were either born , or lived in either country for 5+ years ) . Anyway , in spite of this as stated because of the prominence of US-English , the general European ( through the own languages typical accent ) tends to indeed err more on the side of US - spoken , but often writing more - British , with word-choice/slang being mixed between the two I\\ 'd say . \\n\\nBut for example I\\ 've had many Brits come to me and say Dutchies speaking English sound just like Americans , and to that I respond sure they pronounce aloud in a more US fashion , but if you\\ 're implying that they could almost fool you as a US English ( which some are ) then you must be completely tone-deaf because Dutchies definitely have their own distinct accent when speaking English !",Germanic,Dutch

This attitude tends to seep even into the \ '' public\ '' sector ( i.e . gov offices/services/admin . ) , but let so than in the dining industry for example . Immigration officials are mostly knowledgeable , friendly , helpful and competent . A big key to getting the most out of Dutch service in any sector is to know **what** questions to ask , to figure out your parameters in a given interaction . They\\ 'll often be quiet until you ask the right question , and then all the sudden they\\ 're a fountain of information ... \\n\\nOther Dutch businesses , services , hotlines , ministries aside from the IND ( immigration ) tend to be a bit tricky if you don\\'t know Dutch . Despite the \ '' Amsterdam Attitude\ '' - all service-industry employees in the city speaking English by default ( even to other Dutchies often ) and often refusing to switch back to Dutch if your accent and general proficiency are not on point . Anyway despite that , when you have to call these government services , or more day-to-day industries ( health-care providers for example ) they\\ 're much less willing to speak to you in English and more or less expect you to speak Dutch , very interesting phenomenom . Also this occurs even in Amsterdam service industry workplaces if **you\\'re** the one working and thus *serving* the Dutch people , they\\ 're attitude 180s and they also expect you to engage with them in Dutch , makes sense but also weird contradictory attitude on the whole ...",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Well you wording and articulation when saying it was \ '' neither of our language\ '' was not properly conveyed , so maybe that\\ 's your English showing its fourth place status in your linguistic arsenal.\\n\\nNonetheless , I measure anecdotally by most admitting on this thread that despite British English being taught in school , most seemed to indicate they erred more on the US side of things . Also the prominence of US terminology over British , ( ATM vs. Cash Point for example ) , and also hearing reactions from Europeans IRL that mostly mirror the responses on this thread concerning the increasing prominence of US English.\\n\\nDespite whatever preconceived notions you I\\ 'm not some typical ignorant , asshole , exceptionalist American , there\\ 's a reason I\\ 've lived in Europe for quite sometime ... oh English is the first language I learned but the first of five so ... .",Germanic,Dutch

I do still maintain that you did exemplify quite well this phenomena of Euros to deflect a little bit in these situations , but I don\\'t think it was any sort of intentional malice.\\n\\nI just get annoyed , that Europeans ( and in particular Dutch ) do seem to think that when they\\ 're compared to Americans they\\ 're exempt from this label of racist because they didn\\'t have slavery ( totally not true , because of Suriname ) and the current shitshow that is our law enforcement problem in the US.\\n\\nI would like to take my time to address that point now though , as it it seems our policing problem is the new scapegoat to point and cry racism over at the US ( I guess the Europeans finally accepted that slavery was over a century ago , and that they also had a large part in propping up the Transatlantic trade in the first place ) , anyway the police problem in the US is first and foremost just that , a **police** problem , let me asterisk the fuck out of this statement by saying I\\ 'm not downplaying the disadvantage minorities are at , especially when dealing with LEOs , nonetheless the police problem in the US stems ultimately from a pervasive attitude of brutality , excessive use of force , ego-tripping , control-freaks and lack of instilled deescalation techniques - that is to say ultimately a attitude problem pervading police forces across the country . Whites ( not nearly as often ) have also been subjected to some pretty gross displays of police brutality in the US - ex : 20 year drug dealer gets caught in undercover buy as cops rush to his parked car to arrest him he pull out and tries to drive off to which the officer sticks his gun in the window and shoots the kid point-blank killing him , citing to the recording camera bystander that he feared for his safety of being run over ( car was moving from 0 velocity to a reversal speed so not very fast at all ) . Case in point the police issue is much bigger than race , though the two have obviously become inextricably linked at this point , it doesn\\'t mean that our Police Problem is exclusively a race problem just to **reiterate** , so it shouldn\\'t always be pointed to as such , as it is something which does affect whites as well.\\n\\nI will say that I do respect Dutch cops for the most part ( probably the least intimidating but still competent police I\\ 've seen out of any country I\\ 've been to ) , and think they\\ 're much more competent than their American counterparts , and there is a reason I\\ 'm living in this country after all ( and not in the US ) .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Sorry the original post ( before edit ) made \ '' these Americans\ '' ( and therefore us as a whole ) seem really arrogant , as if they talking in absolutes of being everybody\\ 's favorite nationality in the country they reside , that\\ 's some Trump-esque bullshit talk , and simply not an accurate representation of our mentality ( nor are a lot of the other painfully stupid US op\\ 's that show up on this subreddit , but that\\ 's a whole other thing ) .\\n\\nI digress , as an American who\\ 's lived in four European countries I\\ 'll chime in.\\n\\nOnly in Germany and Italy were Americans a common \ '' immigrant/expat\ '' group and that\\ 's because I lived in towns with active US military bases . That said a lot of opinions were formed around typical brash young American GI\\ 's ( who are basically our one demographic on par with # BritsAbroad , as far as acting like obnoxious assholes goes ) which wasn\\'t a very favorable view . In addition the fact that they were employed by these bases that were \ '' intrusions on national sovereignty\ '' in the eyes of many , than you get a double-down effect by some local hardliners as far as anti-US sentiment goes ( though never had a really bad experience in Italy upon revealing my origins even from MENA and sub-Saharan immigrants , the latter in fact tended to prefer Americans to Italians seeing them as more direct , less \ '' truly racist\ '' i.e . more accustomed to black people ) .\\n\\nThat said there are many civilian support workers , contractors , senior officers and family members that did a better job and establishing a favorable image , and those in these groups especially civilian \ '' GS\ '' ( government service ) and contractors doing the best to often learn the language and integrate . \\n\\nActive Duty soldiers typically did much shorter tours , were much busier and were in a much more Anglo-centric work culture , thus rarely learned the language at all . \\n\\nI\\ 'd say this applies to the towns I lived in , in both DE & amp ; IT . As far as which local populace held a more favorable opinion of Americans , I\\ 'd say probably the Italians , or they maybe see American culture as a bit more \ '' cool\ '' than the Germans ( though German girls I maintain are probably the easiest for yanks to have success with ) .\\n\\nIn the Netherlands and Spain , I lived in Barcelona and Amsterdam ( currently ) which were bigger cities with less direct American influence , though there was a sizeable contingent of Americans studying abroad in both cities as well as tourists.\\n\\nI think there\\ 's more established American expats in Amsterdam than in Barcelona , or that\\ 's the feel I get anyway . The truly established American expats , I do think for the most part integrate pretty well . Out of all Anglo-nationalities , I think they\\ 're the most likely to learn Dutch , because we have to come the furthest and jump through the most hoops to get legitimate residency ( as opposed to say Brits , for the meantime ) so it seems more logical for us to just put in the extra effort to learn the language , since we already have to make so many other sacrifices to come here anyway.\\n\\nAlso my experience with the IND ( dutch immigration bureau ) and \ '' *Gemeente*\ '' ( local municipal government ) in getting my partnership and subsequent related visa has been very hands-off . Compared to the research I did on the strictness of both agencies during the process , I was hardly prodded for anything . Like the Gemeente didn\\'t investigate the history or legitimacy of our partnership ( which I heard was commonplace especially for Dutch nationals trying to spouse non-westerners ) . Even in situations where my potential overstay should have been verified they didn\\'t and seemed to just back off and take my word for it every time they saw my US passport . Was very weird , and clearly a bit \\'racist\\ ' ( maybe that\\ 's not the right word , some for of prejudice but suffice to say I doubt a Moroccan-national in those situations would have been afforded the same oversights or lack thereof rather ... ) .\\n\\nEdit : in Spain , once or twice I had someone express their discontent with my country when revealing my nationality , but that was in my eyes/experience , an anomaly and Spanish people really opened up , were generous and thought it was really cool that I came from the US and spoke Iberian Spanish ( and a little bit of Catalan to boot ) . Maybe the Italians are the favorite immigrant group in Barca actually , they\\ 're pretty prominent and adapt well with both local languages ( Catalan and Spanish ) since Italian is very similar to both languages .",Germanic,Dutch

Not sure of the policy businesses take here , but I\\ 'm 27 usually get guessed as a bit younger ( if I shave my beard I look 18 ) , and rarely get carded , but still do sometimes only at supermarkets though never bars . Sometimes at events or clubs if you look young IDs I can imagine will be checked , but I\\ 've been 24 years and up with a beard most of the time here so again , I seem to rarely be bothered . Not sure of the official stance of public consumption of alcohol.\\n\\nTobacco : I believe it\\ 's also 18 , I don\\'t smoke tobacco at all ( even for joints ) so not sure exactly on age and how strictly it\\ 's enforced . I doubt if cops see teens smoking after the fact that they care ( even in the US , cops don\\'t care typically ) . Probably for teens though ID checks are enforced . Lots of Dutch smoke , and view it as relatively normal . Weird counter-intuitive trend I\\ 've noticed oddly enough , seems like Dutch women smoke more than the men , but that\\ 's merely my anecdotal observation , I could statistically be entirely wrong ... \\n\\nCannabis - 18 to purchase unregulated and tolerated weed from coffeeshops . Though at least municipally here in Mokum , rule on the books says something about discretion of Gemeente and establishment to enforce a 21 year age minimum for entry and access to \ '' rookruimtes\ '' ( smoking-rooms ) though again rarely enforced and some of these rookruimtes are also found in bars . Public consumption can be done in coffeeshops and 420-friendly bars ( mostly an Amsterdam thing only ) , also in Amsterdam only more or less public consumption ( at least of joints and vapes ) is usually tolerated . Also coffeeshops are the place where ID checks are most strictly implemented , I imagine because they draw the most scrutiny of the law , so they try to tread carefully . Dutch themselves aren\\'t big smokers on average , and they don\\'t have nearly as strong of a \ '' stoner-culture\ '' as Americans ( or even other EU countries like the UK , Italy , Spain or Germany for that matter ) , more popular with expats , immigrants and tourists to be honest . The progression of this toleration is at a bit of a standstill , with increasing crackdown on grow gear and growing ( small-time or commercial ) at the same time with proposed legislation of actual regulation ( in-line with the US\\ 's current approach in the legal-states ) .

I lived in Italy from the ages of 13-16 so that provides some perspective ( mind you this is also circa 2003-2006 in the Veneto region ) .\\n\\nTobacco - not enforced at all . Age of purchase officially was 16 , but by 14 and looking maybe 12 in appearances I was able to purchase cigarettes no problem . Nevermind the ID-checkless vending machines the \ '' tabaccherie\ '' put out front after closing hours every night ( this has since changed you need an Italian ID to swipe ) . Maybe Italians smoke more than the Dutch , I think so , it\\ 's viewed as quite normal.\\n \\nAlcohol - also very rarely enforced at either bars , I believe wine and beer may have been like 16 y.o.a . and liquor was 18 . However my mischievous 8 year old brother had no problem buying beer simply so he and his friends could break the bottles rather than drink it ( dumb I know ) .\\n\\nCannabis - many smoke , obviously very illegal but not the worst , small amounts may only be confiscated if you get lucky . Was fortunate enough to never find out the full extent of the law . Though I have friends that have been screwed , and ultimately dicked around with driving rights and license suspensions if they didn\\'t comply with a 4 year long urinalysis scheme . In any matter , not exceptionally difficult to find , most bigger towns ( or cities ) have certain areas where street dealers will congregate ( often Sub-Saharan or Moroccan immigrants ) , for higher quality knowing Italians and speaking the language is usually necessary . The street dealing culture and prominence puts Italy ahead of countries like Germany where ( Berlin being an exception ) such a thing doesn\\'t really exist . \\n\\n\\n**US**\\n\\nTobacco : strictly enforced , federally 18 years of age , though some states or counties enforce higher ages of purchase all the way up to 21 years . ID checks , often with scanning machines to detect fakes , checking for holograms etc . However once purchased it is rarely prosecuted , only bored asshole cops with nothing better to do would ever dream of busting minors for tobacco possession/consumption , and cops often ignore teen smokers ( this has shown to be true from rural Louisiana to Brooklyn , NYC in my experience ) . In the South chew and dip ( smokeless oral tobacco , disgusting stuff ) are popular and also in some other rural areas . Smoking has been and is on a rapid decline , many university campuses are now smoke free for example and less and less young people are smoking . In Western cannabis-friendly states like California , tobacco is perceived with much more stigma than cannabis is by young people ( this is arguably the attitude for even most young people country-wide ) . \\n\\nAlcohol - 21 federally and in every state ( never older or younger anywhere else AFAIK ) the most strictly enforced on every front , bars , stores etc . I have on occasion found bars ( in say New Orleans ) or convenience stores ( in say Brooklyn ) but these are the hidden gems , unicorns and anomalies rather than even remotely commonplace . ID checks . Can be prosecuted for public consumption ( as a legal adult over 21 ) , or being intoxicated underage depending on circumstances . Definitely can get cited for MIP ( Minor in Possession ) . So overall much more strictly controlled than tobacco . \\n\\nCannabis : in some states highly illegal . In many medical , in which some of these the medical system is a farce and effectively a recreational loophole ( for example Montana , Michigan and others operate this way ) . And yet in others fully legal and regulated - Washington ( state ) , Oregon , California , Nevada , Colorado , Massachusetts , Maine , Washington DC , and Alaska . Minimum age for either medical or recreational might be 18 in some states or counties but I believe in most it\\ 's 21 , and ID checks are quite strictly enforced . Seems to be on the rise , and becoming increasingly accepted . The quality and advancement of the industry are bar non the best in the world , and only rivaled by Canada really .",Germanic,Dutch

The only reason cats kill more wild animals than us is because we\\ 've figured out how to domesticate animals before we kill them . 9 billion chickens are killed each year in the US alone . By human beings , not by cats . There are about 74 million cats in the US , which means to compete with humans , the average american cat would have to kill a new chicken every three days . And that\\ 's just chickens ! We kill turkeys , sheep , goats , cattle and pigs en masse as well . It\\ 's hard to visualize how much we kill animals because any wild animals we like to kill are extinct or close to extinction . \\n\\nTake the [ passenger pigeon . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon ) They used to travel in flocks so large they would blacken the sky . Competitions could consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock . The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition . Can you imagine a cat killing 30 000 birds even in its lifetime ? \\n\\nNot to mention the animals we kill by accident . Every day critters are mauled by cars on highways or combines on farms . Over 100 000 people were killed in Hiroshima . How many cats and dogs ? How many mice and cockroaches ? More than a cat could kill.\\n\\nToday domestic and wild cats perhaps kill more _wild animals_ than humans , but make no mistake - that is merely because we\\ 've changed the status of the animals we usually kill away from \ '' wild\ '' - not because of our capacity for murder is lower . Hell , we easily outkill them in wild animals too if we count whatever we haul up from the ocean . The ocean , which for most of humanity\\ 's existence has been seen as a limitless supply of food is being sucked dry . We are killing the creatures there so fast that they can\\'t keep up , and it\\ 's the goddamn ocean . \\n\\nEDIT : I used the US as an example because it\\ 's more relatable for most of reddit , and the numbers are easily accessible . I see now that I am in /r/europe and that\\ 's kind of weird , but I\\ 'm sure the numbers work either way.\\n\\nDOUBLE EDIT : Cats aren\\'t necessarily better than us at killing rats and snakes , we just value their time and lives less than our own .

Aqwis,europe,"& gt ; because today\\ 's universities have become too easy thanks in part to the Bologna program\\n\\nDo you have any evidence that this is not pulled straight out of your ass ? I doubt it . Exams dating back to the 80s , long before the Bologna reform , are available on the Internet for the courses I take as part of my degree . The level of difficulty for those courses are about the same now as it was in the 80s.\\n\\n & gt ; A college degree doesn\\'t guarantee you an office job\\n\\nTwo points : In the countries that have gone through the economic crisis most unscathed , i.e . *not* Spain , Portugal , your own Hungary , etc. , degrees in traditionally \ '' safe\ '' fields like engineering and medicine still pretty much guarantee you a job . A degree in Media Science or whatever does obviously not guarantee you a relevant job , but this is *not* a new development . It has always been that way .",Germanic,Norwegian
