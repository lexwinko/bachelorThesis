This is to reduce the democratic deficit which has plagued the EU for decades.\\n\\nThe EU is a great idea in my opinion . It has managed to keep the continent , relatively , at peace .

There is too wide of a range in socio-economic policies in EU states for there to be a single \ '' federal\ '' system to keep everything in check like in the US.\\n\\nOpen borders are a result of the Schengen Agreement which is independent of the EU .

That removes the Hungarian workforce , which in turn involuntarily sabotages the country\\ 's welfare system . Hungary is by no means wealthy , but its welfare system ( notably health care ) is flawless . But that\\ 's because there\\ 's a 27 % VAT ( highest in the EU , I think ) and workers pay a lot of taxes on income . Hungary already has a 35 % retired population , and each worker leaving hurts the system more . We don\\'t reproduce like rabbits so it\\ 's difficult to look past 300,000 workers leaving in 10 years when trying to care for the retired population.\\n\\nI finished my education last year and never thought of leaving , because I know there are jobs when people are willing to start with much lower than what they expected . I heard it all : family issues , monetary issues , security issues . I\\ 'm no exception to those , but I knew that my leaving would hurt the pensioners ( who worked their whole lives to earn the help they may lose someday ) as well as the next generation .

However , one of the habits the US has is to stick around after the invasion to make sure the procedure was worth its time , which is a fair demand.\\n\\nSince the War , however , the US has been locked into its self-created role of World Police . Ukraine is a member of the Partnership for Peace program of NATO . The program itself is more symbolic than practical - let alone binding - but it shows that NATO member states ( notably the US ) began placing interest in the given state . Thus , while NATO is officially merely a mutual defense pact , becoming a partner of it has many more effects in the long run . Thus , while a full-scale invasion wouldn\\'t be justified in terms of NATO use , the US may just judge the situation as it did 60 years ago : I either help them now , or will have to invade them in ten years because they\\ 'll be overrun.\\n\\nThe love-hate analogy is partially true , but most Europeans subconsciously HAVE to be happy about NATO membership because , if they weren\\'t , nothing would keep them from being next on Russia\\ 's hitlist . It\\ 's very easy to complain about the US when it does something immoral like Iraq or Afghanistan .

It worked to a certain degree ; while the EC still watches everything the Hungarian government does , it allows it a tiny bit more breathing space.\\n\\n-In Hungary the young and right-wing people are more euro-skeptic than left-wingers and older people . This can be attributed to Jobbik , a party who wants absolute Hungarian sovereignty , thinking a tiny country can survive alone in this world just fine . I wouldn\\'t say that there\\ 's ill will behind it ; they\\ 're just stupid.\\n\\n-Most of the euro-skeptics don\\'t want to leave the EU ; they just want the EU to not badger Hungary when it comes to Hungarian domestic affairs . Hungarian MEPs tend to keep to themselves when it comes to the discussing of other nations , and so they want the same treatment from others . Then again , the EP isn\\'t required to fuck off just because most of the Hungarian MEPs run on this honor code.\\n\\nThe point is , while things between the EU ( represented by the EC in most cases ) and Hungary were definitely blown out of proportion with this government , there is definitely truth to the fact that many things the EC chased in Hungary , it didn\\'t care about in other countries . This is what pissed most euro-skeptics off for good .",Uralic,Hungarian

So yes , it\\ 's primitive . It\\ 's primitive , but fitting.\\n\\n & gt ; Look after the election of to how many people actually voted for them and rethink my \ '' rape\ '' metaphor.\\n\\nOkay , I\\ 'm going to address this now so that people whining about the next election will shut up and vote against Fidesz if they want them out of power . Believe it or not , Fidesz is still the most popular party in the country . Month after month , year after year since 2010 , none of the other parties come remotely close to Fidesz in polls , regardless which source is used ( Median , Szazadveg , Nezopont , Ipsos etc ) . To my knowledge , the leftist Unity coalition is launching candidates in every single one of the individual voting district . This means that they can achieve victory by plurality in 106 out of the 106 districts . Jobbik is also launching candidates in every district . I\\ 'm not sure about LMP . The point is that , if the people will it , then Fidesz will be voted out of power . You can\\'t just claim that an election is rigged just because the party you don\\'t like is ( relatively speaking ) the most popular . I hate Fidesz , but the argument saying that the elections will be rigged is ridiculous . \\n\\nFinally , \\n\\n & gt ; Opposers of the goverment will be accused of lack of patriotism and silenced\\n\\nIs this a serious statement ? Not a single day goes by without 50-100 people gathering somewhere in Budapest to protest something the government is doing . About once a month , the entire leftist coalition sponsors a protest with a few thousand people ( ~20,000 was the largest one to my knowledge ) . Leftist papers inside and outside the country are hammering the government . None of the leftist activist or politicians have been imprisoned ( to the despair of many Hungarians ) . \\n\\nYes , Fidesz is full of incompetent fools , but they are a democratically elected government who can be democratically disposed of this year , should the people will it . And if they aren\\'t , then stop being a sore loser and acknowledge that still more people prefer Fidesz than any other party .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,europe,"An efficient military MUST have a strict system of hierarchy . The EU was founded on voluntary ideas , far from establishing a common military . The closest it has is the Common Foreign/Security Policy and a handful of donated battlegroups ( a few hundred or thousand soldiers in each ) . However , nothing in the treaty authorizes either the EP or EC in establishing and maintaining a common military OR declaring war/making peace . \\n\\nI my opinion , this is because there is still a great deal of animosity between several member states , notably in the eastern half of the EU . How would the EU set up guidelines for when conflict ( hopefully never will be a case , but still ) arises between EU member states ? Member states joined voluntarily , but up til today , there was no clause in their joining saying they will be invaded by an EU contingent if they start a conflict with another state . The problem would be that who could determine which side has the moral right in the conflict ? \\n\\nAlso , almost all EU states are in NATO . As EU member states - with the exception of the UK - have shown over the past twenty years , they are still disproportionately reliant on the US as far as military \ '' field trips\ '' are concerned . This is a problem the EU has had since its inception : to be able to use military force , the Union would have to have the courage of adapting aggressive foreign policies when needed . The US is the best example for this : the US does not give a rat\\ 's ass who\\ 's going to give it the death stare for invading another country if it feels it has to be done to protect its interests . Now , regardless of the moral argument surrounding that , the US can order hundreds of thousands of soldiers to any point of the world because it is efficient . EU member states often have different positions on foreign policy issues . Thus , if a conflict arises in non-EU territory , some states may be much more reluctant to \ '' go in\ '' than others . Look at the NATO part of ISAF in AFghanistan : 34,000 American troops , and the next is the UK with 5,000 . It goes much further down after that . NATO is still almost all-US effort . Therefore , if the EU is to establish a united military , it has to engrave the idea of potential mass casualties to a state\\ 's military force into each member state\\ 's brain . That\\ 's a burden which has been carried by the US since the Second World War , but will have to be re-assumed by the EU states .

Aylomein,europe,im not sure you put much thought into that \ '' false dilemma\ '' of yours .,Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"oh dont worry , they know what they are doing , saying this tax would give policemen a raise ... just as if he wants to make police and people collide ... they obviously asked MANY people before about what they think in this topic.\\n\\nso my conclusion is , this whole idiot idea is just to make people forget that USA banned several high ranked officials from entering the country due to heavy corruptional cases . all officials were close to the current government leading party ( Fidesz , Orb\u00e1n ) . \\n\\nwhat will happen is they will keep on saying stupid shit about internet and taxing and in a month they obviously will backpedal from it so meanwhile people forget this USA incident while fighting with police ... because internet tax pisses off EVERYONE ... . except police since they get the raise from it.. what a coincidence .",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see you are from Scotland , of course you can decide if it is good for you or not by voting , but what he said is definitely only manipulation , and who do you think will be the leading politician in new scotland after the Yes campaign ? but let me highlight it : \\n\\n0-20 is pure demagogue , UK has ways and rules to deal with those , hundreds/thousands of well educated people made those rules , and you can change them WITHIN the UK system , you have political power , you can send in proposals ( sorry im not English speaker so i don\\'t know specific words , and maybe it is not the correct word here ) which the government will change if it is for the better . he is talking about weapons , but you need weapons to protect yourself . he is talking about poor and disabled which is only brought up to convince people through emotions . what can he do better in scotland what UK can\\'t do about the poor ? nobody in the world in 5000 years had a perfect plan to eliminate the problem with poors/disabled ( \ '' eliminate\ '' as making them not poor , not \ '' killing\ '' them ) . he is promising more money by eliminating taxes , or giving more to welfare . of course everyone can promise you that , but money isn\\'T produced on trees , he should be talking about from where he would take the money away so he could give to the poor and disabled . but he just talks about poor and disabled.\\n\\n0:45 he says again demagogue , logical fallacies . saying opponents say \ '' abundant oil is a curse instead of an asset.\ '' ... nobody in the world would say something like that , it is an obvious lie and manipulation . i dont have to be scottish to know the epic lie he is making.\\n\\n1:10 as soon as the guy is talking about concrete proof , evidence , about his published paper being shit , he keeps smiling and making movements like a shrug , interrupting him softly many times . all implying the same thing : that the other party is lying and it is not like that . this is a manipulative tactic . ( unless of course the other party is truly lying , but making up a lie this huge about a public paper which EVERYONE can check would be too risky to lie about ) \\n\\ni dont know what he answered to this guy but i don\\'t have to , since i know it already , ive seen this behaviour in action many times , he would answer with another logical fallacy , either saying the other guy made some errors as well , or he would say it is completely wrong and this is more complicated matter and he is trying to simplify it , or he would just grab one little thing from the other\\ 's speech and react to that . if you\\ 've seen the whole you can probably see im right , else i apologize for my speculation , but nonetheless , further proofs without speculations : \\n\\n1:40 about whats best for scotland , well , nothing to criticize but it is just an empty speech , this speech could have been said by anyone in the world about anything in any given time . but interesting thing starts here : \\n\\n2:00 glasses guy asks about his plan B if some thing doesn\\'t work out as he planned . again he is stating proofs that his questions wasn\\'t answered before . of course salmond again keeps interrupting him and smiling as if saying : \ '' completely not true , bullshit\ '' , yet doesn\\'t answer it . talks about debts , i dont know about those since im not familiar with politics in scotland . but saying something like if UK takes assets he is responsible paying it back not scotland is probably very simple and not how it works , but honestly i dont know how it works in that situation . but what annoys me is his figure of speech simplifying the problem so much . i would say about governmental matters , problems are never that easy , you have to follow contracts , procedures 99 % of the time.\\n\\n4:20 glass guy even said he lied about hospitals , making a scare campaign , of course our salmond shrugs it off as funny . if glass guy would lie he should be furious and not shrugging it off as funny . what is funny about it when you are called a liar ? infuriating.\\n\\n5:00 again question about plan B. again shrugs it off as funny . how is this funny , why doesn\\'t he answer the question ? looking \ '' cool\ '' and confident can convince the masses , but just proves he is using demagogue tactics and lies.\\n\\n5:20 can\\'t answer AGAIN the question , so who he brings up ? 100.000 people with disability SUFFERING from the government ? really ? how are you suffering in fucking scotland with GDP Per capita $ 44,378 . obvious lies to manipulate the emotions of people . if you think the government is unjust , you can send in a proposal to the government and if it is good they will vote about it . or does he think people in government hate disabled people with a passion and want them to suffer ? this is not africa . he is clearly using scare tactics as the glasses guy stated before.\\n\\nat 5:40 i cant even understand what he is asking due to accent , but regardless he is asking about how much money something cost . now if a politician brings this up , you know he is a scumbag lying shit . each and every one of them who brings this up like this is the worst manipulator . because you will know the number of whatever he asks in a government scale is gon na be billions , yet of course he doesn\\'t put into perspective , like what is the budget , why the money is needed what is it spent on etc , he just asks for the number , typical manipulation . if you really think you are right about it then you should put it into perspective for people who don\\'t see billions thrown left and right so people could actually understand the numbers . but of course he doesn\\'T do it , he doesn\\'t even let the glasses guy answer properly and just asks for the number.\\n\\nagain 6:00 i dont even understand the second half of what he says , but saying 100.000 poor CHILDREN and he is spending X number of money on something and can\\'t name some job shit is a logical fallacy again.\\n\\nedit : if you don\\'t understand one point pls ask , im not a English speaker and i tried to be short about these since for me these are obvious but if you still don\\'t see it i either was too short about why i think those or i badly phrased it . but : \\n\\n**TLDR : ** im not saying either YES-NO choice is bad , but he is definitely using scare tactics and manipulation through emotions and not through logic . and for him this is just a way to gain more popularity . especially if people vote YES",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see , i was probably wrong in some of my accusations , but i feel like you are trying to convince me why voting YES is good . i never said it is wrong to vote YES , i don\\'t know at all which is good for scotland , but from the things you said , voting YES seems pretty logical . \\n\\nyet my problem was with HOW Salmond presented that choice , not with WHAT he represented . you had sound reasoning behind what you said , that UK is right wing and scotland is left wing . uk wants nuclear weapons , scotland doesn\\'t . this is all there is to it in every topic , but Salmond was never really arguing about this but rather about emotion manipulation , let me respond to some things you said in regards to this : \\n\\n & gt ; tax on empty bedrooms , introduced by the UK government . The Scottish people and government thought it was unfair on the poor who are often assigned houses with more rooms than they might use . \\n\\nwell , tax on empty bedrooms really mostly tax the richer people , the poor who have bigger assigned houses are probably very few , and this could be easily changed within the UK system , if someone wants a smaller house he can change it with other who wanted a bigger house , i dont remember anytime in the history when somebody wanted LESS and he didn\\'t get it . problem is when you want more , not less . so it is strange to me this is a problem to begin with . \\n\\nbut basic political tactic is to always talk about every type of tax you can find , tax is the best way to convince people as a politician during a time of peace to vote for you . most political parties say they will decrease a tax ( for example eliminate the empty bedroom tax , or give more welfare money ) but of course with this the state loses money , these taxes weren\\'t introduced ( most of the time ) just for fun or for politicians to get more money in their pockets . every politician knows if you make a new tax , people will hate you . so they try to avoid increasing tax as they avoid fire . so introducing any new tax or increasing income tax is only done if the state needs money for something . so back to the point , many politicians say they eliminate/decrease said tax , and they WILL keep their promise to not seem 2faced , but soon new taxes with different names will come , because they somehow will have to solve the now deficit in the budget . maybe he will give more welfare and delete empty bedroom tax but will make a new tax for people with cars , and we could again hear reasoning that this law is bad for poor people who are assigned cars etc . taxes are there for a purpose , it is used to build the country and pay people working for the state so it actually gets back to people . ( even if a politican would steal 10million euros from it , that is such a small number compared to yearly budget that it won\\'t be even the 0,1 % of budget and will be unnoticed ) . what im trying to say is , saying that taxes need to be decreased or eliminated is pure political trickery , if you want a different approach to it you should say from where you want to make the money for it . here at least he said that the money will come from Trident , but he didn\\'t say he would use the money from it to solve the deficit from taxes , but rather said it is to use it for poor children and disableds . i don\\'t know the numbers since they never really talk about it ( or maybe they did in the full debate ) , but changing seemingly little things about taxes result in billions . but nonetheless this is an actual point he makes that he wants to stop trident . ( problem is , public safety probably shouldn\\'t be up for vote and the way should be chosen by military professionals . but of course i don\\'t know anything about this matter , but seeing russia\\ 's behaviour about ukraine , maybe this is not the best time to demilitarize . weapons are not for only attacking other nations , but rather as a deterrent to not get attacked randomly ) \\n\\n & gt ; 0:45\\nI don\\'t know how familiar you are with the campaigns , but the opposite side has been saying that oil revenues were too unstable to be relied upon or counted upon.\\n\\ni dont know who is right but doesn\\'t matter , he still on purpose exaggerated . not to mention things like these should be NOT debatable , this could be proved by professionals in the field if there really is oil shortage or not , economic things should never be put up to a vote , but decided by skilled people . only basic policies could be voted , like environmental friendliness etc.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; In the full debate , a few minutes earlier he gets to speak on oil a little . Making the case that Norway has 20 % of it\\ 's GDP as oil revenue , Scotland would have 15 % , So unless people consider Norway unstable , Scotland couldn\\'t be either.\\n\\nagain these things should not be debatable , 1 wrong doesn\\'t make 2 right . these should be proved by data and not \ '' common sense\ '' . and there could be a million difference between these 2 countries as to why it is more liability for scotland and not for norway . i dont know if any parties showed data about their choice , but they should . and until they do , talking about is only trying to make the other look dumb , which is again not a honest direct way of politics , but manipulation.\\n\\n & gt ; What the SNP propose is that we accept some debt for a proportional amount of the national assets\\n\\nseems fair , i completely agree , but things are usually more complicated , i would probably need to hear the other side\\ 's argument , because there could be many scenarios theoretically where it doesn\\'t work like that from pure materialistic perspective.\\n\\nfor example ( this is total fiction ) UK borrowed a lot of money so in 4 years they can invest in scotland farmlands because it is perfect place for it , and in 15 years the money could be paid back . now if scotland gets autonomy before they even start to build farmlands , yet they already borrowed the money , they are in a shitty situation especially if they made some prearrangements in contracts/spendings , with this , scotland has no asset so he wouldn\\'t have to pay any debt , yet it doesn\\'t seem fair does it if he doesn\\'t help paying back the money ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; 4:20 : Hospitals being mentioned are due to cost cutting in England.\\nScotland\\ 's budget is decided in part by how much England spends on Hospitals , so if they spend less , we have less to spend on our own services.\\n\\ni dont know the situation but my problem was that he was accused of lying publicly about it , yet he just laughed it off , sadly we can\\'t see his response , but seemed like there is no real response to that , because when you actually accuse someone of lying publicly , you have to have proofs else you could go to court for defamation . ( as far as i know , but maybe scottish laws are different ) \\n\\n & gt ; 6:00 He\\ 's talking about how the opposition are spending a lot on nuclear weapons when we as a country have rising child poverty rates.\\n\\nwell , i don\\'t even understand the concept of his , how can a child be poor , every child is poor until they start working . but nonetheless , UK policy is of course the same as scotland\\ 's would be in that regard , that they wouldn\\'t allow death by hunger . every democratic country in europe will try to solve things like that , so phrasing it like this is just exaggeration again . saying poor innocents ( children/disabled ) is always a good way to win over people.\\n\\nmost of the other things you wrote i agree with that i was too quick to judge . ( or in some i can not prove it logically just have bad feeling about his \ '' manipulative\ '' body language and speech , but those are all very subjective )",Uralic,Hungarian

Executioner1337,europe,"Translation TL ; DR : \\n\\n & gt ; We have addressed before in April the pedestrian-biker bridge costing 400M Forints ( 1.3M Euros ) planned for the summer water world championships . Our readers weren\\'t convinced with BKK\\ 's ( Budapest K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si K\u00f6zpont , Budapest Transportation Centre ) reasoning , and that the existing bridge only 300 meters away would justify a new pedestrian-biker overpass on R\u00e1kospatak , between Dag\u00e1ly ( the swimming pool ) and its car park.\\n\\n & gt ; But how mindful are the organizers that they thought about people reaching their cars with bikes . \\nIn April we wouldn\\'t have imagined that the 424M Forints wouldn\\'t be enough . Neither that the super expensively earned contract because of the short time frame would be extended with three months . \\n**That means that the works could be delayed up to October , while the water world championship is held in July , according to the contract . ** \\n\\n & gt ; The structure arcing above the flowing R\u00e1kos-patak cost 424M Forints gross at the time of signing the contract , and it included the implementation and everything else ( planning , technical inspection , fees , reserves ) . Now 20M Forints net can be added ( 25.4M Forints gross ) to this , since the 309M Forints dedicated to the implementation now increased to 329M Forints ( net ) according to the modification on Monday . \\nThe price increase is really only a drop in the sea of billions for the water world championship , but its rationale is beautiful . \\n\\n & gt ; The price increase was justified by *a set of unforeseen things* , which lead to the increase of cost of the bridge . \\n\\n & gt ; But the modification of the deadline is even more surprising . The work of art was the symbol of the water world championship even without its increase of cost with its complete pointlessness and its overpriced cost . But that it won\\'t even have to be finished to the world championship ? ! \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' The implementation works are according to the schedule , the facility will be finished before the start of the FINA world championship.\ '' \\nUnless if it doesn\\'t , the already existing bridge being 300 meters away can be used to approach the parked cars .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I could ask the same . How can you support them ? They are not refugees , there are no wars , they just want welfare , and no i dont want them to get paid from my taxes . But if you like them so much , why dont you share your home with few of them ? Also did you see the videos about them attacking trucks ?

Germany doesn\\'t have gay marriage either . Ireland has the most backwards abortion laws in the western world , while Eastern Europe as a whole has the most progressive ones .

I just believe that the state should stand by the local Christian values as the \ '' official\ '' values of the country , even if other lifestyles are permitted . I wouldn\\'t seek to force this on other countries , and is more for Hungary than it is for Germany , where I know that people are a lot less attached to Christianity than they are in eastern Europe . Now , on to the parties ... \\n\\nI was very much center-right with the CDU , I was a big supporter of Merkel and I could usually see the logic in her decisions , even if I didn\\'t agree entirely . I draw the line at the migrant crisis though . Even before , I was very critical of how the EU doesn\\'t have a single , dominant pan-European department that handles the border . It\\ 's very unfair that the nations that happen to be on our border also have to protect the EU\\ 's borders mostly alone . I\\ 'm very much not a fan of how Merkel tried to strong arm Europe into doing something that wasn\\'t even a \ '' greater good\ '' situation , it wasn\\'t to help Europeans or to get Europe into a better place . It\\ 's stupid to risk the integrity of the Union for non-Europeans , especially with a decision that\\ 's so controversial . Merkel is finally changing her tune , but I don\\'t know if I\\ 'll ever go back to being as big of a CDU or EU supporter as I was before .

Thus , I\\ 'd be left with Jobbik . They\\ 're an interesting bunch . I can\\'t honestly say that I\\ 'm not drawn to their rhetoric , Eastern Europe has had a hard time and it\\ 's not very easy to trust more prosperous and in our eyes often naive countries to handle our affairs . That being said , some party members are very unpolitical and say antisemitic things , silly things , and seem to be plagued with the same ideological vagueness that afflicts most other radical parties .

There is a cultural link between us and the Huns , and through that the Xiongnu , who may have been a multi-ethnic confederation that included people who may have appeared white ( though the evidence for this is very scarce ) .\\n\\nThe furthest we can track the Finno-Ugric people is the Urals .

We can\\'t have Germany tip-toe around Russia\\ 's feelings while eastern Europe begs for political and martial support , we can\\'t have Hungary\\ 's leader entertaining Putin while Europeans are dying because of Putin\\ 's actions , and we can\\'t field soldiers from 28 countries and expect them to win a war when they have to operate as 28 different entities with 28 different opinions on how the war should be fought.\\n\\nAlso , we can\\'t keep penny-pinching when it comes to the quality of our defense .

Why does proud Europe rely so much on America to be the counter-weight to eastern aggression ? \\n\\nThose are my thoughts , no , it\\ 's not up to scholarly journal quality , but you guys get what I mean , forgive me if I mis-stated some of my points , I\\ 'm sure I did .",Uralic,Hungarian

This was the figure that clearly pointed out that the Pancho Arena was bulit from aid financed by the central budget . \\n\\nThe stadium of Felcs\u00fat was built from tao money ( corporation tax credits ) , which is practically only not recognised as public money by the Felcs\u00fat Youth Foundation and those around , but in reality \ '' tax-money\ '' is involved .

So they called the tao funds govermental resources , that is , public money . \\n\\nA few weeks ago , however , the report has been amended and nex to the \ '' central budgetary support\ '' line it is not 2.09 billion , but only 145 million HUF ( which is the funds recieved from MLSZ which is accounted as central budgetary resources elsewhere , too ) . \\n\\nAccording to the foundation\\ 's auditor there was an administrative error . \\n\\nOr again , they adapted reality to the words of the Prime Minister .",Uralic,Hungarian

Just quoted what the ayatollah said in a New York Times article.\\n\\nWhat you stated in your first comment was false and deceiving",Uralic,Hungarian
ILikeWaffles95,europe,"& gt ; You know very well that this is false . Prior to the elections in 2014 , the governing Fidesz party changed the election rules and the election districts . So in 2010 , when Fidesz won 2/3 majority , they also received 2,7 million votes . 4 years later , in 2014 , they only received 2,1 million votes , and still received the same percentage of mandates in the parliament.\\n\\nWhile gerrymandering is wrong , do you want me to list all the countries **Mainly the US** who did the same shit , even more obviously.\\n\\nDo you think the US is a dictatorship because of that ? \\n\\n & gt ; limiting the number of terms of prime ministers to max 2 terms\\n\\n ? ? ? Just because a no-name insignificant party tried to make a referendum about something you can\\'t , doesn\\'t mean we have no democracy.\\n\\n & gt ; Those were all questions submitted to the constitutional court . Fidesz did everything it could to prevent the vote from happening , and when it finally did , they just gave in without consulting the people at all . For example , they didn\\'t want to hold a referendum on the Olympics . When enough people signed so that they had to have the referendum , they just cancelled the whole Olympics thing . Now we will never know if the majority wanted it or not . And all the money that was spent in the 4 years before that , for the Olympics ... all wasted.\\n\\nThey know most of the people , or at least a sizeable amount were against it , therefore they pulled the plug . The fact that we had no chance against whatever big city wanted to host it played a major role also.\\n\\nWhat\\ 's your point ? \\n\\n & gt ; THIS YEAR they are blaming Soros . Last year they were blaming the immigrants . And before that , it was the IMF , the EU , random political opponents ... \\n\\nAs if you heard Soros in 2017 , don\\'t kid yourself . \\n\\n & gt ; Orban had a meeting with Putin yesterday . No one knows what they talked about , but it implies that Putin is really pulling the strings behind the curtains.\\n\\nMerkel had a meeting with Putin too , is she a puppet too ? I don\\'t care if political leaders meet each other , if the Russians were plotting some evil master plan against EE , they wouldn\\'t plan it publicly anyways.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not a bad idea to keep Russia close to ourselves too , in case in the future things go south with Europe , \ '' Hintapolitika\ '' . They should not be our primary partners though , and don\\'t kid yourself , it doesn\\'t seem like they will be in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n & gt ; By coincidence , the numbers are better than predicted in Slovakia , Romania etc . Do you think it\\ 's some miracle that Orban did why is Hungary doing good ? Or maybe it\\ 's just an overall regional thing . Hungary\\ 's economy is so small , it doesn\\'t matter who does what , if Germany\\ 's economy slows down then so will everyone else\\ 's . When in 2011 the EU\\ 's economy was doing badly , Hungary also had a recession ( which was worse than in other countries in the region ) .\\n\\nYou are right here , but the lefties went into autistic screeching tantrums about muh ruined economy , which is not true.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no constructive opposition in Hungarian politics . They act like little children who shout stuff at eachoter because they can\\'t ride the carousel . The opposition should change , not only in its communication but in their motives aswell.\\n\\nJust because the lefties are fucking stupid , because\\n\\nA , unlike you , most of the people would cut their arms off before voting for a \ '' Western\ '' liberal.\\n\\nB , they can\\'t pull off their identity politics and after that they nothing to offer what Fidesz or Jobbik doesn\\'t . ( B-but muh liberalism : Expect from your echo chamber in Buda , nobody cares about your PC shit . We have bigger problems than \ '' muh humanity\ '' . ) \\n\\n & gt ; Wrong . They attack Hungary because Hungary treats migrants ( = HUMAN BEINGS ) , like animals . They are locked in concentration camps . You can not treat people like that , this is not Saudi Arabia.\\nThe EU agrees that Hungary should defend its borders .
