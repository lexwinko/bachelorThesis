Revenue from salaries and assimilated wages , self-employment , investment income , or gambling revenue will be taxed annually through globalization at household level . \\n\\nIf employers currently have to calculate and retain employees both social contributions ( pensions , health , unemployment ) and income tax ( 16 % at present ) , 2018 will no longer retain and go to the budget than social contributions . Income tax remains with the employee , to whom the employer is obliged to issue until the end of February 2019 only a document showing the net income achieved during the previous year .

I however specifically stated that you won\\'t be\\nTransnistria.\\n\\n & gt ; Because there is indeed , and I think you will not deny it , a gulf of knowledge between what you know about Catalonia and what I know.\\n\\nOf course it\\ 's true but what I said doesn\\'t invalidate that . If you really really trust your government and think they have everything in hand for the independence the all the power to you . However we are commenting on an article about how the EU parliament president is saying that you\\ 'll be out of the EU but maybe you know something I don\\'t ( very likely ) .\\n\\n & gt ; TThe most grating part is that you are clearly showing a deep ignorance of the cultural , economic , political and even historical aspects of spain and catalonia , and yet you are doing all sorts of assumptions on who will recognise us and worst , the rationale these countries will use to deny us such recognition , despite you not knowing what is their opinion because ou don\\'t really follow the issue of Catalan independence , the movements of Catalan and Spanish diplomacy ( you don\\'t even know catalonia has its own diplomatic service ) and the results of the meetings and conferences which are constantly taking place . \\n\\nReally you got all that from what ? Aren\\'t you projecting on me a little bit ? Only mention I have made of your government is the mantra one.\\n\\n & gt ; This is a pretty big assumption , do you think Thailand won\\'t recognise us because Cambodja or the Patani insurgency\\n\\nI was talking about the EU and not the rest of the world \\n\\n & gt ; I would never dare make such assumptions on issues of main importance to Romania , even if I didn\\'t like your country or your people for some reason , because I have no clue of what happens there and since i don\\'t speak romanian , my options to get information are very limited , and probably biased . Off course you don\\'t make this kind of reasoning regarding my country , because you are so sure of what you know.\\n\\nThe thing I assumed however is that a quarter of the EU will not recognize you . And regardless of your presidents wife I\\ 'm very sure my country won\\'t recognize you . All the romanian governments to date have been alergic to separatist movements . Romania will most likely not recognize you and say it\\ 's a Spanish internal matter and leave it at that . \\n\\nThat was actually the only assumption I made in my post . ( I did include the other countries that don\\'t recognize kosovo to date so I said at least a quarter of the union ) . \\n\\nThere was no assumption about catalonia there was just a statement that your government should have a plan . If you trust them to have one in case of the situation stated then good luck to you and as I said in your post I hope for your sake you are right.\\n\\nThis is why your rant about my assumptions catalonia seems odd because reading my post again I never did assume anything about it .

BRUHBRUHBLOOP,europe,"I really didn\\'t want to comment in this west vs east shit show that this comment section ended up being , but honestly I need to give you a reply because in a weird way , what you are referring to about EE\\ 's complaining about the refugee crisis and annoying you , is what is annoying me about western Euros complaining about eastern Euros for simply having a different view . \\nOk , that was a mouthful , I will put it in a clearer view . As a highly educated eastern Euro who spent the last 8 years of his life in the West ( which is 1/3 of my life by the way ) I could not help but be in complete support to Eastern europeans on the refugee crisis . As many eastern states stated , forcibly relocating refugee there\\ 's was simply idiotic , as all would try to run or feel cheated for not getting placed in Germany , and how would you keep them there , by force ? Refuge started fucking crying even when they realized they ended up crossing the romanian border by mistake , how dafuq do you think that felt to us ? It was very offensive , I\\ 'll tell you that . \\n\\nAnyhow , so here\\ 's the issue , it\\ 's all about politics really . When western politicians such as Merkel saw a political benefit in being the mother of \ '' refugees\ '' she went all in for it , with many politicians from Netherlands , France , the Nordic countries etc . The only reason why the western media ( which is just as much propaganda as russian propaganda really ) went so harshly on eastern states was because they did not buy into that . In eastern Europe being an all for more refugees politician was not bringing political capital , it was actually destroying you politically . Thus eastern politicians didn\\'t buy into their play , and they went to place their own opinions against it . That was all they had at the point , a different opinion , but they got called racists , bigots , nazi\\ 's and what not for it ! How would you not be frustrated at the western Euros after you get that treatment just for not being as idiotically PC as them ? Of course , some leaders saw a way to win political capital from this and they went and created a shit show from the issue themselves , such as Orban in Hungary , the current leaders in the V4 as a more extensive example . And that was probably what went in your face so much that it annoyed you , but it wasn\\'t at all different from what western european politicians did to us , it was exactly the same as a matter of fact , just on the other side . So don\\'t you think you are a bit hypocritical when you are using a clear double measure like that ? \\n\\nWhat I wanted to say is , that while I do support helping refugees and am a very educated person , I could not help but agree with most eastern politicians on the issue . They correctly noticed that the entire solution of distribution was a complete shit and only done to offer the fake impression that something is done , it was only done for the political capital of western politicians , and they didnt want to commit political suicide in their own countries just for the western once to save face , how could I accuse them for that ? For any open minded person there reaction was totally natural , even though exaggerated in some cases ( Viktor Orban ) . \\n\\nNow back to the issue , that did not stop western Euros , such as you , from shitting on eastern Euros for that , which in truth , was you throwing shit on us for having a different opinion on the issue from you . Take me for example , do you think I was against helping the refugees ? I never was , I am not even now . But the solutions proposed by the west were simply idiotic , the problem had to be solved at the core , around Syria , were most refugees live , were all those women and children who can not make the trip are . Send money to Lebanon , to Turkey , to Egypt , make those country help their brothers , they are of the same culture after all . Who could understand them better than their own kind ? And yet , for simply having this different view on the solution , I got so much shit from people like you , how could I not get sick really ? \\n\\nNow a final example , take the politicians of Romania , they were more moderate on the issue . They voted against the mandatory quotas as they believed they were not a solution , however they did not oppose the relocation as it was enforced by the EU . They even started doing it , by now I think they got like 30 refugees here . Why so little you wonder ? They should be above 4500 coming here . Well , that\\ 's because the fucking relocation hubs in Italy and Greece are not working , they are not even fucking operational . That\\ 's how much the EU actually cared about their relocation project , so much it doesn\\'t even work even if you want to do it . But of course , it was never meant to work , it was always just a facade for the masses . The only reason you are pissed is because eastern Europeans didn\\'t buy into your charade , and for that we ANNOY you ? How hypocritical is that really , and because you are annoyed by that I am annoyed for your annoyance ! Isn\\'t life really a wonder in the end ? : ) ) \\n\\nYou are also completely ignoring the very fundamental part of how much western Europe is getting from the eastern open markets and their economical growth which overflows in the west too ... . currently eastern European nations are kinda the engine behind the sluggish growth that the EU is even having as a matter of fact , but let\\ 's not go there , because I feel I would have to start another long long argument about that with you . \\n\\nPS : I agree on the LGBT issue , still lots of things to solve . It\\ 's mainly due to the people being hard core religious here , and that is a result of communist oppression of religion . You western Euros forget or ignore too much that most eastern countries were still a dictatorship 26 years ago . Actually in Romania\\ 's case I would say the communist rule only fell somewhere in the 2000\\ 's , which you can even see on our GDP graphs , the entire decade from 1990-2000 was a complete waste , nothing moved here , just things got demolished . But for what we achieved in just 16 years and the amazingly fast improvements we are doing I can only be proud of my country , and if you can not see that it\\ 's because of your long nose , not because of my peoples\\ ' lack of efforts . So I am sorry , but I\\ 'm not sorry at all ! ; ) \\n\\n Have a nice day .",Romance,Romanian

It will still happen , however . Should the referendum in November not happen , there\\ 'd be advance elections for the Catalan parliament , where parties would be polarized on the issue and people would vote them accordingly . If the recent EU elections meant anything , ERC would win again , with an absolute majority . That party has already had \ '' Independence for Catalonia\ '' as the core of their electoral program for many years , and they\\ 'd be supported by the other parties that are also for independence now ( 2/3rd of current parliament , likely more after these elections ) . After these , independence negotiations would , too , start.\\n\\nIf , even with the expressed will of the people supporting them , these negotiations failed ... unilateral declaration of independence would follow . That could go more or less smoothly , but in any event , it would become an international conflict .

3G6A5W338E,europe,"Some background . Disclaimer : I\\ 'm Catalan . The article goes : \\n\\n & gt ; Under Spain\\ 's constitution a region \ '' can not unilaterally call a referendum on self-determination to decide on its integration in Spain\ '' , according to a written summary of the ruling released by the Constitutional Court.\\n\\nProblem is , there\\ 's no request for a referendum ( binding ) coming from Catalonia . Catalonia has asked for something else entirely , that is , a consultation ( which is non-binding ) . That\\ 's completely legal and that\\ 's Spain\\ 's government current nightmare.\\n\\nWhat Spanish government doesn\\'t want is for the actual numbers ( how much support independence really has ) to be known , no matter what , because they don\\'t like what the polls on the matter look like ( yes wins at least 2:1 ) . And that\\ 's a battle they can\\'t win . There\\ 's nothing illegal about a consultation in the Spanish framework . Even if somehow they actually manage to stop the consultation from happening by November 9 ( e.g . : by sending the military to kidnap the urns ... what a joke ) , that would only delay things slightly . The Catalan can and will hold elections should that happen . Parties will then no doubt be organized as independence yes/no . So what the Catalan want will be known.\\n\\nAfter that , I can\\'t picture a scenario where the Catalan want independence and don\\'t end up getting it , one way or another . The different scenarios there have to do about how much democratic hygiene Spain shows regarding the core principle of sovereignty belonging to the people , and how much the Spanish populace and the world are willing to overlook whatever actions Spain\\ 's government does take against Catalonia .",Romance,Spanish

People just don\\'t take well to being told No to everything . If they were cooperative , there\\ 's a chance people would vote against .

We\\ 're just , as societies , delegating this power to representatives.\\n\\n & gt ; It is because this dismantling of states is not a given regardless of circumstances.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not fair to talk about dismantling of states right now . Catalonia is trying to hold a vote simply to know what its populace does want , and that is all.\\n\\nHaving stated this , we can now enter pure hypothetical territory , considering what might happen after this information is in our hands . If it so happens they want independence , and if it so happens that they obtain this independence at some point , they won\\'t be \ '' dismantling\ '' any state .
