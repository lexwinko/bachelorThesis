Also , are they still really terrible for wanting to build the wall to protect Shengen ? \\n\\n* Why \ '' regardless if the migrants are asylum seekers\ '' ? It is a major factor in the whole story . Stop the formal legalities , talk reality.\\n\\n* Refugees from a country 1000km away should not be aligible to seek for asylum in the EU . They are no longer in danger for 800km or weeks away from the threat . If Germany is so vested in getting all people in safety , they are free to set up asylum points in refugee camps and grant them in the place where it is needed the most . MENA has high poverty and fertility rates so they will have people to import for decades.\\n\\n* are any of the migrants applying actually being identified and validated ? and deported ? not sure if you are correct to point in direction of Hungary\\n",Balto-Slavic,Czech

2girls1crap,europe,"Interesting to see this from Sobotka . As one of the news pundits recently said , he is gaining a lot of respect from people that will never vote for him .

2girls1crap,europe,"Germany can not afford losing any ( current or potential ) currency-weakening countries and export markets .

2girls1crap,europe,"& gt ; And this is a vastly different picture than how most Eastern Europeans understand this crisis.\\n\\nThanks for your lecture . Now let me explain what this migration \ '' crisis\ '' is.\\n\\nIt is a \ '' wave\ '' of people mostly not from war zones . Those are too poor and they are stuck in refugee camps . It is people from all kinds of areas who heard that there is good time to go to Germany and Sweden , because mother Angela will accept everyone . And if by some miracle they are not awarded asylum , no one will make them go back . And it is not a wave in a sense that it spikes and will subside , it is a stream that will go stronger or weaker , but will increase over time . Those people are not interesed in getting to safety , they reached it before they got on the life-threatening jurney accross the sea . They go after welfare in the promissed european lands . And not some mediocre welfare in southern or eaastern european states , only top tier welfare of Germany and Sweden will do . \\n\\nSo the Eastern states do not feel very invested in sharing the burden the rich states brought onto themselves by their wealth and unreasonable attitude towards migrants . \\n\\n**tl ; dr : ** \\nTo us , you are saying : \ '' We are so rich and naive there are milions of people who want to move over here , while you are too poor , homogenous and without the welfare to be interesting for anyone from MENA so no one is coming to you .

3w4v,europe,"When talking about how unlikely a specific event like this is , we often get lost in those specifics - for example , that it\\ 's \ '' dirtyjew\ '' on a bottle of Chianti . So to figure out the probability of something _like_ this happening , you take the set of all improbably long offensive words or phrases , perform the same calculation , and then factor in the number of bottles using visible alphabetic identifiers likely to be seen and photographed and posted to the internet if an improbably long offensive word or phrase appears.\\n\\n 1 . 12 alphabetic characters , so 26^12 = 95428956661682176 possible combinations ( let\\ 's just pretend they\\ 're all 12 long ) .\\n 2 .

Number of bottles with alphabetic IDs consumed per year AND likely to be noticed by a person who would post the picture on a public internet forum ( again , let\\ 's just ballpark at 10,000,000 , and this is probably too low ) .\\n 5 . Chance a picture ends up on Reddit in a given year if it gets posted to a public forum ( let\\ 's assume it\\ 's even odds ) .\\n 6 .

Blind_Fire,europe,"The Czech Republic consists of 3 historical regions . \\n\\nBohemia , the western region . Moravia , the south-eastern part . And lastly , the Czech part of Silesia . Silesia as a region spreads also to Poland and Germany.\\n\\nSo simply calling it Bohemia invokes the Czech word *\u010cechy* , which is the Czech name , again , for only the western half of the country.\\n\\nCzechia is the agreed equivalent of the Czech word *\u010cesko* . The suffix *-sko* is a common suffix for country names . For example , Russia , your country , is simply called *Rusko* , the root *Rus* + *-sko* . *\u010cesko* is often used as a name for the whole region , it was also used in the name of Czechoslovakia , *\u010ceskoslovensko*.\\n\\nMany , myself included , accept Czechia because it is simple and Englishs often use its equivalent , *\u010cesko* , in normal speech . Although , many , myself again included , find it weird-sounding and hesitate to use it themselves.\\n\\nCzechlands is sometimes also used , although , the term is incorrect and has no basis in the English language . Its equivalent , *Zem\u011b \u010cesk\u00e9* , is used when speaking of the historic regions , often meaning literally Bohemia+Moravia+Silesia . It is very close to the term *Zem\u011b Koruny \u010cesk\u00e9* , The Lands of the Czech Crown , which is mostly used in connection with the old Kingdom of Bohemia , former part of the HRE.\\n\\nSome people , mainly Englishs with low English proficiency , use phrases like : \ '' Here in Czech , we ... .\ '' . This is outright wrong and should not be used . Phonetically it is ok but gramatically it is only a shortcut for people to get their message through . Some English-speaking people might accept it but it probably sounds weird.\\n\\nThe Czech Republic , the full name , probably sounds too complicated or exhausting to use over and over again , however , the equivalent *\u010cesk\u00e1 republika* is often used even in the English tongue . It is something that is correct in 99 % of the situations you might bump into .

As it is promoted mostly to stakeholders ( associations , political parties , unions , ... ) than regular public , because it can be costly and you dont want people that attend demonstrations to come there and talk shit , which doesnt really benefit anyone . Also not all events there are fully public . We dont have anything scheduled for TTIP or CETA right now as the negotiations for TTIP are frozen because of Trumps administration ( just like all negotiations involving USA ) and CETA right now is in parliament ( ratification process ) , there was a conference last week about it so I dont think we will see another one as there was nothing new , everyone who wants to know annything about it already does know . But I could be wrong , maybe in next weeks , something will pop up.\\n\\nIf you want more about politics , I would suggest debates co-hosted by Respekt , Charles university or AMO ( asociace pro mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed ot\u00e1zky ) - they are pretty good when it comes to czech discussions . They also invite foreign experts . Knihovna V\u00e1clava Havla has some events too , but I dont have that good experience with it , since many trolls attend it and the quality quickly degrades . But I could as well be just unlucky.\\n\\nThe probl\u00e9m with making information public , apart of what Ive already mentioned , is also the competitive advantage .

ArticleID=1104 ) . \\n\\nBut people also want info about state-owned companies to be made public ( like \ '' kauza registr\ '' from last month ) - which resulted in 50 % of companies being excluded from that law - for a good reason . you just put those companies in disadvantage compared to their competition that do not have that red tape on them . I understand the idea behind it ( less corruption space ) but damn , you are going to destroy them.\\n\\nLast week , someone wanted all employees of our ministry with phone numbers and email adress and office numbers , because we are state employees and should serve public ( and quoted some paragraphs ) . If you want a specific employee for some reason , fine . If you want whole ministry just for fun ( not to mention there is a contract for Temelin right now and people that are responsible for it are not known for public , for a good reason . make russians pay for that information : - ) ) it is not good for anything . would a normal person go into politics/become state employee if he had to share to public everything he has ? where he spends money , how much he gets , who he meets , ... secret service should ( and does ) know about this for top politicians and people in power , but those info shouldnt be made public . same goes for state deals , state safety , secret services , police , ... \\n\\nabout the last paragraph - well , you just have to trust others , just like you trust your doctor , teacher , bus driver , guy that drives next to you , people walking by you at street , your cook , plumber , policemen , judge , ... thats how syst\u00e9m works .

Just trust them . And when it becomes unbearable , people will always vote for someone else , or his own party will kick him out ( or their sponsors will ) . Just dont vote for people with simple solutions , cuz its never simple and they will always keep most of the information ( important parts ) hidden ( or they are clueless and dont even know it ) . Wall/open borders wont help . Leaving/entering EU wont help . Accepting/declining euro wont help .

Does that make them liberal-conservative-socialists ? \\n\\nLiberals in todays EU either want to destroy EU , or understand its social principles and \ '' work within the borders\ '' of the EU legislative - which includes for example grants ( which would be unacceptable for liberals before ) . \\n\\nI am not really sure what do you mean by protecting life . Everyone wants to protect life ( ? ) , liberals would say that you should tak\u00e9 care of it yourself , conservatives would say that the family/your master/police should do it and socialists would say that there should be no guns among the population and only police should have some minimum ( best would be some tasers ) - thats very common in the north and western Europe today , which seems really crazy to me . And also extreme left ( greens , communists ) would say that we should destroy all weapons and focus on higher goals , such as global peace , environment , ... \\n\\nWhat you described about two people example , It seems like typical anarchic-communism ( final stage of socialism ) . Typical liberal would say \ '' your freedom ends where my begins\ '' - & gt ; dont touch my food , unless I give you a permission . But this could be very individual , as for example having opinion about squatters can vary between liberals , anarchists , communists , socialists , conservatives , ... Its a very complicated topic . \\n\\nWhether the liberal should or should not share food in that situation is not really liberal to me . Its socialism-conservatism debate . Socialist would share , conservative would not . Typical liberal would stick to a conservative narrative , but in todays EU , I believe that a liberal would stick with a socialist in this case . For example in the migrant crisis , liberals mostly support helping those people . But again , it varies a lot on individual organisations/parties/people , nobody is a pure liberal , everyone is a mix.\\n\\nEven as a right-wing liberal ( who would have guessed ) I dont see a reason for fencing a forest , so even if it is a private property , in this case I dont see why people should be denied access there . But I would have different rules for small parks that should give me an option to keep it private for me and people I want in . Or to demand an entry fee . But If I owned a forest , I could have different experience and outcome of my thoughts could be different as well.\\n\\nSo overal - we cant really classify parties or people as members of one ideology , we cant even judge certain policies as such , because all of them are mostly a mixture of multiple ideologies . Which is great and it keeps governments towards the centrism , which to me , is ideal , because it satisfies the majority . It is very easy to see that countries , which are edging towards one side more than the other , are not doing that well and a lot of people are really unhappy there , for real reasons ( as opposed to \ '' made up\ '' unhappiness here ) .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Burlaczech,europe,"while I agree with the first part , when left-right was found in France , with left being the progressive reformists while the right were monarchist conservatives . But thats origins , thats not 20 or 21st century , so I am talking about whats relevant for us right now . Liberalism in its core is right-wing orientation ( you should work hard and get big reward ) just like conservatism , as opposed to socialism ( everyone works and should have the same reward ) . Very simplified version . In todays context , lot of workers welfare ( labour laws , unemployment pay , maternity leave , benefits , ... ) are left-wing policies that originate in socialism . A liberal would say \ '' its their probl\u00e9m , I have my own , unlock my shackles and let me tak\u00e9 care of myself\ '' . thats a right-wing way of thinking.\\n\\nWhat reflects reality better , is the 4 way compass with + being libertarian , - totalitarian , X left-wing ( economy ) , Y right-wing ( economy ) . It reflects the complexity way better than just X and Y . Because Stalin and Hitler were both on the other side of axis Y and X , while both being totalitarians and governed the state in a very similar way , as opposed to western style of democracy . \\n\\nthe welfare state , as we know it today , was really not invented by Marx , but by a Bismarc , who was a hardcore capitalist supporter . But you can not have socialism without capitalism ( you will run out of money and everyone will become poor over time - look at central europe ) and you can not have capitalism without socialism ( look at europe in 18-19th century or china today - people will be unhappy and create labour unions , demand more welfare or even leave the country ( or even vote for people like Bernie Sanders ) , if another one will have better working conditions . Modern state needs both systems . Which ratio between the two is perfect ? That really depends on each country . But this will bring us to another subreddit .",Balto-Slavic,Czech
Burlaczech,europe,"in that case yes . I believe we all have a lot in common and its only up to us whether we want to see it or not . Marxism only talks about wealth and how social class is dependent on it , which is not true today in Europe . You can be anything you want comming from anywhere you want , its only up to you and your abilities . So what could be more relevant in 19th century is not ( very ) relevant in 21st . Just like some people want to live by hundred years old book . \\n\\nI am not saying that everything Marx or any socialist said is wrong . I say that their system is wrong . But that doesnt mean we cant listen to it and learn from it . Learning from something doesnt mean \ '' ok Ive read it , its bad , put it away and never think about it again\ '' . No , learning means that if he has a point ( and they do ) , you should take what you want from it and improve yourself , evolve . Just like from a bad relationship , you always learn something new . \\n\\nIf you want an example of what could we learn from socialism is that for example we should care about poverty where religion fails . What should we take from Marxism is that you can think about the common things certain groups share , that you would not think about before . Its up to you what you do with the information , its just a basic level of education here . Whether you exploit it and become a dictator ( Poland , Czech , Hungary , Russia , hopefully not France ... ) or something else ... getting slightly offtopic here so ill end , Ive made my original point .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

DannyUfonek,europe,"The people who aren\\'t affected ( I understand you\\ 're referring to the post-communist countries ) are the most critical because they fear the consequences which they see ( and don\\'t see ) through the media . They don\\'t want to repeat the mistakes that refugee-friendly countries have done in the past few years . To name a few - no go ( Sweden , Germany ) and shariah ( UK & amp ; France ) zones , censorship of critics of islam , creeping islamisation of politics ( UK Labour ) . They want safeguards put in place that will prevent this . Instead , politicians and media , instead of solving the problem , are trying to tell them that they\\ 're all racists ( at least here in the Czech Republic ) . For example , our prime minister Sobotka completely ignored the 200,000 people who signed the petition against EU immigration quotas ( he provided no justification for why he will or won\\'t take it into account ) , likewise the media ignored the petition . If they were xenophobic , they wouldn\\'t have done so . His minister for internal affairs Chovanec is instead demanding money for a campaign to \ '' break the xenophobic resistance\ '' of the Czech people . In case where a ruling politician spits into the face of 75 % of his citizens ( from a study on accepting refugees - 75 % said they were against ) , one can\\'t be surprised that people are angry and are becoming \ '' radicalised\ '' .\\n\\nIf there was a great rise in xenophobia , the gypsies , the Vietnamese and the Ukrainians wouldn\\'t be spared . There is nobody except the stupid true xenophobes ( like this crazy Slovak ) who is suggesting any racist \\'arguments\\ ' . People are just genuinely worried . However , the government just ignores them . I will say what I said in another comment - **Suggesting that critics of islam and of immigration are xenophobic is as unjust as suggesting that all muslims want to kill us ! **\\n\\nAnd in regards to islam - islam ( like many other religions ) is bad and should be criticised . ( Just read the quuran and you will see - or look at the state of human rights in majority muslim societies ( specifically what they do to women , homosexuals , and atheists in the name of islam ) ) , but that is a different issue than the immigration itself . What is however spreading across Europe is the chilling effect of \ '' anti-xenophobia\ '' and PC ( most supported by wealthy muslims and idealistic or machiavellistic socialists ) , which leads to limiting free speech - people can\\'t draw Mohammad or criticise because some muslims ( and some antiracists in power ) see it as insulting ( and some even to the point that they go kill the cartoonists ) , so newspapers are self-censoring . Insults and criticism are the base of free speech , the pillar of our society . If something insults you , then you have three options : a ) ignore it , b ) respond to it and clear it c ) sue the perpetrator ( if it is repeated ) for harassment . You have no right to censor that person in a free society , especially if it\\ 's about some man from several centuries ago.\\n\\nPeople are just seeing that the immigration from muslim countries is unsustainable in the present form ( I\\ 'm all for different forms of integration than what is being done now ) , and right winged opinions aren\\'t the minority . I never implied that . They aren\\'t all over the media . It\\ 's just that the media aren\\'t so keen on reporting all the aspects of immigration . If crime rates are dropping in Norway , good for you . Perhaps you should teach us how to integrate these people better.\\n\\nAnd even if there truly was a \ '' neoconservative wave\ '' everywhere ( there isn\\'t one , lest we would see true xenophobia spread ( and saying that islam is bad isn\\'t xenophobic - it would be xenophobic to say muslims are bad because they\\ 're different ) ) , then so be it . If it is the will of the people and if the EU is democratic , it should reflect that . Trouble is , the politicians are on a paneuropean level ignoring the problem and pretending that all is okay . That is how the really xenophobic people are becoming relevant - the mainstream is ignoring the problem , so people have no choice but to support the extreme on this issue . And no , I don\\'t want people like this Slovakian in politics . I want the problem to be resolved on a rational basis , not a racial one . People are angry because the elites are ignoring the problem . The problem is mainly in the system and stupid politicians , not in the race/religion of the migrants or xenophobia on Europeans\\ ' part ( the two wouldn\\'t even be mentioned as a problem if it weren\\'t for the first one )",Balto-Slavic,Czech

I don\\'t like the system in Czech Republic where supermarkets and restaurants can\\'t give unsold food to those in need because it is **banned** due to \ '' hygienic\ '' reasons , but forcing it on every supermarket is a bit too much . I know , food has to be bought regularly , the majority of people won\\'t wait to the end of the day , and a lot of the food is just thrown away , and I can see it working it many places ( mostly in cities where homeless live ) but I fear that forcing it on everyone might allow others to profit from it and resell the food , or just for consumers to delay buying food ( at least to some extent ) . And as the article says , the main food-throwawayers are the consumers , at 67 % of food binned . So I think the solution is to educate the masses and not to force legislation on the supermarkets . Maybe subsidising unpackaged food or promoting it in TV might help more ?

The business behind \ '' integration\ '' is already spreading propaganda ( for ex . in the form of the \ '' Hate Free\ '' campaign - which involves the motto \ '' Hate doesn\\'t look good on me\ '' ) , which is stifling real discussion as standing on the critical side of the debate automatically amounts to racism and xenophobia . I think before we even think of allowing these people in we should put safeguards in place that will prevent Islam undermining our liberal culture and protect those criticising it . ( I don\\'t want to witness a killing of anti-Islam protestors/cartoonists , only for it to be downplayed and apologised as not being part of \ '' true Islam\ '' , because that is simply not true ) Unfortunately an education programme for the police is planned in which policemen will be taught how to deal with \ '' hate\ '' and \ '' xenophobia\ '' , and not one on protecting the critics that are in real risk of their lives .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Xenophobia is fear of the unknown , and the people that protest wouldn\\'t really do so if they didn\\'t know what Islam really is . And yes , let\\ 's face it , Islam is barbaric . Look not only into Western Europe ( although , there the problems are caused by not assimilating those people ) , but into any muslim-majority country and their human rights record . Even Turkey , although a good exception , isn\\'t that great . Islam needs a reformation , but todays rich muslims and stupid politicians are letting the fundamentalists have their way with it . That is why we must not let it into Europe . We only recently got rid of the influence of one religion , why import another straight away ?",Balto-Slavic,Czech

The people are then filled with insecurity and considering the weight of information they get about the limited success of the integration of the incoming immigrants , they , naturally , tend to those parties that promise to solve the problem instead of pretending it doesn\\'t exist or insulting those that discuss it openly , even though they might have a questionable background .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

DannyUfonek,europe,"& gt ; Perhaps I\\ 'm misunderstanding your sentece , but you\\ 'd allow massive amounts of people to die because they don\\'t benefit you ? Real great job with the whole European values , there . Accepting refugees isn\\'t a matter of \ '' does this benefit us ? \ '' It\\ 's a matter of human rights . \\n\\nWhat I meant here is that if we really want to save as many people as possible , immigration isn\\'t the way to go and in the long term will only harm us , because those that immigrate are only the ones who have enough money to do so ( ignoring the fact that they usually take off from a camp inside a safe country , making them economic migrants ) , whilst those most in need stay behind . If we really want to help them , we should intervene and aim to solve the crisis in Syria ASAP ( people generally prefer to live close to where they were born , in their home country ) , or at least financially support camps in neighbouring countries - the same money that would rent you a flat in Sweden can save five lives in a camp in Turkey.\\n\\n & gt ; One major issue I see on this sub , though , is the expectation that people will abandon their culture\\n\\nIf the culture is backward ( in treatment of women , for example ) , why shouldn\\'t we encourage its abandonment for our and their sake ? \\n\\n & gt ; If I had to guess , the best way to deal with that isn\\'t by marginalizing the religious , but instead by using moderate religious teachers to reach out in those communities . \\n\\nI agree fully with you here . The problem with Islam today , however , is that there aren\\'t that many moderates ( they\\ 're a minority ) . Most powerful muslims support some version of fundamentalism ( salafism , for example ) , and the European politicians are having them let their way with it to not upset them , instead of banning it altogether ( like nazism ) or regulating it ( creating a European values-friendly islamic curriculum , subsidising islamic moderates , and banning funding from foreign organisations ) .\\n\\nThx for the \ '' taught\ '' , I was typing fast so I didn\\'t realise it.\\n\\nAnd as for racism - what the media and politicians are trying to push is that the biggest problem of Europe is racism and that terrorism etc . isn\\'t happening because the treatment of the integration of this group is bad and so the tendency for this group to radicalise can materialise , but because we , racist Europeans , aren\\'t nice enough . Instead of explaining and putting forward a plan how we will prevent the mistakes from Western Europe , our Minister of Internal Affairs is planning a campaign to \ '' stop the xenophobic resistance\ '' of his citizens . Yes , there are racists among us and always will be , but their voices will be louder and more legitimate the more the government will ignore the problem .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

DannyUfonek,europe,"Europe will face some great challenges in the upcoming years and how it resolves them will shape its future . I hope most of these don\\'t become true.\\n\\nRussia will continue to put great money into spreading its propaganda , aiming to further destabilise Europe . However , a full frontal war is something that nobody wants . Russia will continue slowly , but surely . Its next target will be Greece and Cyprus , as these are already economically unstable countries.\\n\\nEurope will continue to be greatly divided on the issue of immigration.\\n\\nThe referendum on Brexit will be interesting , as if it succeeds ( which it probably won\\'t ) , it could be followed by the exit of more countries , especially those that will be supposed to take in more migrants than they take now , according to the quota system.\\nThis would greatly play into the hands of the Russians.\\n\\nIslam will continue to spread through Europe and as a result we will see several more assassinations of cartoonists , which apologists will continue to claim is not a result of Islam . Jews will also increasingly emigrate from Europe.\\n\\nClimate change will continue , and as a result , the North of Europe will become colder ( due slowing down of the Gulf Stream ) , and the South hotter , water shortages will become more commonplace , and violent storms succeeded by long periods of no rain will form the typical summer.\\n\\nThe US will continue to push its \ '' free-trade\ '' agenda on Europe and will continue to try to lock in its position through shady backdoor deals like TTIP . \\n\\nOn the positive side , for the first time since the early 20th century , we might see copyright terms shortened , leading to real copyright reform EU-wide and finally a rollback of copyright maximalists\\ ' lobbying efforts.\\n\\nCensorship will also increase , and it will not be just porn ( as in the UK ) , but copyright lobbyists will continue to push for censoring file-sharing sites , as has already happened in the case of The Pirate Bay . Other morality/scare groups will join in and will try to silence opposition and competition . If things go really bad , we might see \ '' Islamophobia\ '' outlawed , just like UK Labour\\ 's Ed Milliband promised.\\n\\nThe NSA spying will continue largely unobstructed , because the NSA is above the law ( spying continues despite the clear fact that it is unconstitutional ) , people don\\'t understand the problem enough to be able to care ( and that\\ 's on purpose ) , and NSA\\ 's power is too large for politicians to be able to stop it . We might see a few revelations here and there , but nothing will really change . Especially if Merkel stays in office.\\n\\nEurope will increase its focus on renewable energy , as oil becomes again more expensive thanks to increasing destabilisation in the Middle East due to IS . Solar panels\\ ' efficiency will increase and with that , also their market share . Many European economies will push to turn away from gas in order to reduce dependance on Russia.\\n\\nSocial security systems across Europe will near collapse under the pressure of the aging population and economically inactive migrants . Elderly homelessness will become a large problem . We might see the return of a big family ( the young work , the elderly take care of the children ) . \\n\\nSpeaking of families , the proportion of single people will continue to increase , but on the other hand , untraditional families ( for example , several unrelated people living together and sharing their kids ) will become more commonplace.\\n\\nThe falling of Christianity and increase of Atheism in Europe will be compensated by the growth of Islam , and we might in the long run see an increase in sexism.\\n\\nScientists will finalise the way for two lesbians to have a child , and the same thing for gays will follow , although they will still require a surrogate mother to bear it for them . Surrogate mothership and adoption of children by homosexual couples will become more accepted , slowed only by the growth of the muslim say on the issue.\\n\\nInternet speeds will continue to be stagnant across Europe thanks to existing monopolies . Eventually it will reach the point that EU will have no choice but to start talking about subsidising improvements of Internet infrastructure . In the short run , hopefully , we will see roaming charges outlawed around Europe.\\n\\nHectic times await us .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

These would have their own governing body for matters inside the region , while the international relations , army , highest levels of law and other more interregional ( strange word , but I like it ) things would be under jurisdiction of European Union.\\n\\nI proposed something like this as solution for how Yugoslavia could have gone , but I think this is applicable for whole union .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

In 2013 , Croatia sent group called Klapa s mora and music that they made is pretty much what you will hear , when you go to Dalmatia . Just listening to it is much better than what they sent this year ( which was 4/10 for me ) . I feel English sung songs do not represent country as much .

If you don\\'t have free markets , the allocation of resources is most likely extremely inefficient.\\n\\nTrade is also a factor in this , however , I think the most important point here would be very poor political institutions that shaped the democracies in the region later on.\\n\\n & gt ; And captialism has usually devolved to function on the basis of a rich centre with a poor periphery . This becomes apparent on a global scale , but also if you look at a regional level , with GB probably being the best example.\\n\\nDon\\'t know about this one , maybe I would need to do some reading on it . I think this is not necessarily a product of capitalism but rather the result of the globalisation . Since the location of the resources is no longer relevant and advanced countries try not to rely on resource production , there is nothing to prevent capital and labour from accumulating in one location . Think of it as adjacency boon : D.\\n\\n & gt ; with few ressources , less possibilities for agriculture , more difficult climate and less options for efficient trade\\n\\nNowadays the most important resource is the population and the more open market and democratic a country is , the better it uses it\\ 's most important resource.\\n\\nThe issue with clientelistic systems is that they both prevent the free market from operating efficiently due to creating rents and market failures and also prevent democratic institutions from properly functioning due to clientelistic relations taking priority over meritocracy .",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

That doesn\\'t sound like the best option for our people.\\n\\n & gt ; How do you explain the big farming corporations then ? Are they not profitable ? \\n\\nAs I\\ 've already said , I\\ 'm not talking about big corporations . I\\ 'm talking about smaller farmers , family farms and all that.\\n\\n & gt ; The US healthcare is a strawman and not a free market.\\n\\nOK then , let\\ 's take US mobile phone market . They pay a shitload of money , yet it\\ 's supposedly a free market that anyone can enter , right ? \\n\\nNot so long ago prices for international calls in EU were insane . Thankfully , the governments stepped in and put caps on those prices . How is that bad ? \\n\\n & gt ; Then what about their protests ? If they were powerless , why do all politicians cave in to their demands ? \\n\\nThey protest because that\\ 's the only way for them to be heard . They can\\'t go with lobbying as they can\\'t afford any of that . They have zero say in all those legislations and in politics . They block the roads because then the news cover them and they get some exposure.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's about reducing all subsidies , as if they\\ 're there , they\\ 're inevitably end up going for the wrong people\\n\\nSo should we stop ALL government payouts ?

No , there are two ways to increase profits : you either increase quality ( costs rise too ) or reduce costs ( quality drops but sales rise ) . No businessman is working as a good samaritan whose only goal is to benefit the society . That\\ 's why they\\ 're called businessmen , they work for profit . If a cheap , shitty product makes more money , then that\\ 's what they will go with.\\n\\nAlso , please stop posting 30 year old crap videos from \ '' strawman and not a free market\ '' country , they are not relevant to our current situation .

Or some guy who\\ 's never even been to Europe and has no idea what EU is ? \\n\\n & gt ; These have always existed and will continue to exist.\\n\\nThat\\ 's quite a strong statement . Mind you , I\\ 'm not talking about farms where a family grows just enough food to feed themselves . I\\ 'm talking about farms where they only grow one type of stuff and then sell it . If we cut the subsidies , then it won\\'t be profitable anymore and they will stop selling stuff . \ '' In the long run\ '' doesn\\'t really mean anything here , people won\\'t just sit quietly without a job for a decade.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know about it , if everybody is allowed to operate , then yes , it\\ 's a free market , only the most competitive businesses will thrive.\\n\\nIt is a free market and it\\ 's a horrible mess with insane prices and fees on everything . That\\ 's what happens when you let the businessmen do whatever they want . That\\ 's why it will never work . Someone has to control them.\\n\\n & gt ; What do you think is paying for those more expensive calls now ? \\n\\nNo one is paying for them . The prices were high because the companies were able to put whatever price they wanted . They could make it 1 euro/min and they did , even if the actual cost was one tenth of that . What are you going to do , sign a new mobile contract just for one week holiday abroad ? That\\ 's why the governments had to step in and say \ '' Sorry guys , but these prices are unreasonable . Cut them.\ '' \\n\\nThe opposite is going on in the agricultural world right now . The farmers are operating below the lowest limit . That\\ 's why they need subsidies . It simply wouldn\\'t be profitable for them to keep operating without them . \\n\\nNow you may say \ '' Oh that\\ 's not a problem , someone else will come along.\ '' Well sure , someone else will , and then you\\ 'll go back to paying 1 euro/min for your calls ? I don\\'t think it\\ 's a good solution.\\n\\n & gt ; And who are these angels and good samaritans who will organise society for us ? \\n\\nThat\\ 's why we have democracies and why we elect people to do stuff and enforce rules , to make everyone equal . It may not be a perfect system and there are glitches every now and then , but it\\ 's much better than no government at all . Look at Somalia if you want to see how a country without a government looks.\\n\\nI watched part of that video and I still don\\'t see how any of it is relevant to all of this . Those are the very basic concepts of trade , the first baby steps . They ignore the enormous amount of change that the current market underwent . \\n\\nLook at it this way : you have a limited amount of money to spend every month , right ? Now imagine if the prices of agricultural produce have doubled . Could you still feed yourself and your family ? What about those who were living paycheck to paycheck before the increase ? \\n\\nYou might say that the sellers will just import cheaper food from abroad , but then what will happen to your neighbour farmers ? If what you say happens then there won\\'t even be cheaper food from abroad , as almost all of it is from other EU countries . We don\\'t import milk or meat from China for obvious reasons .

Airazz,AskEurope,"Everyone is scared , more or less , because Russia is an unpredictable psychopath . Don\\'t say that \ '' georgians don\\'t give a shit\ '' because they certainly do .

Airazz,AskEurope,"[ This stupid old building . ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/1wZHIcw.jpg ) \\n\\nIt used to be a road police office . Police moved to a brand new building and this one has been abandoned for a while . German company Lidl bought it with plans to demolish it and build a new massive business center . Huge investment , lots of work places , a welcome change to this part of Vilnius.\\n\\nHowever , retarded architects in the government decided that it\\ 's a cultural treasure because this building got some stupid Lenin award a few decades ago for outstanding architecture , back when we were still in the Soviet Union . They made this decision *after* Lidl bought the building.\\n\\nSo far the architects have been convinced that it\\ 's a useless shithole , good only for homeless people , so it\\ 's not worth saving .

If one is intentionally killing lots of innocent people simply because he doesn\\'t like them , then it\\ 's obvious that this person can not be fixed . Again , \ '' an eye for an eye\ '' applies here . Why should they be allowed to live when they ended lives of so many people ? The main problem is that they did this intentionally , they knew what the result is going to be . \\n\\nIn some cases it is not a direct fault , for example some guy gets drunk , tries to drive his car home and hits a bus , killing a bunch of people . It\\ 's terrible , but the guy wasn\\'t intentionally trying to kill anyone . In such case death penalty wouldn\\'t make sense .
