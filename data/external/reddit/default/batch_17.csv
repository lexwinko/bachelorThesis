Atopha,europe,"The article : \\n\\nATHENS\u2014A note from Greece\u2019s finance minister to his prime minister warned that the country needed tough economic overhauls if its economy was to live up to its European aspirations.\\n\\n\u201cWe can take on the task to truly lead the country to a European direction , on condition that the Greeks\u2014those who are living well , not those who are suffering\u2014will make the necessary sacrifices , \u201d the finance minister wrote.\\n\\nThat was in September 1996 . The finance minister was Alekos Papadopoulos and the prime minister was Konstantinos Simitis , but the letter could have been written today.\\n\\nIn the past quarter century , Greece has had a handful of reformist politicians who foresaw the problems that are now threatening the nation with bankruptcy.\\n\\n\\nTheir reform proposals were fought by their colleagues in parliament and savaged by the media and labor unions . They invariably found themselves sidelined.\\n\\nGreece\u2019s international creditors , the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund , have long been insisting that the country push forward , ignoring vested interests , with \u201cstructural\u201d reforms.\\n\\nThey are demanding deep changes to the rules and habits of government , both within the state apparatus and in its interactions with citizens and the private sector , for example via taxation , professional licensing or pensions.\\n\\nSince the eruption of Greece\u2019s debt crisis in 2010 , successive governments have prioritized fiscal austerity\u2014trying to raise government revenue and cut expenditure\u2014instead of tackling deeper reforms of the system head on.\\n\\nMany foreign officials involved in Greece\u2019s ill-starred bailout efforts over the past five years say they have learned what Greece\u2019s past would-be reformist politicians always knew : In Greece , hurting vested interests is harder than taxing citizens to death.\\n\\nMr . Papadopoulos learned that early on.\\n\\nHe held three senior cabinet positions between 1993 and 2002 , and passed key reforms as finance , home affairs and health minister.\\n\\nAs finance minister , he brought in a team from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , which consulted Greece on how to set up its own tax-crime squad.\\n\\nHe introduced Taxis , the digitized tax platform Greeks still use today . His tenure marked some of the first important steps Greece took toward a modern tax system . They were also among the last . Tax avoidance , evasion and fraud are now fingered by Greece\u2019s international creditors as chronic problems keeping Greece from recovery and growth.\\n\\nBy 2002 , Mr. Papadopoulos , who was elected with the center-left Pasok party , could see Greece was veering off the track he had try to put it on as finance minister . He had been part of the Pasok effort to lead Greece into the euro area , and felt at the time that the country was bingeing on the cheap credit that had come with the common European currency.\\n\\nJust as the euphoria of spending euros was spreading through Greek society , Mr. Papadopoulos told Mr. Simitis the country\u2019s finances were out of control . They fell out and Mr. Papadopoulos resigned from the cabinet.\\n\\n\u201cMy fight with Simitis came because in 2002 , instead of accelerating reforms within the euro , they stopped completely . The way things were being managed in the economy was leading us straight to bankruptcy , \u201d he said , resting his head on his hand at a quiet cafe in central Athens.\\n\\nMr . Papadopoulos\u2019s cotton-white hair is testament to his battles : \u201cI was attacked in brutal ways even by my comrades inside Pasok whose constituents were upset because of the reforms I was passing . It came at an enormous personal cost.\u201d\\n\\nTassos Giannitsis is no stranger to this kind of war : His tenure as labor minister was more short lived , and the battles against him even more visceral . Mr. Giannitsis in 2001 , again in the Pasok government led by Mr. Simitis , put forward a comprehensive proposal to reform the pension system.\\n\\nTrade unions , opposition parties and Pasok itself unleashed menace on Mr. Giannitsis.\\n\\n \u2018They called me \u2018the Cassandra\u2019\u2019\\n \u2014Former Greek Labor Minister Tassos Giannitsis \\n\\n\u201cGiannitsis was annihilated after his pension-reform proposals . There are few precedents for this kind of universal attack on a politician , \u201d said Loukas Tsoukalis , a prominent economics professor here.\\n\\nMr . Giannitsis\u2019s proposals , which would have reduced the pension levels Greeks receive and made the system overall more sustainable given the country\u2019s demographic and labor-force trends , were never taken to parliament.\\n\\n\u201cFrom the fridge to the bin ! \u201d said the front page of newspaper To Vima on April 28 , 2001 , as the frozen pension-reform plan was scrapped for good.\\n\\n\u201cWhen I told my colleagues in the cabinet about the reforms I was proposing\u2014which mind you were not the toughest available\u2014the attitude I got was that I was spoiling the party , \u201d Mr. Giannitsis said in an interview.\\n\\n\u201cThey were , like , \u2018everything is going great right now , why are you bothering us with a problem that may implode in a decade ? \u2019\u201d\\n\\nMr . Giannitsis had one supporter in that cabinet meeting : Mr. Papadopoulos , who not only agreed that the reforms were necessary , but famously added that they should be tougher , with deeper cuts to pensions and an overhaul of benefits , because what Mr. Giannitsis was proposing was \u201cpeanuts\u201d compared with what was needed.\\n\\nStefanos Manos , a market-oriented politician on the conservative end of the political spectrum , came before Messrs Papadopoulos and Giannitsis and left a legacy of overhauls in privatizations , tax administration , opening of closed markets like mobile telephony , and reforms of the murky land registry\u2014a key institution in any modern economy that however continues to be a problem in Greece.\\n\\nFew senior politicians in Greece have been as unpopular as Mr. Manos , Mr. Tsoukalis said . In 1998 , Mr. Manos was kicked out of the conservative New Democracy party for supporting a proposal by the opposition , Pasok.\\n\\n\u201cHe was the one key person who so early on talked about the bloated state , the unsustainable pension system , and was blocked repeatedly because of resistance from his own party and from society , \u201d says Mr. Tsoukalis of Mr. Manos.\\n\\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand how so many people would want to have so much , to the detriment of the public good , \u201d Mr. Manos wrote in the foreword of his book . \u201cI made an army of enemies.\u201d\\n\\nThe firebrand Mr. Manos has since been involved in liberal politics in Greece , with parties that seldom get more than 1.5 % of the popular vote.\\n\\nToday , more so than in their times in government , these three politicians and a few others are coming to be seen as among the minority of officials who spotted and attempted to change early on some of the core problems that have led to Greece\u2019s almost intractable crisis today.\\n\\n\u201cThey called me \u2018the Cassandra\u2019\u201d said Mr. Giannitsis of the headlines during his unpopular push for reforming the pension system.\\n\\nCassandra , in the Greek myth , was a clairvoyant doomed to always be right , but never believed .

He\u2019s a gambler and maneuverer whose bold moves are not testaments to vision or cojones but to the unhealthiness of his domestic political situation.\\n\\nHis choice of words in reaction to Turkey\u2019s downing over Syria of a Russian jet\u2014he called it \u201ca stab in the back\u201d\u2014was redolent of another leader who spoke of stabs in the back , and not one whose regime broke any records for longevity.\\n\\nMr . Putin presumably has two immediate goals : Remove sanctions so Russian companies can start rolling over their debts again , without which many may collapse . He also needs higher oil prices to stave off the eventual insolvency of his state.\\n\\nThe Putin regime , let\u2019s recall , arose to loot the benefits of Russian integration in the world economy , not as a reaction against it , despite claims by some today that Russia is motivated by eternal geopolitical insecurities prompted by ( largely mythical ) Western expansionism.\\n\\nHe needs conflict with the West to justify his people\u2019s privation and his failure to allow the diversification and modernization of the Russian economy under a rule of law . He also needs the West\u2019s complicity , which he has mostly gotten . It\u2019s hard to fathom , for instance , why his cheating athletes were allowed at the London Olympics , much less why he was allowed to host the Sochi Olympics . Both would have been unthinkable if the West had publicly recognized his regime\u2019s likely complicity in nuclear terrorism on British soil in the polonium murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko.\\n\\nHis salvation , though he would not phrase it this way , is to become the West\u2019s client regime , while masquerading as a superpower-equal.\\n\\nTruth be told , there are Westerners who would like to accommodate him , but Western politics is not likely to allow it , especially the politics of a post-Obama America.\\n\\nA related problem likely guarantees failure in any case : There is quite probably nothing that U.S. or Western appeasement can do to save the Putin regime from itself in the long run.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the shootdown . Whatever he woke up thinking on Tuesday morning , Mr. Putin now appears to be contemplating playing the victim of NATO aggression ( Turkey is a NATO member ) . Where he goes from here is hard to forecast . Pathological gamblers who get themselves in holes tend to double down . KGB colleagues recall that as a youthful agent Mr. Putin was sidelined to an East German backwater because his recklessness and propensity for miscalculation were unwelcome at a time when the Soviet Union was weak and the KGB had become risk averse.\\n\\nOtto Dietrich , Hitler\u2019s press aide , noted the Fuhrer\u2019s own devolution from \u201cdomestic reformer\u201d into a \u201cforeign-policy desperado and gambler in international politics , \u201d who \u201cbegan to hate objections to his views and doubts on their infallibility . . . . He wanted to speak , but not to listen.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s not exactly reassuring that Mr. Putin\u2019s reaction to Turkey\u2019s defense of its airspace seems to have emerged almost instantly , unlike the shilly-shallying that proceeded his reaction to the blowup of a Russian airliner over Sinai ( perhaps partly because Mr. Putin was trying to figure out if his own security apparatus was involved ) .\\n\\nIf he\u2019s paying attention , Mr. Putin should by now have learned his leverage is much less than he imagines . At least while Angela Merkel is around , he has only managed to turn his important German friend into a quasi-enemy . He has turned a formidable Turkish friend into an actual enemy.\\n\\nOn Friday the Turkish government called in the Russian ambassador for a tongue lashing over Russia\u2019s bombing of ethnic Turks in northern Syria . Tuesday\u2019s downing was clearly not an accident . The Turkish government doesn\u2019t seem to find Mr. Putin quite as impressive as some of his American admirers do.\\n\\nThen again , only the misguided ever did . By March of this year , Russian economist Sergei Guriev estimated that Russia had already spent half its 2015 military budget . Russia\u2019s spending plan was premised on $ 100 oil . This year\u2019s budget hopes for $ 50 oil . Meanwhile , capital flight is running at perhaps $ 100 billion a year . Meanwhile , some of Russia\u2019s biggest companies are verging on default . The Russian army has had to cease recruiting in the fertile Caucasus region due to a worrisome overreliance on Muslim troops . Moscow also faces a growing liability in economically failing Crimea and eastern Ukraine , complicated this week by partisan sabotage of Crimea\u2019s electricity supply.\\n\\nGlobal stock markets dipped only modestly on the Turkish shootdown . Oil jumped a buck . This muted reaction should not be seen as a testament that Mr. Putin or his regime have much of a future .",Turkic,Turkish

However , I don\\'t think many families chooses Albanian to be taught to their children . \\n\\nThe reason is simple , Albanians aren\\'t concentrated in one area , which means there are often not many Albanians in one classrom . Also , even if some of them want to learn Albanian , it won\\'t be helpful to them since they will rarely see any Albanian speaker in their hometown.\\n\\nIt is sad , I really dislike people who just don\\'t bother to learn their ethnic language , but it\\ 's not entirely the state\\ 's fault .

This made the whole education system a mess , every school system having a different curriculum and an agenda . Schools of non Muslims left a bitter memory in the minds of Turks , when they celebrated the occupation of Anatolia before our War of Liberation , and the religious schools too , when they tried to suppress the Liberation War in favor of the Sultan . Atat\u00fcrk closed the religious schools and brought every school under one secular education system . This law is still present today , which means nobody is getting a school for his own .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; Having it as a museum is by no means disrespectful to you . If anything it\\ 's a compliment and that\\ 's the kind of thing people respected Kemal for . How is it disrespecting to you by having it as a museum exactly ? Because you pass on a great opportunity to flaunt your dominance over a great monument ? \\n\\nWhen Istanbul was occupied after the WW1 , christians ( both local and foreigners ) flocked to Hagia Sophia , trying to pray inside . Again and again they got permissions and support from British and pressured Ottoman Administration . They did this despite it being clear that it was a mosque and the Imperial Mosque at that . They came to our lands and spit on our face ( figuratively ) . Yes , giving respect and forgiving those that disrespected you is a virtuous action and deserves respect . BUT doing it at the expense of your ancestors and people is anything but virtuous . I consider the situation of Atat\u00fcrk making it a museum suspect and do not believe he did it with full knowledge . If he actually did it then he should be ashamed and I would consider such an action as unbefitting for someone like him.\\n\\n & gt ; As far as i know mosques in Greece or Bulgaria aren\\'t turned into churches.\\n\\nThey were simply destroyed outright or left to disrepair ( for much of Ottoman heritage in Balkans , leaving it is same as destroying them ) .\\n\\n & gt ; On the other hand , Turkey is not only trying to turn Hagia Sophia into a mosque , it has already done this with other churches but we\\ 're not talking about that . \\n\\nIt is already a mosque.\\n\\n & gt ; We\\ 're talking about Hagia Sophia because it\\ 's a huge monument that you could preserve as a museum unlike what you\\ 're doing with other churches.\\n\\nWe can also preserve it as a mosque and my people can go and feel the same things as their ancestors did . I fail to see how using it as a museum is preserving anything . Taking it and turning it into a zoo ( not much different ) only preserves building and nothing else . Culture is something that lives , and continuing traditions for centuries while keeping to their original meaning is the thing we should do . There are traditions around Hagia Sophia that we still know and can save before it is too late.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's gold considering the Ottoman Empire used the Parthenon as a gunpowder storage and was half responsible for the single greatest of our monuments getting blown the fuck up.\\n\\nI won\\'t say we cared about your heritage , we didn\\'t . For us it was same as any building . And that explosion also caused deaths of hundreds of people but I guess it was our fault for using \ '' gunpowder storage\ '' . I can understand that it was negligence but it was certainly not on purpose . Many many sites made by Greeks still exists and slowly restored . We don\\'t destroy them because \ '' muh evil Greeks\ '' . \\n\\n & gt ; Name one Ottoman mosque of the scale of Hagia Sophia in the balkans for me please . Don\\'t tell me about random irrelevant mosques cause we\\ 're not telling you about random irrelevant churches in Turkey either . We\\ 're talking about something the size and importance of Hagia Sophia.\\n\\nI thought it was about history and culture but as you clearly show it is about symbolism . Those \ '' random irrelevant\ '' mosques are part of our history and they are the \ '' history and culture\ '' of Turkish people . Funny how you disregard them because of their size . And yes , I realize you don\\'t give a shit about neither your own \ '' history and culture\ '' or ours , it is all about \ '' size and importance\ '' aka its symbolic value . Had you actually cared about it , you would have spoken about hundreds of Greek historical sites that are actually in danger unlike Hagia Sophia . But no , not even 1/1000th care is given to them . And that is exactly my point about you people being hypocrites . We are honest about what we are , we will continue to be so.\\n\\n & gt ; Honestly it\\ 's pointless to debate with someone that sees the Hagia Sophia as a spoil of war and as a \ '' trophy\ '' of conquering another civilization\\ 's city . You have zero respect for the building , for you it\\ 's only something to fuel your warmongery . \ '' Look what we took from you ! It\\ 's ours now and it\\ 's a mosque ! Suck it ! \ '' It fully shows what i meant about the kind of message you\\ 'd be sending out . It\\ 's sad really.\\n\\nYes , I am completely open about it .

Result will be this ; if you want to be respected , first deserve it by actions . You can start by giving us an equal \ '' goodwill\ '' action instead of demands and shit . Considering the \ '' size and importance\ '' of Hagia Sophia , you should start with restoring at least a hundred Ottoman sites ( mosques , shrines , tombs , etc .

It is still owned by the waqf ( fund ) created Mehmet II the Conqueror . He put Hagia Sophia under his private ownership after the conquest instead of the state ownership . State barely have any right to manage Hagia Sophia and its estates and can only do so because all wakfs were put under collective management . Technically all those wakfs are still required to keep to the will of the person that created the wakf . And AFAIK it specifically states Hagia Sophia is to be used as a mosque.\\n\\nIn addition , the order from the council of ministers which decided change to museum is also suspect . The signature wrote \ '' K.Atat\u00fcrk\ '' but was signed before Mustafa Kemal\\ 's got the Atat\u00fcrk surname legally . ( Something like that . [ Here is a discussion about it if you know Turkish ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KvR9q_Bbssk ) . Warning : It is long ) \\n\\nSo Hagia Sophia is still legally a mosque but people are \ '' illegally\ '' prevented from prayers . Though it being used as a museum is not actually exclusive of it being used as a mosque.\\n\\nTo add to this no one other than Turks has any right to speak against our decision . Orthodox Christians could have some justification to ask for a goodwill but they lost it after what they have done to mosques/masjids/tekkes/shrines/tombs on the lands they gained from us . Catholics lost it after they looted ( literally everything , they even took parts of walls thinking it would heal them . WTF ? ! ) and made prostitute sing on inside it .",Turkic,Turkish

Even if they did , their ethnicity is Turkic now , simply because language is the main factor of ethnicity for much of the world .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"& gt ; Ethnicity of the ruler does not determine that.\\n\\nOf course it does . It is not the only thing that determines it but is an important part . What determines being a Turkish state is how much of the state apparatus was created and led by Turks . Also how much Turkic influence the state had . Many Turkic ruled states from Ottomans to Safavids to Mughals had quite a lot common with how they came to power and how their state apparatus worked . Population itself is not the main determinator . Indeed , it is not the citizens that create the state but the ones in power . Citizens merely participate.\\n\\nFYI the first Turkic state in middle east was Tulunids . AFAIK they literally minted coins calling their state Turk . ( I remember it mentioned by the Prince Abbas Hilmi who , by the way , is of Egyptian dynasty.Whom are also Turkic : P ) \\n\\n & gt ; I mean we are not discussing his theological views here.\\n\\nAnd I didn\\'t say anything about theology . Founding ideology of Safavid Empire was based on Safaviyya Tariqah and also Shia sect . Shah Ismail who was a Turk was the person solely responsible for decision to adopt Shiism . Thus he and his followers were the pivot that created the Safavid state . It was Iranians that bowed down to Turkmen , not the other way around . \\n\\n & gt ; Just because Shah Ismael was of Turkish origin , and it had some religious mumbo jumbo , the Safavids do not become Turkish . \\n\\nIt does . One doesn\\'t lose his ethnicity after conquering some place . We conquered eastern roman empire and we are still Oghuz . Todays ancestors of todays Azerbaijani Turks were the ones that created the Safavid state . And those ancestors include thousands upon thousands of people that came from Anatolia and other Turkmen groups nearby . \\n\\n & gt ; Safavid Empire was not Turkish state . \\n\\nIt was . Did it become more Persianized as centuries passed , yeah . But its foundations stayed same . It can be either considered Turkic or Turco-Persian . Just like Ottomans . By the way all Turkic beyliks in Anatolia ( Including Karamanids ) used Persian for their state work , do you also consider them Persian ? This is ridiculous.\\n\\n & gt ; For your information , Mehmet the second was half Greek . Does Ottoman Empire become Greek or what is this logic really ? \\n\\nBlood doesn\\'t determine ethnicity but culture . Mehmed was culturally Turkish . His English language was Turkish , he was the leader of a cultural branch of Oghuz , called himself Han , etc.. Pretty much every outsider saw him as a Turk . Anatolian Turks are genetically closest to the English Anatolians but we are not fucking Hittites . I certainly am not a Greek or a Lycian . IMHO those that became Turks out of choice were smart ones , those that did through sword were weak shits . Better this way.\\n\\n & gt ; Safavids were referred as \ '' Ajams\ '' by the Ottomans . Care to know what Ajam means ? Iranian in Arabic.\\n\\nAnd central anatolia was called \ '' Rum\ '' until few centuries ago . Does that make Turkmen tribes and beyliks Greek ? Iran was predominantly populated by Iranians for centuries . That is why we called it Ajam . Yet they were ruled by Turks until very recently . ( Even today , some people call Azerbaijani Turks are sometimes called \ '' acem\ '' . ) \\n\\nAlso no , Ajam has a complicated history and meaning . Certainly not just used for \ '' Persians\ '' . \\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's like saying Turkey is full Kurds . Ridiculous . They are minority in Iran.\\n\\nTurks were minority in Ottoman empire for a while as well . Doesn\\'t change anything . Iran was ruled by Turks for centuries and they did it while being a minority . Power of sword changes a lot . Albanians taking roles in the government didn\\'t make Ottomans non-Turkish . ( Not to say they don\\'t have a share . It is not a zero sum game . ) Safavids were at least Turkish as it was Persian . \\n\\n & gt ; This has nothing to do with Safavids not being Turkish , I did not say our history started with Ottomans . Seljuks and Ottomans were of Turkish dynasties , granted . Safavid ? You got ta be kidding me.\\n\\nAnd are Azerbaijani Turks not the other branch of Oghuz Turks which made up the Seljuks ? \\n\\n & gt ; Fetret means period of leaderless rule .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"So am I understanding it correctly that \ '' keeping\ '' it a mosque as its owner decided 600 years ago is being disrespectful ? I fail to understand how keeping/making it a mosque causes a disrespect \ '' history and culture\ '' . Especially considering it was not a museum in our \ '' history and culture\ '' . I guess it is only important when it comes to how it was in european history and culture . Place of Hagia Sophia in our history is as a trophy , the greatest of trophies . It is the symbol of our ownership of Istanbul , our victory against Romans and making their achievements ours ( both for past ones and for others continued to be made under ottoman empire ) . Making it a museum **is disrespecting our history , and our people that earned us Hagia Sophia with their blood**\ '' \\n\\nAs for blowing it up , destroying such a great building for no reason would be being stupid but it would still be in our rights .

Turning a church into a mosque or a mosque into a church are both shitty and petty.\\n\\nI agree that it is shitty but pettyness depends on the circumstances . Hagia Sophia was turned into mosque to declare Islam being supreme and the conquest of Constantinople . It had a big propaganda effect which continues today , albeit diminished.\\n\\n & gt ; A lot of old small churches are left abandoned and without repairs as well . There\\ 's a shitload of them sometimes it\\ 's not possible to restore them all . There are many more important and bigger mosques that are being preserved in many countries however . That\\ 's not a justification for what Turkey is doing . \\n\\nYeah , not repairing them because of the lack of resources and other priorities is completely understandable but I am not talking about such cases.\\n\\n & gt ; Not repairing a mosque is nowhere near as insulting or provoking as converting it into a worship site for a different religion ( considering it\\ 's being done out of spite like you\\ 've admitted ) .\\n\\nYes , but question is why should we be the ones that stomach the insult when the other side did/does similar stuff .

[ Sixth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=21m40s ) show how its dome looks today.Ibrahim Pasha must have loved Jesus a lot for making a mosque with his picture . /s\\n\\n- [ Fifth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m18s ) is tomb of Beyazid Baba . They even turned tomb of a **muslim guy** into a church . Mind that his remains are still inside . I would say worse could happen but as we can see it already does . \\n\\n- [ Seventh one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m29s ) is from macedonia about a mosque ( known as Imaret Mosque ) that got destroyed and replaced with a church.\\n\\n- [ Eight one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=22m48s ) is Faik Pasha mosque ( they pronounced the location as \ '' navra\ '' but I couldn\\'t find the transliteration ) . It was used as a brothel . Yes , a **BROTHEL**.\\n\\n- [ Ninth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=23m12s ) is S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque ( It think was a church before and returned back to a church ) . This one is actually understandable and justified , others are not.\\n\\n- They also talk about mosques in Thessaloniki that were tuned into night clubs.\\n\\n- [ Tenth one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=23m48s ) was Musa Baba Shrine in Chios . It was destroyed or more like demolished with explosives . Here they comment about it like this ; \ '' There were things that got destroyed here ( Turkey ) as well\ '' , \ '' We wouldn\\'t be sad about ones that get destroyed but these ... \ '' , \ '' We demolished some as well but not this way ( referring to purposeful destruction with explosives ) \ '' \\n\\n- [ Eleventh one ] ( https : //youtu.be/KvR9q_Bbssk ? t=24m8s ) is called Hasan Baba Shrine and it seem they tried to destroy it with explosives but failed : /\\n\\nI guess we were both wrong when we assumed mosques not being turned into churches . Much worse stuff is being done . Only difference is our side pretty much forgot ( or was forced to forget by the state ) about them yet your side continue to whine . As if it was not enough , europeans continue to whine about it as well.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nI won\\'t answer other parts because it is pretty much fallacy and insults . ( At least you real feelings are showing through . ) Kinda funny that you are continuing to act as if I reject not caring about culture . We are not pretending about our intentions . We mostly care about our culture and marginally about others . We also changed those churches into mosques to humiliate our enemies.\\n\\nDifference between your people and mine is that we are honest about what we are , yet your people are not . We do not try to whitewash the history with falsehoods and coverups , in our view reality is quite fine . We do not say \ '' muh history and culture\ '' instead of our real feelings . We say \ '' if you insult us , we will return it back\ '' . Let\\ 's be honest , your people are as bad as mine . Be open about it and give us truth , then we will respect you . Let\\ 's not pretend as if your people don\\'t actually want Istanbul and Anatolia back.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to answer back if these don\\'t change your view at least a little bit .

More importantly there was water in every town ( probably not in villages ) . \\n\\nIn my experience , water and cleanness is a big part of our culture . And every old town you visit will have at least few historical fountains . Building small fountains was considered an important charity and it continues today . In Istanbul there are thousands of disused old fountains every few streets . And every old mosque has a place for storing water in the middle of courtyard .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"I shall try to explain it as much as I understand . I must ask you to not come to conclusions prematurely because when it comes to islam things are a lot more complicated and context changes many things . I guess this is true for everything but if you take Islam and evaluate it in comparison to christianity , you will surely misunderstand even most basic parts . And yes , it will be long ... . \\n\\n & gt ; I heard that Islamic State are killing their fellow Muslims in Syria for minor violations of Islamic custom , like eating in daytime during the Ramadan , and that they justify it by accusing them of being apostates . \\n\\nISIS follows a relatively modern reform movement called Salafism/Wahhabism . It is kind of similar to what Protestant movement is to Catholicism . They are claiming to take islam back to its roots and purify it from later additions . Now , you have to understand that islamic law works , is similar to how modern law works with Quran and Sunnah being the framework , then building upon precedent rulings by other judges to decide on laws . This is called taqlid ( imitating ) . So these people reject these rulings and try to do it again but instead of taking past rulings they want to use primary sources ( Quran/Sunnah ) to decide on everything . They are also literalist and strict as in they consider whatever is written should be applied even in cases of metaphors and application is without excuses . This \ '' without excuses\ '' part is very problematic for mainstream islam as sinning doesn\\'t make someone non muslim . \\n\\nAnother problem is declaring people apostates . Yes , there are precedents of such thing happening but it was extremely rare occurrence . Because as in many islamic laws , repentance is an important part on how judge decides . One couldn\\'t just declare another person an apostate , only way for such a case to occur is it the perpetrator is openly declaring islam as a false religion . Anything less he will most certainly get away with lesser punishment . And so long as someone says they are muslim , no one can really say he is not . others can say he is a sinner and tell wrong things but he will still say a muslim . In Turkey many people drink and flaunt every principle of Islam but they are still muslims according to Sunni ( specifically hanafi ) school.\\n\\nIn theory people could be punished with death for thievery but in practice unless there were other big crimes accompanied , it never applied . Randomly googling I found [ this article ] ( http : //dokuman.tsadergisi.org/dergiler_pdf/2008/2008-Agustos/4.pdf ) talking about number of people accused with thievery during 16th to 18th centuries in the city of Bursa ( one of the bigger cities in turkey ) . Across 2 hundred years , 1 to 9 people got killed out of 29 thievery cases . What are the changes that there were only 29 thiefs in a big city ? You have to understand one of the main intentions of law during that time is to make a warning to other people who might try . So in practice only few people got killed even for such laws . But if you look at ISIS they judge dozens to death every day . \\n\\n & gt ; Are Islamic State really practicing an authentic version of Sharia Law ? If not , then how can Muslims even believe that there is only one \ '' true interpretation\ '' of the Quaran ? \\n\\nIn one of the suras inside Quran tells that God will protect the Quran from being corrupted unlike other holy books . So for a muslim , Quran is protected in case of both its writing and its meaning . So whatever meaning Quran has ( single or multiple ) , they are intended and it is still commands of God.\\n\\nNow , there are many differing views on this , but my own understanding ; \\n\\n**Single** : There is no reason for God to put different views so there must be one meaning that is right every time . Just like how rights and wrong don\\'t change so must the teachings of Islam must be universal.\\n\\n**Multiple** : Times and cultures change so God must have considered its teaching to be right for each and every one of these cases . So all interpretations can be true depending on context.\\n\\nSo how do people decide on any of these ? Usually it differs between theological schools and which sunnahs they accept , other theological principles they accept , also different levels of emphasis they put on different techniques of lawmaking , etc . It is fucking endless ... . So every different movement decides on this and thing are also very fluid , there are many in betweens . And this is also so hard to generalise for 1.9 billion muslims , so might as well try to generalize human culture . \\n\\nWhat you should get from this is that they will never agree on what is the exact \ '' true interpretation\ '' , you might as well ignore it . Islamic laws and theology is a lifetime study and even then you can only understand a very limited portion of it . \\n\\nWhen people ask for sharia , they are merely asking their own interpretation of world to be made into law . Does this seem familiar ? Yes , it is how laws are made right now , by popularity . Only difference is they want Quran and Sunnah to be framework for laws ( kind of like constitution ) .\\n\\nSo No ISIS doesn\\'t follow any authentic version and they don\\'t even follow mainstream version . Most people here in Turkey consider them monsters , few agree with some of what they do but even that is varied and have different nuances instead of supporting ISIS . ISIS people are pretty much outcasts of Islam.\\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm genuinely confused here . I keep hearing about how we Europeans are in danger of Sharia from all the Muslims coming here , yet I can\\'t figure out what it\\ 's even supposed to mean in practice . There are Muslim Arbitration Tribunals in Britain , for example . So , why do British Muslims want Sharia law when they basically already have it ? \\n\\nAs an atheist , I had housemates and friends from all kinds of muslims from conservatives to fundamentalists and have spent half my life arguing with them . Result is , even I have no idea how it is gon na be in practice . pretty much very few people disagree on how to do it . So say it will be like how it was in Ottoman times but when it comes to exact details , they all differ . And Ottomans changed so much through time and practiced differently depending on region , how are we gon na choose any of that ? Some pass the problem to scholars but as far as I know situations like Iran where islamic scholars rule are very rare . Instead there were usually a secular ruler who were also the highest authority , so ruler and sacred . \\n\\nNow , my interpretation of people asking sharia is like people who want to live in utopia . My mother who is vehemently secular also says if you can get her \ '' True Islam\ '' , she can accept it as it would be perfect harmony or something . No idea what it means in practice.\\n\\nIn reality though , satisfying people who want sharia is not really hard to do . I can give some suggestions on how I think it can be done ; \\n\\nYou see in modern nations , autonomy and special laws apply by geography but in places like Ottoman Empire special laws differed by your religion and local judges ( called [ Millet system ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_\\\\ ( Ottoman_Empire\\\\ ) ) ) . There were a pretense of universality but in practice groups were sharply divided but also applied locality . \\n\\nLet\\ 's say you were a greek . I meant you personally were subject to the law of Greek Orthodox church and you didn\\'t follow sharia law . And an armenian followed laws of Armenian church . If there were a problem between two groups , laws of injured party applied ( unless one party was muslim then sharia applied ) . These religious authorities decided on taxes and many other parts , so in practice they were autonomous so long as they didn\\'t act against Sultan . It is kind of odd compared to modern law where if you move somewhere , that provinces laws may apply to you . Imagine that everywhere in the empire , people were subjected to laws of their own group . This is present in many countries in the middle east , past and present . It is kind of why this area is so diverse and homogeneity is uncommon . So what muslim people want is for their own laws to apply when there is a problem between two of them . They don\\'t want universal civil laws between everyone but their own civil laws . Of course there would be some laws above this as in constitution , human rights , etc but when they have a problem about their marriage , they don\\'t want to be beholden to secular laws based on christian laws of the past . They have their own thoughts on how marriage , inheritance , defamation , etc laws . Islamic law being above others are of course wouldn\\'t be possible but I don\\'t think there would be any problem because some suras ( or sunnahs ) also ask people to obey the laws of their country so long as it allow them to practice their religion . \\n\\nI must admit I have a lot of sympathy to these kinds of laws . Kind of different laws for different demographics . This can get very complicated , of course but if people hundreds of years ago managed to do it , we can do it too . In a limited context it can work great.\\n\\n & gt ; I realise that you can\\'t speak for all Muslims , as a Turk , but in your opinion , is there any way we could coexist with the migrants ? Because it doesn\\'t seem like they\\ 're going to stop coming anytime soon , and everyone is really upset about it.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any reason for you not live together . There will be some tension as is usual when people of different values meet but all these can be handled with proper state and civil guidance . What is important is to make sure these people don\\'t get confined to ghettos and low-income trap . I heard in germany many turks can\\'t integrate because of how system favors selecting people from early age and makes transfers between good schools and bad ones very hard . So you have make sure these people who are less educated and have less means to be able to improve with state support . Not for everyone but for successful children like scholarships , etc.\\n\\nWow , I wrote so much I hit the word limit and had to shorten some . And I need to sleep as it is 4pm here .

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"Whole point of creating secular nationalist identity was to keep people together as much as possible with a single unifying idea .

Also Arabs had rebelled ; our muslim brothers stabbed us in the back . Wouldn\\'t people ask \ '' what about them ? \ '' ? \\n\\nBUT secular nationalist identity was still based on Sunni Islam ( a subset of it , namely muslims loyal to the Ottoman state ) . That is why Diyanet doesn\\'t include Alevis . ( At least % 10 of population .

I merely said that I am wary about accepting such claims ( \ '' ..defences against Turkish orders of deportation ... are **retrospectively depicted as Armenian rebellions** ... \ '' ) so easily because the implications are quite far reaching . There being an actual rebellion or not is very important and what happened Balkans is quite relevant to the motive and possible continuation of how such rebellion might end . \ '' Armenian national liberation movement\ '' didn\\'t come out of thin air , they were quite informed at what happened in Balkans . \\n\\n & gt ; It doesn\\'t matter how people use it , this is not about your reputation or what random people who have no education in this matter think . Yes , genocide is a crime in itself and by international law it does matter if you classify something as a genocide or not . I know there are people who call every massacre a genocide because it sounds more dramatic to them but that\\ 's not relevant to this discussion . There are scholars in genocide studies and only their verdict needs to be heeded . I don\\'t even understand what your point is . We should just stop distinguishing between genocides and massacres because random people with no credentials throw the word around nowadays ? \\n\\nDude , all I am saying is that it is \ '' too connected with Holocaust , politically charged and used ambiguously\ '' . It is fucking ambiguous because right now you are talking about the \ '' genocide the crime\ '' as if it is same since the crime happened before being defined and AFAIK the court didn\\'t give verdict on it . Then you talk about genocide scholars like they somehow have right to decide . Many of them use different definitions for \ '' genocide\ '' which makes all these more and more ambiguous . Seriously , I merely said I dislike the term ... only to be shown why I dislike it in action.\\n\\n & gt ; Holocaust\\n\\nWhether the word Holocaust is exclusive term doesn\\'t matter .

And I explained that when muslims say they don\\'t support equality , they can also mean something else than what european people understand . We are not you , we have a different culture and mentality . And you have to take into account who said this , where they said it , and whom did they say this . Else you take it out of context and risk slandering people.\\n\\nYou take things you heard about muslims then fit them into a stereotype and act as if Erdogans also support it . How do you know it is \ '' actually oppression\ '' ? I know people ( including women ) that support similar things and they are quite sincere about their thoughts . You don\\'t have to support it but it is not \ '' sick\ '' and it has logical consistency.\\n\\n & gt ; Also who is to decide which rights are proper for men and which rights are proper for women . Who is to judge this ? *\\n\\nSame ones that decided it before . For Turkey it is Turkish people , not you or anyone else . Did europeans ask us when they were doing their laws ? No they did it themselves according to their own culture and situation . Now they are trying to force their values unto us . Act as if we are monsters for being who we are.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; As far as mr & amp ; misses Erdogan ... it looks like an oxymoron one to say that not all \ '' roles\ '' are proper for women ( actually says stay home with the kids ) and the other one to call women to take more \ '' roles\ '' in society . One of them is a hypocrite it seems.\\n\\nI don\\'t see him asking to ban women from taking different roles . Where did you read this ? Not on the articles of OP and you posted . His own daughter and wife are very active on social projects , so he clearly doesn\\'t mean only \ '' stay home with the kids\ '' . Wanting different roles for men and women or putting what he called \ '' motherhood\ '' doesn\\'t necessarily mean women have to stay home . \\n\\n & gt ; So if I may ask you ... . how can you not see that ? \\n\\nI see many wrong things supported by Erdogan but I don\\'t read into his \ '' intents\ '' because that is fallacy . You can claim things are going become like that but then talk about those , not this or that individual.\\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish

CInk_Ibrahim,europe,"Just watched bit of the stream to learn what happened in other players . And it seems people didn\\'t get why I did those release vassal stuff . I would like to explain myself and give my reasoning as to why it could have been good strategy . ( /u/hajutze here ) \\n\\nI was honestly expecting to play as Hosokawa since the excel sheet showed it like that . So when I discovered I got Ottomans , it was kinda late to strategize . I expected a coalition so asked few \ '' helpful spirits\ '' and they confirmed it some of coalition members . But I didn\\'t expect so many big powers joining it . Now , no one really told me the exact coalition but looking at the excel sheet and seeing how so many of them played nations close to each other in last game ( Morocco , Andalusia , Tunis , Mamluks ) , I connected the dots . Some of those didn\\'t really have any reason to attack me . So I tried to reason with them but it seems they didn\\'t do it because it would be beneficial but for \ '' roleplay\ '' reasons . As if those nation ever really cared for ERE in real history . I tried to offer them complete peace and no movement into europe but all I got was \ '' sorry\ '' , silence and \ '' Deus Vult\ '' . I tried to enlist eastern powers but they didn\\'t want suicide with me . ( IMHO this is literally ~~nation ruining~~* fucking up another player\\ 's game . It is also very rude . ) \\n\\nAt this point I didn\\'t really have much choice . I could just give up and choose another nation but , meh , that\\ 's pathetic . So I did what I only could , I tried to make it as hard for my enemies as possible . In the last game I was Qara and Timurid rebels fucked up my army very badly during the game . So I wanted to do something like that . I also didn\\'t want to give them lands they want . After few trials in SP , I realized scutage prevent your vassals from being annexed in a war . Thats why I released Bulgaria . So that Hungary and Poland wouldn\\'t be able to gain anything . I wanted to release Epirus and give it balkans to prevent ERE but I realized the force limit penalty for having vassals too late . I also planned to fuck up my nation and generate rebels when war started . But it seems Ottomans are too stable for that shit . \\n\\nThe reason I attacked the Knights was to finish one of them before the coalition started . In the first startup which failed , the Knights actually had allies so I couldn\\'t attack him . But after restart , it seems they forgot to ally the Knights . His only ally was Byzantium and I wondered if the Byzantium player might join the war by mistake . It would have been great so I tried it . Then the game crashed and the Knights player didn\\'t join . Since I didn\\'t really need the land , I just white peaced . But after learning , the player joined in the next break . Fucking knights , they were always sneaky ... \\n\\nIf I had enough time to test it before the game , I am sure I could do it . If we have priority for veterans in the next game , I will do it 10 times better . IMHO given smart strategy , Ottomans can actually take so many enemies with them . It might not win , but it can turn it into Pyrrhic victory . ( If Lithuanian , Bohemian and Byzantium armies were to be destroyed . It would be a good lesson . ) I also made mistakes . For example , I expected them to move quickly against me but they actually waited until the truce ended . I could have taken advantage of this and declared war first . Stability hit is actually exactly what you want when you need to generate rebels . I could have devastated Byzantium and quickly moved to one of the others and make sure their army is destroyed . It could also fuck up their coordination . Just like how it happened when one of them fucked up and attacked against me across straits.\\n\\nEdit : By the way it was actually fun .

That is the problem and as a ideology , it should be pacified . Same way Khawarij was handled by the orthodox Muslims . By rejecting them as one of them . By denying them using the Hanbali school as their shield and clearly differentiating them . By crippling the states ( primarily Saudis ) that support this ideology .

Sufis I am talking about are ones that continue hundreds years old traditions and literally \ '' Paths\ '' one can choose if they wish to explore Islam in detail . And what Gulenists do or want is not my problem . My view towards them is same as other parasitic sects . ( Well , as a Turk , I see them as betrayers . ) Those that exploit people for their own ends using lies should be punished.\\n\\n & gt ; These people can get a bit more secularized & amp ; integrated and not listen to anyone who tells them what God really wants them to be . I mean , that\\ 's a possibility nobody mentions . It\\ 's always Saudis manipulate them in this way , let\\ 's manipulate them in that other way.\\n\\nSo ? You can not secularize them against their wishes . Salafists can only reach out to those Muslims because there is already a demand from young people wanting to be more involved in their religion . If Muslims in Europe didn\\'t feel any need , they would go to NGOs for their social sensibilities . Question you need to answer is how can you make people care less about their religion ? There are few ways to do it and most of them are quite distasteful . And very very hard to do without breaking basic human rights . Even then it might not work.\\n\\nIf you are dreaming about some ideology that encourages integration/secularization , IMHO you will find nothing people would willingly follow . It is simply do not answer any of their problems in a way they would be happy . \\n\\n & gt ; These people are not flocks of sheep looking for shepherds . If the societies they exist in think and act as though they are this special kind of sheep then that approach itself is a problem and needs to be recognized as such.\\n\\nThey are people , living in a place where their religion is not accepted thus they feel their lack of it more clearly . They are people wishing to be better muslims but can not find established movements they can reach . Calling them sheep is such a generalizing thing . Are people following political ideologies also sheeps ? Are left and right simply product of someone introducing it ? Or are they simply already existing ideas that was organized and structured by others . \\n\\nAlso I think you are contradicting yourself . You say they are not sheeps and then talk about secularizing them . There is already nothing preventing them from secularizing . If they wished to integrate/secularize , they can simply take up the dominant culture and ignore religion . The fact that they do not do this , despite having the alterEnglish is the reason we are talking about it . \\n\\nAll I am saying is that , these people can not reach alterEnglish religious ideas . Money simply allow such movements to reach people more easily . These radical ideas are largely denied in greater Muslim world and the places these people immigrate from . If Europeans allow and encourage these kinds of alterEnglishs to exist , they will not have to see such radical groups . This is not about let\\ 's fight this with that , more about evening the playground . No one is forcing these people to go to mosques . But if the only mosque they can reach is salafi ... \\n\\nThey can also invite other established organizations like Turkish Diyanet but I doubt they are willing to do it .

These young militants were armed with military style guns including sniper rifles and considering the amount of IEDs used , they must have been trained beforehand about how to make them . It is widely believed that PKK stored weapons during the ceasefire and were preparing for this .

And considering the event at the end of the war , I am sure it would not be without hundreds of thousands of my people dying . I think there was enough risk that it can be considered a justification . But it shouldn\\'t matter . Innocents died and there should be justice for them even if the perpetrator had a reason .

( It was an industrialized massacre . ) Is it not politically charged ? And doesn\\'t pretty much everyone uses it ambiguously ? The fact that you even bring up the number of victims already show me that you simply use is as a bigger/worse massacre . It is ambiguous because if we take the meaning most people use , then pretty much every war would be a \ '' genocide\ '' .

I mean our history is quite full of bloodshed and usually we are not particularly ashamed of it.\\n\\n & gt ; Also note that there was never any court judgement for the Holocaust to have been a genocide . The Nuremberg trials were largely about war crimes . The accused were never punished for genocide . The genocide , specifically committed in time of peace was deemed lawful . The Holocaust also was committed prior to the coining of the term genocide which was sometime in 1944 . For all intents and purposes these ( non ) arguments ( need a court judgement , genocide was invented after , ... ) apply equally to both genocides.\\n\\nBut the term \ '' genocide\ '' is still too connected with it . No one can accept it without being put into the same level as Nazis . \\n\\nAnd there is also the matter of it being selectively applied because the western countries only care about some of them . I consider this to be the most denigrating part of such acceptance . Frankly , even though I consider it a genocide , I would be reluctant to ask my state to accept a resolution which apologizes for it . Simply because similar things done to us by others are not considered as such .

Simply because he did a lot of contradictory stuff on that subject . And we don\\'t know what he actually thinks . Of course there are some things that no sincere Muslim would say . For example in one of his letters , he was calling a verse from quran something like \ '' nonsense\ '' which is a big no . On the opposite side ; there was a religious singer H\u00e2f\u0131z* Kem\u00e2l G\u00fcrses whom Atat\u00fcrk is said to love listening and even give his Surname .

And conversions caused most of the populace to \ '' become Turk\ '' across centuries . The slowness of this is the main reason for the converts to not retain their identity . In places where mass conversions happened , they retained their identity quite well . ( Bosniaks and Albanians . Maybe Roma and Pomaks as well . ) \\n\\nTo give an example , In 1583 % 44 of Muslims , whom constituted the majority in Trabzon , was either first or second generation converts .

Caunos,europe,"Okay once upon a time there was a religious community that followed Fethullah G\u00fclen ( I will call them Gulenists ) . Erdogan and Gulen had a good relationship so Erdogan put lots of people from the community to important positions and Gulenists cheated on exams to get into these and some other positions . Some of Turkish people opposed these but Erdogan ignored them and since majority of Turkish people supported him they got away . Few years ago Gulen and Erdogan had a conflict . Gulenists published some tapes that prove frauds of some ministers\\ ' and Erdogan\\ 's families and themselves . They are now seen as terrorists . And majority of Turkish people ignored these tapes and he won next elections again ( We have this retarded mentality that called \ '' Yiyor ama \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131yor\ '' . Roughly translates into \ '' he takes bribes but he does good things/works so we don\\'t give a fuck\ '' ) . Erdogan started purging Gulenists slowly . After two and a half years the coup happened . Erdogan has the support of people more than ever and coup was made by Gulenists ( It is claimed that the Gulenist commanders were going to purged in the high military council later this year . So they made this coup attempt as a last chance ) . So , this massive purge happened . \\n\\nAnswer of your questions are : \\n\\n1 . Most people are ok.\\n\\n2 . Well , we can say that he is cleaning but it is more than likely he will use this to also \ '' clean\ '' the opposition against him . And innocent Gulenists ( people follow G\u00fclen but do not cheat on any exams or didn\\'t commit any offense ) can also in danger . To give an example from myself , my high school was private and it was owned by Gulenists . And I have Gulenist friends and they are most likely innocent .

If Anatolia were still under orthodox greek rule the accepted European/Asian border would not be the Bosphorus but somewhere around the Syrian/Iraq/Iran border . \\n\\nSecondly , Cyprus is on the Asian continent so their issues needn\\'t be included in this sub either then correct ? \\n\\nThirdly , the Greek island of Rhodes and several others in the Dodecanese are further south and east of some of Turkey\\ 's biggest \ '' asian\ '' cities . \\n\\nFourthly , \ '' Asia\ '' was the name of a small province of Greek Anatolia and was not used to describe the continent as a whole until after Ottoman conquest . \\n\\nFifthly , lets take a country of similar size to Eastern Thrace , say for example Holland , then lets give them a whole swath of territory that they own anywhere else in the world . Because they own territory that is \ '' outside of Europe\ '' no matter how vast it may be , does it make the part that lay within Europe any less european ? Was The United Kingdom and less a part of Europe because ( percentage wise ) a similar portion of the empire existed outside the bounds of Europe ? \\n\\nSixthly , I don\\'t care what you think but Izmir and Antalya feel more European than many parts of Europe do even though they\\ 're \ '' Asian\ '' .\\n\\nSeventhly , Did I mention that Cyprus is an Asian island ? \\n\\nEighthly , Isn\\'t it funny how the bounds of Europe ( politically ) stretch north , south and around Turkey but take extra care to exclude as much of Turkey as possible ? To include Georgia and Armenia which are so obviously east of Anatolia and Cyprus which is south and east , it makes the intention of political cartographers so apparent . If you\\ 're Christian you\\ 're in but if you\\ 're Muslim then don\\'t mind as we carefully draw a circle of exclusion around you . [ My Point ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/vDOVKr9.png ) Just admit \ '' Europe\ '' is a religious designation and leave the geographic argument out of it.\\n\\nNinthly , this is a sub that discusses the issues that face Europe , not issues that take place solely within the confines of Europe .

Each state was very autonomous up until the constitution replaced the articles of confederation , but perhaps more-so up until the civil war when the federal government\\ 's claim to dominion over the states was solidified . The common way to refer to the USA was \ '' these states united\ '' in contrast to \ '' these united states\ '' to give you an idea.\\n\\nThe autonomy of each of the US\\ 's states has slowly eroded over time and this is what\\ 'll happen to a federalized EU .

Dracaras,europe,This is not an excuse for your thievery . I wouldnt expect anything less from the United Kingdom though . Your whole empire was built on the tears of the non-British people .

But then your army stupidly started killing and raping us which made population uneasy and hostile towards you and then brits decided to use you as a lapdog and attacked ankara with warcry \ '' to the angora\ '' with more loots , pilages in villages along the way . In the end you lost everything whereas you could have taken eastern thrace ( sorry western powers would have never give you constantinopolis ) and even smyrna if you had patiently waited and being friendlier to the locals . Well thank him i guess : D anyway we should leave these behind and cooperate in the future since both of our countries are pretty much weak and crippled.\\n\\nOh and yes you had a good navy which was one of the reasons we lost balkan wars because reinforcements couldnt pass from smyrna to the balkans because you blockaded ports : & lt ;",Turkic,Turkish
