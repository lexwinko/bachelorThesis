0zymandiasss,europe,"Firstly , there have not been \ '' 3 models\ '' for Brexit put forward , it\\ 's the Remain camp that keeps trying to box the Leave camp into rigid constraints of pre existing deal . The UK can and will get it\\ 's own separate , unique deal that does not include free movement of people in any form . Now , if you\\ 're looking for the closest approximation of what that deal would look like , look to Canada or South Korea . \ '' But 7 years ! ! Hur Dur ! \ '' All other countries that have gone for a free trade deal have been negotiating from a blank slate . The UK is already compliment with all EU regulations , we\\ 'd just be negotiating on which parts to drop which will take far less time that Canada did.\\n\\nNow , as for why the EU would give us a good deal . Now , I expect you think they\\ 'll try to screw us over to stop others leaving I.e . the abusive partner theory . I disagree with this because you have to think about what will happen in the future . Let\\ 's assume they\\ 're deliberately harsh . Now , if the UK does badly , everyone will blame it on not getting a good deal . Now , while this will certainly discourage other members from leaving , it will leave the EU wit a hostile reputation . Other countries will be less inclined to join the EU , rather they\\ 'd just try for trade deals than locking themselves into a partnership they know they can never leave . \\n\\nConversely , if the UK sees good economic growth , even with a shitty deal with the EU , it will spell the end of the EU . All countries will see the UK thriving outside the unions , even with harsh penalties . This will open the flood gates . The more that leave , the less the bad deal matters as all newly independent countries will trade with each other as well . If that happened , the EU would probably not survive for many years after . Not something the EU wants.\\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about what will happen if they give the UK a good deal . If they give a good deal , and yet the UK does badly , it will send a message to everyone in Europe that membership of the EU is by far in a way the best thing for their economies . All countries in it will give up on the idea of leaving , seeing the economic benefit of staying . Countries not yet in the EU will make it a priority to join , so they can also get the economic boost it provides . All in all , if the UK gets a good deal but fails , it will ensure the further if the EU for decades to come . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about if the UK gets a good deal and also has good economic growth . People will see it as a country doing well , with most of that success based on the free trade deal they got , this reflects well on both parties involved . Now , some countries in the EU will see this as a reason to also leave , however , the EU has several ways to discourage them this way . They can say the UK only got a good trade deal because of it\\ 's large economy , something that would not be afforded to the smaller states . In the case of larger countries like France , they can say the UK is only doing well because it never had to float its own currency after exit , playing up fears amongst eurozone countries that it would be impossible for them to exit the EU because of the Euro . Now , his isn\\'t a perfect way to keep members , but it certainly gives the EU more room to manoeuvre.\\n\\nTLDR : If the EU gives the UK a bad deal , at best the EU will have a hostile reputation and find it much harder to attract new members , at worst , it will lead to the break up of the EU within a few years . If they give the UK a good deal , best case they secure the future of the EU for decades , worth case they have to work hard to stop any further members leaving , but the eurozone members will be easy to keep in the fold . I think in the grand scheme of things , they\\ 'll come down on giving us a good deal .",Germanic,English

With a localized sterilizing agent and anesthetic applied , and under the careful application of a medical doctor , this procedure results in only a very short term and minor pain without lasting health , sexual or visual consequences . The goal is for the procedure to symbolize the more extreme cultural practices so that they can be replaced with this far more benign procedure .

Meaning they still rely on numbers of soldiers more then high tech weapons . That has its pluses and minuses . Having a large number of troops makes fighting many fronts easier but also slow down mobility . It is my opinion that Russian military would fare well in a defensive role but would suffer greatly is a large offensive war . \\n\\nJust like the US military is heavily designed to counter the Russian military , the Russian military is deigned to counter the US military . However the style of warfare the US has fallen into ( modern warfare ) is a lot different then it use to be and Russia has not really made changes to address that .

Is it anything like the black Americans who claim to have PTSD as a result of slavery , which ended over 150 years ago ? \\n\\n & gt ; Actually it is , in most colonial holdings we suppressed English education and had white Europeans do all the educated work . \\n\\nEven if what you claim is true , that just lays the blame on the ones who wanted Europe out . Did they at any point think , \ '' Hm , Most of us can\\'t even read .

How long are Europeans supposed to carry the weight of this indiscretion ? \\n\\n & gt ; And done with the complicity of our nations as well as that of the general population , but this isn\\'t the argument we are having . We are & gt ; discussing the long term effects for colonial imperialism , which you are trivializing . \\n\\nAh , but you did bring up the supposed exploitation being carried out post-colonialism . As if that was the fault of the general population.\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe , but we just happened to be the ones that were good at it and did it for far longer and objectively much more recently.\\n\\nSo because we did these things more recently , we should feel more guilty about it ? Should young Germans feel guilty about the holocaust ? They had nothing to do with that either . \\n\\n & gt ; Not the point I\\ 'm making . You spoke as if China was somehow \ '' recovered\ '' , which is a blatant falsehood.\\n\\nThey would have been better off without our meddling .

It\\ 's not the fault of Europeans that the Africans were too incompetent to maintain what we left behind . \\n\\n & gt ; But their lives can be dramatically improved.\\n\\nMy life can be dramatically improved if I were allowed to live in a mansion on a hill . So what ? Bill Gates isn\\'t obligated to let me move into his house . Europe is not obligated to take in the world\\ 's poor . \\n\\n & gt ; Because the problems are rooted in what we have done . They may not be able to blame you or me , but Europe is very central & gt ; in the causes to their shitty lives . Not just from our colonial past , but from continued exploitation through corporate means.\\n\\nWho is \ '' we\ '' ? Do you think I exploited millions of Asians and Africans ? The practices of big business aren\\'t the fault of the general population . These are a very small number of elites who operate with the complicity of Asian and African governments . \\n\\n & gt ; Because we did historically oppress them . Claiming we didn\\'t is revisionist in the extreme.\\n\\nI never said we didn\\'t . European countries aren\\'t anywhere close to being the only ones who did this .

12ToneRow,europe,Universal suffrage was a terrible idea .,Germanic,English
12ToneRow,europe,"& gt ; Um , that wasn\\'t Colonialism . At all.\\n\\nFunny , I don\\'t remember saying that it was.\\n\\n & gt ; Firstly , Mongol \ '' rule\ '' in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute . They didn\\'t settle and they never went further West than & gt ; Hungary . They were far too busy fighting themselves.\\n\\nThey were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe . \\n\\n & gt ; Seondly , the Muslims did not colonize Iberia . They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates . There\\ 's a & gt ; distinct difference between conquering with migration , and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the & gt ; overlord , regardless of the conditions of the English population . The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval & gt ; Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.\\n\\nSo numerous slave raids , land grabs , and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods ? Are you saying that they didn\\'t exploit us economically ? \\n\\n & gt ; Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination ? \\n\\nWhat\\ 's funny is the fact that they\\ 're not . They have benefited from their ancestors\\ ' enslavement . They enjoy the same rights as whites do , and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action . They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards . \\n\\n & gt ; To make it simple for you , problems such as wanton corruption , abysmal education , wars , ethnic conflict , and wealth leaving the country are & gt ; extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism , and American neocolonialism during the Cold War . \\n\\nSorry to say , but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history . It\\ 's not the white man\\ 's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape . Not being able to read doesn\\'t cause someone to burn their neighbors alive . \\n\\n & gt ; On top of this , what you are saying is amount to victim blaming , it\\ 's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern & gt ; themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so , and this is directly contradictory to the right of & gt ; self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \\n\\nAnd we did allow them to govern themselves . Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn\\'t obligate us to let them all come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources , and it is in the name of these corporate & gt ; interests that many European interventions have been made , the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.\\n\\nAnd ? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it . If those nations want restitution , they should get it from the companies that exploited them . And again , it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place . \\n\\n & gt ; For an indefinite period of time . We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations , when those problems have been solved & gt ; and we show genuine good will to act in their interests instead of our own , when it comes to the problems in the region , then we can start talking & gt ; about absolving ourselves . In historical terms , this was yesterday.\\n\\nHow about those that exploited Europe then ? Should we continue to make them pay for their past sins indefinitely ? The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid . Some countries I\\ 'm sure , only remain solvent because of the aid we give . Where would you draw the line ? \\n\\n & gt ; Again , the nations are , as these are the same nations today that existed then , only in a more evolved ( or devolved , depending on where you & gt ; stand ) state . The United Kingdom is the British Empire . Portugal is Portugal and Belgium is Belgium.\\n\\nA nation is it\\ 's people . And these people have nothing to do with the sins of the past . Who\\ 's really bearing the cost of making amends ? It\\ 's not \ '' nations\ '' . It\\ 's people.\\n\\n & gt ; One would think that\\ 's not really the fault of the consumer , but the utter indifference amongst the general population as to the origin of their & gt ; goods would , indeed , make us partially responsible . \\n\\nIt takes two to tango . No one is making them accept such working conditions . If someone is , it certainly isn\\'t your average Brit . \\n\\n & gt ; No , the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust , but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the & gt ; people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation . \\n\\nBut Germany wasn\\'t responsible for the establishment of Israel , which impacted the people already living there . \\n\\n\\n\\n",Germanic,English
12ToneRow,europe,"On your first 4 points ( to save some space ) : We weren\\'t only talking about colonialism . You suggested that we have these obligations to foreigners for ALL the sins we committed . Not just colonialism . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm saying it\\ 's nothing compared to Colonialism . Slavery was a two way street , Christians sold captured Muslims into slavery during the & gt ; Reconquista . Due to the fact those people had then been living there for a sum total of 700 years , would you call that economic exploitation , & gt ; or just simply the spoils of war ? \\n\\nYou\\ 're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others . It suits your argument to do so . I don\\'t fault you for that . Interestingly enough , your point about the Reconquista seems to indicate that you think we are even with the muslims . Good , then we don\\'t owe them anything . \\n\\n & gt ; Actual foreign direct investment as opposed to simply handing over a few billion to a government as long as they tow your line , because make & gt ; no mistake that aid money doesn\\'t go to all post-colonial states , just the ones that do what we like.\\n\\nWe could go back to giving them nothing if you like . I\\ 'd certainly like that . \\n\\n & gt ; You should pick up a history book sometime , it might fix that problem of yours.\\n\\nSub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans , Arabs , and Europeans . Maybe you could enlighten me.\\n\\n & gt ; Do you think that the blacks have twice the unemployment simply because they\\ 're lazy and like living off welfare ? Or maybe it\\ 's because & gt ; there\\ 's fuck all educational investment in working class areas . \\n\\nI guess white people don\\'t belong to the working class , right ? Your insults aside , there are many ways one could explain black unemployment numbers . One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with some imaginary inter-generational post traumatic stress . That\\ 's one of the more outlandish explanations for black Americans\\ ' over-representation in violent crime and under-representation in higher education.\\n\\n & gt ; For example , it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests . So , yes , the state does endorse this . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.\\n\\n & gt ; The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief . The thief has all of your shit but you still want him & gt ; to get the fuck out of your house . At the end of it all you have nothing left . Is it your fault ? \\n\\nInfrastructure , education , modern medicine , and a written language in some cases . We gave these things to the colonized . I\\ 'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.\\n\\n & gt ; The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state , which the state benefited from and as such , successive generations of & gt ; people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.\\n\\nWhere does the state get its money ? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution ? That\\ 's my point . Generations today shouldn\\'t be made to suffer for sins of the past . \\n\\n & gt ; Are you some sort of Libertarian that believes everyone can quit a job and move on with their lives ? \\n\\nPeople do it all the time . They weigh the risks and take their chances where they might have more opportunity . Many third world immigrants come to Europe with nothing . Many come illegally . If they can just quit their countries and move to Europe , they can certainly quit a job and move on with their lives.\\n\\nI doubt many of these people care about colonialism . They\\ 've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want . If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners , why don\\'t you do the \\'tolerant\\ ' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis ? Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections ? The possibilities for saying , \ '' We\\ 're sorry\ '' are endless.\\n\\n",Germanic,English

19djafoij02,AskEurope,"[ Does this work ? ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Rhodesia ) \\n\\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the Rhodesian Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a first past the post principle . At some stages , however , there were two-member constituencies , and in the early years there were some appointed members . The 1961 constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\\n\\nAt the time of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence , Rhodesia\\ 's amended 1961 constitution ( which was annexed to the UDI ) provided for an Officer Administering the Government , to be appointed by the British Sovereign ( or by the parliament if the Queen made no appointment ) , with political power residing with the unicameral Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nUnder the 1961 constitution , the Rhodesian Assembly had 65 elected members : 50 constituency members and 15 district members . The voter rolls had education , property and income qualifications . The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95 % of its members were white and 5 % were black or Asian . The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90 % of its members were black and 10 % were white or Asian . The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll . Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts , but for elections in the constituencies , the B roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total , and for elections in the districts , the A roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total . This procedure was known as \\'cross-voting\\ ' . In practice , the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\\n\\nThe 1962 general election was a watershed for the country , since it resulted in the election of a Rhodesian Front government led by Winston Field that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia . The defeated United Federal Party led by Edgar Whitehead had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\\n\\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969 . It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided . African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register , and those that had registered not to vote . Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote , and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25 % .\\n\\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution . This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic , following a referendum result in favour in 1969 . Under this new constitution , there was a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected Senate , and a directly elected House of Assembly , in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the 1961 constitution . The new office of president was a ceremonial post , with executive power remaining with the Prime Minister.\\n\\nThe 1969 constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly . The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans . The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll , and 8 B roll seats . It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached . In addition to the B roll seats , the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members . The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly , with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well . These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.\\n\\nThe new constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms . The concept of \ '' separate development\ '' for blacks and whites was written into that constitution . The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted . This last feature underpinned the concept of \\'equal partnership between black and white\\ ' as an alterEnglish to majority rule . However , the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely , if not for ever . White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance , given enough time . [ 1 ] \\n\\n\\n",Germanic,English
