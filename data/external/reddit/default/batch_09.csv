DameHumbug,AskEurope,"& gt ; Classification is flawed and inconsistent\\n\\nThat\\ 's why i kept going with you . I felt yours were flawed and inconsistent . \\n\\n & gt ; But I still consider it to be a part of the region because a part of it is in on the peninsula & amp ; it was a part of Sweden.\\n\\nThe peninsula was named for the Scandinavian countries that were on 90 % of it . You don\\'t cut a peninsula early just to fit borders . They could call it the Norwegian Swedish and part Finland peninsula but that wouldn\\'t roll of the tongue as well . Then someone realised there was a name for the people that lived on 90 % of it and it was named so . Scandinavia has nothing to do with location on the map but 3 countries . If you want to get fancy it\\ 's a \ '' historical and cultural-linguistic region\ '' . You can keep using geography as a point but then you can also bring in whatever other random metric you feel like using.\\n\\n & gt ; because of history yet this isn\\'t true with Finland , too\\n\\nThey have a history through us through proxy , aka being Swedish . They didn\\'t fight wars against us , they fought because Sweden told them to do it . Denmark and Sweden however are directly interacting and it\\ 's their state declaring wars with Norway being the battleground and reason for war in a bunch of those . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm astonished anyone would say Icelandic is not a Scandinavian language\\n\\nTotally agree , not sure what i was thinking on this one . Even reading it back i\\ 'm not sure where my head was . I think i know what i sort of meant by it but after that fiasco of a comment from me i will just not go into it again . Can\\'t trust my own head with that again so soon haha.\\n\\n & gt ; objective standard for Scandinavia , Greenland and the Faroe Islands are technically Scandinavian because they are Denmark.\\n\\nNo , again not geography . They , like the others , lack the history and language . Two of the three main things i keep going on about consistently . Culture i can\\'t really speak of as i don\\'t feel confident to comment on it but language and history yes . It doesn\\'t matter though , if you aren\\'t three for three then you\\ 're out of a scandi membership.\\n\\n & gt ; It seems like CGP Grey concurs with my assessment , there is a degree of subjectivity in deciding which is which . \\n\\nHe seems pretty clear about who Scandinavia is , but he says there is also confusion . I don\\'t deny that at all.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; My point simply is : Don\\'t tell people that they\\ 're wrong for saying Finland & amp ; Iceland are in Scandinavia because there are valid reasons for them to be considered a part of it.\\n\\nIf there were valid reasons they would be Scandinavian . It\\ 's as simple as that . We don\\'t even count Svalbard as Scandinavian and that\\ 's Norwegian with 70 % Norwegians . Why i\\ 'm sure you ask . Well it lacks the history , one of the three checkboxes it need . It wasn\\'t really used until 1600 , then it started being a hunting outpost for all sorts of people from all over until the 1800 something .

Christians were subjected to a highly discriminatory tax , they were shut out many professions , and often were in practice precluded from owning any sizeable amount of land . In effect , a large fraction of Christians in the Ottoman Empire were forced to work the land as laborers , while the profit of their work went to landholders who were almost invariably immigrants from other parts of the Ottoman Empire or local Muslim converts.\\n\\nAt the same time we had the spansih inquisition where non-christians had to flee al Andalus .

However , due to your followup : \ '' Nice reading comprehension , but I\\ 'm used to the old strawman when dealing with pro-immigration types.\\nI specifically said disproportionately , would you like a dictionary ? \ '' I did get more defensive since it was nothing but a personal attack that in no way contributed to discussion .

However , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics .

Segregated suburbs with repatriated foreign fighters pose an acute threat , says migration officer Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' The district Hj\u00e4llbo is the Swedish answer to Molenbeek , Brussels , where terrorists from Paris hid while they were planning new actions . We must prepare ourselves , \ '' says the policeman . \\n\\nJust three hours drive from Oslo are six neighborhoods in Gothenburg characterized by parallel society , crime and strong elements of extreme , violent Islamists , according to a recent police report . \\n\\nAftenposten stands outside the door to a so-called garage mosque named \ '' Blue Door\ '' district in Hj\u00e4llbo , Angered , Gothenburg . Terror scientists from National Defence College in Stockholm have characterized the place as a meeting place for extreme Islamists and were warned by the police about going too close . \\n\\n**Carpeted washroom converted into a mosque** \\n\\nAftenposten found the blue door that has given the mosque its name . The venue is a disused laundry in an apartment building close to Hj\u00e4llbo center . The door is open and we enter . \\n\\nThe nearly 20 square meter room is covered with carpeting . On the walls there are a few bulletin boards and posters in Arabic . Two easy chairs make up the furniture . \\n\\n\ '' No shoes ! \ '' \\n\\nA young man with a dark beard reminds us to take off our shoes before entering a mosque . He sits alone on the carpet in a corner and reads a book . He does not want to say his name , but says in English that he is a computer science student and that he does not speak Swedish . He cringes away when we retrieve the camera . \\n\\n\ '' Why do you visit exactly this mosque ? \ '' \\n\\n\ '' I visit all sorts of mosques , \ '' he said . \\n\\nHe summons an elderly man who presents himself as a Palestinian named Ahmed Abdelrazek , and emerges as a kind of leader on site . When we ask him about the terrorist researchers\\ ' claim that there is recruitment to ISIS , he shakes his head . He does not like people from here travel to war . \\n\\n\ '' It\\ 's insane to train people to commit acts of terror , \ '' says Abdelrazek . \\n\\nThe young man may not speak Swedish , but he understands a certain amount of the Swedish language . He enters into the conversation with the elderly man who suddenly did not want to talk more with us . \\n\\n\ '' They don\\'t like visits from the media , \ '' concludes police inspector Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n**Fosters foreign fighters in isolated pockets** \\n \\nWe meet the policeman at the police station in the district Hj\u00e4llbo , where the audience is operated behind bulletproof glass . Bostr\u00f6m has worked in the police for 38 years . He takes us to a meeting where he draws and tells on a blackboard on developments taking place in the northeastern parts of Gothenburg . \\n\\n\ '' Gothenburg are among those places that are recruited most foreign fighters per capita in Western Europe , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nThe terror in Paris and Brussels have focused on isolated pockets of parallel societies in Europe that fosters foreign fighters and terrorists hiding on the run . Intelligence information indicates that IS has trained 400 people to attack on European soil . Sweden is specifically designated as a target . \\n\\n\ '' The official alert level is currently at level 3 . I would say that it is at 5 , almost on top . When we hear how the mosques here reviewing the terror in the rest of Europe , I am not in doubt , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m , showing that there was a failed suicide attack in Stockholm in 2010 . \\n\\nJohan Walter sitting in the same meeting room . He is employed in Migrationsv\u00e4rket but pronounces himself as a private person . He has worked in the vulnerable districts in almost 20 years . \\n\\n\ '' I am convinced that it is only a matter of time before it slams , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**A segregated society with violent extremism** \\n \\nA Swedish police report that came just before Christmas last year , states that 15 residential areas in Sweden is characterized by a parallel society with a strong presence of violent religious extremism and criminals . Six of the worst areas are located in Gothenburg . \\n\\nThese are residential areas where much of the population has little confidence in the police and judiciary . They will not testify in court . Conflicts are resolved out of the ordinary justice system , sometimes within clans . Many people who live here , have over time been living in a sort of state of emergency with serious crime and shooting in broad daylight . Threats and violence are perceived as normal by many , and measures that are inserted , have had little effect.\\n\\nThe backdrop is record unemployment , drug crimes , ethnic segregation , stigmatization and sometimes extreme overcrowding . There are examples of 20 people sleeping in shifts in a two bedroom apartment . \\n\\n**Young criminals are recruited** \\n\\nIt is the development of clean immigrant ghettos that worries Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' We have even created the segregated city . A third of the population in Gothenburg are immigrants . 80 percent of those living in neighborhoods in the northeast . These are places authorities are absent.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m points out that eight out of ten drop out of primary school in some of these neighborhoods . Figures for crime and unemployment are ominous high . \\n\\n\ '' It goes without saying that young people in this environment becomes easy prey for people who want to recruit them . We should remember that this is young people who are not even welcome in his own family because they are criminals . They drink . They see no future . They are then invited into the fire . Over time , they get to hear about Islam , but only those parts of the religion that suits them who enlists them.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m says that these young people who rule without the basic knowledge of Islam , even if the parents are devout Muslims . \\n\\n\ '' First generation are the most stable . But what happens when the elderly fall from ? The potential for even more foreign fighters is enormous , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nAlready last autumn warned the Swedish security police Sapo about terrorist risk in Sweden , and the Gothenburg pointed out by many foreign fighters . \\n\\n**Lifetime for beheading two Swedes** \\n \\nTwo men from Gothenburg , a 30 year old and a 32 year old , were in a Swedish court recently sentenced to life in prison for beheading in Aleppo in Syria . A few weeks ago , four men with ties to Sweden stopped in Turkey as they were supposedly on their way to Syria to join the IS . \\n\\nNo youngsters Aftenposten meetings Hj\u00e4llbo will take foreign fighters in defense . Two young boys stirs up sharply , but they want to be anonymous . One of them is a Kurd . They say they know many who have traveled , but no one has returned . \\n\\n\ '' They are jerks traveling . If they survive and come back , I\\ 'll beat them , \ '' says Kurd Alex ( 19 ) . \\n\\nBuddy Arber ( 19 ) are Albanian and says : \ '' Foreign warriors pigs to Islamic religion.\ '' \\n\\n**Notified of developments in the suburbs** \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m claims he has seen the danger signs long . \\n\\n\ '' We see that gifted fundamentalists gain more and more control in these suburbs . The less we do to support those Muslims who want to approach our democracy , the better breeding ground there for parallel society . People in these suburbs live as social hostages , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nJohan Walter nods . \\n\\n\ '' There has been a shift in recent years . Niqab was never used before , but it has come after influence of fundamentalists . We see changes in Somalis who previously had sufi traditions of dance and music . Now they do not dare to perform this public anymore because they can meet reactions , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**Major challenge to reverse the trend** \\n \\nZan Jankovski coordinate efforts against communities with violent extremists in Gothenburg municipality . He would not comment on the terrorist danger . \\n\\n\ '' But it is clear that we have too many Syria explorers from the city . Of 130 who have traveled , is around 25 dead and 25 have returned . We have received information that fewer trips now , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\nHe points out that they also have foreign fighters to Ukraine and greater extreme-right in town . \\n\\n\ '' It is clear that the challenge with a segregated and polarized city is a major challenge . Reversing a trend that has come over time is not easy . We have a long-term cooperation between several agencies where we work at schools and youth groups in these neighborhoods , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\n**Build more housing and focuses on children** \\n\\nKommunalr\u00e5d for Social Affairs in Gothenburg , Marina Johansson ( Social Democrats ) , says that they have taught 3,000 people to pick up signs of radicalization among young people . When they see these signs , contact the parents and school . \\n\\n\ '' But there is much that has gone wrong in these residential areas , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\nNew migrants are now located in other districts , and new housing will alleviate overcrowding . \\n\\n\ '' Moreover , we will initiate long-term measures within the living conditions and health to reduce social inequalities between districts . With a long-term effort can we stop segregation and create good conditions for the children , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\n**Fears for kids** \\n\\nDistrict Bergsj\u00f6n was planned for industrial workers at Volvo and SKF . Now Bergsj\u00f6n marked by drug and gang crime , and two years ago was one of the first foreign fighters from district killed in Syria . \\n\\nSomali coach Jama Abdisataar ( 41 ) has lived in Bergsj\u00f6n for several years . He has four children , and also has two asylum seekers on 16 and 17 living with them . Now he\\ 's upset for the young . \\n\\n\ '' Some people hang around the mosques , and we know that recruitment takes place . It is bad that they leave people who have fled the war into new violence , \ '' says Abdisataar who himself says he hates Islamists Al Shabaab . \\n\\nHe likes it in town , but it seems there is little evidence of Sweden . \\n\\n\ '' Swedes move . I do not know why , \ '' he smiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Germanic,Swedish

AFAIAA,europe,Please define eating the welfare state .,Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"& gt ; Compared to the U.S. , countries in Europe are extremely homogeneous . Being a Swede with blond hair and blue eyes that speaks a certain dialect vs. a brown hair , green eyed Swede speaking a different dialect isn\\'t exactly diversity . Definitely not the same as an Guatemalan-American and Vietnamese-American.\\n\\nLet\\ 's look at this comparison . The Guatemalan-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans have been in the US for what , a few decades . Well , then we\\ 'll look at a Chilean-Swede and a Chinese-Swede who\\ 've been here for a few decades . \\n\\nNotably , Sweden\\ 's foreign-born population ( 16.5 % ) [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) is large than the US\\ 's foreign-born population [ ( 14.3 % ) ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) . \\n\\nSweden is a bigger immigrant country than the United States and has been this way for years .

Europe is very diverse and these issues will depend , to begin with , on where you are in Europe . Second , you have to define \ '' fit in\ '' to get anywhere with this.\\n\\n & gt ; Your statement even highlights it . You are taking a group that has a ton of commonalities and separating them into different groups based on minor language differences . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not the case . The differences are much more than linguistic and go right into hundreds of years of traditional , religion and even where they live and what they surivive on . It\\ 's like speaking of the Amish or Texas Germans to some extent ( though a deceptive comparison ) in that these two groups are also American . \\n\\n & gt ; Any time a distinction like that HAS to be made shows how closely one holds on to even a regional identity and will alienate those not sharing that identity . \\n\\nYes , but your are missing this : that identity can still be included in the conservative national identity , just like variations within nation states elsewhere .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"Yeah , foreign aid workers . In any case , that was not the effect of your argument , so you\\ 're being dishonest .

The problem is that the written language does not reflect the pronounciation of the spoken language . \\n\\nI agree that English spelling needs to go through a reform . There are organisations out there that have been pushing for this for a long time , but politicians in e.g . the UK and the US mock such reforms with moronic retorts like \ '' it\\ 's not our fault people can\\'t learn to spell\ '' or \ '' it\\ 's not the orthography\\ 's fault that English-speakers learn to read later than others\ '' .",Germanic,Swedish

AFAIAA,europe,"& gt ; I only mention it because it\\ 's topical but , there shouldn\\'t be a hyphen in your \\'English-speaking\\ ' . \\n\\nThis is how both Oxford and Chicago style manuals recommend spelling \ '' English-speaking\ '' . Here are some actual examples more relevant to the UK : \\n\\n* \ '' English-speaking world\ '' ( *Pocket Oxford English Dictionary* , pp . xii , 1073 ) \\n* \ '' English-speaking person\ '' ( *Pocket Oxford English Dictionary* , p. 401 ) \\n* \ '' an English-speaker from outside China\ '' ( *The Oxford Handbook of the History of English* , p. 359 ) \\n* \ '' the only inept English-speaker\ '' ( *The Oxford Handbook of Shakespeare* , p. 582 ) \\n\\n & gt ; The general rule is , though people often don\\'t care , that a hyphen should be used when it\\ 's a compound modifier preceding a noun or whatever but not if it comes after or is on its own . \\n\\nI\\ 'm afraid you\\ 're mistaken as that\\ 's not accurate for the entire language . It is accurate that it is recommended by certain style guides used in the UK . However , English has many different styles guides where rules on hyphenation differ based on a ) country/reigion , b ) field of discourse , c ) publication/in-house editing , d ) hyphenation in many cases being left to the writer\\ 's judgment and so on .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"I did not write that the euro destabilized the economy of Sweden , I wrote \ '' create a destructive economic unit to destabilise national economies\ '' . The EU has , for instance , ruined Greece , which I mentioned . Largely this was facilitated by a system in which monetary policy is controlled by unaccountable bureaucrats at the European Central Bank . After the 2008 Financial Crisis a series of enoromous transfers of wealth from taxpayers to financial institutions took place , but they were not enough to stabilise the system because the fundamental structures surrounding the euro aren\\'t capable of doing that . The EU needs to either completely restructure its financial institutions or put checks and balances in place to prevent destroying the very economic zone it hopes to create . But there\\ 's hope there , the EU is so undemocratic and poorly structured it is currently destroying itself from within . \\n\\nConcerning Sweden , the EU constitutes a big economic investment with a relatively small economic return . Its policies towards Greece have directly affected Swedish banking , industry and stock markets . It has paralysed Swedish agriculture and it has given Sweden a large population of unemployable , antisocial Romani . Due to its own idiocy and the influence of its overlords in the EU , Sweden has been hugely affected by the migrant crisis , which is crippling the country\\ 's police force and social services , among other state functions . Swedish export and employment have been affected by the EU\\ 's monetary policies and so on . \\n\\nThe majority of laws and regulations that decide over Sweden today come from the EU : Sweden pays a fee every year to let the EU decide more and more over Sweden , which has undermined Swedish representative democracy . The EU inefficiently places decision-making powers at a supranational level when these same powers can and have long been efficiently carried out at national level . The EU is thus not only undemocratic but also inefficient . This supranational structure in itself entails that power is moved further and further away from Swedish voters and that the EU does not have Sweden\\ 's best interests in mind . As mentioned above , economic sovereignty has been profoundly undermined by the EU , which in turn means that local economies and socio-economic policies increasingly fall into the hands of supranational EU bureaucrats who do not have a particular nation state\\ 's best in mind .",Germanic,Swedish

You moved the goal posts . You haven\\'t logically explained why the former would motivate the latter , that they leave the EU . The statements I\\ 've read from Greeks in government over the past few years indicate that Greeks had no choice due to threats from many sides .

Citizens of European nations have virtually no influence over the so-called representatives in the EU .

What\\ 's relevant in this case is how that thing functions . The Third Reich was democratically elected , but according to your reasoning , it is incorrect to call the Third Reich\\ 's Reichstag undemocratic.\\n\\nRegarding EU\\ 's so-called democracy , there are problems with things like accountability , representation and legitimacy . The problems include low trust in the EU , low voter turnouts in EU elections , and national elections for EU seats that focus on national issues when the EU is a supranational organisation . There are no EU-wide parties and there are no actual EU elections . National issues voted on that get national politicans voted into the EU only have indirect influence on actual EU-level issues . Half of EU\\ 's citizens feel apathetic about the EU and distrust the structure of its representation . Then there\\ 's the extensive lack of citizen participation in EU elections .

Like with phone chargers -- every vendor created its own \ '' in his best interest\ '' , until EU forced them to use the same standard .

The submarine was discovered by two local fishermen in the morning after . \\n\\nThey contacted the Swedish navy , which didn\\'t believe the reports , but went to investigate anyway . The patrol ship *HMS Smyge* was first to arrive and laid anchor next to the submarine . The commander of HMS Smyge climbed aboard the submarine and managed to make contact with the commander ( they had to communicate in german ) . \\n\\nAccording to the Soviet commander the navigation equipment on board was \ '' Kaputt\ '' and that Soviet tugs would come and pull it afloat . However , the swedes naturally said \ '' no way\ '' , the ball was rolling.\\n\\nTwo recon fighters from Sweden did indeed spot Soviet ships on their way to the stricken sub . Among the ships were modern frigates . Later that evening the Soviets asked for permission to send four ships to rescue the sub , again the swedes said \ '' Nope\ '' .\\n\\nThe Swedish prime minister told the Swedish command to keep te Soviets away with what they got . The problem was that at the time they really didn\\'t have that much in that specific area . The coastal battery , which was the main defence weapon was missing its fire control system due to maintenance ! Luckily they did manage to get a new fire control system , one which was very modern and mobile , in place by the evening . \\n\\nThe personell at the battery followed the Soviet ships advance towards the border . \ '' *1000 meters , three minutes ! *\ '' Was called out and the mood was tense in the control room.\\n\\nThe next call out was \ '' *700 meters , two minutes ! \ '' , and at about that time the Major in charge thought \ '' *We are probably at war now*\ '' . The decision was made to put the battery into war-mode , which included changing the radio operations into frequency-hopping , a feature that at the time wasn\\'t allowed to be used in peacetime in Sweden . \\n\\nWithin a minute after that the Soviet ships had stopped , just outside the border . Apparently they sent out a transmission saying that something wasn\\'t right and that they were waiting for new orders . \\n\\nThe Soviets did try to make a dash with a tug the day after , but it was stopped by the Swedish sub *HMS Neptun* . Swedish *J\u00e4gare* , basically Swedish commandos/rangers , were guarding the sub at all times as well . They also had the commander , who liked to stand on the tower of the sub , in a sniper sight at all times . If anything were to happen they would board the ship.\\n\\nMore Soviet ships were arriving at the border , and they planned to take the sub by force at 03.00 the next night . However the attack was called off at 02.30 the same night . The reason is supposed to be that Sweden has had the time to mobilize a much larger force at the site at that time . \\n\\nIn the end Swedish tugs got the Soviet sub afloat again and it was escorted to the border.\\n\\nWiki article : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363\\n\\nA short film made by the Swedish Military shows how it looked at the site : https : //vimeo.com/11072021",Germanic,Swedish

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"& gt ; Certain countries have \u201cunwritten constitutions , \u201d a group of separate documents which , taken together , functions as a whole . Ours is simply a single document for all fundamental laws.\\n\\nMainly the UK in the first case . \\n\\nI can only do a comparison to the Swedish constitution since I\\ 'm fairly familiar to that one . We have four fundamental laws , but the definition of the word \ '' law\ '' is a bit different . I get the feeling n the internet a \ '' law\ '' is mostly referring to an \ '' article\ '' . The most important fundamental law is the instrument of government , and that\\ 's the one I will refer to from this moment on.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know . You said your newest constitution was put in place to avoid amending an older one , and it\\ 's just a comparison.\\n\\nIn that case I wasn\\'t clear enough . The main reason was that a big part of it had fallen into obsolescence . Therefore it was rewritten from the ground up . A big change was the move from a two chamber parliament to a unichamber . \\n\\nIt has then been amended many times , latest in 2014 . In order to amend it you need a simple majority , but two times and have a general election in between.\\n\\n & gt ; In any case , I still don\\'t see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution.\\n\\nWriting a new constitution doesn\\'t have to mean that you do away with everything old . Sure , you can amend it but there are some pretty troublesome parts in your constitution , such as the electoral college.\\n\\n & gt ; Is that not similar to your country\\ 's highest courts ? \\n\\nActually , no . But I know that we\\ 're the odd ones here . Courts ( any court ) can test if the application of a law is in accordance of the fundamental law in each specific case . But they can not dismiss a law as \ '' unconstitutional\ '' . Before a law comes into effect it passes through the \ '' council on legislation\ '' which may point to problems with the laws . The government is being watched by the \ '' Committee on the Constitution\ '' . But as I said , we\\ 're pretty odd in that . \\n\\nThe point I was trying to make was that instead of interoperating old laws it might be better to rewrite them so they make sense . \\n\\n & gt ; I did say that . The Bill of Rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default.\\n\\nHmm , the only thing which remotely resembles that is [ allemansr\u00e4tten ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam ) , which isn\\'t defined what it includes or not . But it is granted by the constitution by the 2nd chapter , 15th article , 4th paragraph : \\n\\n\ '' Everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public\\naccess , notwithstanding the above provisions.\ '' \\n\\nBut then again , doesn\\'t that make it the other way around ? I should probably go to sleep now..",Germanic,Swedish

Today for instance we hade sunrise at 02:13 , and sunset will be at 22:47 , but to be honest it doesn\\'t really get dark , it\\ 's more like a dusk/dawn setting . Tomorrow we will have sunrise at 02:09 and sunset at 22:51 . So we will \ '' gain\ '' 8 minuets of sunlight over just 24 hours .

In all cases of dismissal the employee should , if possible , be offered a different position at the same employer , or to improve the working situation for the employee.\\n\\nMost of the times you get dismissed not for personal reasons but due to lack of work at the employer .

There is also a big part on alcohol , what impacts it has on you and others in both short and long-terms . You can get imprisoned from as low as 0.02 % BAC in Sweden.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou also have to take a practical test where you drive slalom , test braking and do evasive manoeuvres on slippery surfaces . These tests are done both with and without stability control systems and ABS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe actual test is in two parts , first a theoretical test about traffic rules and risks . Then the practical driving test where you must drive safely and as environmentally friendly as possible . You also get to do some special manoeuvres , like reversing around a corner . The test can be taken from the day you turn 18.\\n\\n\\n\\nA normal drivers license is good for vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes , and you can tow a trailer with a loaded weight up to 750 kg ( total weight must still be under 3.5 tonnes ) .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"Hitler invaded partly to save the supply of Swedish iron ore which went through Norwegian harbours , especially winter time when the Swedish harbours were frozen . The allies had plans to disrupt the deliveries , and even demolish the Swedish mines.\\n\\nShortly after the invasion of Denmark and Norway we were given an ultimatum . In order to stay out of the war we were to continue selling iron ore to Germany ( not a breach against neutrality I might add ) , our warships were not allowed outside Swedish territorial waters and a few other things .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"About Swedish healthcare.\\nSweden is divided into 20 countys , and it\\ 's the county that\\ 's responsible for healthcare and the insurance of its inhabitants . This means that there are some variations throughout the country . But generally speaking a visit to the ER will cost you about 100 SEK . When you reach 1100 SEK over a 12-month period you don\\'t have to pay the fees for the reminder . The same is also true if you reach 2200 SEK for prescription drugs.\\nThere is also a lot of private health care in Sweden . However most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . Meaning it\\ 's funded through the countys and you don\\'t pay anything extra just because it\\ 's private . Also , according to law you have the right to choose your \ '' home clinic\ '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here.\\nThere exists some private healthcare that isn\\'t funded by the countys as well . And because of that there also exists private health insurance . These cost between 90 and 450 SEK/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what\\ 's included.\\n\\nNow , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc . I for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually I can go there the next day . At the ER it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . But yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times.\\n\\nI have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . Also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the National Board of Health and Welfare.\\n\\nAnd lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . You can also access it on the web att [ 1177.se ] ( http : //www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time..",Germanic,Swedish
Abrovinch,AskEurope,"There are several ways to go from the *gymnasium* to university . \\n\\nThe simplest way is to have done the courses required with grades decent enough to be accepted to the university programme ( and university ) you want to attend . What decent grades are is decided by the amount of applications each year . \\n\\nIf you have done the required courses , but your grades aren\\'t good enough you can do *h\u00f6gskoleprovet* - \ '' Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test\ '' , which is a test with questions from varying subjects . You get graded from 0 up to 2.0 . The test result is valid up to 5 years , and you can do the test how many times you like . When applying to university it works the same as with the normal grades , except you only compete with others that\\ 's done the test , not with those applying with regular grades.\\n\\nThe third way is if you haven\\'t done the courses required , let\\ 's say yo did a vocational *gymnasieprogramme* but later decide you want to be an engineer .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"Ah yes , the classic \ '' But taxes ! \ '' -argument.\\n\\nHere\\ 's a fact . Sweden has among the highest taxes in the world ( 45,8 % of GDP ) , but to give it a fair chanse we need to figure out how it works.\\n\\nSo , let\\ 's say you make $ 3700/month , but your employer needs to pay payroll-taxes on that , which is 31,4 % . This means you cost the employer $ 4860 , but YOUR taxable income is still $ 3700 , and that\\ 's all that really matters for YOU as an employee . \\n\\nNow , Sweden has marginal taxes etc . as amany other countries ( including the U.S ) . But in this case the effective income tax-rate for you is about 24,2 % ( it depends on where you live in the country , but the difference is not that big ) .\\n\\n24,2 % income tax isn\\'t that bad to be honest..\\n\\nBut of course there are other taxes , capital gains is 30 % of revenue , however there are no property taxes ( but there is a municipal fee ) , or inheritance .

We find that the y-name syndrome is empirically grounded ; men with y-names are more likely to live in municipalities characterized by indicators of low socioeconomic status and are over-represented among criminals .

The National Housing Board was set up as the central authority providing subsidized loans and rent controls , while the National Labour Market Board was established to coordinate the nationalized local employment offices and supervise the union-controlled but state-subsidized unemployment insurance funds . In 1947 , a tax reform was carried out that reduced income taxes in low-income brackets , introduced an inheritance tax , and raised the marginal tax rate for higher tax brackets.\\n\\n & gt ; ( ... ) \\n\\n & gt ; Erlander coined the phrase \ '' the strong society\ '' , describing a society with a growing public sector taking care of the growing demand on many services that an affluent society creates .
