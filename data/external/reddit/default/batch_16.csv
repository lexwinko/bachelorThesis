Agality,europe,"This refugee issue is also politicized like everything . AKP ( Erdogan\\ 's party ) supporters have a positive view about them . Some of them even support the idea of giving all these people Turkish citizenship . But other party supporters share a more negative view about them . Nationalists think that due to their ethnicity they should be expelled immediately and secularists think that they may damage our secular society so they should be expelled . Most secularists and some nationalists are living in western coastal cities . Sometimes I hear local people talking like : \ '' Let them go to Europe , We can\\'t afford this much refugees\ '' . Everyday , on news , you can see a story about how government officials rescued a boat of refugees try to cross the sea to reach Greek islands . I think the media try to give the impression : \ '' Our officials try to block the refugees to reach Greece as much as they can but they are just too much.\ '' \\n\\nOf course in the end , every non-AKP supporters blame AKP for this mess because the way the refugees are welcomed is too uncontrolled . For example in my hometown Izmir , located in the western coast , population is 4.5 mil and estimated refugees are 100.000 .

Alpha023,europe,"Geographically speaking , we should be in EU with the same reason Cyprus had . If Cyprus is considered , geographically , an EU country then Turkey should be also considered European . \\n\\nCulturally I am afraid Turkey is kinda divided into two . There is this at least 40 % of Turkey that is secular and more westernized than the rest . Look at Istanbul or Izmir ( or any western cities ) for example . However I believe with time , we can change . Just like we did in 1920s when Ottoman Empire disbanded and a whole new country born with more based on western values . However with the current government emphasising more on Islamic culture , things doesn\\'t look so well right now . Now I come from a what you might call the elite part of Istanbul but everybody I know is either secular or are not associated with Islam . I don\\'t believe 99 % percent of the population is Muslim . If there was no peer pressure and more freedom of speech , we would be way more secular than most of the countries in the World . \\n\\nYes , Turkey is big . And we are gon na need a whole lot of investment on the eastern part of Turkey to prevent any drug or immigrant trades .

Well at least not militarily . My father side is Cypriot so I think I have more say to this issue than the European people have . Now all most of my family lives either in UK or in Turkey with frequent travels to Cyprus because of the conflict . In this issue I believe both sides are wrong . I believe what Greek Cypriots did was a big NO-NO around 1950s-1960s and Turkey tried its best there to protect its people . Now Turkish military may have used a little excessive force but it isn\\'t any different what US did to Iraq or Afghanistan or what European countries did to rest of the world for colonization ( what I am trying to say that anything country would have done the same thing if they were in that position ) . If Turkey did really intended to invade Cyprus , they would have done it by completely taking the Cyprus . Anyways the fact is the northern Cyprus is really in shitty condition compared to the Southern Side . I have been to both places . I have seen the difference . The fact is I don\\'t like the Turkish or Kurdish immigrants to Cyprus from Turkey anymore than Greek Cypriots do . And I know that is one of the reasons Turkey can not settle on any resolution with the Republic of Cyprus . But you can\\'t just ask the 200 thousand people to leave and go back to Turkey . Especially to those that actually born in Northern Cyprus . The Greek Cypriots are not really excited about any settlements either . They are acting to overaggressive to the issue and are not really trying to use any kind of empathy ( What I am trying to say that they are looking at the issue on only one point of view ) . I can\\'t blame them because probably they were taught like that after the \ '' Invasion of Cyprus\ '' . \\n\\nThe connection to the US isn\\'t something that will make a big difference to EU . Lets all be real , It\\ 's not like US doesn\\'t have any influence on any EU countries . \\n\\nThe closeness to the war-zones never effected the people of Turkey . Except the issue in Syria . That is the result of the bad decision of our government and the fact that other countries are not doing anything to help Turkey to protect and feed the immigrants from Syria . The issue with Kurdish terrorists ( \ '' seperatists\ '' ) doesn\\'t seem to be resolve with any military force unless we fully attack on the terrorist group as well as the cut the funding from the kurds in Europe . Not to mention , we have to stop the drug supplies to EU which basically funds the whole kurdish terrorists . \\n\\nAnother issue with Turkey for joining to EU is that people in EU sees EU kinda like a Christian union . And lets all be really people are also afraid of Muslims from the Middle East because of those live in EU ( even though they are different ) \\n\\nThere are more things to talk about but I am tired .

Alpha023,europe,"& gt ; No actually it\\ 's the hypocrisy i\\ 'm talking about . What happened first is that the Ottomans occupied the Byzantine Empire . If you\\ 're fine with conquering foreign lands when you win a war , why do you think the Treaty of Sevres was unfair ? It\\ 's nothing else than what you did to others right ? I\\ 'm asking you and you keep avoiding the topic.\\n\\nByzantine fought with Ottomans directly whereas Treaty of Sevres granted Greece and Armenia huge lands although they were never the major powers that fought agaisnt Ottomans . There is a difference . Treaty of Sevres is unfair because these major powers ( British , French , Italians ... ) were never in Anatolia . Whereas Muslims/Turks did have origins . Yes some of their ancestry came from Central Asia but that doesn\\'t mean they didn\\'t integrated with the locals there . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is exactly what the Ottomans did . Turkic people were not English to Anatolia before they got there and \ '' disturbed the land\ '' as you put it.\\n\\nDo you honestly believe we are completely English to Central Asia ? This is the result of nationalistic propaganda in your country . Visit Turkey and see how similar our people are to yours then decide whether we are completely Asian . Fact is majority of our ancestry lies on Anatolia and surrounding reasons.\\n\\n & gt ; Dude this is exactly what you said you were fine with , a few posts above when i replied to you . You literally said \ '' so what if we conquered them ? \ '' I\\ 'm trying to understand if you agree with the right of conquest or not but it\\ 's obvious that you only agree with the right of the winner when you win and when you lose the war you think that being occupied is unfair . If you think that it\\ 's not right , then you should also agree that what the Ottomans did in Anatolia was not right . Pick one.\\n\\nI was fine with that when it was between 1300-1700s as did everyone else . Everything until the 1800s or even later is a totally different world than it was in 1920s . People and human society changed so did my opinion on the subject . Problem is you people are still continuing that irredentism in 21st century.\\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish

This garden we have does not really have a gardener . And more of a forest-kinda , plants their own gardeners type of deal . Now from nature , we know that single species systems don\\'t always work . Even a human being isn\\'t a single specie system .

Some argue that what Germany and Japan did in WW2 was to avoid food shortages that they experienced in recent history .

If we can debate over something for hours , we have to nitpick otherwise we won\\'t ever get to the point.\\n\\nYou is also sometimes used to refer to groups when it is second person plural . So \\'Conforming to you/a group\\ ' is equivalent to \\'conforming to the values of the group\\ ' . Now tell me , was your nitpicking in this case any useful ? Did it add anything to our debate ? \\n\\n & gt ; Except there is a world of difference , and everyone who were attacked by racists or Islamists would agree . Europe has itchy trigger fingers for racists - a well deserved reflex honed due to history . Racist attacks are covered extensively and everything that can be done to prevent them is being done . However , violence fuelled by Islam in Europe is hushed , not covered by the media , rapes committed by immigrant groups doesn\\'t even make it to the papers . If you question this , you immediately get called a racist . That is a huge difference right there.\\n\\nI would argue otherwise . You have still attacks by Muslims covered by the media , it has been several months we still talk about Charlie , right ? \\n\\n & gt ; I find your arguments laughable , because they are not very different from the arguments of the people you mock so comfortably . Your responses seem to run on labels , like \ '' Racists\ '' who complain about SJWs . I\\ 'm Turkish , I complain about SJWs because I don\\'t need them to defend me . I can fight my own battles . You go on and on with labels , \ '' conformists\ '' , \ '' intolerants\ '' et cetera . I think that explains your disdain for \ '' nitpicking\ '' , because it\\ 's mighty easy for you when you can do everything over labels . And talk about dishonesty as icing on the cake . \\n\\nThe same way that nitpicking is useful , labels have its uses . It allows the use of abstraction in the discussion . When discussing something so big , you need to discuss abstracts . You can not discuss generalities using individual cases . It is possible discuss every \\'conformist\\ ' and \\'intolerants\\ ' on an individual basis . But that would take too much time .

Alpy94,europe,"While I do not have much knowledge about Netherlands , here in France most Arabs are mostly well integrated . But my definition of integration is more open than many Europeans . For me integration would be finding people of immigrant descent in different positions where they interact with locals . And in France you have many arabs doing that . On the wikipedia page for Dutch Turks , there are or were 18 different politicians . [ Hell with a definition similar to mine , this study suggest that Turks are well integrated in Netherlands . ] ( http : //eucenter.berkeley.edu/files/tol-a-compariative-study.pdf ) ( interesting study . You should read it ) \\n\\nNow might I offer a different point of view ? While many Turks are integrated , some aren\\'t . Now a question : Would you notice that the person who next to you on the bus was Turkish or of Turkish descent or not ? Turks do not look very different from other Europeans . The only cases would be that of not-so-well integrated ones . So chances are you interact with a lot of well integrated Turks but you don\\'t notice well because you are integrated ! Unfortunately therefore it is natural that people assume that Turks aren\\'t integrated into Dutch society.\\n\\n & gt ; Perhaps it came across as sinister , not my intention.\\n\\nIt came across as very very sinister , though I assumed it wasn\\'t intentional.\\n\\n & gt ; I consider all ethnic and racial backgrounds as having equal worth and rights , but i also believe that the traditional homelands of those groups should be where they remain the majority . That way they all have a place in the world to feel safe among people they can identify with . That would avoid a lot of conflict and violence . ( On that note : # America4EnglishAmericans ! ) \\n\\nNow I disagree . People should move around a lot more . It helps to avoid echo chambers in societies for one . It allows for more culture . More ideas . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Anyway i hope that explains my worries about the future of my own people/culture and the incessant whining of our governments about how we should become a \ '' multi-cultural society\ '' . \\n\\nTurks worry about the same thing , about their future . Only their ancestors were poor and migrated , while yours were wealthier . Can you judged them for doing the same thing ? \\n\\n & gt ; Completely ignoring the fact that history has shown how that often leads to fear , hatred and ethnic cleansing . A multi-cultural planet would be a far more viable goal.\\n\\nYou mean having multi-cultural societies leads to hatred ? I would argue the opposite . Societies with a single monolithic cultures tend to be more intolerant as their ideas of natural/usual is more concretely defined , and any thing outside that thin slice is considered wrong . So any interaction with an outside culture will end in catastrophe . In a harmonious multi-cultural society , your idea of usual is wider so you consider a lot more things to be acceptable .

AnEphemeralThrowaway,europe,"Europe\\ 's core modern values are not based on Christianity and Turkey\\ 's modern values are not based on Islam .

AnEphemeralThrowaway,europe,"My guess is people are referring to religion.\\n\\nIslamic lifestyle , proper full 100 % Islamist lifestyle , is definitely incompatible with modern Europe . Incidentally I would argue that proper full 100 % Christian lifestyle is incompatible with modern Europe as well , but currently in Europe there is no State that is using Christianity the way the current Turkish government are using Islam . \\n\\nSo based on this , the argument is that Islamic lifestyle is somehow inherently deeply entrenched in Turkish society and every little dogmatic rule in Islam is at least passively present in any Turkish persons lifestyle . But in actual fact I would argue that Islamic ways of living are not inherently involved in the way the average Turkish person lives their life , and I would even go further and say even the average AKP supporting Turk doesn\\'t live their life with much real Islamic influence.\\n\\nI imagine I will be getting weird stares at the moment . \ '' But Erdogan is Islamist , he is bringing Islamism to Turkey , Sharia Law , headscarves etc.\ '' . It\\ 's true yes . He is using Islamist populism to garner support . The Turkish demographic that supports him easily fall for the plea to emotion . A few Islamic phrases here and there and they are swooning for him , because these are people doe eyed for the days of their ancestors village and since their ancestors saw these words as noble and associated with good deeds , they automatically see it that way as well . This certainly is a problem that causes a division between the way people vote in Europe and the way they vote in Turkey , Turkey still has an electorate that can be exploited with religious populism . \\n\\nBut then in terms of the lifestyle of these AKP voters ... are they actually 100 % living lives that are not redeemable with the West ? I would say no they are not . A religious AKP supporter who does his 5 times a day prayers is not incompatible with the West . Forcing this religion on others is , and to be honest in my experience of AKP voters among my relatives I have never experienced any force or anything in their lifestyles that would see them as being fundamentally different from their humble socio-economic equivalents in Europe ( especially those in the Balkans who are probably much like them but with the Church replaced with the Mosque ) . \\n\\nThere is a minority pocket of hardcore Islamists that are fringe compared to AKP mainstream standards and who actually are most certainly not compatible with Europe in any way shape or form . These are similar to the Islamists we see protesting on the streets of London , Paris or Berlin , who I like to call \ '' the Saudi pocket\ '' . These people shouldn\\'t be in the conversation if they are talking about mainstream Turkish culture and its compatibility with Europe , as they are not representative of Turkish Muslim cultural norms.\\n\\nFor me Turkey\\ 's incompatibility with Europe starts and ends with politics . The fact that a right wing conservative government is in power , voted in by people who see their religious identity like a football team and a Fascist President who resembles a leader from the days European states were riddled with Fascist leaders . The fact that the political institutions and state apparatus\\ ' of Turkey are not up to European Union standards , judiciary etc . things like this . This is the main difference between a Turk and a European . It\\ 's not that there is a deep cultural difference . \\n\\nBut away from politics , if we look at the general Turkish life map , it is the same as a European life map ( and I imagine this life map is true of the whole World ) . Born , go to school , hopefully do well at school and go to university , get a well paying job , get married , have kids , rinse and repeat etc . all while participating in the capitalistic free market along the way . This is just as true for Erdoganist Turks as it is for Europeanist Turks . It\\ 's not as simple as poor working class people from Anatolia VS rich educated Istanbul/Western Coast elite . Much of the bedrock of AKP support is by the \ '' Anatolian Tigers\ '' , the noveau rich who come from humbler backgrounds than the \ '' old money\ '' Kemalists . \\n\\nI guess what I\\ 'm essentially saying is this . Let\\ 's say we lived in a wacky alterEnglish history where Turkey was a historically Christian country . All of the things in Turkish politics could still be the same as they are . There is nothing inherent in Islam that makes Turkish politics the way it is , you can substitute any religion and it would work the same , especially the Abrahamic religions . Erdogan could be a Christian leader using Christian rhetoric to drill the masses up in the same way .
