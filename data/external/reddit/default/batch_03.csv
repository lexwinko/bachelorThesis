Metric is the primary system used by the US government especially in things such as the military since the [ Metric Conversion Act ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act ) of 1975 . Also universities are mainly taught using the metric system as well as scientific research.\\n\\nThe hard part is convincing hundreds of millions of people that are familiar with British units to make a switch .

It is represented by a centrist Democrat.\\n\\nThe district with the 2nd lowest GINI is MN-06 , which covers the wealthy exurbs northwest of Minneapolis , the city and suburbs of St .

These suburbs of New York City are prosperous , but not as wealthy as the Hamptons further east ( this is district NY-01 ) .

Not even a debate on that point . Obamacare is considered socialism so it is an evil program and gets criticized by people that are on Medicare and Social Security .

4ringcircus,europe,Those bases increase stability . They are there with permission of the local governments .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,You have said Poland doesn\\'t matter . Defending a country with a military appliance isn\\'t letting them rot as a convenient safety buffer.\\n\\nSpending according to GDP is to make it where all countries contribute towards defense but giving it a measure of fairness . Richer countries should provide more since they are more able . You can\\'t expect NATO to be completely \ '' equal\ '' with every country having the same size army . GDP is the fairest metric to compare .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes just like cease fires only done by Ukraine was such good news . Russia is being quite gracious by allowing Ukraine to still keep a country .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,No one buys your shilling .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I heard it was really rough for them . So many teeth to deposit before 5 pm .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , because that is what I said .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,More of the typical salami tactics . Russia will want military there and the section of country will be a dysfunctional nightmare that keeps Russia with a buffer they can exploit and Ukraine left fractured and weak versus a prosperous developing country like other Eastern European EU countries .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Bullshit . You find people bringing it up in the thread . So was I not right ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,According to you .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"So , what about the West is what you are saying ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes the \ '' rebels\ '' are quite the victims here being persecuted by EU . Quite the bogeyman .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Too cheap to have dignity .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Do German politicians actually talk like this with no repercussions ? Is this something they say because of populist appeal and is shared by many Germans ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Trolling has become truly high tech now . Assholes now come with air forces .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Maybe picking up some teenagers together .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,So it just invades all its neighbors and creates puppets out of self defense ? I am glad it has NOTHING to do with Russia trying to have another reiteration of their former empires .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yeah Russia has never done that before .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes NATO would matter because then you can protect yourself better against Russian hostility . Russia bullies who they can .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I stopped reading your drivel at first paragraph . It literally states they have no proof on anything they wrote . You think Russia attacks from open fields away from cities ? Of course there is collateral damage .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Doesn\\'t change that Serbia takes huge amounts of aid from the EU regardless of what you claim you don\\'t \ '' need\ '' . I\\ 'm sure you would gladly pay much higher taxes to make up for the shortfall in aid .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Just the other day they were threatening to invade and annex Canada . Oh wait , never mind .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,25 years ! At what point is Ukraine allowed to be a country ? Instead they keep Ukraine in a permanent state of poverty and forever meddling in their internal politics.\\n\\nYou think maybe they could have built some factories instead of leveling Grozny to the ground or invading Georgia occupying Moldova for over twenty years ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That implies Russia views them as real countries . Russia is a king on the board and pawns are dispensable .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yeah right . One country . With who leading ? I have seen Germany in action .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes I do remember watching that interview . I have never heard that perspective before until I watched the interview . The one point that confused me was when he said losing gas from Russia would be manageable due to it being a small percentage of their total energy needs . I am mostly curious to know what options Finland has to protect itself from the constant economic threats used by Russia . The current atmosphere is disgusting . It has common Russians beating their chest with how strong and important they are again which is the most disconcerting part of everything happening.\\n\\nWhen you have the educated and internet savvy that speak English talking like barbarians that cheer and beg for nuclear war and empire I can only imagine the uneducated that only have access to Russian media and speak just Russian.\\n\\nIt is becoming harder and harder for me to separate Putin from Russians .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , clearly EU are the irrational ones here .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,There is no proof that will ever convince you . I tire of trolls . I know where these conversations end . I have had these conversations lead to Russians claiming they were oppressed by Georgia which was the true leading country of USSR . I am not drunk enough for that level of trolling and bullshit .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Thank you , I had no idea .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That is disgraceful . Thank you .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Sorry , I am quite ignorant to the situation . Who exactly were the Irish fighting if they were neutral ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"I am not defending the British history with Ireland , but there were much bigger things in play . If Hitler got his European empire you would have been begging for the British to rule you as an alterEnglish .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Literal Russian soldiers in a country they are not welcome in is an invasion . Stop defending Russia with this bullshit . No one cares about these semantic games . That isn\\'t \ '' discussion\ '' . That is just deflection .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"I am curious , how do you view this as USA helping Ukraine ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"You are a disgusting troll . Haha , nuclear war is hilarious .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Still a load of shit to get invaded over and over and only respond by saying please stop . It is pretty brazen to invade countries and get offended when they defend themselves .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Is this sarcasm ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,You forgot the evil Jews !,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you were being obtuse on purpose .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That is pretty clever once the translations are mentioned .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Very poignant .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Nope , they gave theirs up with zero negative effects on their end.\\n\\nEdit : SARCASM",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,& gt ; paying stay-at-home moms\\n\\nWhat ? How does this match up with \ '' right wing\ '' in any shape or form ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Russia only understands force .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I just am watching from a distance as half the continent has massive unemployment and Germany\\ 's solution is cut cut cut into prosperity \ '' for the greater good\ '' . They don\\'t give a shit about anything other than getting gas in and artificially cheap exports out while everyone else in the puppet states suffers . I can see with my own eyes how Germany responded as a leader when it came time to do something for the greater good that might actually have any effect on their own precious GDP .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Do you want a cookie for admitting Russia invaded Crimea six months later or something ? I couldn\\'t imagine a more obvious statement . I didn\\'t realize we had to celebrate when people talk about the sky being blue.\\n\\nI\\ 'm making Russia look bad ? Russia beats the rest of the planet combined on the \ '' making Russia look bad\ '' front.\\n\\nYeah , I\\ 'm shilling because I\\ 'm not trying to defend them with bullshit legalese while they are trying to carve up Ukraine .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Haha , never change , Serbians . Complaining about FUCK THE EU while taking aid from EU .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Fucking assholes dared to protest . Only natural that the result is an invasion by Russia .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , even if New York gave away trillions they would never be able to tell the rest of the country how to operate .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Never fails .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I get a huge impression of the courage of your convictions .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The Swiss .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Correct . One time fix .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That false equivalency hurts my brain . The leaders of the \ '' rebels\ '' literally is Russian government.\\n\\nIt would be literally like an American citizen born in USA that worked for US government becoming the president of Ukraine . Let me know when USA is invading and has soldiers dying on vacation and \ '' getting lost\ '' as well . They are supplied and trained and led directly from Russian government . It is a Russian proxy war by every definition . No one believes Russia\\ 's denials . They still think the rest of the world operates like Russia during Soviet era where you can just put out a government controlled message and everyone buys it .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,He was literally complaining about how badly UK was treated by USA while it was trying to invade and take over Egypt YET AGAIN . All while Hungary was being invaded . How the fuck is USA supposed to be mad at USSR and support Egypt being taken over at the same time ? Bitching about colonialism as if it was ancient history just because UK is \ '' old enough\ '' while trying to turn the Middle East into UK\\ 's playground once again .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Implying there is any \ '' surprise\ '' from that .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And WHY did any of that happen ? Because of Russia trying to destroy Ukraine \ '' covertly\ '' .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And these polls show why Eastern Europe looks across the Atlantic for a dependable ally .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The richest countries on earth and people freezing by the thousands . OK .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Wait was there some kind of distraction during that ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The point was that Russia clearly overmatches Ukraine .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The fighting happens on the front . If there are attacks on Germany proper then that is also a front . Big difference from handing out food .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,It is absurd to treat Ukrainians like mindless drones that aren\\'t able to make their own decisions . It isn\\'t hard choice to be against Russia . The only convincing that is needed is sharing a border usually and witnessing how they treat \ '' friends\ '' on a regular basis .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yeah , USA was moments away from jumping in with the SS and storming London .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Are you seriously suggesting that helping the UK war effort prior to it being politically feasible to jump in 100 % was exploiting WWII in some way ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Christ . I almost never hear about that happening in USA . Even the homeless rarely ever die from bad weather . What the hell is going on over there ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I agree with you but the massive difference makes the whole comparison absurd .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes because Russia is very nuanced with their use of declaring people and governments fascist .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"To be fair , the propaganda works . That is my simplistic vision of it . I was shocked the other day to learn that the UK is poorer than even the poorest states in the USA . I have always considered the UK to be a rich country . Somehow even shit holes like Mississippi are richer .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,What exactly is allowed to happen in non Russian land ? Is near Russia also ruled by Putin that it requires his permission ? \\n\\nWhere is your outrage over ACTUAL invasions in Europe ? Instead you save your disgust for allies instead .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,A drop in the bucket over two plus decades you mean ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Wait , I thought they are NATO prior to that no ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Thanks for all that info . Your name also makes a lot more sense now . I just assumed you really liked football and mirrors.\\n\\nHopefully it all works out for the best for Scotland .

4ringcircus,europe,This is what made me click . Do you work in marketing ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Thanks , I will . I was shocked at even hearing about it .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Just noticed the Sahara is a migrant too .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And I honestly think that is a good system even though it isn\\'t a \ '' free\ '' market . I think believe in extremes and the policy makes sense . I don\\'t really believe saying something isn\\'t pure capitalism is a valid criticism anyway.\\n\\nThe USA has farm subsidies as well and their farming industry could very easily produce way more if it so desired . What I don\\'t understand is how fucked up Russia is with how it supports its industry . It just comes off as a big fuck you to its citizens .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Its senses .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,This is why I come here .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Orders of magnitude in deaths . Who the hell said I down voted you ? Am I all of reddit ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Oh God that is depressing . I had no clue Italy was that bad . I assumed it was doing fine until crisis and education was only an issue with old people .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That is just a choice in priorities .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Fuck them .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Greece , LOL .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Invading Gibraltar while no one is looking ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Hahaha . Yes go to Portugal for the employment prospects .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Amazing what happens when Russia does Russian things if you dare to not be a puppet . Changes opinions very quickly .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,In that case disband all military . Ultimate under dog . As if Putin lacks ways to push propaganda .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,USA was supplying the Allies long before they joined . The US was also hurting Japan in an attempt to help the Allies as well before they officially joined the war .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,It increased the commute a little .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Fuck that . So Hitler could have fortress Europe ? What could possibly go wrong ? No matter what is done there will always be a pissed off contrarian group that will turn literally any action into something negative . There are people that complain even when they literally are given free things .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Well at least I can appreciate American style propaganda .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Oh well in that case I guess he needs to take over all of Europe then to make sure he can secure gas delivery to every single household.\\n\\nThere is more to Ukraine than just having a pipeline going through it.\\n\\nAre you trying to say Putin is justified in his actions ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Are you trying to say Putin is justified in his actions ? \\n\\nHurr , hurr , I am just a stupid American , never heard that one before.\\n\\nWhy does Russia need to take over Ukraine ? Ukraine is a consumer of their gas . Many other countries in Europe are as well . Tell me again why Ukraine should be annexed against their will and how any of that is justified versus seizing any other country in Europe ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Well if Germany could actually be a leader , there would be no need for military equipment to cross oceans instead of moving a couple countries over to the East .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"I was being sarcastic . I think it was a mistake to give up nukes when next to Russia . I wish USA would do more for you . I am honestly not sure about memorandum , but it seems like USA and UK are keeping up their end of the deal by respecting the territory of Ukraine , no ? Russia on the other hand , well , they are doing the usual .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,He has known the rules that would result in the adjustment of GNI for all of EU for years yes . It was agreed to for years by everyone . Literally no surprises that this was happening . Cameron is a liar playing populist politics . The UK also absolutely 100 % is not being punished for a damn thing .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,My sides . Why not just reroll an account and go with village_idiot instead ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"No , no . You misunderstood me . Those are two independent statements .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I would imagine from frustration at Russian propaganda game . I know I am guilty of making the comments myself often .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Haha . I will watch with popcorn from here as Germany and rest of Europe fucks over France and UK instead of USA.\\n\\nWhy should we pay taxes ? No one will attack us . UK and France have nukes and army .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That poor invading army . I hope someone is praying for them . If only we could have peace by giving Putin his USSR territory . EU are a real big group of meanies .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Could you expand on that ? What are you referring to ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Shocker . This is like the Godwin of /r/Europe .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Look at a map lately ? Check the size of Russia and ask yourself if Russia is going to run out of conscripts .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Well , I don\\'t disagree with anything you said . I just think \ '' gas\ '' is inaccurate . Europe doesn\\'t need Ukraine for gas and Russia had zero issues selling gas without annexing Ukraine . Russia just wants to annex Ukraine before another country joins EU and improves their situation . You see how they react to countries like the Baltics or Georgia .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I only wish US forces could have GPS malfunctions .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Oh , so your frame of reference was half a century ago ? When did American military invade ? \\n\\nDo you know what the words \ '' same shit\ '' mean ? \\n\\nItaly are real warmongers too . Punic wars , same shit .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , just like all the courageous people in the US Coast Guard that protected Florida beaches against the Nazis .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And nothing was lost .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,You are saying the government actually pays people to do shit like that ? That picture is insanely depressing no matter if it is true believers or paid shills . I honestly have trouble understanding Russia . All I ever hear and read is how much the people love the rule of Putin in Russia . This comes even from \ '' Western\ '' media which has an obvious bias against Russia and would love to portray Putin in a bad light .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"So all the \ '' support\ '' of Putin you think is fake ? Are you being sarcastic when you say there was too much freedom in the 1990s ? Hard to tell over text . \\n\\nI know Yeltsin was a disaster , no one disputes that . Does that make it where basically Putin can do anything because at least he isn\\'t Yeltsin ? This is just my own thinking on the matter . Feel free to tell me I am completely wrong . I just seem to run into so many people online that are willing to make excuses for literally any and every action Russia takes .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,How is it any different ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The president was elected on the premise that he take that deal that was years in the making . He was bought and paid for as a Putin puppet .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yeah , I agree . North Korea is all about opinion polls and a happy populace . Literally the only difference between North Korea and the countries in EU is term limits .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,He will hate whatever stops him . He hates Ukraine now . They were the same country only decades before . Appeasing him stops nothing . You going to break all relationships with USA ? Russia is killing Ukrainians as a way to show power and strength and being relevant super power as a proxy attack against USA will happen no matter what .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The point is you don\\'t leave the country and actually show up to fight . I could have mentioned national guard for USA but those people are actually still called into active duty and sent overseas . The ones on the front are the ones doing the actual \ '' defending\ '' .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Still going strong with the first occupation .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Pathetic attempt .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,State television openly talks about Russia going to war and Russians escaping to bunkers ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,But again they can always outnumber . Russia has tons of nukes of every variety . They are also crazy in thinking nukes DE ESCALATE .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Sounds like something out of a North Korea official press release .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Snails are fucking delicious .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,What the hell is \ '' on the west\ '' ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Oh , so I guess the weak economy of Germany can\\'t handle 2 % unlike the powerhouses of Poland and Greece ? Somehow UK manages just fine to keep above 2 % .\\n\\nSo , unless there is the threat of being kicked out , freeload with a train of excuses including referencing economies in the 1940s at every opportunity ? \\n\\nThis is why there will never be an EU military . Just a bunch of countries trying to fuck each other over at every opportunity by one upping each other . It is a mutual defense treaty , but all these countries just putz around saying who gives a shit I can\\'t be punished for it and the other countries protect me . If that isn\\'t selfish freeloading I don\\'t know if anything is.\\n\\nYou have a country like Spain that says fuck it and cut their military more and more , but then they cry about taking care of illegal immigrants from Africa . Why should anyone in EU care when Spain proves very effectively that they don\\'t give a shit about anything that happens in Eastern Europe ? It is only \ '' team\ '' when it is asking for everyone else to help you.\\n\\nBy the way . That crisis affects Americans , too . I didn\\'t realize a crisis that also happens in USA is a good excuse to say we don\\'t want to spend on defense , let American tax payers take care of it for us so we can have other things we want .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,WWII being used as an excuse for free loading on budgets in 2014.\\n\\nK.\\n\\nWhere are these war torn areas in Western Europe ? Why are countries that were behind the iron curtain able to meet the AGREED UPON goal ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And how would writing off all of Europe help USA ? That would mean one country owning the whole continent . Leaving an alliance also is an excellent way to lose influence . Taking your ball and going home doesn\\'t improve anything.\\n\\nIf anything USA has the most to complain about in regards to NATO . It wouldn\\'t be \ '' an Anglo club\ '' if everyone weren\\'t such cheap bastards that freeload with pride . The exceptions to this prove the rule .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Simple , a big army kept them honest in Germany during Cold War . A big army would have kept them out of Ukraine and Georgia and would kick them out of Moldova . The point of military is being ready to always use it which prevents you from having to . Not having a military causes more war .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I do agree with you but give credit where it is due . I think Poland and Greece pay their share and all of the Baltics are either projected to hit 2 % or are already there .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,And then what ? Internal passports restricting their travel ? They would be able to move anywhere they wanted and like all immigrants would form ghettos because they would be most comfortable around each other .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Because it is true .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I completely missed that .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Well , in that case , it would be with a sub or ICBM . At that point , tactical or strategic is just a matter of size . It wouldn\\'t be used in a \ '' battlefield\ '' setting which is the intent of tactical nukes . Russia has tons of ICBMs and a huge fleet of subs from soviet days that can launch nukes as well . You would need A LOT of missiles in order to guarantee a likelihood of stopping the attack . Plus subs introduce a real wild card . It is basically impossible to stop sub attacks.\\n\\nThey even have bombers that can drop nukes , but that is more risky . Nowadays they are mostly used for dick waving by violating NATO/EU airspace .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Must be from Texas with whatever was laying in back seat on quick notice .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,How convenient .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,They don\\'t need to invade Germany . They work the edges and weaken the EU politically in the meantime because their main rival is EU not the USA . EU has a much bigger effect on Russia economically and politically versus the USA . The last thing they need is a strong EU . That is why they invaded Ukraine multiple times . They take full advantage of funding opposition parties and \ '' protecting Russians\ '' around Europe .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Russia can\\'t do shit . If they did that , they would only be guaranteeing their own destruction . You don\\'t earn \ '' respect\ '' through nukes . You earn it by giving respect to your neighbors . That is why countries run from Russia at first opportunity into the arms of USA and EU and NATO .",Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"All of it , daily , for months .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"No , Russia almost never pops in the news or mentioned by government . Even now . No one gives a shit about that failed state .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,The fucking gall to point out they are invaded . Not as bad as what the Jews did in WWII though .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,They want to complain about countries having their own foreign policy and expansionism for anything . You would think NATO is stationed in Moscow with all their bullshit crying . All Putin does is bitch and whine .,Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,You are completely right . How hard is it to pay attention ? Russia was doing this as soon as the Soviet government fell . There is absolutely nothing new here .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Just look at the booming economy in North Korea for example . I totally agree with your assessment .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Great counterpoint .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , but sanctions keep them weak . The point was that only a military can take them out unless the people within finally revolt on their own . Plus they get propped up from China.\\n\\nRussia gets almost all their revenue direct from EU .",Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,Eastern Europe dictators ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"Yeah , in March .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,You are just excusing Russia . Russia invaded because they lost their puppet president . End of story . The people snapped at his lies and doesn\\'t want to be a Russian vassal forever and to trade with EU . Why should Russia be able to control Ukraine and leave it in permanent poverty ? They have a right to prosperity . EU has more to offer them.\\n\\nFuck this apologizing . I don\\'t care about their motives . Stop invading Europe . They operate as though they are a vast WNP pure and no one may dare touch the USSR that still exists in their mind and they are so confused why Warsaw pact countries prefer the West.\\n\\nEdit : yes you are lying . Pushing propaganda about \ '' promises\ '' that NATO isn\\'t allowed to accept countries that aren\\'t written anywhere . Just more bullshit from Russia to excuse their naked aggression . They are irrelevant with a bruised ego that takes it out on neighbors because they can\\'t hit their real \ '' enemy\ '' of the USA .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,What does ISIS have to do with the other rebel groups ? They are different groups . USA is already saying that they would do that . You are mentioning things to do that are already in the works . Also EU is for the most part NATO . EU should be held responsible for doing nothing against Russia in their backyard . Most of them are looking for reasons to cut their military because they use USA for a crutch .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,They already captured Crimea . I have never seen such fragile egos .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,All of them fell when Soviet Union fell .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes everyone knows Russia respects treaties and diplomacy versus force and power .,Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"Just sounds like horrible options all around . There seriously is no way for change in government without war and revolution , you think ? Russia has gone that far down the path of dictatorship ?",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Holy shit . I hope someone invents planes or something . EU forces should be defending their own damn continent instead of whining that they actually even have to a military at all . EU forces are also disjointed and lack political will to be used .

4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , it absolutely is better objectively in every single way . Well , glad we got that settled .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I am pretty sure USA-India ties are closer now than they have ever been from what I have read .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That is true but the hope is adding things in future not removing more and more . It is my understanding that only UK and Denmark have exceptions and Sweden is cheating . Also things get a little weird when island nations are involved . UK really only borders one country and only partially . Most of UK has no borders at all .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I had to leave Navy due to medical . Any other bullshit tangents you want to try ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Having your leadership being Russian citizens born in Russia and connections to Russian government does wonders for that bullshit you are pushing .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I am curious . Are there any maps that break down all these \ '' countries\ '' you speak of ? I thought Russians were an ethnic majority all over Russia including even the far reaches of Siberia . Aren\\'t nukes also located all over Russia ? It would be strategically unwise to only have them in one location . Basically the same reason that Ukraine had nukes when USSR broke apart .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Well the job description kind of sets the tone .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Do you have an opinion on why ? Is it something like pride possibly ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,How is a balkanized Russia with nukes any better ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I didn\\'t realize offering Ukrainians a better standard of living was imperialism . Sure doesn\\'t seem like \ '' same shit\ '' to me .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That was an NSA planted story to give them an air of objectivity . We have to go deeper .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,False equivalency sure does excuse a lot of bullshit with ridiculous rationalizations .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,That is because you have people in Europe that call people that push for sanctions war mongers while appeasing actual invaders .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,What snowball effect ? A bunch of people screaming the sky is falling for decades as the USA continues to grow larger and larger .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,It has been 70 years . Are the nerves really that raw still ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I was not aware that the USA was trying to break apart countries in Europe . I should watch the news more . Any suggestions ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,One can only hope .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yes so much war mongering from the west that refuses to get involved and Ukraine defending itself . When will everyone stop picking on the invaders that are denying anything is happening ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Am I in /r/YUROP right now ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Switzerland is not neutral .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,His comments obsess over hating Americans and talking about video games which are pretty much exclusively American made on an American website . The irony of the pathetic existence would be comical but it is hard to notice when you spend all your time circlejerking in ShitAmericansSay .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,So does Mexico get Los Angeles ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Because the press is so open in Russia and anything that is said over there is to be believed . Russia is a dictatorship .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Cough South Korea cough .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Is that true ? I never heard about that,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Yeah Russia would run it without issues I am sure . I can only imagine the customer service levels would make Comcast envious .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Stalingrad was a nice touch .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I never heard about second one . I barely remember the first . You are kind of reaching though . A jet is hardly a remote control plane that is broadcasting video . That jet is physically controlled.\\n\\nPlus I just give credit to any hacking attempts and kind of appreciate them . Better than thinking you are invincible .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Only the names change . Corruption stays the same .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Everything he does is hilarious .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Thanks ! I had no idea how bad it was .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Because people said that .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,What ? USA did not try to get Falklands handed over . They have military support to UK . Reagan offered naval support.\\n\\nUSA was also heavily involved in WWII almost a year before they joined officially . Also this was before USA was a huge world power and NATO existed .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Not everyone gets to the big leagues of the TSA immediately . There are developmental leagues .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I would of course but that is politicians in every country . I imagine leftists in Russia are almost like the dodo .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Based on what ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,You might as well be black for all that racist cares .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,No one in the West is doing any favors for China .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Solution is obvious ? What solution ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Why are you thinking war from hundreds of years ago is somehow relevant today ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,No treaty ? Then it means nothing . Russia definitely treats even a memo that is in writing like toilet paper so why should a conversation that supposedly happened be rule of law ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Not really .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"The point is that if you deny your own soldiers are even dying and you parade the enemy like Nazis and you deny you are even there , what hope is there as a prisoner ?",Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"I know full well that UK has exceptions since it isn\\'t in Eurozone . I was stating that UK clearly wasn\\'t doing anything that could remotely be considered \ '' austerity\ '' . It mimicked USA on how to recover from crisis by doing QE . Yes , of course cuts were made , but some form of cuts were needed . It couldn\\'t be considered full blown austerity however . UK definitely doesn\\'t follow Germany\\ 's Austrian economic school of thought .",Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,They are not allies . China has openly stated that Crimea belongs to Ukraine .,Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"Trolls gon na troll . Russia flat out is responsible for murder , but you don\\'t want to see the obvious and grasp at straws .

4ringcircus,europe,Why ? You think he will start nationalizing companies or something ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,All of a sudden ? He thought that when it fell . It became an even greater idea once he it worked out he would be the leader of it .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Well not behind compared to Belarus and Ukraine as examples . I am sure there are more .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Here we go .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Who was last Russian leader that was \ '' good for Russians\ '' ?,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I wondered what took so long for this to appear .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,Haha . Sorry that is hysterical for me to have Russians treat Putin like a living God hero and then other accuse him of working for USA .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,I guess that would be a nicer way of stating \ '' doesn\\'t know shit\ '' outside of their country . Being a superpower and being a large country with a large population makes it all too easy to think the world begins and ends at the US borders.\\n\\nHope you are liking it so far . I\\ 've heard Colorado is a beautiful state . I\\ 've never gone past the East Coast as far as USA goes .,Germanic,English
4ringcircus,europe,"I do hope you are joking . Catholic and Christian are one in the same . This is prior to the Reformation and East-West split . Also , the area was most definitely Catholic , the kingdom that was invaded by the Moors was Catholic .",Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"Yes , it could possibly be everything except the most likely thing every single time .",Germanic,English

4ringcircus,europe,"First off , there is no \ '' real\ '' value with gold . Gold is a useless commodity that people run to because they think it is somehow worth more than fiat currency . Gold is only useful based on perceived value just like fiat is . Gold is like the tulips of 2014 . The price fluctuates like any other commodity and it is incredibly easy to lose money from investing in it.\\n\\nHere is the information you asked for : \\n\\nhttp : //www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/\\n\\nWho says lack of regulation is a definition of an economy . Laws can be passed and things change . Nothing exists in a vacuum frozen in time . I would say the issues of Europe have a lot more to do with the flawed system of the Eurozone . The economy of the USA is much bigger than the Eurozone and it functions much better than it because there is more central power and weaker states are looked after better . In a very ironic situation , USA is more socialist than the Eurozone.\\n\\nAlso , don\\'t criticize what current yields happen to be . When inflation is almost nonexistent bond yields will also be incredibly low as well . Government loans and institutional investors operate on massive scales and always get the cheapest interest rates available . That isn\\'t unique to the crisis.\\n\\nI am not discounting your criticisms of EU . They are very valid and I\\ 've made the same criticisms myself countless times .

All of us are going to find out eventually though . I personally hope for a very successful EU with more centralized power in Brussels . The current system pisses me off and I get angry at how fucked over the Southern countries are in the current status quo.\\n\\nUSA isn\\'t going to fail . I don\\'t know many people that cheer for recessions , but the boom and bust cycle just kind of keeps repeating itself with a general upward trend . Things will always be ok . Sometimes the situation will be worse and other times things will be better . Everything ebbs and flows and kind of self corrects . The system in the USA doesn\\'t let anything fail . Even the shittiest states in USA are propped up to where they have living standards that are similar to the richer countries of Europe regardless of which states happen to be doing poorly at any given time.\\n\\nThe USA is a lot more socialist than it likes to admit . Just never use that word inside of the country . It is the definition of evil for many ignorant people inside of that country and in an ironic twist they tend to survive due to the socialist systems that they despise.\\n\\nMeanwhile in EU you have countries in Germany or Austria that are still doing well and they look over to countries like Spain and tell them to stop being so morally inferior and lazy and say \ '' tough shit\ '' no matter how bad their economy is doing while having zero control over their own fiscal policy that is influenced primarily by Berlin.\\n\\nI\\ 'm kind of rambling , but I think what I\\ 'm trying to say is that it is a fucked up system .

If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million Englishs . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I am Bulgarian . Why am I Bulgarian ? 1300+ years ago some 30 000 steppe people showed up in the general area where Bulgaria is situated now . They were the Bulgars . What they found was a bunch of unorganised Slavs and Thracian descendants numbering about 2 million people . Quickly they incorporated them within the new Bulgarian state with the Bulgars forming the ruling and military elite . Wars ensued and little by little the proto-Bulgarians either mixed in with the English inhabitants or died off in these wars . I am very inclined to believe that all Bulgars had died off ( As they were semi-nomadic warriors they comprised the biggest chunk of the army , they did not deal with other things , so when an army was destroyed a massive chunk of the Bulgar population was destroyed as well ) or mixed with the local populace beyond recognition by the time the Byzantines conquered Bulgaria some 300 years after its creation . \\n\\nSo here I am . Its 2016 some 1000 years after I believe the Bulgars in this region were no longer an ethnicity . But still our country is called Bulgaria , I call myself Bulgarian but after what ? Some word that used to mean something 1000 years ago . Why do I not call myself Byzantine ? Or Turkish ? The Ottomans formed the longest lasting government that ruled these lands . I only care about my culture and traditions because they were inherited to me the same way another culture and traditions could have been inherited to me . \\n\\nSo I realised , nationality , religion , culture and traditions . All these things are random . They should **not** be the basis of my character . They should not define me , they should not define my inspirations about the future or my interpretation of history . I realised nationality is something , used in the past to drive the masses to do what the Kings and Dictators told them to . History was changed , culture and traditions adapted , so your kid would grow up and thoughtlessly drive himself towards the trench of the enemy for this made up symbolism and made up norms . \\n\\nHow silly it is , that we divide ourselves into nation-states because 300-800-1300 years ago someone thrust a sword in the ground and said that ethnicity and culture and traditions would not grow from now on at this particular place . \\n\\nWhen it comes to having a government , I dont care if its made up by only Bulgarians . What I care is that it has the same basic principles as I do , which are equality , human and civil rights and that everybody has the liberty to pursue happiness .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,In my opinion if you consider them European you can consider Turkey European as well . \\n\\nAt the end of the day nobody knows where Europe is and to me the best answer is that there is no European continent but it is part of Eurasia .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

I wrote that post to portray that and I chose the Brexiters winning because that is how the thread was leaning . \\n\\n & gt ; These demands are a joke . 10 times better for UK to leave than to make the EU even more insignificant . Cant make them want to be a part of Europe.\\n\\nThe demands were awful and if all were granted I would have rather had them leave . I think the deal Cameron secured was reasonable . \\n\\n & gt ; I actually prefer the UK to leave rather than have them riot over every minuscule law the EU forces upon them\\n\\nAgain this was fueled by the pro-Brexit threads and frustration .

The blues is basically homo sapiens who after leaving Africa settled in Mesopotamia before migrating to Europe . It is one of the oldest groups to inhabit Europe and it predates many other groups like the Slavs who came from Asia . It is most predominantly seen in South Eastern Europe with Croatia having the most . Many Bulgarians can trace their roots to that haplogroup ( most of any other group ) .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I was wondering how to phrase it so it wouldnt become part of the EU discussion but I didnt manage to . This is just what I think in general not only for the EU . We have some major issues in Bulgaria because of nationalism .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Yeah I basically have almost no knowledge on this so I am working solely on intuition and logic . My stance does have some holes in it .

Who cares what the country is called , by now it is just a relic of some name that used to mean something a thousand years ago . What matters to me is that we secure a good and equal future . I do not mind if they wrote the signs in Turkish in the Turk predominant regions . They have as much right to live in Bulgaria as we do and as human beings they have the right to be treated equally and fairly . If they become a major nationality then fuck it lets rename the country , but it is unreasonable to do it now when they are only around 12 % . Treating them as equal citizens does not mean we need to go to the other extreme and become half Turks or something.\\n I have never fought for a segregated nation-state not that you have fought for anything either . But if we go with \ '' we\ '' and \ '' them\ '' they fought for this land too and Ottoman Bulgaria is the longest governmental state that has existed in these lands .

The EU binds all nations together , borders wont matter much when everything flows steadily and freely through it . Where are the massacres of New Yorkers by Bostonians or the siege of Sacramento .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"That is incorrect . As I said in another comment less than 100 years ago German was as dominant in the USA as English .

They were dixie . \\n\\nPolitical union did not follow the cultural union . More like they both helped eachother grow . And for the EU there already is a political union . But I dont understand why there is a necessity to create a European culture and nationality . You will still be British I will be Bulgarian . We will just have a federal government .

In Bulgaria when someone tries to correct history everybody starts raging because \ '' something something preserve our culture\ '' . Culture is culture , there is no need to divide ourselves just because there are some differences . As I said before issues only arise when you let people from 3rd world countries live the way they lived in the Middle East because its \ '' their culture\ '' .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Where is the irony ? \\n\\n & gt ; You can\\'t just say \ '' they are nationalist and have problems , ergo , they have problems because they are nationalist.\ '' You have to demonstrate the association.\\n\\nI agree , I didnt explain that thier nationalism is why Putin has a 90 % approval rating while he is pushing the country into another cold war . \\n\\nNationalism doest develop . It unifies people against the outsiders . In the 19th and 20th century that was useful , but now , that we no longer hate each-other simply because we are from different nationalities , ( for the most part ) and that we live in peace it is no longer necessary because it is pushing us back into conflict . \\n\\nMulticulturalism is not bad . Its just that people assume that women belonging to men , for example is part of the Middle East\\ 's culture . Just because it is so predominant in their societies it does not mean it defines their ethnicity . We had sexism in Europe too and we removed it . And being part of their religions doesnt matter either , since Christianity also has some very sexist teachings but we have learned to not follow the teachings that dont suit modern society . Therefore Multiculturalism is not the issue , the issue is letting some people live in the dark ages because its \ '' their culture\ '' .Nationalism is not needed to fix this , just some common sense . \\n\\nSo why do you need Nationalism to protect you from a Scottish kilt or a Turkish kebab . One thing is making burkas illegal , another is making Lithuania\\ 's national dress illegal . \\n\\nIts always Europe because we expect better and also because we live here . I doubt you read East Asian newspapers and I very much doubt anybody from Asia cares or knows if Europeans are racist or not . I dont care about Asia , I do however care about Europe . And many Europeans are very racist . Poland and most if not all Eastern European nations hate the migrants simply because a majority of them are Muslim . Thats not really racism but it is harmful prejudice towards people because of their religion . And thats awful . I dont say they are wrong to dislike the migrants from say Afghanistan . But many do not hate them because they are uneducated or wont be able to cope with a modern society but because they are Muslims and they will \ '' ruin their culture\ '' . Or even as I have heard from many people it is because they are \ '' dirty animals who will come and rape our children\ '' . Now how is that an acceptable position . And how is Nationalism not building upon that type of thinking .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"What if there are some bad French morals and some aspects of your heritage is flawed ? Will you without a question pass that to your children ? Is it not better to pick the best morals from the whole world instead of blindly just picking the ones you were born into ? It is easy also to hold that argument as you are French , but many people will argue that women wearing burkas is part of many country\\ 's morals and heritage . Should women continue being oppressed in those countries just because it is part of their \ '' culture\ '' ? And at the end of the day I cant comprehend how you can love a whole country and nation because you were born into it . As a Bulgarian I want the best for Bulgaria and I feel like its my responsibility to be working into achieving a brighter future . That doesn\\'t mean that I will force myself to love Bulgaria and every aspect of its culture . Its because I am an individual and my opinions and character are not controlled by where I was born . I am who I am because I independently chose who I want to be . I question everything I know in order to be non-biased and try to be as reasonable and logical as I can in my opinions . \\n\\nI dont think you have made a concious effort to integrate into your culture . You are born into it . Just like religion . Yes there are some people who do make a concious choice but a vast majority just accept what they are born into . Hence why you dont see any French people proud of German culture . And hence why you are proud of French culture and not Italian . Because you were born into it . Had you been born in Italy or Germany you would be saying the same things but about Germany . And just because you were raised and taught to think in a different way because you were raised French doesnt make your argument better . Because then your opinion is not based on logic or reason but on who taught you what , a.k.a . you did not make this opinion as an individual but as a product of an upbringing . And if you think that way then there is no reason to blame ISIS who are beheading people because they were raised this way . The same way they refuse to accept that beheading are immoral you have made decisions because of your upbringing that were immoral , of course not to that extent but still . \\n\\nSo isnt it better to think as an individual , unbiased in creating your opinions , instead of basing your character your personality and your opinions on where and how you were raised which at the end of the day is decided by a big spin of the random wheel .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Lets start with what Nationalism is . \\n\\n & gt ; Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together . \\n\\nNationalism was a well known concept before the form we are familiar with became quite popular with countries in the 19th century . Just because the \ '' nation-state\ '' in today\\ 's status did not exist back then , it doesnt mean it didnt exist . \\n\\n & gt ; The story of history is largely one group of people oppressing a weaker group of people.\\n\\nWhat were those groups made up from ? It was Jews versus Egyptians , Mongols vs Tatars , Romans vs Etruscans . Those group were made up on the basis of nationalism . Exceptions would be the Teutonic order for example , which were not a common thing . \\n\\n & gt ; The main political and governing organization up until a couple hundred years ago was multiethnic empires.\\n\\nUhm , not really , not most of then at least . You could say Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic empire but then no Slavs were ever given power in it . For a long time the empire was just called the Austrian Empire until the resurgence of ( you guessed it ) Hungarian nationalism . But it was 1 group of people from one nationality , ruling over a conquered number of peoples . \\nOttoman empire was also similar , although they were more split between religions , rather than ethnicity , but lets not kid ourselves , back then 99.9 % of an ethnicity would have the same religion so you could say that the separation of the ruling elite and commoners ( and christians as a second class citizen ) was ethnic . Small exception for the Janissaries who were conscripted from Christian societies , converted to Islam to serve the empire.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; A big reason why history has been a continual violent struggle of groups . \\n\\nGroups largely based on nationality/ethnicity , yep . Reasonably then you can make the point that if people didnt feel some sort of symbolical belonging to one group because they were born and raised in roughly the same geographical location as you there wouldnt be as many wars . **But** and this is a big but , there are many many many other reasons that war occured through history , we are talking a plethora of complicated reasons based on human nature , government types , technological levels , nationalism , etc , etc . \\n\\n & gt ; Youre comment is probably the most historically ignorant comment I\\ 've ever seen \\n\\nOh the irony . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that nations generally had self determination throughout history is ludicrous and false . \\n\\nNow this is somewhat complicated . Without efficient forms of communication , even nationalities were split up . The people that led them ( kings , emperors , etc . ) were able to then seek their own desires without caring about what the people wanted . ( Nobody knew what \ '' the people\ '' wanted , not even them ) . In the 19th century , though , when Nationalism resurged , it was much easier to develop a sort of national unity and a common goal , which in most cases was to achieve a state with a singular nationality in it being the ruling elite and lower classes . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that any significant portion of wars happened because \ '' I don\\'t like those other people\ '' is so sophomoric.\\n\\nOF course , there were many other reasons , but most of them arising from governmental and administrative regions developing from ethnic boundaries . The 100 years war wasnt started just because they hated each other . But the lower classes had no other ambition to kill the other rather than because of hate towards the other ethnic group . If a French person found themselves in an English hamlet , would he survive the night ? \\n\\n & gt ; The Austrian Hungarian empire didn\\'t start a war because they didn\\'t like Slavs . What was the spark of that war ? A member of a oppressed nation and group that lacked self determination killed the leader of the nation that was oppressing them.\\n\\nUhm yes they did . You just proved *my* point . Due to the nationalism of the Black Hand and Gavrilo Princip the spark was lit and resulted in a war , that was caused by frictions created from nationalism . If there was no Nationalism back then , the Austria-Hungarian empire would not be oppressing Slavs just because they are different ethnicity from them , the Black Hand woudnt be formed out of nationalistic necessities in the form of uniting all south Slavs , Russia wouldnt have attacked Austria-Hungary because they needed to protect their Slavic brothers , etc . The cause of the war was Nationalistic frictions in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . \\n\\nBut I am not disagreeing that Nationalism was a useful tool in the past . It was . Its just that I believe that it is not necessary anymore in the modern world and in some regions it is even being harmful . Whether or not nationalism was a thingof the past is unrelated to my main post and I dont know why I let you distract me from it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Yes UK made goods will gain ground in the market , but how much ? 10,20 maybe 30 % ?

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"& gt ; Yes there is - there is even a lot of talks about Scotland remaining in the UK should they declare independence before Brexit\\n\\nIm guessing you meant remaining in the EU not the UK . But the situation is different here . In their referendum they were also told that they would not be allowed back into the EU immediately . Especially with the UK\\ 's veto . It was made clear that independence meant that all relations with the EU would need to be made from scratch because you cant deal with the new sovereign state with the agreements you have made with another one . Even in this case , though , Scotland wont be allowed to just re-enter the EU immediately after a Scottish Independence . It is just impossible . As I said you cant have the agreements and deals made with the UK to be binding for another country which Scotland would then be . \\n\\n & gt ; That is irrelevant - people want independence despite the fact that it may not create a better future . I surely remember what the early 90s were like in Estonia . \\n\\nHow is it irrelevant ? I think its the most important part . Only if the UK were educated enough on what they were voting they would have remained instead of voting for Brexit in order to stop Muslim immigration . Ah but did leaving the Soviets bring a better future ? Now Estonia is ways ahead of Russia . And you did have examples of how capitalism was better than socialism so you could definitely make a rational argument for leaving then . \\n\\n & gt ; If they want to , then why should there be a problem . If they don\\'t want to , then it\\ 's not our business to stop them.\\n\\nBut nobody is stopping them ! ( except maybe Spain ) There is a process that every country that wants to become a member needs to follow in order to gain membership . There are guidelines that need to be reached . Its the process that makes the EU possible that would slow Catalonia or any other nation from joining , not spite or bitterness . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is why not cooperating with their entry is why I consider it a childish reaction.\\n\\nThere would be cooperation , but how long would it take for them to land a deal ? How long will Spain be childish ? It is uncertain but only one thing is known , and it is that it wont be instantaneous\\n\\n & gt ; No - having come from a subjected nation - the problem was not only political repression , but the fact itself that it wasn\\'t \ '' our nation\ '' .\\n\\nWell that is your opinion . I personally , as long as my vote count towards the leadership and the local governance cant be bothered with the symbolism of calling that leader and governance ours . I dont see how that would make me sleep better . \\n\\n & gt ; Yet are outvoted in issues that matter to them internally . Reminds me of these Russians , who claim there should have been an all-empire/all-union referendum on whether or not Estonia should have become independendent or not.\\n\\nEvery village is outvoted as well as every person . Its the flaw of democracy , not everybody can be happy . As long as they have their local governance though , it is fair . \\n\\n & gt ; Have you considered Catalonia wants to be treated as an equal among European nations , not as a regional subject of Spain ? \\n\\nFor me its much more important to identify whether leaving or not would be better for them . What they vote is their business . I just think the question of \ '' should we\ '' needs to be raised in stead of silencing it with stuff like \ '' they have the right to be independent\ '' , everybody does , it does not mean its the right thing to do , though .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"The EU has stated that leaving Spain would mean they would leave the EU . Not to mention the high possibility of Spain being spiteful and vetoing their entry for a long time . 10 years , I think is a reasonable amount of time . The government has to be formed with the whole administration , new foreign relations with the EU , then the EU needs to make sure that Catalonia answers to all requirements for joining , etc . Its a long process . \\n \\n & gt ; To be an independent country , duh\\n\\nNot independent , different . They already are independent . Nobody is discriminating against them , nobody has enslaved them , they have all the rights , can vote in elections can be elected to represent the people . Its not more independence than the UK \ '' gaining independence\ '' from leaving the EU . Its populist crap.\\n\\n & gt ; Necessity & gt ; complexity\\n\\nWhat necessity ? \\n\\n & gt ; Plus , the same empty argument could be said about every change on the world map.\\n\\nNot really .

2ntle,europe,"The comment on the end of the article drives the right point home that was not covered by the author : \\n\\n & gt ; From my personal experience and studies ( currently writing my thesis in Balkan history ) , this almost makes it out that those Serbs in Vukovar are totally innocent bystanders in the war and the current issue surrounding Cyrillic script . Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997 , two years after the war officially ended . Whilst in Serb hands , the Latin Script was banned . Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas . These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places . These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes . Under international pressure , Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape , murder , torture , theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated . Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims . This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society , thus we have a culture of separation ( cafes , shops , schools etc ) . Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County . For example , at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there . So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not . There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,That joyful moment when you understand the meaning of words because you also speak a Slavic language.\\n,Balto-Slavic,Croatian
Azure_Dawn,europe,"Some parts from article . \\n\\n & gt ; This is more difficult to do than it sounds because the media\u2019s narrative about Le Pen\u2019s rise has been hysterical . The next two weeks will feature more of the same : articles decrying the potential end of Western civilization , the rise of fascism , and the potential unleashing of the horrors of Europe\u2019s past across the Continent once more . Many who never much cared about France will spontaneously generate opinions about how the West\u2019s hopes now rest on Macron\u2019s shoulders . If Le Pen wins , it will be the French Devolution . If she loses , complacency will set in , and Macron the empty suit will take up residence at the Palais de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e . He will continue status quo policies that in five years will bring us right back to where we started \u2013 or perhaps worse.\\n\\n & gt ; The key questions no one is asking are : Why did Le Pen oversee the expulsion of her father from the National Front , and why has she worked so hard to exorcise the party\u2019s most radical positions ? Stated differently , does Le Pen control her constituents , or do her constituents control her ? The answer to this question is important because it is the difference between the National Front being a reanimation of the worst of 20th century European history and a 21st century political party attempting to respond to economic , political and security challenges while still operating within the framework of liberal democratic norms . If the masses control Le Pen , we\u2019re back in the 20th century . If Le Pen controls the masses , we\u2019re still in our own century.\\n\\n & gt ; The second issue for these voters is immigration , and by extension , radical Islam . Three days before the election , on April 20 , a shooting happened on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that was claimed by the Islamic State . Paris and Nice suffered horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by radical Islamists in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . Le Pen\u2019s platform addresses this in two ways . First , she wants to strengthen the rule of law . She plans to do this by hiring more police , building more jails , and shutting down mosques with ties to radical Islam . Second , she wants to crack down on illegal immigration . This means curbing asylum requests and introducing more stringent naturalization requirements . Le Pen also plans to limit legal migration to 10,000 people per year . One may disagree with Le Pen\u2019s approach , but not with the fact that a problem exists and previous French governments have failed to address it.\\n\\n & gt ; Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man says , \u201cMen are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d Article 3 says , \u201cThe principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation.\u201d This is a contradiction . Article 1 is universalist ; it does not say \u201cFrench men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d It says all individuals enjoy these unalienable rights . But on the same page , Article 3 becomes pragmatic , attempting to ensure these rights are protected . Without enforcement , rights are abstractions . The individual may have rights , but we do not live in a world of individuals . We live in a world of political communities . The French nation is Le Pen\u2019s political community , and her policy is to defend it . For her detractors , Le Pen\u2019s great crime is that she does not consider it France\u2019s responsibility to ensure the unalienable rights of all men . For her supporters , she is the defender of the unalienable rights of French men , and to ask France to do more is to ask the impossible.\\n\\n & gt ; There is a dark side to France , as there is a dark side to all countries . But Le Pen is not a slave of the masses . She is a political pragmatist who is holding back something far worse , and she knows what the \u201csomething far worse\u201d is because she tried to exorcise it from her own party last year . This election is important because of what it indicates about the future of Europe . That future hangs on the nation-state\u2019s ability to respond to the concerns of individuals .

Azure_Dawn,europe,So you are fundamentally going back to something that could be a mix of Neo-Ottomanism plus Islamism ? \\n\\n\\n\\n,Balto-Slavic,Croatian
Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; First , there is the growing number of economically underperforming Muslim youths in Europe . This is traditionally a pool from which extremist groups recruit , and Hegghammer writes that this population looks set to continue to grow dramatically thanks to immigration and higher birth rates . Entrenched economic disadvantages will likely stop many young Muslims from gaining the full benefits of modern European societies.\\n\\n & gt ; The second , more important trend is the growing number of \u201cjihadi entrepreneurs\u201d \u2014 returned foreign fighters and other activists \u2014 who could inspire and recruit a new generation of European extremists . Hegghammer conservatively estimates there are now at least 2,000 radical Islamists in Europe with foreign fighter experience , time in prison , or both . While some may turn away from jihadism in the future , a small proportion will not.\\n\\n & gt ; The third and fourth factors relate not just to Europe , but to the broader world . Hegghammer suggests that persistent conflicts in the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia look \u201cset to supply European jihadis with both rallying causes and training opportunities for the foreseeable future , as it has in the past.\u201d Many experts believe that the conflict in Syria may still have a long way to go and that groups like the Islamic State will be very hard to fully defeat . The group could be training and blooding potential European attackers for years to come.\\n\\n & gt ; Compounding this problem is the final factor : the Internet . The Internet has considerable benefits for extremist groups , Hegghammer suggests , serving as a tool for \u201cpropaganda distribution , recruitment , fundraising , reconnaissance , and operational coordination.\u201d The rise of encrypted communications and social media have made it harder for authorities to keep up .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; Poland\u2019s history can easily be summed up as a continuous struggle against invasions and divisions . The country\u2019s geopolitical significance stems from its location between Russia and Germany . We have written about the challenges that both Russia and Germany will face in 2017 ; these challenges also pose unique problems for Poland , which is economically and militarily vulnerable . Recent developments have also helped Poland lay the groundwork for its eventual emergence as a regional power , as stated in our 2040 forecast.\\n\\n & gt ; Considering Poland\u2019s relatively small economy , which gives it more room to maneuver , the decline in German exports could become an opportunity for Poland to maintain and increase its export competitiveness . Technology transfers have accompanied Western investment in the country , and with continued support for national research and innovation and its relatively well educated and cheap workforce , Poland could remain competitive on the global market . One major challenge Poland faces in the medium to long term is its demographic situation , which limits its potential because the country has the second fastest aging population in Europe . But the success of socio-economic policies that drive competitiveness is dependent on political stability.\\n\\n & gt ; With Western Europe disinclined to prioritize any potential Russian threats , Poland is slowly acting as a small regional leader by working with countries to establish and support common initiatives such as defense against Russia . Within the EU , Poland will continue to be the leading voice of Eastern Europe , distancing itself from the EU\u2019s Western European members . Warsaw has been the main challenger of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project proposed by Russia , effectively blocking it when the country\u2019s anti-monopoly agency stopped the formation of the project\u2019s consortium . Seeing that Belarus wanted to improve relations with the EU to access European markets , and considering Belarus\u2019 dependence on Russia\u2019s slowing economy , Warsaw has worked to improve ties with Minsk . Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in October and said a new chapter in Polish-Belarusian relations had been opened . The two countries have economic incentives to develop closer ties , and Poland will likely take advantage.\\n\\n & gt ; Trapped between Russia and Germany , Poland is aware of Russia\u2019s increasing assertiveness and NATO\u2019s challenges , including its members\u2019 differing security interests . In the short term , Poland will likely feel the impact of Germany\u2019s economic slowdown . Adaptation to the new reality of a declining Western Europe will not be easy or fast . The current administration will continue to seek the right balance between extending control over the economy and political institutions , and making sure its public approval ratings remain high . Considering the country\u2019s defense imperatives , Warsaw will keep building strong ties with the U.S. and develop its regional leadership posture by working with Eastern Europeans on different levels.\\n\\n & gt ; Poland usually only makes mainstream news in the West when it has conflict with the EU over specific policies or when massive government protests erupt . The much more subtle and important thing to be aware of is how Poland is beginning to behave like a small regional leader . Warsaw will see increased tensions with Western Europe , and Germany in particular , partly due to economic problems , but mostly because of diverging views on security priorities . Increased Russian assertiveness will force Poland to invest in and make the most of regional alliances .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Ballander,europe,"Whew , you threw together a lot of bull.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadzic worked together and at the same time on standardization of grammar and alphabet for Croatian/Serbian languages waaaaaay before Yugoslavia . In mid XIX century . Why do you think both languages have 30 letters , same grammar and why Croatian Latin and Serbian Latin scripts are identical and why both are phonetic languages etc ? \\n\\nThis I already addressed in my original post and clarified it in my second . I think I was pretty clear.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Also Croatian language had two-three purges , especially around WWI and WWI and recently in the \\'90s.\\n\\nCroatian had a few \ '' purges\ '' , but not like you think . They were never about targetting \ '' Serbisms\ '' ( are there really any ? ) , but loanwords in general . It\\ 's a lot like French puritanism . I\\ 'll give you the WWII one , their agenda was pretty obvious and I would not put past them that their goal was to \ '' remove Serb\ '' in every sense . However , WWI was a load of crap , since it never happened . Indeed , there was a lot of new words introduced in that period ( say 1850s-1910s ) , but it was , again , just to remove loanwords from Standard in general , primarily **Hungarian** and **German** since there were loads of them . No one had Serbia in mind , but some had Yugoslavia - which goes back to political tampering with languages due to agenda . Some words caught on , some didn\\'t ( as always ) .\\n90\\ 's was about reintroducing the words that fell out of use due to Yugoslavia ( people had to adhere to the Standard set by Novosadski dogovor which was mentioned here already , and abberations were definitely not tolerated , hence I called it forced instead of voluntarily ) . Some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in a sense two languages were more similar before WWII.\\n\\nYes , and after . WWII-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical Croatian language.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; For example did you ever heard of Miroslav Krleza ? \\n\\nOf course.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The greatest Croatian writer who ever lived ? \\n\\nWhile he is no doubt a great writer , that\\ 's debatable . There\\ 's a slew of great Croatian writers and I\\ 'm glad I can\\'t pick one so easily . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe sounds familiar ? \\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Heard about his book \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' from 1932 ? Yeah \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' , not \\'\\'Tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt\\'\\'\\n\\nWhat\\ 's the point ? You\\ 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . That\\ 's massive reaching and does you a disservice.\\nYou also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards Yugoslavian unity . \\nI doubt you ever read any of his works , but I did and there\\ 's nothing too different from today\\ 's Croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . \\n\\nJust check his \ '' Balade Petrice Kerempuha\ '' and see if you still want to claim Croatian and Serbian are the same.\\n\\nBut since you were so eager to bring Krle\u017ea up , I have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ \ '' Declaration about the name and position of Croatian literaly language\ '' ] ( https : //hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo % C5 % BEaju_hrvatskog_knji % C5 % BEevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ Novosadski sporazum ] ( https : //sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosadski_dogovor ) . So , he would very much disagree with you.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' hiljadu\ '' would be considered \ '' Serbism\ '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in Croatia\\n\\nNo , you wouldn\\'t . I\\ 've known people who freely used \ '' hiljadu\ '' when talking to teachers of Croatian language.\\nBesides , \ '' hiljadu\ '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from Greek language ) , not a \ '' Serbism\ '' . Really , are there any Serbisms ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by Croatian linguists , just to be as different from Serbian as possible.\\n\\nAgain incorrect . A lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . Google Bogoslav \u0160ulek , Adolfo Veber Tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Learn yer history bruh.\\n\\n\ '' Bruh\ '' , I know my history just fine . I don\\'t want to comment on your knowledge of Serbian ( I don\\'t really care ) , but your knowledge about Croatian history is frankly atrocious and it\\ 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a Croatian.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; We use both \ '' hleb\ '' and \ '' kruh\ '' , both \ '' vazduh\ '' and \ '' zrak\ '' , both \ '' sargarepa\ '' and \ '' mrkva\ '' etc . Bosnian and Serbian went for language richness , while Croatian went for language purity.\\n\\nVazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in Croatia . Not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into Standard . On the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in conclusion , no , Yugoslavia didn\\'t forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . \\n\\nIt\\ 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , I feel , based on your wishes . The idea of Yugoslavia **and** Yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . There\\ 's no denying it .

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; Well , I replied to a comment in regards to why Bosnia and Croatia are two different countries while Slavonia and Dalmacia aren\\'t.\\n\\nBecause of historical reasons . When you look at the maps of former empires , you\\ 'll notice that borders between Bosnia and Croatia were almost the same , they were borders of Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\\n\\n & gt ; So why religion ? Well , let\\ 's be honest.. A lot of seemingly insane views of other people have been caused by religion . So I guess I\\ 'm just trying to figure out if that\\ 's where it comes from down there . I mean , religion caused the killings of \ '' witches\ '' , gays , women ( doing anything wrong . ) , other religious groups etc . so \\n\\nReligion is not the point here . While religion had some part in formation of some nations ( primarily Serbs and Bosniaks/Muslims , to some extent Croatians ) , the problems were more of cultural/national/historical rather than religious . \\nCroatians were never very exclusive religion-wise , as you also had protestant , orthodox , etc . Croats . Heck , one of the orthodox was a famous writer during the national spring.\\n\\nFurthermore , even Croatian nazis considered Muslims to be Croats and they didn\\'t persecute them per se . For example , they turned one of the galleries in Zagreb in a [ mosque ] ( http : //media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/11-zagreb2-450.jpg ) . Those nazis also organised Croatian Orthodox Church.\\n\\nLooking at the religion as a source of all problems is a lazy and ignorant view , but the simplest of them - which is why so many people are prone to it.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I suppose it might explain some of the tensions down there if everyone was like 110 % serious about their religions and believed every word of their holy books.. \\n\\nWhat year is it ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; To me it simply doesn\\'t make sense to think that someone living 10 miles away ( Across a border ) is so different\\n\\nI left out the second part because it\\ 's a stereotypical nonsense.\\n\\nThe thing is because of cultural influence . Bosnia and Herzovina/Serbia were dominated by Ottomans and it shows , whereas the Croatians coast was always under the Italian influence . Northern Croatia ( Northwest particulary ) was under heavy Austrian influence . So , this is from where a lot of cultural ( and linguistical if you\\ 'd be looking into the dialects ) differences emerge.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest , a northern Croatian is more likely to get beat in southern Croatia than a Serbian or some other nationality . Just a few days ago there were some news of players getting beaten . So , all these rambles about Serbians/whateverelses fearing for their lives because they\\ 're so special is nonsense , since Croatians may get the very same treatment . Why ? Because assholes . You got plently of them as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why do Croatians care if someone\\ 's wearing a Serbian tourist t-shirt in Croatia for example ? \\n\\nThey rather don\\'t , they got other things on their mind to worry about rather than who\\ 's wearing what.\\n\\n & gt ; We don\\'t beat up people wearing German , English , Swedish or whatever football jerseys here for example..\\n\\nWe don\\'t do it either , other than hooligans , but they are more of an international problem ( see Dutch hooligans destroying Italian works of art , etc . ) and it\\ 's no worse than in other European countries .

I simply can not fathom how anyone can see a Serbian ( Which it wasn\\'t , but let\\ 's pretend it was.. ) shirt as something provocative in any way . \\n\\nSplit is a bit rough around the edges , and like I said , you can be a Croatian from Zagreb in order to get a beating there , if you run into hooligans . \\nWhy can they perceive it as provocative ? Because they were probably drunk/drugged , which lowers their ability of rational thinking even lower.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Hooligans in the football sense ? No , they exist . But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don\\'t tend to see in most other countries . Of course there are football rivalries here and sometimes a bunch of F.C . Copenhagen fans will get into a fight with Br\u00f8ndby IF fans or whatever . \\nLook up videos of Danish fans from Poland-Ukraine Euro etc . if you want to see what our fans are usually like . They\\ 're drinking , singing , partying and making a fool of themselves . There\\ 's a reason they\\ 're called \\'Roligans\\ ' and not hooligans . \\'Rolig\\ ' means calm in Danish . Not calm in the \ '' We\\ 're quiet\ '' sense , but in the peaceful sense . \\n\\n\ '' My part of the world\ '' ... You\\ 're free to try any extremist thing you think you can get away with in Croatia , I assure you you won\\'t have a nice time.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; they\\ 'll get banned from the stadiums , fined , potentially jailed and \ '' everyone\ '' will distance themselves from it . The club , the fanclub , the \ '' FA\ '' etc . It\\ 's not an accepted thing at all . Even if both sides essentially agree to fight.\\n\\nYou think it\\ 's accepted in Croatia ? Wow , I wonder what kool-aid they feed you with in Denmark.\\nReading between the lines , your perception of Croatia was as it\\ 's a religous , wildwest-like warzone . Wtf ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don\\'t tend to see in most other countries.\\n\\nWe don\\'t ? \\nWhat about the Dutch trashing Italian works of art ? \\nBooks have been written about the UK.\\nThis is just generalizing and sweeping your problems under the rug . The grass is not greener than in Croatia.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's not just the picture though . It\\ 's news , it\\ 's travel warnings , horrific pictures of someone of one nationality who\\ 's been beatedn ( or worse ) by people of another nationality , it\\ 's traveler stories , it\\ 's comment sections on various sites \\n\\nI don\\'t know where you\\ 're getting all this stuff from . Especially since most of it can be forged/faked ( you\\ 'd be surprised how often I can come across mental gymnastics ) .\\nTourists who come here usually thoroughly enjoy it and crime rates are rather low , Croatia is a very safe country.\\nLay off the youtube and site comments , in general . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Well yeah , but that\\ 's not where I saw it.\\nhttp : //www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/croatian-girl-kisses-serb_n_2839945.html\\n\\nLol , wow , I must admit I thought a tiny bit higher of Huffington Post , but this is just tabloid material at absolute worst . They base their story around a picture and reddit user , without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources . It\\ 's basically like you saw it on reddit.\\n\\n\\nThis is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they\\ 're going to only go by the words of reddit users . \\nIn this case , nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners.\\n\\n\\nI find english articles about Croatia generally of poor quality , and often scarce and misleading.\\n\\nFor example , when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban , which was fairly covered , a lot of these sites were saying that 65 % of Croatians voted for banning of gay marriage.\\n\\nHowever , 65 % of those who went to vote voted for banning , and only 38 % of voter base went voting . But of course this gets no mention.\\nThis can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65 % of Croatians are against gays/gay marriages , while in reality the referendum wouldn\\'t even pass if it weren\\'t for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the EU referendum.\\n\\nI also remember reading an Economist article on Croatian elections , where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates ( which were used by common people in Croatia ) , which is just a huge low for a media.\\n\\nAlso , a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts.\\n\\nCroatia doesn\\'t get reported on often , and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it , I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; No , I may have some media created assumptions , but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there ? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region ? \\n\\nDrop the \\'region\\ ' and replace with \\'Croatia\\ ' and I\\ 'll agree , but otherwise no . I always hated this collectivism regarding ex-Yugoslavia , since it simply can not be under the same denominator . There\\ 's a reason it didn\\'t work , the differences are there . Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ? Unfortunately , it happens too many times.\\n\\n\\nSomething you may not be aware of , and that contributed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor . Slovenia and Croatia had to give substantial money to the underdeveloped parts of Yugoslavia ( the rest of it ) during the times of both Yugoslavias and this is what annoyed most people.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; While I find the crazies.. Well , crazy.. It doesn\\'t mean understanding where they\\ 're coming from can\\'t be interesting.\\n\\n\\nThey can be coming from their personal problems and frustrations.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Even if it\\ 's in Bosnia it doesn\\'t really change anything though\\n\\nIt does , since I don\\'t want to deal with stereotypes about Bosnia . The ones about Croatia are enough for me , thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Baz1ng4,europe,"Well , grammatical gender is not the same as the \ '' real\ '' one ( social construct ) , neither should it be equated with sex . \\n\\nNouns that end with -chen or -lein are neuter nouns . **It\\ 's endings that usually determine grammatical gender of nouns , not their referent . ** M\u00e4dchen is a diminutive word form from Magd ( which is of same origin as English maiden ) , and that word is in feminine . \\n\\nIn Croatian there are also nouns that are masculine ( or even neuter ) , but they refer to a female person ( because of the endings/suffixes ) . A child is usually neuter - even thought there is also a masculine noun - although it obviously has sex.\\n\\nFunny thing , in Croatian a \ '' dead man\ '' is grammatically alive .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Baz1ng4,europe,"Well , to me it sounds as [ \u028b ] as I am \ '' born\ '' with that sound . : D Or it sounds like a weakly ( mis ) pronounced [ v ] . \\n\\nI meant , if you have to explain someone how to pronounce [ \u028b ] , wouldn\\'t you say it\\ 's similar to [ v ] , but only tongue is little bit lower , and there is less force in pronouncing it , or would you say , pronounce it like [ w ] , but with no velarization , lips shouldn\\'t be rounded ... \\n\\nThese are pronounced by same person , I would say that [ w ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File : Voiced_labio-velar_approximant.ogg ) is way off . \\n\\n [ \u028b ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File : Labiodental_approximant.ogg ) is much closer to [ v ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File : Voiced_labiodental_fricative.ogg ) . \\n\\nBut this difference in perception ( of you and me ) could be explain with different language .
