ADizzy7,europe,"Your points on the refugee convention are interesting and I thank you for that info . I would like to point out that throughout my comments I have not suggested that Australia simply opens its borders . I believe we do need to have a tough immigration policy because , yes , people do die at sea trying to come to Australia , and also , lets be honest , if we did let everyone in , many many many people would come because Australia is amazing ( most of the time ) . \\n\\nHowever , I think we can agree that the current conditions refugees are kept in are unacceptable , and the political language and policy used against refugees by BOTH major Australian parties is deplorable . For example , they are not referred to as \ '' asylum seekers\ '' or \ '' refugees\ '' , but as \ '' illegal maritime arrivals\ '' ... . My opinion is , we can do better . We can deter refugees while still allowing open and honest journalism , without major human rights organisations accusing the govt . of torture , without keeping children locked up and witness to and victims of abuse . \\n\\nThis situation goes back a long way , I don\\'t know if you know about the Children Overboard scandal , where the government lied and said refugees threw their own children into the ocean so that they would be rescued by the navy , and then used that lie to their own political gain.\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Overboard_affair\\nSo you\\ 'll have to excuse me if I don\\'t trust our government to treat these people with decency.\\n\\nThis is a very nuanced situation , and one that 100 % needs changing . \\nI\\ 've said it already , but its not black and white . It\\ 's not no refugees or all refugees , there is a middle ground that needs to be sought.\\n\\nI think at this point we will probably just keep going in circles , we obviously disagree , which is fine . Thanks for the interesting debate .",Germanic,English
ADizzy7,europe,"But you\\ 've still failed to provide a reason as to what benefit they would have from reporting torture . Not a hypothetical situation , any sources ? Anyone else suggesting the UN is telling lies ? I\\ 've given you a link in which the Prime Minister ( whose policy this is ) has even admitted to bad conditions . Now he hasn\\'t called it torture for obvious reasons , but if you can look at reports from the UN , Amnesty International etc and think \ '' oh it\\ 's just all politics\ '' then I don\\'t know what else to say .",Germanic,English
ADizzy7,europe,"Again , the report of torture comes from\\nthe UN . Not some Australian guy with family in Afghanistan who he wants to come and join him . THE UNITED NATIONS .",Germanic,English
ADizzy7,europe,"At what point did I say we should let the refugees who \ '' skip the queue\ '' in ? I didn\\'t . I simply said the way they are treated now is insane . Priority should be given to refugees in camps , and those who come by legal means ( but that\\ 's not to say those coming by boat may not be legitimate refugees ) . \\n\\nThe world is not black and white . It\\ 's not either- let them all in OR lock them up indefinitely . There is a middle ground , and that\\ 's where Australia\\ 's policy needs some serious changes . \\n\\nEDIT- I should also point out that out current system costs SO much money . More money is spent on asylum seekers held in offshore detention than it would cost to house them in Australia . Here are some articles : \\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-09/dunlop-accepting-refugees-makes-the-most-economic-sense/6761770\\n\\n ( an older article but interesting all the same ) http : //oppenheimer.mcgill.ca/A-Price-Too-High-the-cost-of ? lang=fr\\n\\nhttp : //www.amnesty.org.au/resources/activist/Handling_Objections_About_Asylum_Seekers.pdf\\n\\n^^^ this article in particular is a good read . \\n & gt ; But isn\u2019t offshore processing cost effective ? \\nThe Commission of Audit found that it costs more than $ 430,000 to detain an asylum seeker in offshore detention for a year ( or about $ 1200 per day ) . It is estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 a year to hold an asylum seeker in community detention and less than $ 50,000 to host them on a bridging visa . This means **offshore detention is more than eight times more expensive than onshore alterEnglishs** , and asylum seeker policy costs , including offshore detention , are forecast to exceed $ 10bn over the course of the current government.\\n\\n",Germanic,English
ADizzy7,europe,"Again , my qualm with the policy is not that it doesn\\'t \ '' work\ '' ( debatable considering the cost etc ) but I suppose it comes down to whether or not you think breaking the UN convention on human rights is okay because it \ '' works\ '' . \\n\\nEdit to include a source : \\nhttp : //hrlc.org.au/un-finds-australias-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-violates-the-convention-against-torture/",Germanic,English

As i always say when this page is linked , I do not condone the actions of the British in India , however in your own linked article it goes on further to discuss ALL causes of the famine , not just it was the British\\ ' fault , but the inability of the national Indian government to implement coherent policy . \\n\\nFrom the Wiki Page : \\n\\n\ '' Whatever the cause of the famine , deaths could only be prevented by supplies of food from elsewhere in India . This was not forthcoming\ '' \\n\\n\ '' In 1942 , with the permission of the central government , trade barriers were introduced by the democratically elected Provincial governments . The politicians and civil servants of surplus provinces like the Punjab introduced regulations to prevent grain leaving their provinces for the famine areas of Bengal , Madras and Cochin . There was the desire to see that , first , local populations and , second , the populations of neighbouring provinces were well fed , partly to prevent civil unrest.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' even when the Government of India decreed that there should be free trade in grain , politicians , civil servants , local government officers and police obstructed the movement of grain to famine areas\ '' \\n\\n\ '' Eventually there was a clear threat by the Government of India to force the elected governments to provide grain , when the new Viceroy , Archibald Wavell , who was a successful general , was about to take office . For the first time substantial quantities of grain started to move to Bengal\ '' \\n\\nEven if the British were able to assist : \\n\\n\ '' Any imports would have had to come from Australia , North America or South America . Some supplies from Australia entered the region . The main constraint was shipping . The Battle of the Atlantic was at its peak from mid-1942 to mid-1943 , with submarine wolf packs sinking so many ships that the Allies were on the verge of defeat , so shipping could not be spared for India\ '' \\n\\nIt is worth remembering that at this time , Britain was at war with the Nazi\\ 's , their presence in Asia had been greatly reduced and India was largely in control of its affairs . As i said previously , some British policies helped contribute to the Famine , but it was not the only cause and people need to recognise this when they continue to link to this wiki page . \\n\\nAs i said , I am not condoning British actions , I just wish that when we discuss issues and provide evidence to back our claims , that we discuss all factors in the conversation .",Germanic,English

Ax_Dk,europe,"The Famine of 1943 can not just be summed up in one nice little paragraph that says \ '' Britain Bad , India Suffer\ '' . \\n\\nThere are so many reasons for this famine not just that Churchill diverted grain for troops . You also need to look at this from a whole of India situation . \\n\\nCertain areas of India were not producing enough food to feed their populations and were reliant on imports of grains and rice from Burma ( also a british territory ) . \\n\\nWhen Burma fell to the Japanese , this import source was gone . \\n\\nIndian states had a large degree of self governance at this stage and rather than ensure that food was made available to Bengal etc by sending food from states with surplus as they had done in previous decades , they decided to implement price controls etc to try and solve the issue - something that had not previously been tried in India . These price controls meant that states that had surplus food were not willing to send this food to these provinces as farmers would make losses and profits may be released outside of their states . \\n\\nThe failure is the inability to get Indian States to work together for the good of the larger nation , rather than the recently democratic states within India - politicians in these states now felt the need to show that they were standing up for locals first . \\n\\nSo really , if this article was looking to tell a complete story it should expand these subsections . \\n\\nThe British had largely handed power over to the Indian Government and didn\\'t have their hands on their day to day \ '' levers\ '' of running India . \\n\\nI am not saying that this is not the responsibility of the British to fix , but I am sick and tired of the Bengal Famine being bought up as a prime example of how the British Empire failed and as such - should be considered 100 % horrible . Authors always actively ignore the circumstances and go with the revisionist narrative and ignore the fact that India had achieved a level of self governance at this stage sufficient to handle this issue themselves . \\n\\nIf this had happened in 1843 then it would have been 100 % Britain\\ 's mistake .

Or someone that crosses into Turkey and decides that Turkey is not good enough , so they start walking , and when they get to a closed border , decide to start a protest , or to rip the place apart , or to burn camps/facilities to show that they are angry . if you are scared for your life then you should be happy to be sitting on an island in Greece , or on the Macedonian border . \\n\\nOn the point of refugees from Iran and Afghanistan , most legitimate refugees ( from what I have read ) are either from persecuted ethnic groups , or homosexuals/ something else that is unacceptable in their own country .",Germanic,English

He was a more liberal king and agreed that Denmark should have a more liberal constitution similar to Norways and so ended the absolute power of the king of Denmark . \\n\\nNow this constitution is a great thing , but also helped break Denmark up further . Danes believed that the extra rights that the Constitution of 1849 should apply to all Danes ( Denmark Proper , Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg ) . Schlesvig Holstein and Lauenberg were in personal union with the Danish king , so not part of Denmark proper , but had large Danish populations , majorities in some areas , minorities in others . Based on the fact that Schlesvig was perceived to be majority Danish , the constitution intergrated Schlesvig into Denmark proper\\n\\nThe majority germans in Holstein and Lauenberg believed that schlesvig should be in union with them and so fought against the Danish king . Denmark won the first Schlesvig war in 1851 , but lost the second in 1864 , resulting in the loss of Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg , as well as the region of southern Denmark ( S\u00f8nderjylland , Synnejylland ) .\\n\\nSo the constitution was good , but indirectly led to the loss of 1/3 of Danish territory and 56 years in exile for my ancestors , who only returned to Denmark in 1920.\\n\\n",Germanic,English

When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders , Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in R\u00f8nne and Nex\u00f8 and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7\u20138 May 1945 .",Germanic,English

Dragon029,europe,"To give a short version , it means : \\n\\n1 . That the jets can talk to each other properly , give each other information . You don\\'t want to be using AOL messenger if everyone is now using Facebook messenger.\\n\\n2 . So that commanders don\\'t have to ask different nations \ '' Hey Slovenia , can you plane over there laser designate ( mark with a laser ) these targets for me ? \ '' If nations are using the same aircraft , with the same tools , they already know that you can mark those targets . This also extends to things like electronic warfare , radar mapping , carrying certain types of bombs , the range that aircraft can fly , etc.\\n\\n3 . If ( eg ) a British jet has an uncommon part break while at an airfield in Iraq , the British commander can talk to an American or Norwegian or Australian commander and request a spare part from their inventory , allowing them to fix a plane in hours instead of days , while the governments work out a transfer of funds later.\\n\\n",Germanic,English

[ And then some . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt ) \\n\\nTax money goes straight back to the people in a way that is ( ideally ) economically , socially and environmentally productive . Hoarded private wealth would *rarely* be invested in a way that was much better at this , btw.\\n\\nHoarded wealth ( if it\\ 's not spent on building pointless monuments and luxuries ) will mostly go into investments designed to get the best return/risk profile . You can absolutely guarantee that it will *not* be invested in the most efficient way from a social , environmental , sustainable , or long-term point-of-view.\\n\\nThis ROI maximisation is not the same as overall value maximisation . It\\ 's therefore distortive , and thank god we\\ 've got a second mechanism - government - which counters some of this distortion.\\n\\nBut of course - this cuts both ways .

JayKayAu,europe,"I just want to point something out that our American friends sometimes forget : *Absolute* freedom of speech is *not actually a good thing* . \\n\\nFreedom of speech is *generally* , most of the time , under normal circumstances , a wonderful thing . Yay , let\\ 's all be free to say what we want ! We definitely want to be standing on the *freedom* end of the spectrum . The other end of the spectrum ( like North Korea ) is not a pretty place . Not at all.\\n\\nAnyone from a developed country would agree with this . Freedom is mostly a great thing.\\n\\n***BUT*** be very , very , *very* careful when you decide to do something *absolutely* , with no exceptions.\\n\\nWhen you push this idea of \ '' freedom\ '' of speech *to the extreme* , you start to get some very , very nasty problems pop up . \\n\\nSome examples : \\n\\n - Alice copies Bob\\ 's work , and sells it as if it were hers . ( copyright ) \\n - Bob claims Charlie is a child molester . ( defamation , slander ) \\n - Charlie sells Dianne fake artwork claiming it as original ( counterfeiting ) \\n - Diane runs a business and knowingly misleads her customer , Ernie . ( trade practices ) \\n - Ernie hates a minority group , and organises anti-minority rallies against them . ( hate speech , incitement ) \\n\\nIf we have *absolute* freedom of speech , you can never solve these problems . Ever . People can cheat , lie , and slander , and incite with absolute impunity . *Absolute* freedom means that there are *no ( legal ) consequences* . Because if you\\ 're free to do anything , then the law has nothing to say.\\n\\nSo there are *always* going to be a class of situations where what you say ( or do ) *MUST* carry consequences.\\n\\nThat means we will never ( regardless of what country we\\ 're in ) , have *absolute* freedom of speech . Our speech will be limited in some way or form regardless . And that\\ 's both a necessary and a *good* thing.\\n\\nSo what we\\ 're *really* talking about here is *where* do we draw the line of freedom of speech ? \\n\\nAt the moment , America is *pretending* that freedom of speech is absolute . It\\ 's not . That\\ 's a delusion . ( Try making a bomb joke at an airport . ) \\n\\nOther developed countries don\\'t bother pretending , but instead are honest about where the limit is .

I am open to any scheme of taxation that addresses this ( e.g. , land tax , Tobin Tax , etc ... ) in a smart way . I\\ 'm also interested in ensuring that negative externalities are internalised as much as possible .

What\\ 's clear to us from the headlines and broadcasts are people\\ 's ( particularly Europeans\\ ' ) manifested reactions to other races , but never the depths of the psyche where the root of a problem can be truly found . Conscious reasoning often takes you nowhere with a racist.\\n\\nHis \ '' eight in ten\ '' statistic was alarming for me , until I read what it was based on : \\n\\n & gt ; Tenenbom defines anti-Semitism as a belief that Jews hold vast power relative to their numbers , that they are obsessed with money and that Israel is solely or overwhelmingly responsible for the conflict with the Palestinians . \\n\\nI don\\'t know whether to be disappointed or relieved , but his results are definitely exaggerated because the definition was objectively *wrong* . \\n\\nAnti-Semitism is a serious phrase and should not be tossed around lightly , in Germany of all places . It encompasses simple , dumb hatred . Not the observation that relative to their numbers , the Jewish people are pretty high-achieving , due to historical and socio-economic factors that would take another wall of text to discuss . And in contrast with such a troubled past ! Like every Jewish person I\\ 've befriended or met , I\\ 'm sure Mr. Tenenbom would happily , at least humbly acknowledge this . Why get upset when others notice and automatically assume a case of tall poppy syndrome , when many other cultures are snidely frowned upon for being \ '' ignorant\ '' or \ '' uncivilized\ '' ? That perspective in Europe poses a much larger threat at the moment . It\\ 's a source of my relief that the findings aren\\'t entirely correct , since the only clear criteria for anti-Semitism would be the second , which brings me to the main point : \\n\\nI am frustrated as always to see people who support the Palestinian cause instantly branded as \ '' anti-Semetic\ '' or \ '' self-hating Jews\ '' ( self-hating , honestly ? ridiculous ) . There are many humanitarian motives for condemning Israeli policy , and if you disagree with that , by all means discuss it - just don\\'t resort to strawman labels . We could do without that narrow dichotomy of thinking.\\n\\nIn fact I would go even further to argue that many are inclined to support Israel do so out of a far uglier subconscious bigotry , one cultivated by selective journalism which presents the Arab people as angry but fails to reveal why , shows men rallying in the streets without the wives and children they aim to protect , reports killings by Arabs rather than the killings of Arabs , which are *unimaginably* greater in number.\\n\\nThe truest irony of all shines through when people like myself try to point out the ethnocentrism of Israel , and its failure to provide equal rights - and are called racist for it . \\n\\n**TL : DR** : Biased findings , sensationalist article , and the continued abuse of a once solemn , meaningful phrase .",Germanic,English

The country itself may need enough space to accommodate a significant amount of people . So maybe 100 million ? There are three places in the world that might fit the bill - **Outback Australia , Siberia and the Western Sahara . **\\n\\nThe location of the new country can only work if the current owners agree to it , obviously.\\n\\nOnce a location has been determined , the next thing to do would be to create some sort of legal framework . It is not necessary for the new country to be a straight democracy at first because , obviously , no one lives there . A move towards a Democracy would occur over time , but at first the country would exist as a United Nations protectorate . Member countries of the UN would provide law enforcement , legal officials as well as medical experts.\\n\\nThe next thing to do would be to design a city . Considering the locale , food production is probably out of the question so the city would essentially be a city-state , capable of housing 100 million people.\\n\\nOnce a city has been designed and the capital secured , refugees ( and anyone else who wants to go there ) are allowed in and are put to work building the new city . Associated industries are also set up with private investment in small businesses that begin to employ refugees who are not suited to the heavy labour of city building.\\n\\nAs this continues , note that there will be laws set up to prevent the sort of abuses that went on in rich Middle Eastern cities . Allowing the workers some level of profit sharing in the building of the city will allow money to flow more freely to the bottom rather than simply at the rich investors . There will be a universal health care system and free school education for children.\\n\\nAs time goes by , the city would become a manufacturing hub for the world . Like Japan , raw materials would go in and industrial goods would go out . The location of city - in a desolate place - precludes any ( or much ) mining of natural resources and the only thing \ '' going for it\ '' economically will be that people live there and are willing to work.\\n\\nAfter much time has gone by - say ten or more years - democratic and constitutional changes are undertaken to allow self-determination.\\n\\n**YES THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS AND NO IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT** , but the inability to create a completely perfect and efficient alterEnglish to the current problem should not be the reason to reject many of its good points .",Germanic,English

OneSalientOversight,europe,"I was waiting for someone to say that.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not Germany\\ 's trade surplus/mercantilism that makes them a successful economy . The principles of Germany\\ 's economic success can be applied to a nation which has a trade deficit . Applying German principles won\\'t turn that country into an exporter.\\n\\nI think it is far too simplistic to assume that \ '' Germany is successful because it\\ 's a great manufacturer and exporter\ '' .\\n\\nGermany has some very good labor market regulations . Unions and Employers work together to seek the common good . Unions recognise the need for Employers to make a profit , Employers recognise the need for workers to have good wage and working conditions . It\\ 's not perfect but it is a better system than anywhere else in the world.\\n\\nApply this to a country that has a trade deficit . The economy is based more on consumption than production , so people are employed more by the service and retail sector . So instead of unions and employers making agreements that apply to factories and steelworks , you have unions and workers making agreements that apply to cafes , restaurants , discount stores and supermarkets.\\n\\nGerman businesses are also often privately owned by families spanning many generations , as opposed to ownership being publicly purchased and traded on the sharemarket . What matters to German business owners is not the share price , but revenue.\\n\\nGermany also has a smaller property market . Many Germans live in long term rental accommodation . The property bubble which blew up the rest of Europe was not present in Germany in the same way . Had Europe kept their property market sustainable ( like Germany ) they would be better off.\\n\\nThe German government was more fiscally responsible , with tax revenue being sourced from a broad base . The governments of Ireland and Spain , for example , were not so responsible . They ran surpluses for a while , yes , but much of this excess tax revenue was sourced from the property bubble . When that popped , these governments went into deep deficit.\\n\\nOff the top of my head , those are Germany\\ 's main advantages , and none of them are based upon mercantilism .",Germanic,English

This crisis will certainly test the bounds of people\\ 's assumptions ( from both Euro supporters and Euro skeptics ) .\\n\\nThe advantage that Greece has over , say , Iceland , is that this capital flight away from Greece has not resulted in a plummeting currency and the inflation that it brings . Those in Greece who have been responsible and paid off debt and saved would usually be punished unjustly in a currency crash ( the value of their savings drops in relation to the rest of the world ) , but this time around they have retained their savings.\\n\\nIn many ways Greece\\ 's economic woes have been transferred onto the Eurozone as a whole , allowing the larger economies of France and Germany to help dampen the market unhappiness with Greece.\\n\\nUltimately Greece\\ 's economic future is linked with the success of the entire Eurozone : the recovery of France and Germany and other main Eurozone players will act to bring Greece out of its woes ... eventually .",Germanic,English

OneSalientOversight,europe,"I live in Australia but this argument is still the same.\\n\\nThere are multiple factors which have led to the US being high in gun violence - not just the occasional mass shooting but the common one-on-one murders that occur every day and which hardly ever get reported.\\n\\nOne factor is the lack of a welfare net . We in other western countries choose to pay our poor and unemployed more money and give them more generous benefits overall . We also have universal health care . The US has very little of these benefits . Turning to a life of crime is seen as a legitimate career opportunity for many . Moreover , people are expected to \ '' look after themselves\ '' so much that the potential for failure is huge . This puts a great amount of psychological pressure upon people . I\\ 'm confident that an expansion in the welfare system in the US to be at European levels will result in less crime overall , and thus less gun crime overall.\\n\\nBut then there is also the issue of gun availability . The US has the highest level of guns per capita in the western world . They also have the highest levels of gun crime in the western world . This is one of those cases where correlation does equal causation.\\n\\nMost gun crime is committed by those who have illegal weapons , but where did these illegal weapons come from ? There aren\\'t illegal gun factories operating in third world countries that are shipping their products to the US . Most of America\\ 's guns are made legally and made in America . How did these legal firearms end up in the hands of criminals and becoming illegal ? There is obviously a HUGE movement of guns and firearms from the LEGAL gun owning community to the ILLEGAL gun owning community . Thus restricting legal firearms will lead to a drop in the amount of illegal firearms .",Germanic,English
OneSalientOversight,europe,"I\\ 'm finding it difficult to understand the logic you\\ 're using here . You\\ 're saying that because inflation isn\\'t predictable - but rather unpredictable - then it is good to reduce risk.\\n\\nI agree with you here 100 % What I\\ 'm finding difficult to understand is that you think that \ '' Zeroflation\ '' is \ '' unpredictable\ '' .\\n\\nIn the end what I\\ 'm talking about here is \ '' Price Stability\ '' . The reason why I believe in \ '' Zeroflation\ '' is because of the following.\\n\\n* Inflation is the reduction of money\\ 's purchasing power . The higher inflation gets , the less purchasing power a person or business has . Money is supposed to be a store of value so if money keeps losing its value it also begins to lose its usefulness . If inflation then moves into hyperinflation , you then have a system in which money ceases to have value and is no longer used for economic activity . A barter system then emerges.\\n\\n* Deflation , however , is an increase in money\\ 's purchasing power . The more deflation there is , the more value a person\\ 's cash and bank deposits are . But this is also not a good thing because if money keeps getting more and more valuable , people will cease to use it to invest in capital and instead keep it under their beds . The use of money as a method of exchange then drops considerably . As deflation gets worse , so too will a barter system emerge.\\n\\nSo the problem is this : when prices are unstable and when a person\\ 's money changes in value considerably ( either as a loss of value with inflation or as an increase in value with deflation ) , then the inevitable result is a breakdown of the monetary system and a return to the more inefficient barter system of pre-civilised times.\\n\\nSo armed with these two different but similar facts ( or axioms if you like ) , there is obviously a median between the two , whereby money is used in its most efficient way . Inflation leads to an imbalance , as does deflation.\\n\\nSo what is the best median between the two ? I would argue that it is *Absolute Price Stability* , where money neither goes up or goes down in value . Such a situation makes for a stable economic environment ( all things being equal of course ) .\\n\\nIn practice there is no doubting that a policy of absolute price stability would not succeed in having prices remain stable every single day , month , quarter or year . That is actually not a problem . The issue is whether prices remain stable over the long term . There can certainly be short term price hikes or price drops , but over a period of a few years , monetary policy should focus upon keeping the index stable ( If the index is at 100 in year one , and is 100 in year three , that\\ 's good policy ) .\\n\\nI won\\'t address the issue of high European Wages as I honestly think that\\ 's a Furphy argued by Eurosceptics that has been influential for too many years.\\n\\nA tax on European financial transactions , a Tobin Tax , is the best solution in this situation.\\n\\nAnd why not use inflation to reduce debt ? Probably because that is what many countries have done in the past to their own detriment . Many countries in South America , for example , had very high inflation levels throughout the 80s and 90s as they sought to inflate away their debt . They\\ 're only now recovering - and mainly because they have sought to keep prices stable instead.\\n\\nGermany after WW2 is another example . In the years following WW2 the West German government was hampered by US economic controls and experienced very high levels of inflation . Living standards dropped considerably from the time the US took control of the West German economy . When the US gave up and let the West Germans control the economy themselves , the first thing they did was enact policies to reduce inflation . Once the money ( the Deutschmark ) reliably retained a store of value , the economy began growing again . Within 20 years they were the richest country in Europe.\\n\\nAnd what about the US during the 70s ? It wasn\\'t Reagan , but Paul Volcker who saved the US economy . How ? By killing off inflation.\\n\\n ( BTW , don\\'t somehow think that Zeroflation is equivalent to zero money growth . It isn\\'t . The money supply can still be growing during a period of deflation . It is also possible for the money supply to be shrinking during a period of inflation . The money supply is an important factor in inflation , but not the only one )",Germanic,English
OneSalientOversight,europe,"Well the UK can leave the EU if it wants to but remember that the financial sector is what got the world into the mess its in , and the UK has a bigger financial sector than most.\\n\\nAs for zero economic activity due to inflation I would like you to consider the fact that there are plenty of examples of economic growth in deflationary periods , not to mention economic decline in inflationary periods . My feeling is that the best long term potential for economic growth can be partly met by having \ '' zeroflation\ '' .",Germanic,English

It\\ 's still bad in Europe , but there are a number of really important things that people ( esp English speaking pundits ) seem to ignore.\\n\\nAs regards to Budget deficits and Government debt , the EU and Eurozone have smaller budget deficits than the US ( about -4 % of GDP compared to around -8 % of GDP in the US ) and a **smaller** amount of government debt . This may confuse people so let me explain : \\n\\nCertain countries in Europe ( eg Greece ) have huge levels of government debt while other countries do not . One of the problems with comparing Europe to the US is that both areas have different ways of comparing debt . When we hear that the US government has debt of 65 % of GDP , that does not include debt accrued by state and local governments . In Europe , however , the debt figures that are reported DO include this debt . When you add US state and local government debt to the federal figure , it ends up being equal to if not more than that of Europe . [ I blog about this here ] ( http : //one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2010/05/busting-myth-of-european-debt.html ) \\n\\nAnother important fiscal statistic is tax revenue . Although some countries in the EU are famous for their inability to collect tax , overall EU/Eurozone governments have maintained a reasonable revenue base throughout the recent crisis . By contrast US tax revenue has plummeted . This means that the US needs to grow more and grow faster just in order to maintain its public spending than the EU/Eurozone will . Again I blog about it [ here ] ( http : //one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2011/08/us-government-needs-more-revenue.html ) .\\n\\nAnd finally we shouldn\\'t forget Germany . Germany really is the engine of European growth and its economy has performed stunningly well throughout the crisis . Germany\\ 's growth is linked to the EU/Eurozone as a whole . So when we weep and wail over places like Greece and Ireland , just remember that these countries need a strong and resilient Germany demanding their goods and services in order to recover.\\n\\nAnd finally look at politics in the EU . No politics is ever \ '' good\ '' , but apart from the radical fringe groups there is no popular political party in any country that is anything near the radicalism of the US Tea Party and Republican party generally . There\\ 's no one in Europe yelling \ '' Communist\ '' at those who support universal health care or generous welfare spending or public education.\\n\\nLong term , Europe has it made .

AnDaghdha,europe,"& gt ; This comes from the fact that the \ '' neutral\ '' countries nonetheless benefit from the alliance , while not bearing any cost . And yet they sometimes go on the high horse of pacifism.\\n\\nOf course we benefit from the alliance . However , that is not a reason for us to join NATO or give up our neutrality . Especially an alliance with a country like America which has been persistently at war with multiple countries and seems to view it as a way to gain favour rather than a last resort . Just because they aren\\'t seeking to relabel the countries they invade or overthrow as the \ '' United States of America\ '' on the map , it does not justify their actions . Even more so when they act undemocratically and on the impulses of their leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's just not true . NATO was becoming almost obsolete , until Putin started his funtiems in the neighborhood . He dragged NATO screaming and kicking back to Cold War . But , hey , such politicians like to have a clear enemy to scare their public with.\\n\\nTo claim NATO is a force for good because Russia is not is deceptive . Both sides act in their own interests . NATO has been acting with disregard since its inception . As has Russia . Putin merely initiated a new theatre in the shit slinging . Neither side is fully at fault . Russia and NATO will always be reacting to what the other side does . I do know however that Russia won\\'t stop doing shit so long as NATO is breathing down its neck and aggravating it . And if you corner a dog , it will bite back.\\n\\nAt the end of the day , my opinion on NATO is mine own ( although I know many share it ) . I don\\'t have to defend my country\\ 's neutrality .
