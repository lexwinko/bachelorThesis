In today\\ 's times , many political arguments become rather ugly , and I want to make sure you know I don\\'t mean any of this personally.\\n\\nI understand and I even upvoted all your comments in this thread . Ironically , I am getting downvoted for having a different opinion - had I say something like \ '' Drumpf is Hitler\ '' it would be the opposite . Truly , nowadays people are offended just by the mere fact that someone with different opinion exists ( I do not mean you there ) .\\n\\n & gt ; No , he wasn\\'t . Mattis was an OBAMA pick , whom Trump actually wanted to sack . He\\ 's only still there because the Hill Republicans convinced Trump to leave someone with experience in place , because there is literally not a single other person in the entire administration who knows anything about defence.\\n\\nHow Mattis was an Obama pick when Obama fired Mattis in 2013 - http : //www.weeklystandard.com/obama-fires-top-general-without-even-a-phone-call/article/697744 ? Once Mattis assumed the office he also harshly criticized Obama - http : //www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/1/james-mad-dog-mattis-retired-us-commander-rips-oba/\\n\\n & gt ; I can\\'t find a record of Trump ever praising Estonia for that . The absolute closest I can find is him saying that countries that pay over 2 % are ones they wouldn\\'t break the treaty on , which includes Estonia , although I would think to be rather concerning since the European countries around Estonia matter more than the US itself . \\n\\nI have sent you the link in the previous comment - http : //news.err.ee/219493/trump-sends-congratulation-note-to-kaljulaid , quote from there - *\ '' He also recognized Estonian efforts within NATO , in particular its achievement of the 2 percent GDP goal regarding defense spending.\ '' * . There is also some Trump\\ 's comment about Ukraine ( in the same article ) - *\ '' Your support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine is important for our shared goal of enhancing European and regional security.\ '' *\\n\\n & gt ; Estonia would be much more reliant on Germany or the Scandinavian countries actually fighting on the ground\\n\\nWell sure , look at this article for example - [ Finnish defense minister wouldn\\'t allow in NATO forces aiding Estonia ] ( http : //news.err.ee/596302/finnish-defense-minister-wouldn-t-allow-in-nato-forces-aiding-estonia ) .\\n\\n & gt ; \u201cWell , we don\u2019t rely on American banks , we have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d \\n\\nIt was said only about golf courses\\n\\n & gt ; He had strong prexisting financial connections to Russia long before ever running for president , including a slew of properties , and there is absolutely no reason to think that has changed \\n\\nThere are many properties branded with \ '' Trump , Inc\ '' in US . Trump had several contacts with Russian investors but it seems that he did not build anything in Russia in the result - [ see this link ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia ) \\n\\n & gt ; refuses to release his tax returns\\n\\nWell that\\ 's really bad\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Sanctions against Russia are still in force\\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and that is something Trump has been fighting tooth and nail to change , and something he might still manage . Obama put many of the sanctions you\\ 're referring to in place . Do you praise an arsonist for trying to burn your house down and failing , and shame the builder who made it in the first place for not making it fireproof ? That is , to my understanding , what you are telling me.\\n\\nYes , it was Obama who initiated them . Trump is President for already 6 months and he still did not cancel them .\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; There are more US troops on the Russian border than it was during Obama\\ 's presidency\\n\\n & gt ; *sigh* . They weren\\'t put in there under Trump\\ 's watch , it was under Obama\\ 's . Look at the date on that article . The order was signed by him before he left office , and Trump arrived just soon enough to take his place at the podium . Again , how on earth is this Trump\\ 's doing ? It\\ 's an order designed by Obama , signed by Obama , and simply couldn\\'t get finished before his term ran out . Trump came into office , had no idea whether he should stop it or not , and decided to trust that Obama knew what he was doing . Do you believe that your postman somehow manages to write such passionate letters on your friend\\ 's behalf ? That he crafts everything you receive in the mail ? No , he merely delivers a pre-made package , and the same occurred here.\\n\\nWell Trump could easily cancel them * ( if he would be really pro-Russian ) * just like he trying to introduce the travel ban . Just as with the sanctions , 6 months later since Trump assumed office - US troops are still on the Russian border and there is no sign of moving them.\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Assad got punished for his chemical attack\\n\\n & gt ; I would even be willing to argue with you here , it was a tiny slap on the wrist that caused no long term damage . In exchange , he spent almost $ 60 million of military equipment , which is about 10 % of Estonia\\ 's entire military spending for a whole year . Action definitely needed to be taken , I\\ 'm not arguing with you there , but that was arguably an incredibly expensive attack for relatively gain , hmm ? \\n\\nWhy does it mater how many % of Estonia military spending it is - it was US who took that action , not Estonia.\\n\\nIt definitely costed some money but now Assad seems to be not trying to pull this trick again . Also , what was the EU response to that attack ( except just talks ) - nothing . \\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Trump tried to push other NATO countries to spend more on defence ( obviously Putin would hate that ) \\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and these countries would also hate it . Just take Germany , for example ; if we spent 2 % of our budget on military , we\\ 'd already be outspending Russia by 40 % , just by ourselves . Imagine if France and the UK chipped in ; that\\ 's a little excessive , or ? It\\ 's easy for Estonia to spend 2 % because you have a rather small economy , but for a relatively small country surrounded by allies and with no overseas territories , I see no reason why we should pay that much . More than what we do at the moment , I can agree to that with the rather shoddy state our military is in , but we already pay for much of the EU\\ 's infrastructure and bail out a ton of poor countries . We\\ 're not paying for an entire continent\\ 's army as well.\\n\\nThere could be reasons to disagree with the 2 % target goal , but my point is that Russia would definitely hate that if everyone would be really spending 2 % - it contradicts with the theory that Trump is pro-Russian ( originally claimed by the comment that I responded to ) .\\n\\nSo , what was my original comment : \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' Still that \ '' buddy of the Russian oligarchy\ '' did a lot more for deterrence against Russia than any other NATO or EU country.\ '' \\n\\nSo does any EU country has more troops on the Russian border than US has ?

Now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850.\\n\\n & gt ; I think your figures are wrong there because Estonia still has half the GDP per capita of Finland . \\n\\nWell they are not wrong because current Finland GDP PPP is $ 43,090 and Estonian one is $ 30,850 , the difference is not a half . So this is a fact that ~50 years of the USSR occupation literally ruined the economy and now it significantly recovered with capitalism - I already described it with exact figures in my above comment.\\n\\n & gt ; Look up the actual theory , disconnect it from what you know from history , and imagine what it could be like , without a lens.\\n\\nWhat is the theory ?

What happens to the current business owners ? This theory never worked and will never work - unless socialists find a way to control population via some kind of a hivemind device.\\n\\nTo be honest , even if it would have worked exactly as it written in the theory , I would still dislike it - because no \ '' workers\ '' can realistically manage risk of running an enterprise , and they should not.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t agree with how Soviet Russia ran things , despite being a socialist , all I\\ 'm saying is that it was literally the pinnacle of Russian power.\\n\\nThe pinnacle of Russian power ? Are you talking about 1930-1940 when people were being sent to gulags , or about the other part when they were queuing for bread from 6am ? \\n\\nToday Russians at least have some freedom - they can travel to foreign countries , read foreign newspapers and do business . All this was impossible in USSR.\\n\\nIt was the pinnacle only if you measure it in number of tanks and nukes.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition , have you ever actually looked at what Russia did wrong ? It was corruption in government , sectarianism , inefficient management , a one-party system that never needed to change , stagnation , isolation .

Nobody was pillaging Serbia in the past 50 years , while there is the opposite in case of Estonia .

What business can you do when your whole market is limited to a small and closed balkan country ? The reforms have been designed to protect the local business and keep out foreign competition.\\n\\nYou are very wrong here . \ '' Ease of doing business\ '' is about dealing with tax authorities , setting up a business , getting permits , etc . If it is a pain in the ass to setup a local business , how exactly it \ '' protects the local business\ '' ? If they would do reforms their local business would be stronger and their economy would attract foreign investments.\\n\\nYour original point was : \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it\\ 's so simple to reform.\\n\\nAnd once I proved that it happened in other countries before , you started saying *\ '' reforms are not needed if & lt ; list of excuses & gt ; \ '' * .",Uralic,Estonian

ExWei,europe,"I , as someone who lives in EU , can not imagine that sanctions against US states from EU will ever exist . You used Russia as an example - but US economy is a lot bigger than the Russian one and it would really hit EU if introduce such sanctions . EU trade with US is 20 % .\\n\\nAlso - could you imagine what uproar it would create ? Shell Oil Company ( HQ in US is in Texas ) , for example , is Netherlands-owned - Wilders is already almost got elected in Netherlands , imagine what would happen if Netherlands economy would be hit with such sanctions ? Brexit happened because of temporal discomfort * ( let\\ 's not pretend there were no issues ) * but a total ban on trade with some US states would be a lot larger discomfort . You can care as much as you want about environment and ethics but if you are unemployed because of the sanctions then you would probably care about money over environment . EU countries would lose billions of euros , thousands would lose jobs - guess for which party they would vote ? For that one that promises to leave EU and cancel the sanctions.\\n\\n & gt ; My point is not everything should be about money and neoliberalism.\\n\\nI agree , there should be limits . But we can not allow e.g . Saudi Arabia that literally stones gays and women to be allowed , and the red states to be banned for \ '' ethics and environment\ '' .\\n\\nIMO first sort out Saudi Arabia , Qatar and North Korea , and only then think about red states - probably while trying to sort out Saudi Arabia , Trump will be already gone.\\n\\n**edit : ** and what would be US response to these sanctions ? Wage full trade war with EU ? Sorry , but we in EU do not want it .",Uralic,Estonian
ExWei,europe,"& gt ; If you have a real argument make it\\n\\nOk , let me rephrase my argument : \\n\\nYour claim was \ '' yes pull all investment from red states only invest in blue areas\ '' \\n\\n1 . How exactly do you see \ '' pulling all investments from red states\ '' ? Make some law that would prohibit private EU companies from owning shares in the states that vote republican ? As of today , EU companies can freely own shares in almost every country * ( I believe it excludes North Korea and other similar countries ) * , even in popular tax planning countries ( aka \ '' tax havens\ '' ) such as BVI . Outlaw Republican states so they would be in the same list as North Korea ? It sounds like dictatorship.\\n\\n2 . ( # 1 continues ) Ok , lets assume this law is created and it passed , what would likely happen : all affected EU companies would either create a subsidiary or move legal residence to somewhere like BVI where they would not be bothered by such laws , and then they would continue managing their investments into Republican states from there . So what would EU gain from that : instead of getting at least some % from the dividends from the US investments , EU would get 0 % from that.\\n\\n3 . I see you indirectly compared Texas to \ '' a nazi death camp\ '' in [ the other comment ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6futrk/eu_to_ignore_white_house_and_work_directly_with/dily6o3/ ) . What exactly Texas is doing that it deserves such comparisons ? Votes republican ? With countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar being allowed , it would be an ultimate double-standard to ban Texas.\\n\\n4 . On your argument on the better places for investments ( higher ROI ) . What prevents the blue states from improving their business environment to make them more attractive for investments ? Why there should be some kind of *affirmative action* to discriminate against some states ( that are \ '' guilty\ '' of voting for a different party ) ? It is like if you would have a fast car and you neighbor would have a slow car , so they would break your tires so your speed would be equal ( or worse ) .\\n\\n5 . You also say \ '' Get Asia on board too\ '' - what do you mean there ? Force private companies to invest to Asia ( many of them are already doing that - thanks to their business friendless and good ROI due to local factors ) ? The same with \ '' invest blue states only\ '' - how are you going to make companies to do that ? \\n\\nMy point is that there should be fair , free market - you are a blue state and you want investments ? Great , make yourself more competitive to win it from the red states .

ExWei,europe,"& gt ; so in a normal world they should have \\'equal rights\\ ' . however this is not a normal world.\\n\\nYou have no clue how wrong you are . Please read at least [ some Wikipedia article about that ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_nationality_law ) , for example . Especially the \ '' historical precedents of undefined citizenship\ '' . I will quote it for you : \\n\\n & gt ; \\'Undefined citizenship\\ ' ( Estonian : kodakondsuseta isik , Russian : \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ) is a term used in Estonia to denote a post-Soviet form of statelessness . It is applied to those migrants from former Soviet republics and their children , who were unable or unwilling to pursue any country\\ 's citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Russia being a successor state to the Soviet Union , all former USSR citizens qualified for citizenship of Russian Federation , available upon mere request , as provided by the law \ '' On the RSFSR Citizenship\ '' in force up to end of 2000 . [ 4 ] Estonia\\ 's policy of requiring naturalisation of post-war immigrants was in part influenced by Russia\\ 's citizenship law and the desire to prevent dual citizenship , [ 5 ] and upon the established legal principle that persons who settle under the rule of an occupying power gain no automatic right to nationality . According to Peter Van Elsuwege , a scholar in European law at Ghent University , **a number of historic precedents support this** , most notably the case of Alsace-Lorraine when France on recovering the territory in 1918 did not automatically grant French citizenship to German settlers despite Germany having annexed the territory 47 years earlier in 1871 . [ 6 ] \\n\\nPersons of undefined citizenship who reside legally in Estonia can apply for an alien\\ 's passport . Estonian alien\\ 's passport allows visa-free travel within Schengen treaty countries for a maximum of 90 days in a 6-month period . [ 7 ] AlterEnglishly they are entitled to naturalise as citizens and receive an Estonia passport , and more than half have opted to do so since 1992 . [ 8 ] \\n\\n & gt ; if the netherlands revokes a terrorists citizenship to prevent him from coming back , then they are violating this particular human right as well ( which is why the discussion on whether to do this is an ongoing debate in my country ) .\\n\\nIn Denmark , if you are terrorist [ you lose Danish citizenship ] ( http : //www.middleeasteye.net/news/denmark-strips-man-citizenship-fighting-596200382 ) . Is Denmark also \ '' not normal world\ '' for you ? \\n\\n & gt ; because this particular human right does not have preconditions however reasonable they may look like to you\\n\\nNothing prevents them from becoming Russian citizens . They all are eligible to become Russian citizens because they were Soviet citizens and Russia is a successor of USSR . Estonia is not a successor of USSR.\\n\\nRegarding your second paragraph ... . some formatting would make it more readable by the way.. : \\n\\n & gt ; these soviets have lived there all their lives\\n\\nWrong . Many of them immigrated in 1970s - it is a considerable part of life but not \ '' all\ '' . If you moved in 1970 and after 20 years in 1991 you still do not know the local language - sorry , but you are a bad immigrant.\\n\\n & gt ; this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nLike I said , they are free to get Russian citizenship . Once they get Russian citizenship they still can live in Estonia.\\n\\n & gt ; so in a normal world they should have \\'equal rights\\ ' . however this is not a normal world . \\'English estonians\\ ' do not like them and are very smart . they thought \\'well we are very many so we rule here . and we don\\'t like them\\ ' . But they could not just tell them to go because that would be mean . So they thought on this until a smart Estonian came up with an idea . \\'Well the soviets do not know estonian . so we tell them that they can belong here if they know estonian . that sounds reasonable\\ ' . so they went to the soviets and said \\'we are so generous , we allow any soviets to become estonians , as long as they know estonian\\ ' . the soviets lack of knowledge of estonian is just a politically correct proxy for ethnicity . so to prevent smart people from excluding people they don\\'t like , this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nSo is all this an excuse to illegally immigrate to an other country and completely do not try to learn the local language ? Just answer that . Is it okay when you immigrate and don\\'t even try to at least a bit to integrate ? This all is only about their lack of at least slightest integration.\\n\\nHowever , some of them integrate ( and acquire the Estonian citizenship ) and I support that.\\n\\nChances are that you never was in Estonia and yet you are claiming you be an \ '' expert\ '' on the subject . Literally everyone who wanted got that citizenship , only those who do not need / or hate it are without citizenship now.\\n\\nAlso , regarding the discrimination : If I move to , say , Finland , they will want me to learn the Finnish language in order to become a citizen of Finland . Why Russians should get a free pass ? \\n\\nAlso , it seems to be a common misinformation , but all non-citizens are eligible for all benefits like healthcare , pension , unemployment benefits , etc . They are equal to citizens there.\\n\\n**edit : ** your comment in other thread - \ '' the EU should never have allowed you in\ '' , \ '' little insignificant fascist countries with no history\ '' .

When USSR collapsed , everyone who lived in Estonia at that moment but did not live here until 1939 ( i.e . an illegal immigrant ) could make a choice : select undefined citizenship or Russian citizenship .

Those people from the # 2 item are absolutely free to receive Estonian citizenship at any moment if they just pass the Estonian language test - language of the country they live in .

Those who immigrated during Soviet occupation but learned the language during that time could acquire Estonian citizenship right in 1991.\\n\\nSo , once again , how does it violate human rights ?

FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; I think if you look at Brazil and Portugal , Cuba and Spain , Canada and the USA and ( finally ) the UK and Ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own , individual , languages.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter much if the language is unique to them or not , what matters is whether the culture is based on that language or not . Core concepts of many languages and associated cultures do not exist in other languages , thus it is not possible to adopt another language without abandoning or re-shaping linguistic and cultural concepts , which would lead to a loss of cultural diversity.\\n\\nConsider this example . Suppose I say to you in English that \ '' I spent yesterday evening with a neighbor.\ '' You may well wonder whether my companion was male or female , but I have the right to tell you politely that it\\ 's none of your business . But if we were speaking French or German , I wouldn\\'t have the privilege to equivocate in this way , because I would be obliged by the grammar of language to choose between *voisin* or *voisine* ; *Nachbar* or *Nachbarin* . These languages compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not I feel it is remotely your concern . This does not mean , of course , that English speakers are unable to understand the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors , but it does mean that they do not have to consider the sexes of neighbors , friends , teachers and a host of other persons each time they come up in a conversation , whereas speakers of some languages are obliged to do so.\\n\\nOn the other hand , English does oblige you to specify certain types of information that can be left to the context in other languages . If I want to tell you in English about a dinner with my neighbor , I may not have to mention the neighbor\\ 's sex , but I do have to tell you something about the timing of the event : I have to decide whether we dined , have been dining , are dining , will be dining and so on . Chinese , on the other hand , does not oblige its speakers to specify the exact time of the action in this way , because the same verb form can be used for past , present or future actions . Again , this does not mean that the Chinese are unable to understand the concept of time . But it does mean they are not obliged to think about timing whenever they describe an action.\\n\\nWhen your language routinely obliges you to specify certain types of information , it forces you to be attentive to certain details in the world and to certain aspects of experience that speakers of other languages may not be required to think about all the time . And since such habits of speech are cultivated from the earliest age , it is only natural that they can settle into habits of mind that go beyond language itself , affecting your experiences , perceptions , associations , feelings , memories and orientation in the world .",Uralic,Estonian

And just like the South Korean government , NATO was politically committed to a preclusive defense in geographic circumstances that would have favored a far more elastic defense.\\n\\n & gt ; In a retrospective view of the situation at the level of theater strategy , we would see the eastern edge of the Federal Republic ( \ '' West Germany\ '' ) extending from the Baltic coast all the way south to Austria . For some 625 miles , the border would divide East Germany and Czechoslovakia , at the time both basing areas for the Soviet army . Upon mobilization , as units of the Belgian , British , Canadian , Dutch , German , and American armies would move out of their barracks and bases to deploy into their assigned positions , NATO\\ 's \ '' central front\ '' would acquire a physical form . We would see not a solid line with units stationed shoulder to shoulder but rather a series of deployments of men , vehicles , and weapons within a band of territory running from north to south.\\n\\n & gt ; Roughly one-third of NATO\\ 's tank and mechanized formations ( the \ '' covering forces\ '' ) would have advanced to within a few miles from the border , with the rest kept some distance behind . Even though the front held by the covering forces would not follow each twist and turn of the border , it would still be stretched out over some 600 miles . In addition , at least the low-lying tracts of the border with neutral Austria would also have to be protected , because Soviet invasion forces from Hungary could pass up the Danube valley quite quickly.\\n\\n & gt ; We can now finally dispose of the missile-infantry proposal . Given the length of the frontage that the Alliance was committed to protect , we can immediately understand why a frontal defense by missile troops would have been very weak , even if elaborately shielded by properly overwatched barriers . For we discover that in those narrow sectors of the front where the two sides would actually collide in combat , the antitank missiles would be greatly outnumbered by Soviet armored vehicles , even though the missiles were so much cheaper.\\n\\n & gt ; As matters stood during the last two decades of the Cold War , more than 10,000 tanks , an even larger number of infantry combat vehicles , much self-propelled artillery , and all manner of support units could attack from a standing start from East Germany and Czechoslovakia , with much greater forces moving up behind them from Poland and the Soviet Union.\\ ' That great mass of vehicles would not of course be distributed evenly from north to south opposite every segment of the front , but instead be concentrated into four or five vectors of advance , each moving westward in a phalanx as broad as the terrain would allow . Some might be constricted into an approach as narrow as a two-lane road , while others might advance on a width of as much as ten miles . But summing all the vectors and the width of every phalanx , Soviet armor would still be attacking only a fraction of the entire 600-mile line . Thus even if a huge force of missile troops were raised , with tens of thousands of launchers , Soviet armor rolling forward would easily outnumber them in every combat encounter.\\n\\n & gt ; The arithmetic of attrition must therefore guarantee defeat . It can not be otherwise when the number of missile launchers must be distributed to cover all the frontage , while invading armored forces attack in concentrated force ? Of course the missile troops could also be concentrated , in fact they could outconcentrate the invasion columns , if they were mobile enough . But that can not be done just by supplying trucks to transport them up and down the front along the border patrol roads , because any movements that far forward would be much too vulnerable to artillery fires . It can only be done by keeping the bulk of the missile troops in wait at rearward crossroads , ready to rush forward on their trucks to reinforce sectors of the front under attack . Incapable of cross-country movement and thus road-bound , motorized missile troops in transit would be highly vulnerable to air attack and quite unable to move forward against the artillery fires running ahead of each invading phalanx . Helicopters could assure an even faster response . Enough of them could allow the missile troops to outconcentrate the invasion columns every time , but that is no longer the cheap alterEnglish originally proposed \u2014 and why carry missile troops with antitank launchers anyway , when helicopters can have their own missiles without need of troops to launch them ? In either case , those most fragile of aircraft would be highly vulnerable to the antiaircraft weapons that accompany armored forces and to the descending curtains of artillery fire of a large-scale offensive . \\n\\n & gt ; With trucks much too vulnerable as well as road-bound , and with helicopters too vulnerable as well as too expensive , only well-armored ground vehicles , fit to go across country , can provide mobility under fire for the missile troops , to allow them to meet the concentrated attack . Armored and tracked , such vehicles could certainly bring the missile troops where they would be needed . They would of course replicate the present carriers of the mechanized infantry . . . which of course includes antitank missiles among its weapons . And if armored vehicles are to be acquired , why not arm them with built-in missile launchers that can be used without dismounting ? And if there are to be built-in weapons anyway , why have only bulky missile-launchers with their slow rates of fire , when guns remain superior for antiarmor combat at closer ranges ? If taken that far , the original proposal dissolves into a mere variant of the existing mechanized forces , or even into a re-creation of the tank itself . We have come full circle , back to the conventional solution of fighting armor with armor . We can now recognize that the persistence of armored forces is not just the result of institutional rigidity , the force of tradition , the power of entrenched military bureaucracies . Without protected mobility there is no concentration , and without concentration there is no strength .",Uralic,Estonian

FleshyDagger,europe,"[ Background ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way ) : \\n\\n & gt ; The Baltic Way or Baltic Chain was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on August 23 , 1989 . Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) across the three Baltic states \u2013 Estonian SSR , Latvian SSR , and Lithuanian SSR , republics of the Soviet Union.\\n\\n & gt ; The demonstration originated in \ '' Black Ribbon Day\ '' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s . It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany . The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940.\\n\\n & gt ; The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements : Rahvarinne of Estonia , the Popular Front of Latvia , and S\u0105j\u016bdis of Lithuania . The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities . It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations . It has been described as an effective publicity campaign , and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene . The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter , but as a moral issue.\\n\\n & gt ; The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric , but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union . Within six months of the protest , Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.\\n\\nThere\\ 's also a documentary by two American filmmakers about [ the Singing Revolution ] ( http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0954008/ ) , which the Baltic Way was a part of ( [ trailer ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pm3yzSN8aVk ) ) .",Uralic,Estonian

I clearly stated that research has shown this and pointed you towards one of the first and most famous works that came to this conclusion , The Feminine Mystique . Women who are housewives tend to be unhappy with that role.\\n\\nSo you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s USA to prove that housewives in present-day Germany prefer to work ? And you call this research ? \\n\\nDo you have an actual source that gives a figures on how many German parents would work rather stay at home , given the choice ? In Estonia , for example , we\\ 've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation . The most highly-educated , well-paid women were the group that saw the highest rise of birth rates after *parent\\ 's salary* was introduced that consists of child support at the level of parent\\ 's salary in the year before childbirth . This tool of financial security ( ! ) has by far been the most effective method of stopping population decline , even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society . As a side effect to this , the length of time staying at home has also increased : approximately half the parents do not work during their first year with the child . There is a sharp decrease of staying at home at the cut-off point of *parent\\ 's salary*.\\n\\nSee [ this chart ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uTLt8I2.png ) from a study by Praxis , with summary published in [ Estonian Parliament\\ 's journal ] ( http : //www.riigikogu.ee/rito/index.php ? id=13768 & amp ; op=archive2 ) . It\\ 's percentage of parent\\ 's who receive pay from work ( left axis ) for the top-paid 20 % in months since the birth of their child ( bottom axis ) . Parent\\ 's salary was introduced in 2004 , and the chart displays behaviour two years prior , at the time , and two years later . At that time , parent\\ 's salary was paid for 12 months . Notice how the percentage of parents working drops by half , given the choice to stay at home - and mind you , these are the most career-oriented people . As an implication of this , the length of staying at home also significantly increased.\\n\\nSo the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors , and not some kind of an universal thing of its own.\\n\\n & gt ; The overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high.\\n\\nOf course . But the high quality isn\\'t guaranteed , thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation , not some ideal model . And let\\ 's not forget from where we started - was the quality of day care high in DDR and the Soviet Union by today\\ 's standards that the research is based upon ?

That\\ 's the question I have been asking.\\n\\nThe only fact you\\ 've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular . This is flawed reasoning since the popularity of child care does not necessarily reflect what parents want . Instead , it may very easily reflect what they are *forced to* do to make the ends meet . Likewise , staying at home does not automatically translate to a preference , but may indicate \ '' a lack of quality in available child care.\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's like taxes . The fact that 99 % pay them does not mean that 99 % of the population would prefer to do so , given a choice not to.\\n\\n & gt ; Different studies coming to different conclusions does not mean anything if the quality of the scientific method is not on the same level.\\n\\nThere are studies supporting both sides of the argument , and there are no definitive studies that would give a solid , universal backing to either of them.\\n\\nIf you claim otherwise , then I guess it is my turn to ask for sources .",Uralic,Estonian
FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; The fact that child care for children under three is still wildly popular and common in East Germany even without the obligation to work you mentioned would suggest that yes , women prefer to work.\\n\\nDesire and actions may not necessarily be aligned . For example , a study conducted in Tallinn among mothers of one-year-olds concluded that only 7 % wished to return to work at that time . Sadly , many can not afford to stay at home beyond the 18 month maternity leave that we have . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that babies need to basically be attached to their mothers is not what modern science says at all . Mothers are not the only attachment figures of babies .

There are very few studies that have large enough sample size and long enough timespan - like [ the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ] ( https : //www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/Pages/seccyd.aspx ) , which followed its subjects into adolescence - , and I do not believe that conclusions from any of them can be applied to other societies in other eras .",Uralic,Estonian
FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; It was also much more common for women with children to work\\n\\nDid they prefer to do so , or was it forced upon ?

FleshyDagger,europe,"The source I provided was a table from ministry of defence\\ 's ordinance that set conscription numbers for 2013 and 2014 , and assigned them to units . It should be enough to settle the matter.\\n\\nAs for reservists , you seem to not understand the defence concept that is based on conscription . Estonia , as well as Finland and several other countries , do not keep a large active military , but instead run a small peacetime force that is tasked with training conscripts . After their training , these conscripts are assigned to reserve and continue their normal life ( with refresher training now and then ) , but they are seen as fit for active duty for ten years from their training , and should the need arise , are called up with a mobilization . Thus the main fighting force is 10 years\\ ' worth of conscripts . They are sometimes called \ '' active reserve\ '' to distinguish them from those who simply sometime in their life got military training . For example , Finland\\ 's armed forces have trained 3.5 million conscripts in the past 90 years , and about 2 million of them are alive , but only ~350 000 or ten years\\ ' worth of them are considered the fit for immediate duty and thus added to active personnel ( 36 000 , most of them conscripts in training ) of Finnish armed forces to form the wartime size.\\n\\nRomania abolished conscription in 2007 . This means that by 2017 , there will be no reservists who would be generally considered to be fit for immediate duty . So here\\ 's my question again : where are you going to take reserves from to boost wartime size ? Are you going to rely on 40-somethings and 50-somethings with obsolete training , many of whom have never even seen the current equipment ? \\n\\nI believe my comparison of Estonian active personnel + active reserve + members of paramilitary organization against Romanian active personnel was the most accurate way of comparing size , considering the core differences between professional armies and conscription-based armies.\\n\\nThe only thing that you could pick on is that the Estonian wartime operational size includes the Estonian Defence League , a volunteer military organization , in addition to conscripts .

If you had ever had read the definition of depression from the ICD-10 , you would not have linked me a source that starts with \ '' 28 percent of stay-at-home moms reported depression a lot of the day when asked how they were feeling the day before\ '' .

Unlike Russia , NATO has not yet [ occupied the country ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_ % 281940 % 29 # Soviet_occupation ) , [ installed a puppet government ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Transitional_governments ) , [ deported tens of thousands to die Siberia ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Mass_deportations ) or [ simply murdered them ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Blokhin ) .\\n\\nThis , however , does not fit into Mearsheimer\\ 's narrative , because in such case , the expansion of NATO had not been something orchestrated by the West to \ '' encircle\ '' Russia , but an expression of free will by Eastern European nations , motivated by the fear of history repeating itself . And thus would collapse his core message of blaming the West.\\n\\nIn fact , the situation in Eastern Europe has very little to do with the West . Key dynamics lie within the history of the region , especially in the post-war subjugation of Eastern Europe and Russia\\ 's failure to face its bloody past like Germany has done . Could you imagine modern-day Germany [ going after those who refused to serve in the Wehrmacht or the SS ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fsm9j/russia_reopens_criminal_cases_against_lithuanians/ ) ? \\n\\nThere\\ 's a reason why Russia\\ 's neighbours are doing everything they can to isolate and protect themselves from Russia , and it\\ 's an absolute travesty that the self-proclaimed \ '' realist\ '' ignores this . His reasoning is a fantasy that might be internally sound , but nevertheless has very little connection to the real world.\\n\\n & gt ; Whether Ukraine becoming integrated with the EU and a possible NATO candidate is a threat to Russia , well as Mearsheimer says , it\\ 's not up to us what Russia deems as a threat . \\n\\nOf course Russia is free to define what they see as a threat , but this does not validate their position - deciding for the Ukrainians is a balant violation of Ukraine\\ 's right to self-determination , a cardinal principle in modern international law , binding to all members of the UN through its Charter.\\n\\nThis is also one of the topics Mearsheimer skips over - he does not even mention that Putin in his military aggression has violated the UN Charter , the Helsinki Act of 1975 , the Treaty on the Dissolution of the Soviet Union of 1991 , the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 , the Russian-Ukrainian Friendship Treaty of 1997 , or the Russian-Ukrainian Sevastopol Base Treaty of 1997 , and so on.\\n\\nWith Mearsheimer\\ 's arguments , any crackpot military aggression anywhere in the world could be defended . He could use the same arguments to justify Joseph Stalin , Adolf Hitler , or Saddam Hussein , which suggests that these arguments in defense of Putin might not be of much value .",Uralic,Estonian

Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\n & gt ; \\n\\nBUILDING THINGS\\n\\nA glimpse of this Swedish future can be caught at Arlandagymnasiet , a high school in M\u00e4rsta , half an hour north of Stockholm , which offers remedial Swedish classes for immigrant students . On a recent morning , Ayaan Hassan Ali , a 16-year-old recently arrived from Somalia , was sitting in a modern classroom , with blue chairs and bright wood paneling on the walls . In one corner , there was a large flat-screen TV , in another , a map of the world , and in the back , a couple of bookshelves filled with dictionaries : Swedish-Arabic , Swedish-Russian , and Swedish-Tigrinya among them.\\n\\nAyaan spends almost every afternoon studying at home so she can come to class well prepared . After two months in school , she says she still has a hard time speaking Swedish , but her reading and writing have improved considerably . \u201cI want to be done with the language introduction by the end of this year , \u201d she said . Her aim is to earn a middle-school diploma as quickly as possible , so that she will be able to begin high school and eventually study engineering at a university . It is an ambitious plan . \u201cSome of them complete it in a year , \u201d said Veronica Suskic , the headmaster in charge of the introductory program . \u201cBut very few.\u201d\\n\\nAyaan\u2019s main challenge might not be her own motivation but her fellow students -- and a school system under strain from the steady arrival of new immigrants . Ayaan is one of only two girls in her class of about 20 . ( It\u2019s a number in constant flux , Ayaan\u2019s teacher , Thomas Engqvist , said , since new kids come all the time , while others \u201cmove , get deported , some just disappear.\u201d ) Many of the boys arrive to Sweden as unaccompanied minors , most of them from Afghanistan . The others in the class are from Albania , Eritrea , Kyrgyzstan , Poland , Somalia , and Tajikistan.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult environment in which to teach , \u201d Engqvist said . \u201cThe testosterone level is pretty high , and their level of education tends to vary a lot . And then we have the whole world in the class -- you get mini wars , conflicts that sometimes boil over.\u201d The situation shows no sign of letting up . With a wry smile , Engqvist quoted a colleague who said that , \u201cas long as there are wars in the world , we have a job.\u201d And there are always wars , he pointed out -- \u201cright now , in Syria.\u201d\\n\\nThat day , the class spent several hours reading aloud a simple text over and over . After they had finished , the teacher turned to the class to test them on vocabulary . \u201cModig , \u201d he asked , using the Swedish word for brave . \u201cDoes anyone know what modig means ? \u201d Silence . \u201cOkay , it\u2019s when you do something even though you\u2019re afraid to do it . Does anyone have an example of being modig ? \u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a small guy picks a fight with a big guy , \u201d one of the Afghan boys , 17-year-old Sadiq , said . Like most of the Afghanis in the class , Sadiq had arrived alone , after passing through some ten countries on the way . \u201cYes ! But he has to be afraid , \u201d the teacher said . \u201cOtherwise he\u2019s just stupid . Someone else ? \u201d\\n\\nAhmad , one of the Somali boys , tried telling a story about how he was fleeing his home in Somalia and crossed a river filled with crocodiles . But the gap between his halting Swedish vocabulary and the sheer horror he wished to express was too wide , and the teacher was unable to follow along . Instead , he asked , \u201cAyaan , is being modig something good ? \u201d Ayaan looked down into her book , thinking hard . \u201cYes , \u201d she said in her deep voice , a voice that makes her seem older than she actually is . \u201cFor example , when you dare to do a test even when you\u2019re afraid you will fail.\u201d She paused . \u201cOr when you speak up , even though you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\\n\\nLater in the day , the class had a discussion about jobs . Sadiq , the 17-year-old Afghan boy , asked me if being a journalist was a good job . After being told that becoming a lawyer or studying economics would be better if we wanted to make money , he nodded absent-mindedly . \u201cHow about welding ? Is that good ? \u201d It turned out that he\u2019d been a welder since the age of five . He looked proud . \u201cYou\u2019ll always have to build things , don\u2019t you ? \u201d",Uralic,Estonian
Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\nUntil the mid-1990s , the Sweden Democrats were a party of militant skinheads in black uniforms . Its xenophobic message is unchanged , but today the group presents itself as Sweden\u2019s only reliable guardian of the welfare state . A television ad released by the party for the 2010 elections depicts an ethnically Swedish retiree hobbling forward while a hoard of Muslim women in burqas greedily charge past to grab money from the national coffers . The choice , a voice-over explains , is to \u201ccut money from immigration budgets , or from pensions.\u201d \\n\\nThis messaging plays into the worries of many Swedes that the welfare state is increasingly fragile . Over the past two decades , the size of Sweden\u2019s welfare state has shrunk . Public spending has fallen from its peak of 67 percent of the GDP in 1993 to 52 percent today , as taxes have been cut quite drastically : as a percentage of the GDP , overall taxes have gone down from 51.4 percent in 2000 to 44.3 percent in 2012 . Both services and benefits have been cut -- most notably unemployment benefits -- and big parts of the welfare sector have been opened to private , profit-making companies . In international economic circles , this has been hailed as a new \u201cNordic model\u201d -- a lean but well-financed and still generous state . But for many Swedes , the cutbacks carry a clear sense of loss . And , increasingly , some Swedes seem inclined to blame immigrants for that feeling.\\n\\nIn the 2010 elections , the Sweden Democrats earned 5.7 percent of the vote , enough to enter parliament . Post-election surveys clearly showed that the party got most of its support from working-class male Swedes -- the group , apart from immigrants , hit hardest by the shrinking supply of low-skill jobs . Today , as the next general elections in September draw closer , most opinion polls show the Sweden Democrats at close to ten percent . A recent survey showed that about 30 percent of young male members of Landsorganisationen , Sweden\u2019s largest trade union , support the party . Thus far , the government has carefully avoided dealing with the party , and no one expects this to change after the coming elections . But as the party grows , the lure of the policies that the Sweden Democrats espouse clearly grows with it . \\n\\nUSING A MEGAPHONE\\n\\nRami Al-Khamisi is a fierce-looking young man , with close-cropped hair and a physique shaped by regular visits to the local gym . But he is no delinquent -- quite the opposite . He\u2019s in his second year as a law student at Stockholm University , and in recent years , an organization he helped found , Megafonen ( \u201cThe Megaphone\u201d ) , has emerged as one of the most notable community organizations in Stockholm\u2019s suburbs . Unlike the Swedes who think of immigrants as the cause of recent tensions rippling through Swedish society , Al-Khamisi blames the tax cuts , privatizations , and cutbacks to the welfare state.\\n\\nAs we walked through the neighborhood , Rami seemed to know pretty much everybody . Meeting some teenage boys hanging out in a doorway , Rami shook hands . \u201cWhat\u2019s up , \u201d he said . \u201cYou on your way to school ? \u201d ( It\u2019s a question with an uncertain answer : In Husby , 19 percent of the 15-year-olds don\u2019t have the grades to earn placement in high school . ) As we reached a footbridge near his building , Rami pointed to a low-slung yellow building with peeling paint and darkened windows . Inside , you could see furniture strewn about , like someone had left in a hurry.\\n\\n\u201cThis used to be the Yellow House , a place for kids to hang out , \u201d Rami said , peering through the broken blinds . \u201cIt\u2019s been closed for five , six years . There was another place as well , called the Barn , that closed ten years ago . They used to arrange all kinds of things . In the summer , we went out into the Stockholm archipelago , camping and stuff . In the winter , we went skiing in Fj\u00e4llen -- the mountains up north . Now , there\u2019s almost nothing.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cI think the politicians might understand that kids here need something to do , \u201d Rami continued . \u201cBut they don\u2019t live here , they don\u2019t know our reality , so they don\u2019t realize what it does to the neighborhood when they board up places like this . Most kids here don\u2019t have their own rooms ; they live six , seven people in a two- or three-bedroom apartment . So where do you hang out ? At McDonald\u2019s , feeling like a bum ? You know what happens ? They\u2019ll start looking for some action.\u201d \\n\\nListening to Rami , it is easy to get a dark view of Sweden\u2019s future . He sees -- as does the immigrant-turned-economist Sanandaji -- a whole generation of \u201clost kids\u201d in areas like Husby , boys with an immigrant background who are at risk of never truly becoming part of society . But that\u2019s not because they\u2019re not integrated into Swedish culture . \u201cMost of the kids who rioted were born here and speak no other language than Swedish , \u201d he said . \u201cSo what exactly should we integrate into ? \u201d\\n\\nWhat Rami sees instead is a generation that , lacking education and real jobs , feels excluded from the possibility of ever having a voice in Swedish society . \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say , but there are so many here that are already on the wrong path , \u201d he said . \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll take for the politicians to realize that the segregation you see here -- it\u2019s a problem for all people in Sweden . Because this is our country , too.\u201d \\n\\nAN IMMIGRANT COUNTRY \\n\\nThe politician in charge of trying to solve this peculiarly Swedish puzzle -- at least until the September elections -- is Erik Ullenhag , the integration minister . Since 2006 , the Swedish government has been a center-right coalition under conservative Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt . But the 41-year-old Ullenhag is a member of the Liberal Party , and his politics on immigration don\u2019t deviate from the Swedish establishment consensus that straddles both the left and the right and argues that the country\u2019s open immigration policies should be kept in place . In 2010 , after the Swedish Democrats earned a place in parliament , the Reinfeldt government made a point of agreeing to an immigration deal with the Green Party that guaranteed just that . \\n\\n\u201cWe deal with this differently than in most other European countries , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019s about showing political leadership . Instead of adjusting our policies to the Sweden Democrats , we stand up for being open and tolerant . We\u2019re a small and rich country ; we should take our share of responsibility in the world . And we think that if people who come here get jobs and become part of Swedish society , there is a lot of support for the idea that people should be able to continue coming to Sweden.\u201d \\n\\nUllenhag points to surveys showing that Swedes have become more positively inclined toward immigration in the past decade . And he insists that , in the medium term , there are clear economic benefits to immigration . \u201cIn 20 to 25 years , I think we will see a situation where this openness has been very good for Sweden , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019ll make us stronger in this globalized world.\u201d \\n\\nBut he admits that there are challenges -- above all , with education and jobs . \u201cThe big integration challenge is that too few of the recently arrived have jobs . And it\u2019s true that a lot of the simpler jobs have disappeared from the labor market in the past few decades . But we think other sectors , like the service sector , can fill these gaps.\u201d To that end , the government has put in place a number of reforms to ease entry to the job market -- Ullenhag points to tax subsidies to domestic services and a focus on vocational training in school . But so far , they don\u2019t seem to have put a serious dent in the high unemployment numbers.\\n\\nBut economics aside , Ullenhag admits that Swedish society will have a problem as long as Swedish citizens don\u2019t recognize that they need to alter their own sense of national identity . \u201cSweden is an immigrant country today , as much as the United States or Canada , \u201d he said . \u201cBut have we gotten used to it yet ? No , not really . This is still a country where many people who were born here identify themselves as immigrants . Which means you\u2019re not really part of society . That\u2019s the big challenge . We have to get better at coming together around a common future -- instead of focusing on where your mom and dad were born.\u201d",Uralic,Estonian

I am not saying that French companies are bad I just think that there should should be choice.\\nI am sure that it will hurt EU companies that operate outside of the EU because you can be sure that other countries will respond to that . Europe is not as powerful as it was in the 19th century so we can\\'t do anything without a response from the rest of the world.\\n",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Eastern and Central European defense industries could offer something if they got more funding as well . Poland for example has a defense industry but I am sure that France and Germany would be more prefered . I have a feeling that most of the funds will go to companies in Western Europe and everyone else has to buy from them in the future .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I hope that defense industries in Eastern and Central Europe get funds as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Depends if common budget and eurobonds ( common debt ) is the same thing . This needs more clarification .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Estonian GDP growth was 4.4 in the first quarter compared to last year . Check mate.\\nGood to see Baltic economies doing well .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,EU GDP is 16 trillion with UK .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,But as polls prove most of the Germans and French are not willing to help their NATO allies against Russia . So I think it will be exactly they same with the European Army . There is simply no will to help us who border Russia no matter which name the alliance is called .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,But were there less parties in the parliament or about same as today ? Or were right wing parties more similar than they are now ?,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,I have thought the same thing because things in Poland and Hungary are nowhere near as bad as some people try to show . It is impossible to compare these countries to Russia and Turkey and say things are as bad unless you really really want to belive that .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Wars have mostly started because of things happening in continental Europe so strong EU even if it has to be at the expense of UK is what we need .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Someone in the other thread said that he wants referendum on it and that his positions ( regarding reforms ) make ( intentionally ? ) negotiations with Germany impossible .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Well the wikipedia site that you linked says that soon it can .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Plus it will probably be useless force capable of doing nothing because it needs like one million summits to agree on doing anything .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Hopefully Latvia will recover soon .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Well that explains it .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,English is so widely used that Esperanto has no chance . English is the best common langauge and soon it will be neutral language because as we all know UK will be leaving the EU .

Heinsz7,europe,"There is only one thing that makes me sceptical when talking about renewable energy in Europe . It is that eventhough we produce more renewable energy then we actually use bascially as much coal as we did before . In Germany renewable energy is replacing nuclear energy not coal energy , that is not a very good thing in my opinion - it should replace coal energy . \\n\\nIt is important to note that it is not the percentage of energy produced by coal and fossil fuels that is hurting the environment but the amount of coal and fossil fuels that we burn and we should be more focused on the amount instead of percentages .",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Yes and US is just asking how are they going to reach 2 % by 2024 .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,If you look their military exercises like Zapad next one is in this september ) and Kavkaz then they think that such scenario will work in Eastern Europe . They have different plans for different regions and enemies.\\nSo what would your response be should scenario that I described above happen ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Kinda funny how everyone in Europe has portrayed USA as the one who wants to drop sanctions immediately ( and USA has gotten lots of hate for it ) but in reality it would be the EU that would drop these first because of MONEY .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Shows why Eastern European countries trust USA instead of Germany and Western Europe .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,But why should they pay for using my data ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,But Google does a lot more than just Google search so can you tax the entire profit ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I am not sure if it is America overspending or Europe underspending . European defense expenditures are at historical lowpoint at the moment .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Depends . I think when it comes to security and strategic interests there is more common with Poland than Germany .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Yes but not all advertising is in the same place . When you want to tax them by number of searches made you can logically tax them only for ads that are shown on Google search not in Youtube for example .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I could understand taxing company for something when I give them my money and get something in return . But this is not the case with data because data has no value itself .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,"For history French is obviously more important but if we talk about modern day Europe and how Juncker says that English is fading then the next most logical choice should be German .

Heinsz7,europe,I am not sure either but they have very strong conventional capabilites ( unrivaled in the world ) and they might use that .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Military spending works with inertia so even if you start to spend more now it may take more than a decade to even start to feel the effects of spending more . Effects of the European underfunding will reveal themselves in the future because we will now lag behind and this gap is not so easy to make up .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,The fact that there are no sanctions on the energy sector shows that the sanctions are not serious but just a face saving project because Europe had to do something about Ukraine . All that talk about how Russia is nothing but a big gas station ( most of the revenue comes from oil and gas ) and there are no sanctions on energy . Like what the heck .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,How do you know that ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,What are they sabotaging ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I read the article but I could spot anything about illegal sanctions nor sabbotage.\\nUSA set new sanctions on Russia and Germany and Austria got angry . USA opposing Nord Stream 2 is not illegal - many European countries oppose it as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It seems like other countries are not even invited to discuss .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,They are definitely brutal to look at and live in I imagine .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,The entire European Union renewable energy is half-arsed and doesn\\'t make any sense to be honest . Eventhough this sub posts lots about solar and wind power the fact is that most of the \ '' renewable energy\ '' in the European Union comes from burning wood ( pellets made from wood ) . I mean this worse than burning coal but at least we can feel good about ourselves . I\\ 'd like to see some real efforts instead of playing around with statistics .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It does increase CO2 levels in the short term ( 10-20 year perspective ) because removing the CO2 will take longer time than releasing it into the environment because another tree takes a long time to grow - a lot longer than burning it in seconds . Also by burning trees you reduce the amount of CO2 than trees can remove from the environment because there will be less trees.\\nFor the same amount of energy burning a tree releases more CO2 in to the environment than coal.\\n\\nBurning wood is not the sustainable solution because think about what happened if the whole world started to burn wood as its main renewable energy source . It would be catastrophic for the environment which ironicaly is the thing we want to save right now.\\nEuropean Union has acknowledged that burning wood is a loophole in the requirements and they will fix it eventually but it will take time because it will mess up all the renewable energy goals if they do it too soon.\\n\\nEDIT : World already has a deforestation problem as well so burning them for energy instead of coal is the last thing we should do . One is worse than the other.\\n,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,It is just a meeting . I mean Western European leaders have met with Trump also so not a big deal . To me it seems that media is trying to create a story here .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,"Why didn\\'t you quote the rest of the sentence ? I\\ 'll do it for you . \ '' As President Trump has made it clear , it is not suitable for the U.S. to maintain a disproportionate share of NATO\\ 's defense expenditures\ '' . To me it looks like a decent argument .",Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,6 months ( or 2 years for people over 50 ) seems very good to me .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,But there is enough LNG to not build Nord Stream 2 .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Or even seen one in real life .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Indeed . It is obvious that this is all about money . Why else would EU try to fine them % on global revenues not European revenues .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,To be honest the amount of people wanting Europe to become like China in terms of cencorship is frightening . Lately I have noticed very strong isolationist and authoritarian tendencies in this sub eventhough people supporting these things think of themselves as democratic and freedom supporting people .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I agree . They talk about education but they fall for left wing utopias all the time because they want to belive it so much .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,So you would choose Russia over all the countries that are between Germany and Russia . Again security of Eastern and Central Europe gets screwed by business interests .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Windows has better support for its systems as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I\\ 'd add that the argument \ '' get things done\ '' is usually used to support ideas of one party state and authoritarian rule .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Not so good for people living in Scandinavian countries and Baltics .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,What makes these sanctions illegal ? Is it illegal for USA to set sanctions on Russia . Like come on . It is perfectly legal for USA to fine companies that do business IN THE USA that try to get around their sanctions .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,At some point Merkel will start campaigning as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,"Yes and I came to conclusion that European soft power is soft ( I mean weak ) . Foreign students studying in Europe and people watching European clubs play football are not enough in my opinion for soft power .

Heinsz7,europe,Sanctions are always going to hurt both sides . European Union has a bigger economy than Russia so Europe should go for it .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Russia is like one of the biggest threats to EU memberstates ( many of them ) so the HQ can\\'t be in a random European Union state . Maybe Germany because it is in a central position of the EU . But unless EU \ '' military\ '' does nothing about Russia threat then it is a pointless thing that serves interests of only half of the Europe.\\n\\nEDIT : Also who cares what Russia thinks about it . I mean are we more concerned about building a united military that can defend all memberstates or caring about Russias feelings . Russia doesn\\'t give a sh*t about what their enemies think about them and neither does USA but we in Europe are concerned about feelings and sensitivities of our potential enemies ( I don\\'t mean USA as a potential enemy ) .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,They make money of advertisers advertising using their services not off data . Data just makes it easier for them to make money but I am sure that even without data collection they would still sell ads .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Even multiple countries could not afford it right now because defense expenditures are small in Europe and as you pointed out these projects are political . There is no reason for countries that do not participate in such programmes to buy these planes because they tend to be expensive .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,AlterEnglish is not using their services .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Public debt of my country is 10 % of GDP so I think you can understand me if I say that I would be nervous having common debt with countries that have entirely different ideas of spending ( budget deficits ) .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Playstore is an app too .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It means that both of the possible next chancellors of Germany are against eurobonds so this means that there will be no eurobonds . I like that .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,If it only benefits France and Germany then why should other countries follow ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Yes but what happens next ? This is not enough force to stop an attack and Europe is not strong enough to counter-attack and recapture lost territory .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,The number of people in Estonia believing in alternate medicines and witchcraft is just mindboggling to me .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,But there are countries like Sweden who have budget surplus and are having very good economic growth which means that budget deficits are not necessary for economic growth . Right policies and good business environment is what is needed not a lot of debt . Let private sector do the investing and loaning instead of public sector .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I have lost all my faith in the so called \ '' proper fiscal unification of the Eurozone\ '' because there are too many countries that don\\'t care about 3 % budget deficit and 60 % of GDP debt limits . \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t force Germany so much because it is starting to look like blackmailing in my opinion . Forcing Germany too much might break the current EU but it might not be bad after all . Maybe Northern European countries can make some kind of a trade and economic union with Germany in that case - because Northern European countries tend to have same views as Germany when it comes to economic and fiscal policies .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,So any predictions when will see the results ? 2035 ? 2040 ? 2045 ? .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,You can use it faster than forests are growing . The reason why this is even viable option right now is that only Europe is burning trees for energy on such scale but imagine what would happen if the entire world started doing so . We would run out of forests really fast because it takes only seconds to burn one but decades and decades to grow one . And it gives you spike because all the CO2 that tree has collected over the decades will be released in just seconds . \\nBurning trees is green as long as tree grows in 1s and removes the CO2 that has been released as fast as it was burnt - impossible .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Together with right to be forgotten this means that people could ask companies to delete information when they are barely even mentioned or any information that they feel hurts them in some way . Nonsense .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,No . It is a way out of it because gradually wages will increase and have increased so far . Poorer countries need to attract investments and it is one of the ways to do so .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I think that it is easier and more convenient for Facebook to block their services in Austria than to comply with this . Maybe they should do exactly that - would be interesting to see what happens .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Lately there have been many discussions in this subreddit about eurobonds and I remember it being said that now Schultz is against it too .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,This speech was only one part of the entire trip not the trip itself and the entire speech is available in youtube ( only 9 minutes ) and you can clearly see that most of the time everyone had very streight and casual faces . The only part of his speech that got reaction was when he talked about spending and this is nothing new - even Obama talked years about it but Trump just said it out directly when everyone was present .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,More like Macron alone . I think that Merkel would never say something like that .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,"European Union memberstates are accusing Germany of the same thing that USA does and when you tell these states to produce better things , instead of accusing Germany , you get downvoted in this sub .",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,How is better management and oversight going to fill warehouses with spare parts ? You need to order them .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Russia does care about Baltics because Russia can\\'t accept the fact that they have no control over Baltic countries eventhough they see Baltic countries as part of their \ '' near abroad\ '' .

Heinsz7,europe,That\\ 's what they want us to belive but unless the next step of efficiency is cutting wages then there is simply not enough money . Also I don\\'t know how creating more bureaucracy is going to increase efficiency to be honest because even with these central hq\\ 's and commands the national ones will remain . Spending efficiently is just a buzzword because it is not a new termin and everytime countries cut their military spending they say something about \ '' it\\ 's not how much you spend but how you spend\ '' \ '' more efficiency is the key\ '' but in reality military capabilites have deteriorated . There is no substitute to money . I am more than sure enough that joint EU defense policy will be used as an excuse to cut spending even more.\\n\\nEDIT : Sorry about multiple posts everybody .

Heinsz7,europe,Does anyone else besides English French speakes use French ? I think that everyone else is using English .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,They could learn but as of now German has the most speakers so if we have to switch now then German would be better choice . According to wikipedia table the advantage to German is like 30 million English speakers right now . But to be honest I would support English as the main language of the EU.\\n\\nEDIT : Also Germany is the most powerful country in Europe so that has to count something as well ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Considering how Russia talks constantly about how they are encircled by the world and that someone will try to attack them at any moment then I am not sure about who is really paranoid .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,My media is not saying that and I talked about how situation was when we had to send aid to Greece . Estonian pensions were then about 300 euros and now they are approaching 400 euros so you can see the difference . Also our unemployment benefits are around 120 euros a month which is clearly a lot less . You can understand from these facts why people were angry .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,"I\\ 'd like to improve Eurozone and I would not be against closer fiscal union but this would mean that we would have to implement very strict rules when it comes to budget deficits , public spending and everything fiscally related because countries would be a lot more dependent on others than they are now . This would also mean there there have to be punishments so if a country breaks even one rule then they should be thrown out immediately.\\n\\nAlso we can clearly see that European Union is going to move into direction where bigger countries get more power and smaller countries get less say than they have now . As you said \ '' tough luck because you are small\ '' indeed . I can say tough luck as well - can\\'t compete with Germany ? Tough luck.\\n\\nPer capita Estonia recieves more than Spain but by total amount not . Also Estonia is expected to become net contributor some time in 2020s so don\\'t worry .",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Germany is keep struggling countriea alive . If Germany leaves eurozone then I think most of the countries that have high debt and budget deficits would go bankrupt immediately because try loaning money with high interest rates . Germany does want to fix eurozone bur instead of throwing cash at the problem that makes the problem go away for a year or few they want to make sure that problems like this can never happen again . No one is entitled to Germanys money and if Germany gives it to other countries then Germany has right to set its conditions .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I think it seems a non-issue as well especially when thinking about future . Some people always talk about how we need basic income because robots are going to take most of our jobs and then some people say that we need more immigrants to do the jobs . Little contradicition there .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,I had no idea that we have place like this in Estonia . Besides trees it looks all so different.I wonder if it during flood or something .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Many people speak German Englishly outside of Germany as well . For example in Austria .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Good point . Also I would add that the problem with current immigration policy is that it overlooks the problem that the new immigrants will also get old one day and somebody has to take care of them as well . It is possible that they will start inviting more immigrants from 3rd world countries to take care of them as well . So immigration only offers short term solutions and postpones problems but makes the problems even worse in the long term .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Article says that they want Black Hawks that can be made locally . Black Hawks are definitely not inferior in my opinion because they are proven to be one of the best helicopters out there + jobs for locals if they are made locally . Seems like a good idea in my opinion . Also it helps strenghten defence cooperation with USA .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Next thing we have is that European productions have to move to USA to show movies there .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,The fighting part ( who gets factories ) is something that I would be afraid of as well because it could lead to many projects being cancelled .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,There are but they are token deployments . Here are like 1000 british soldiers in Estonia together with some French soldiers who will leave when Danes arrive + couple of hundred US soldiers . They all are here through NATO not EU .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It might be possible that I am biased as well because for example in Estonia and Latvia goverments imposed harsh austerity as soon as the crisis started which cut wages and goverment spending a lot . Also there were tax increases on people too . But it worked out well for us and now our countries have recovered and are doing well . I think that with austerity there is no middle ground - you do it or not - and in my opinion many countries that are struggling right now were initally too hesitant and wanted to make it gradually or spend their way out of it unsuccessfully .,Uralic,Estonian

Children , young and older , were offered musical entertainment by Taulide family band . Some of the posters had visible spelling errors , and fought over , some were written in uprintable expressions . People were brought to protest by bus free of charge - from every county.\\n\\nAfter greeting speeches both in estonian and Russian , Laikre Raimondo began singing , who praised the people - all those who stand for family values\\u200b\\u200b . For the wellfare of Russian-speaking people , Raimondo also sang in Russian.\\n\\nSubsequently , a spiritual Vello Salo came on stage , who read out a poem by Henrik Visnapuu.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaid SAPTK leader told the people that , because the politicians have remained deaf ears , thus the people protecting the traditional family had come to protest the Toompea . Cohabitation Law Adoption would actually be one step closer to gay marriage rights , he said . The adoption of the Law would affect all of us - families would be lumped together with gay relationship and It\\ 's unacceptable to Estonia society.\\n\\nWe assure that druing the parliament election time we will constantly remind people of who are the politicians who voted for the act , he said.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaiu\\ 's speech was interrupted continuously by cheers and applause .\\n\\nSAPTK Vooglaid Varro\\ 's CEO , said that the protest is the last chance for citizens to resist the union\\ 's efforts to push through a law against the will of the people and the family , and fundamentally reshape the meaning of marriage.\\n\\n\ '' This is our land and our country , where the people have supreme power .

He was also very just/fair and didn\\'t seem to abuse his power for personal gain , he was kind of happy with what he got and tried to take good care of it . \\n\\nMost monarchs , on the other hand , had a lot of really bad qualities if you read history and did a lot of really bad things , the fact he didn\\'t really have any bad qualities is great in itself ( this is why I liked Isabella and Philippe II a lot , it is great to read about people who have almost absolute power yet use it very well ) .\\n\\nIn terms of religious conflicts I agree that since he was a very devout Catholic he spent a lot of time trying to keep all his dominions under Catholicism , which was a mistake , since it was just delaying the inevitable , but this is not necessarily because of political reasons , but he genuinely believed Catholicism was the only true Christian religion.\\n\\nIn general both Isabel and Philippe were both very religious and did probably both go too far with their enforcement of it to their lands ( I\\ 'd say a major mistake for Isabel was also the enabling of the Inquisition , even though she didn\\'t really even support it , but rather everyone else around her were able to talk her into it and it seemed like a good idea to consolidate the monarchy ) .\\n\\nHowever , the flip side of it is that Spain stayed away from religious conflicts that plagued a lot of other Christian kingdoms of the time and thus was able to be a stronghold in terms of defending the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and expanding overseas .",Uralic,Estonian

Huehue777,europe,"1 ) Economies between many Western and Eastern EU countries is almost the same in purchasing power parity\\n\\n2 ) By this time EU has scrapped or heavily limited the amount of refugees it takes in . Many countries found out the hard way that it is extremely hard to integrate people from 3rd world muslim failed states . \\n\\nThis is why most Western/Nordic EU countries have a lot of American-style segregated societies/ghettos , filled with crime , unemployment , use of Arabic as main language , religious extremism and a deep hatred toward the English people.\\n\\nHowever immigration both illegal and legal will stay strong from African/Middle Eastern countries as migrants will continue to figure out different ways to get to EU , as Europe\\ 's standard of living will still continue to be so much higher than anywhere else around it.\\n\\n3 ) UK left the EU , some other countries considered leaving as well , but since there were no more referendums it didn\\'t happen . After the refugee crisis was solved and after another economic/debt crisis there was a time of stability , in which EU develops once more toward a federation , with the creation of an EU army as a major step forward.\\n\\n4 ) Since the economic differences were reduced between East and West , and since open borders have diminished the differences between EU people , there is more of a common sense of unity and it is now very common for Europeans to live/work/study in different EU countries and more people will begin to feel like \ '' Europeans\ '' in addition to their national identity.\\n\\n4 ) In Russia at one point Putin loses his power for one reason or the other , which creates massive chaos in the country , as there will be a huge struggle for power between the United Russia old guard , the oligarchs , the nationalists , the democracy-activists , the various regional separatists ( especially Chechnya and other Caucus muslim countries who will use this to break free from Russia ) and the communists . \\n\\nThis is why things turn from bad to worse in Russia and since Putin had destroyed virtually all democratic institutions there will be a major downfall in the economy and the overall functioning of the state . In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately . Also Turkey has become a bit more democratic , but is still very far away from joining EU.\\n\\n6 ) Estonia will be a very successful country by 2026 and its various start-ups have become quite big and well-known . Also , the 0 % corporate tax rate and the e-residency brought a lot of new companies ( +money ) and also immigrants to Estonia , which has helped push Estonia to have a very high GDP per capita PPP and in terms of quality of life it is on par or higher than other Western EU countries . Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia .

First off , it is difficult to understand , as to whether feminists even think that women should be having sex in the first place , because according to them it is an act in which the man is in a dominant position and a women in a submissive position , so the act must be frowned upon , probably at least according to some of the 3rd wave feminists.\\n\\nOK , whatever the feminist logic is toward sex , then comes the issue of when a woman is having sex on her free will . Well , the feminists can\\'t really stop that I guess , since most women actually love to have sex and find great pleasure from it . Yet , for some reason , if both people have decided on their free will that they want to have sex , it is OK , but if the man decides to gives some money for a mutual decision to have sex ( trafficking is illegal anyway everywhere in Europe and large social safety nets provide everyone with minimum living standards ) , then the man suddenly becomes a criminal ? ! \\n\\nI mean you can\\'t make this up and it is mind-boggling even to try to get into the brains of the 3rd wave feminists , but the logic seems to be getting lost somewhere here.\\n\\nIt is kind of the same as with the whole Gamergate thing imo . At one point feminists go about the streets naked and ask that they be able to walk without having to wear a shirt and extremely rarely also they raise a concern of women having to wear niqab\\ 's in muslim countries , but at the same time the same 3rd wave feminists get extremely angry , if a video games decides to create a female character , who shows some cleavage , which has forced most game developers to completely cover up the new characters now and so scared to EVER create a sexy character any more in fear of a 3rd wave feminist backlash ( e.g League of Legends ) .\\n\\nSo yes , probably wasted my time trying into the minds of 3rd wave feminists , but they and their new policies , which they are enforcing with social media smear campaigns , have become kind of a joke , especially taking into account that there is still massive discrimination against women in 3rd world countries going on , especially in muslim societies , but who care about women not being able to drive a car in Saudi Arabia or women getting whipped in Indonesia with a lash for walking in the streets without a male companion , if you have bigger problems like game devs releasing sexy video game characters .",Uralic,Estonian

If you don\\'t storage your food properly , you will have an infestation of vermin . You don\\'t blame the vermin for using an opportunity , you blame the careless one who let it happen to himself.\\n\\nSame goes for EU refugee policies . Our welfare countries plus very lax borders are like a giant neon sign saying , \ '' come here\ '' .

Ivar9,europe,Pretty sure the Russians have wanted to be under Russia the whole time . Long time before they even knew who Putin was . There is nothing we could have done in a couple of decades to change that . All we can do is continue building a better country and wait because time is on our side .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I think this racist comment was a Swedish joke to make fun of how my answer would be treated by some Swedish politicians .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,EU needs unified benefits by purchasing power and the same rules for getting your family members .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Lets everybody tell how other countries should be run . Lets not care how people actually living there want to decide .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,There is a clock ticking in Estonia as well . We are nowhere close to replacing old buildings . There will be a time when massive amounts of buildings will become too old at the same time .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,What i have heard is that Latvia is corrupt .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Pretty dumb article . The plan was for something like 2 years . Estonia has said all along that we start in the end of this year and the amount will be divided to two years .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Just the other day they showed an Albanian girl who has lived in Estonia for 3 years and she spoke Estonian without an accent . Also I have heard mormon missionaries speak Estonian after being here less than a year .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,History shows German side usually loses in the end .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Doubt it . We are already learning American . But German influence over other countries will definitely grow and German might become more popular again .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,Prices in Estonia are around 5 Euros . Cheaper ones can be found but they are much smaller than the ones I have had in Germany . Also I noticed that in Germany the meat is made of actual pieces of meat but here it is like some smooth ground meat or something .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I always wonder how can the kebabs in Germany cost so little . Cheaper and better tasting compared to Estonia .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,There are talks here quite often that we are also turning into a boring Nordic country .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,"Why insane ? I think Estonia has something similar with 40,000 members .",Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Estonia is a free country where you can choose to create a company and buy stuff from somewhere or sell somewhere . The government does not control these things . The numbers are so small because unfortunately it is very hard to work with Russia.\\ne . missing letter,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,I saw a couple of weeks ago on CNN an interview with Sarah Palin . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BpAhLbFAWAE,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,If the same thing happened here people would be angry that police let that person go instead of shooting him . Then if that person still gets asylum people would vote the super conservative party next elections .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,You can see Tallinn from the last picture . Too close for comfort .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,We have military training in the woods during winter and people sleep in tents .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Fun fact . Our president is/was American as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Yes these poor people are forced to learn the local language of the countries they occupied . Such discrimination .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,He wants Russia to be a global power .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Public WiFi is a nice thing but mobile data without roaming fees would be even better .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Sweden joining Nato would help defend Baltics a lot . They own quite a big portion of Baltic countries and it would be good for them to keep the money flowing .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Looks like a mast on top of it though .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Planning is definitely one of the best . Quite nice views from the towers as well .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Very positively . The only western ally that seems to understand our situation . When I play online with Americans they often asked sort of worriedly how they are viewed in my country because they seem to think that all of Europe hates them .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Is it some crappy band that tries to sell their CD in car park to raise money for US trip to make it big there ? We have had a few of those and none have made it big this way . I guess they just buy beer with the money .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,100 per country on rotation ? This would mean that in some years there are thousands of british troops who have some training when it comes to fighting in our nature and climate . So they are actually able to send trained troops here when real danger arises . I would like to thank our allies for doing this . Hope we can be good hosts and they will have a good time here .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Yeah that was really good . Both sexes were equally carless .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Russia never attacks other countries . Largest land area just heppened somehow . Not aggressive expansionist at all .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I hate it when Germans in my company say we will do something week 36 . I have no clue . Should I start counting from the start of the year to figure out when week 36 is ? I usually just ignore this info and wait for it to be put in the shared calendar .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Born in the Soviet Union . People were more helpful to each other I think . Everyone was equally poor . Few people had a car . Most lived in a commieblock . In school there was a compulsory potato picking for the older classes . We had a picture of Stalin in our school books . Some goods were not available in stores but were there for people with connections and for favors . No supermarkets and very few stores compared to nowadays .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,There have been 0 cases like that in Estonia .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Food costs pretty much the same . Western-Europe has same products with better ingredients . Clothes are cheaper in Germany . Street food like kebab has the same price but you can find better kebab in Germany . So at least in Estonia it is not much cheaper . Just less money to spend .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,We have more land than Denmark .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,You guys steal our cars and build these ugly Maxima stores here . On the positive side you do sell us LNG gas .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I was wondering why some people try to get to Finland through Denmark . Baltics were just not on their guide .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Same for Finnish people in Tallinn . They look like they have done a lot of business in our alcohol stores .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Had a black couchsurfer once . Went to maxima to buy some beer and the cashier went crazy when my guest wanted to give some money to her hand . Like she would get a disease or something . Then later we went to bars and I was told to take my monkey and leave or they would beat us up . All this happened before this refugee crisis that has made more people crazy . So yeah Estonia is racist . Only solution I see is getting more different people here to make people more used having them . Abusing allies and tourists is the worst . How stupid can you be ?,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,In Estonia the buttons work but they produce no different result from not pressing the button .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I worked with 2 Indians from different parts of India and they barely spoke English . I think the local languages are very strong there .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Why Lol k ? Only 10 % of Indians speak English .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,You guys either have much better Maximas or way worse Rimis . Maximas in Estonia are ugly and shitty with soviet mentality workers . Would never choose Maxima over Rimi .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,Who needs this expertise and experts anyway .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Our media does not cover him too much . There have been news on what the current state of the Republicans are but that is it . What do I think of him ? I think he would sell us to Russia unlike Bush who actually made a trip here before he started running for president .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,But you said that larger countries are closer to 2 % than smaller ones . Now you are talking about total amount available for defense .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,We can corrupt them . There was a some guy yelling \ '' As-salamu alaykum\ '' in Helsinki with a beer can in his hand .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I think they do want a unified Europe but it must be a very close ally not a competitor to them . This would mean treaties that favor the US a bit more and keep them in charge of things more or less .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,People that fled from Crimea to Estonia would disagree.\\n,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Estonia is pretty empty and not growing . Regarding your credit comment . Everything costs how much people are willing to pay and people are willing to take 30-40 years of credit to buy . I have heard you can take a home loan for 60 years in Sweden .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Our biggest parliament party won the last elections with the slogan \ '' New nordic country\ '',Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I guess that is the reason why more people from Russia are actually moving to Estonia .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,Things have actually improved a lot since soviet union . The area where they produced electricity was very polluted .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,If Putin had been friendly to the Baltics in the beginning he would have had much stronger support and influence here . I think people liked this tough guy thing but not when he is against you . This was a strategical error and they are now trying to get influence with some political parties . I think in Latvia they are quite successful . Here they only have Tallinn but support for Keskerakond and EKRE has risen and the next parliamentary elections are quite important .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Greece is still an island when it comes to Schengen .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,They just stopped mindless bloodshed under Khrushchev . Stalin as an icon on posters and books still remained . We also had statues of Lenin everywhere .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,He could claim Estonian citizenship and get it if he wanted .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Bad haircut .,Uralic,Estonian

Ivar9,europe,English is enough to move here .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Center party has a very different platform from Putin . Closest to Putin is EKRE .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I think it is the other way around . Alex Jones is spreading the Russian views and lies .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I would argue that we should also use the army for offensive missions as well . This really helps the army be more efficient and develop much better . Also makes EU stronger in foreign relations .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Estonia is also very homo . Please do not come .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,I think it all depends on what school they went to . When they went to an Estonian school they are usually well integrated . Russian schools on the other hand produce Russians that are still quite like their immigrant parents .,Uralic,Estonian
Ivar9,europe,Western capital has made a killing in the EE .,Uralic,Estonian
