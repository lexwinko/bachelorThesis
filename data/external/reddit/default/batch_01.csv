AnExplosiveMonkey,europe,"The short answer is \ '' Why *not* let gay people get married . Sure , you could make the argument that no kids will actually come from it , but the same could be said of elderly or infertile couples , and you don\\'t see anyone saying \ '' *Well* , do they really *need* the right to vote ? \ '' .",Germanic,English
AnExplosiveMonkey,europe,"& gt ; 1 ) You\\ 're presuming that gay people want to get married though . I\\ 'm unsure why gay people would want to get married anymore than straight people , and the latter have been increasingly looking down on marriage - especially the youth.\\n\\nAlready answered \ '' Tax credits , adoption rights , inheritance , next of kin , visitation rights , etc.\ '' \\n\\n & gt ; 2 ) civil unions and cohabitation are valid forms of marriage that don\\'t require the government to tell religions what to do ; the majority of Hindu/Buddhist Asia has split the idea of marriage and legal-marriage.\\n\\nRight , again , you can make a perfectly valid argument against the government being involved in marriage at all , but until the day when that gets resolved , do you propose just leaving out gay people altogether ? Also , do you acknowledge that cohabitation is less than marriage ? \\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) You\\ 're presuming that government has a right to say what a church can do . The definition of marriage can vary from organisation to organisation . If a priest doesn\\'t want to marry a homosexual couple , then why should he be forced to ? \\n\\nWhere ? Where did I do this ? Show me.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying a priest should be forced to do anything . I\\ 'm saying if the priest is *also* willing , where is the problem ? \\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) And you\\ 're focusing on Christianity . I presume that you don\\'t think marriage is backwards and that Christianity is an integral aspect of European culture . In that case , it\\ 's not a gay right , but rather an issue for Christians.\\n\\nI\\ 'm focusing on Christianity because Ireland is predominantly Christian , and the Catholic Church has historically had a significant presence in the laws of this country .

I feel like you\\ 're trying to disagree with me for the sake of disagreeing with me.\\n\\n & gt ; 2 ) the two are completely possible throughout most of Europe . \\n\\nRight , but until the legislative battle finishes to hypothetically transition over to that , why not let gay people get married ? \\n\\n & gt ; And how is it less than marriage ? marriage doesn\\'t equate to love , and marriage is more commonly being seen as a regressive burden.\\n\\nDid you check the link I gave you a few comments back ? There are many differences between the two . That is not up for debate . \\n\\nHere\\ 's a sample \\n\\n & gt ; And yet some very important inequalities remain . For example , Civil Partnership : \\n\\n - does not permit children to have a legally recognised relationship with their parents - only the biological one . This causes all sorts of practical problems for hundreds of families with schools and hospitals as well as around guardianship , access and custody . In the worst case , it could mean that a child is taken away from a parent and put into care on the death of the biological parent.\\n\\n - does not recognise same sex couples\\ ' rights to many social supports that may be needed in hardship situations and may literally leave a loved one out in the cold.\\n\\n - defines the home of civil partners as a \ '' shared home\ '' , rather than a \ '' family home\ '' , as is the case for married couples .

Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Germany ) , Mussolini ( Italy ) , Franco ( Spain ) , Suharto ( Indonesia ) and several Latin American regimes . Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each : \\n\\n & gt ; **1 . Powerful and Continuing Nationalism** - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . Flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\\n\\n & gt ; **2 . Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \ '' need.\ '' The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc.\\n\\n & gt ; **3 . Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists , terrorists , etc.\\n \\n & gt ; **4 . Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\\n\\n & gt ; **5 . Rampant Sexism** - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid . Divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\\n\\n & gt ; **6 . Controlled Mass Media** - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . Censorship , especially in war time , is very common.\\n\\n & gt ; **7 . Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\\n8 . Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed\\nto the government\\ 's policies or actions.\\n\\n & gt ; **9 . Corporate Power is Protected** - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\\n\\n & gt ; **10 . Labor Power is Suppressed** - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed.\\n\\n & gt ; **11 . Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested . Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\\n\\n & gt ; **12 . Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\\n\\n & gt ; **13 . Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; **14 . Fraudulent Elections** - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham . Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates , use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and manipulation of the media . Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections .",Germanic,English

AstroAgama,europe,"Paywall , text : \\n\\n & gt ; European leaders are preparing to recognise the potential for a united Ireland\u201d within the EU , confirming that Northern Ireland would seamlessly rejoin the bloc after Brexit in the event of a vote for Irish reunification . In a step that may stoke concerns in Britain that Brexit could hasten the fragmentation of the UK , diplomats are planning to ask leaders of the EU\u2019s 27 post-Brexit member countries to endorse the idea in a summit on Saturday . It would allow the province to follow the example of German reunification in 1990 and reflect the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , which ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland . The agreement allows a referendum on reuniting Ireland where there is reason to believe a majority in the province is in favour.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Britain and Ireland are committed to upholding the Good Friday Agreement as co-guarantors . But the increased talk of Irish reunification will reinforce the fears of those in Britain who believe & gt ; Brexit will bolster those championing a UK break-up . Nicola Sturgeon , Scotland\u2019s first minister , has already called for a Scottish independence referendum within two years , as Britain\u2019s departure from the union is finalised . Saturday\u2019s gathering in Brussels will mark the formal adoption of EU guidelines for Brexit talks with the UK , staking out a tough opening stance with a common front on issues such as Gibraltar , ? & gt ; Northern Ireland and the rights of EU migrants.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Britain on Thursday not to harbour illusions about the bloc\u2019s resolve . \u201cI have to put it in such clear terms because unfortunately I have the feeling that some in Britain still have illusions , \u201d Ms Merkel told the Bundestag . \u201cBut that would be a waste of time.\u201d No final decision has been taken on a specific text on Irish unity . It would be part of accompanying documents to the guidelines for Saturday\u2019s summit , because it is seen as a clarification of law rather than something to be negotiated in Europe\u2019s talks with Britain.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Officials warned that a reference to the idea could still be excluded because of the acute sensitivity around independence questions in Scotland and Catalonia in Spain . EU27 ambassadors were first told of the plan at a meeting on Wednesday but Donald Tusk , European Council president , has yet to share a text , which was suggested by Dublin . Enda Kenny has pushed for a \u201cunited Ireland\u201d reference in the final Brexit treaty that will confirm the UK\u2019s exit , but an EU statement at the outset of talks would be seen as a diplomatic coup as he prepares to step down as taoiseach \u2014 prime minister \u2014 after six years . Advocates of the reference to Northern Ireland and reunification say the reference simply reflects the Good Friday pact , signed long before Brexit was anticipated . But it would still send a powerful signal at a sensitive moment in the politics of the island.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Under pressure to hand power to a younger generation , Mr Kenny has said he will make his intentions for his political future clear once the \u201cground rules for Brexit\u201d are set . This has fuelled expectations that he will step down within weeks , setting in motion a contest for the leadership of his centre-right Fine Gael party . Ireland is the most exposed of the EU\u2019s remaining member states to Brexit . Dublin is desperate to avoid a clean break between the UK and the EU , which could severely damage Irish-British trade that runs to \u20ac1.2bn a week . But it also wants to be seen to play a full part in the negotiations on the EU side . \u201cWe will not be a proxy for the British in the exit negotiations , \u201d Irish foreign minister Charlie Flanagan told the Financial Times in an interview .",Germanic,English

We are the heirs to a powerfully attractive doctrine for living which attracts talent and creates envy in the rest ( when was the last time an important white physicist from Harvard fled America for the safety of Iraq ? ) . The west is wealthy , its vision of morality is clear and fairly consistent , and besides that we have military and religious organisations which support that vision and which are fully capable of taking care of themselves . That strength is why the West can and does handwave differences inside their populations - out of a kind of arrogant confidence that in the long run it doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\nNo , the dude in white is dangerous to those other Muslims . He\\ 's a frog hopping and croaking in the breeze with regards to how much hurt he can actually bring to western values , but he creates enough noise that he seems bigger than he is . It obscures the way not all Muslims are like him , and that those who are generally have other issues aside from their religious beliefs driving them forward . You can tell the other moderate Muslims on this panel know it as well - the woman esp absolutely pwns him , shutting him down at every opportunity .

My_usrname_of_choice,europe,"& gt ; Using an explosive device onboard a civilian boat in a countries harbour is the very definition of terrorism . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not any definition of terrorism.\\n\\n & gt ; Sabotage is when you physically damage or disable something so that it does not work as intended ( eg cut the ignition wire ) . \\n\\nExcuse me , how does blowing up a boat not fit that description ? \\n\\n & gt ; Terrorism is the use of external force ( eg explosive device ) to create fear or to intimidate for political gains ( ie to prevent a protest ) .\\n\\nNo .

For $ 10,000 , someone who was otherwise stateless could become a Tongan Protected Person ( T.P.P . ) and carry a Tonga passport , which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except Tonga , where a T.P.P . was forbidden to settle.\\n\\nWhen some countries rejected the validity of these passports , the King was informed and a new Tongan passport went on sale for $ 20,000 ( or $ 35,000 for a family of four ) . This gave the holder Tongan nationality and a right to settle . South Africans and Libyans as well as hundreds of Hong Kong Chinese were quick to snap up these passports . Imelda Marcos bought one , and in the process became a Tongan citizen . In the past seven years this has produced $ 30 million for Tonga as well as a constitutional crisis .

We go to a hui ( meeting ) at the Marae ( meeting house and surrounding land ) . We go to tangis ( funerals ) and we perform a haka ( war dance/challenge ) . I wouldn\\'t call a Maori object sacred/forbidden , I would call it Tapu.\\n\\nOrdinarily , Pakeha don\\'t use things when there\\ 's nothing of Maori relevance , as that\\ 'd come off as weird .

But it\\ 's a growing trend . Now it\\ 's taught frequently in schools , so most kids know a few words of it and more and more can pronounce the words properly ( rolling r\\ 's is an art ) .\\n\\nWe have two national anthems , an English and a Maori , and the Maori is not a translation , it has its own meaning.\\n\\nI am of course a bit biased , as I went to a primarily Maori school ( very nearly the only Pakeha there ) , so we learned more Maori than the average child.\\n\\nI guess the main difference there is , we\\ 're using it contextually .

oreography,europe,"Contrary to your assumption , most people know about the Islamic Golden age and the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols . However , the point is that Islamic societies as a scientific and cultural force never recovered after that . The Ottomans became the core Political power in the political power in the islamic world and the seat of the caliphate , in which scholasticism and scientific pursuits regressed in comparison to Europe . \\n\\nAnd yet the Golden Age did not promote secularism or other humanistic values , nor did it discourage the practice of taxing dhimmi and treating their non muslim population disproportionately worse . It was not an equal society . My point was that Religious freedom in Europe was a twofold process - The Reformation provided an alterEnglish to Catholicism , and The Enlightenment and the secular principles it generated for governing the realms allowed the expression of differing ideas and religious practices . Any secularism that exists in Islamic nations today , exists through European occupation or influence . The muslim world did not have an autogenic reform like in Europe . \\n\\nNo , you\\ 're right on this point . The Ottomans were no worse than many other empires . However this doesn\\'t excuse the suffering that the population of Balkan nations underwent . Today , Turkey not only ignores ethnic cleansing of three ethnic groups , but also is hostile to their former colonial subjects like the Greeks . Europeans have long apologized for the faults of their colonial endeavours , but because of Caliphatism and nationalism , it seems muslim turks aren\\'t going to apologize for forcing their faith on christian communities . \\n\\nAnd yet you\\ 're not disputing the fact that it was only under the oppression of the Ottoman Empire that caused Europeans to convert to Islam . There was no history of Islam in France , Italy , Germany , Scandinavia , Britain or a majority of other European countries before Colonialism . We willingly imported islam to our countries , the same can not be said about islam to the Balkan nations.\\n\\nI have no hostility to immigrants , so long as they adapt to the culture of their host countries and arrive in them by legal means . This is expected of migrants in every country , except it seems for Europe . Stereotyping my disregard for Islam as \ '' Evil Brown People\ '' is a character accusation with zero grounding . Why can you not divorce the fact that islam is not tied to one ethnicity , and critique the faults of the religion based on its merits , like you can with any other ideology . Christianity has more African and South American followers as it does Europeans , but I doubt you would call it a religion of \ '' Brown People\ '' . The fact is that is that these migrants are coming to Europe illegally , they have little to zero education , and they hold attitudes and a religion that is fundamentally hostile to the west .",Germanic,English

oreography,europe,"Contents Posted Below as behind a Paywall . \\n\\n & gt ; **EUROPE SIGNS ITS OWN DEATH WARRANT**\\n\\n & gt ; **With the continent wrestling with mass immigration and losing faith in its traditions and beliefs , its civilisation faces collapse**\\n\\n & gt ; Europe is committing suicide . Or at least its leaders have decided to commit suicide . Whether the European people choose to go along with this is , naturally , another matter . When I say that Europe is in the process of killing itself , I do not mean that the burden of European Commission regulation has become overbearing or that the European Convention on Human Rights has not done enough to satisfy the demands of a particular community.\\n\\n & gt ; I mean that the civilisation we know as Europe is in the process of committing suicide and that neither Britain nor any other western European country can avoid that fate , because we all appear to suffer from the same symptoms and maladies.\\n\\n & gt ; As a result , by the end of the lifespans of most people currently alive , Europe will not be Europe and the peoples of Europe will have lost the only place in the world we had to call home.\\n\\n & gt ; Europe today has little desire to reproduce itself , fight for itself or even take its own side in an argument . Those in power seem persuaded that it would not matter if the people and culture of Europe were lost to the world.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no single cause of the present sickness . The culture produced by the tributaries of Judaeo-Christian culture , the ancient Greeks and Romans , and the discoveries of the Enlightenment has not been levelled by nothing . But the final act has come about because of two simultaneous concatenations \u2014 sets of linked events \u2014 from which it is now all but impossible to recover.\\n\\n & gt ; The first is the mass movement of peoples into Europe . In all western European countries this process began after the Second World War due to labour shortages . Soon Europe got hooked on the migration and could not stop the flow even if it had wanted to.\\n\\n & gt ; The result was that what had been Europe \u2014 the home of the European peoples \u2014 gradually became a home for the entire world . The places that had been European gradually became somewhere else.\\n\\n & gt ; All the time Europeans found ways to pretend this influx could work . By pretending , for instance , that such immigration was normal . Or that if integration did not happen with the first generation then it might happen with their children , grandchildren or another generation yet to come . Or that it didn\u2019t matter whether people integrated or not.\\n\\n & gt ; All the time we waved away the greater likelihood that it just wouldn\u2019t work . This is a conclusion that the migration crisis of recent years has simply accelerated.\\n\\n & gt ; Which brings me to the second concatenation . For even the mass movement of millions of people into Europe would not sound such a final note for the continent were it not for the fact that ( coincidentally or otherwise ) at the same time Europe lost faith in its beliefs , traditions and legitimacy.\\n\\n & gt ; More than any other continent or culture in the world today , Europe is deeply weighed down with guilt for its past . Alongside this outgoing version of self-distrust runs a more introverted version of the same guilt . For there is also the problem in Europe of an existential tiredness and a feeling that perhaps for Europe the story has run out and a new story must be allowed to begin.\\n\\n & gt ; Mass immigration \u2014 the replacement of large parts of the European populations by other people \u2014 is one way in which this new story has been imagined : a change , we seemed to think , was as good as a rest . Such existential civilisational tiredness is not a uniquely modern European phenomenon , but the fact that a society should feel like it has run out of steam at precisely the moment when a new society has begun to move in can not help but lead to vast , epochal changes.\\n\\n & gt ; Had it been possible to discuss these matters , some solution might have been possible . Looking back , it is remarkable how restricted we made our discussion , even while we opened our home to the world.\\n\\n & gt ; A thousand years ago the peoples of Genoa and Florence were not as intermingled as they now are , but today they are all recognisably Italian , and tribal differences have tended to lessen rather than grow with time.\\n\\n & gt ; The current thinking appears to be that at some stage in the years ahead the peoples of Eritrea and Afghanistan too will be intermingled within Europe as the Genoans and Florentines are now melded into Italy . The skin colour of individuals from Eritrea and Afghanistan may be different , their ethnic origins may be further afield , but Europe will still be Europe and its people will continue to mingle in the spirit of Voltaire and St Paul , Dante , Goethe and Bach.\\n\\n & gt ; As with so many popular delusions , there is something in this . The nature of Europe has always shifted and \u2014 as trading cities such as Venice show \u2014 has included a grand and uncommon receptiveness to foreign ideas and influence . From the ancient Greeks and Romans onwards , the peoples of Europe sent out ships to scour the world and report back on what they found . Rarely , if ever , did the rest of the world return their curiosity in kind , but nevertheless the ships went out and returned with tales and discoveries that melded into the air of Europe . The receptivity was prodigious : it was not , however , boundless.\\n\\n & gt ; The question of where the boundaries of the culture lay is endlessly argued over by anthropologists and can not be solved . But there were boundaries . Europe was never , for instance , a continent of Islam . Yet the awareness that our culture is constantly , subtly changing has deep European roots . We know that the Greeks today are not the same people as the ancient Greeks . We know that the English are not the same today as they were a millennium ago , nor the French the French . And yet they are recognisably Greek , English and French and all are European.\\n\\n & gt ; In these and other identities we recognise a degree of cultural succession : a tradition that remains with certain qualities ( positive as well as negative ) , customs and behaviours . We recognise the great movements of the Normans , Franks and Gauls brought about great changes . And we know from history that some movements affect a culture relatively little in the long term , whereas others can change it irrevocably.\\n\\n & gt ; The problem comes not with an acceptance of change , but with the knowledge that when those changes come too fast or are too different we become something else , including something we may never have wanted to be.\\n\\n & gt ; At the same time we are confused over how this is meant to work . While generally agreeing that it is possible for an individual to absorb a particular culture ( given the right degree of enthusiasm both from the individual and the culture ) whatever their skin colour , we know that we Europeans can not become whatever we like . We can not become Indian or Chinese , for instance . And yet we are expected to believe that anyone in the world can move to Europe and become European.\\n\\n & gt ; If being \u201cEuropean\u201d is not about race , then it is even more imperative that it is about \u201cvalues\u201d . This is what makes the question \u201cWhat are European values ? \u201d so important . Yet this is another debate about which we are wholly confused.\\n\\n & gt ; Are we , for instance , Christian ? In the 2000s this debate had a focal point in the row over the wording of the new EU constitution and the absence of any mention of the continent\u2019s Christian heritage . The debate not only divided Europe geographically and politically , it also pointed to a glaring aspiration.\\n\\n & gt ; For religion had not only retreated in western Europe . In its wake there arose a desire to demonstrate that in the 21st century Europe had a self-supporting structure of rights , laws and institutions that could exist even without the source that had arguably given them life.\\n\\n & gt ; In the place of religion came the ever-inflating language of \u201chuman rights\u201d ( itself a concept of Christian origin ) . We left unresolved the question of whether or not our acquired rights were reliant on beliefs that the continent had ceased to hold , or whether they existed of their own accord . This was , at the very least , an extremely big question to have left unresolved while vast new populations were being expected to \u201cintegrate\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; An equally significant question erupted at the time around the position and purpose of the nation state . From the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 up to the late 20th century the nation state in Europe had generally been regarded not only as the best guarantor of constitutional order and liberal rights but the ultimate guarantor of peace.\\n\\n & gt ; Yet this certainty also eroded . European figures such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in 1996 insisted that \u201cThe nation state . . . can not solve the great problems of the 21st century.\u201d Disintegration of the nation states of Europe into one large integrated political union was so important , Kohl insisted , that it was in fact \u201ca question of war and peace in the 21st century\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; Others disagreed , and 20 years later just over half of British people who voted in the EU referendum demonstrated that they were unpersuaded by Kohl\u2019s argument . But , once again , whatever one\u2019s views on the matter , this was a huge question to leave unresolved at a time of vast population change.\\n\\n & gt ; While unsure of ourselves at home , we made final efforts at extending our values abroad . Yet whenever our governments and armies got involved in anything in the name of these \u201chuman rights\u201d \u2014 Iraq in 2003 , Libya in 2011 \u2014 we seemed to make things worse and ended up in the wrong . When the Syrian civil war began , people cried for western nations to intervene in the name of the human rights that were undoubtedly being violated . But there was no appetite to protect such rights because whether or not we believed in them at home , we had certainly lost faith in an ability to advance them abroad .",Germanic,English
oreography,europe,"& gt ; **CONTINUED **\\n\\n & gt ; At some stage it began to seem possible that what had been called \u201cthe last utopia\u201d \u2014 the first universal system that divorced the rights of man from the say of gods or tyrants \u2014 might comprise a final failed European aspiration . If that is indeed the case , then it leaves Europeans in the 21st century without any unifying idea capable of ordering the present or approaching the future.\\n\\n & gt ; At any time the loss of all unifying stories about our past or ideas about what to do with our present or future would be a serious conundrum . But during a time of momentous societal change and upheaval the results are proving fatal . The world is coming into Europe at precisely the moment that Europe has lost sight of what it is . And while the movement of millions of people from other cultures into a strong and assertive culture might have worked , the movement of millions of people into a guilty , jaded and dying culture can not .\\n\\n & gt ; Even now Europe\u2019s leaders talk of an invigorated effort to incorporate the millions of new arrivals . These efforts too will fail . If Europe is going to become a home for the world , it must search for a definition of itself that is wide enough to encompass the world . This means that in the period before this aspiration collapses our values become so wide as to become meaninglessly shallow.\\n\\n & gt ; So whereas European identity in the past could be attributed to highly specific , not to mention philosophically and historically deep foundations ( the rule of law , the ethics derived from the continent\u2019s history and philosophy ) , today the ethics and beliefs of Europe \u2014 indeed the identity and ideology of Europe \u2014 have become about \u201crespect\u201d , \u201ctolerance\u201d and ( most self-abnegating of all ) \u201cdiversity\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; Such shallow self-definitions may get us through a few more years , but they have no chance at all of being able to call on the deeper loyalties that societies must be able to reach if they are going to survive for long.\\n\\n & gt ; This is just one reason why it is likely that our European culture , which has lasted all these centuries and shared with the world such heights of human achievement , will not survive.\\n\\n & gt ; As recent elections in Austria and the rise of AlterEnglish for Germany seem to prove , while the likelihood of cultural erosion remains irresistible , the options for cultural defence continue to be unacceptable . Even after the tumultuous years they have just had , the French electorate go to the polls next weekend to choose between more of a disastrous status quo or a member of the Le Pen family.\\n\\n & gt ; And all the time the flow into Europe continues . Over the Easter weekend alone European naval vessels collected more than 8,000 African migrants from the seas around Italy and brought them into Europe . Such a flow \u2014 which used to be unusual \u2014 is now routine , apparently unstoppable and also endless.\\n\\n & gt ; In The World of Yesterday , published in 1942 , the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig wrote that in the years leading up to the Second World War , \u201cI felt that Europe , in its state of derangement , had passed its own death sentence.\u201d Only his timing was out . It would take several more decades before that death sentence was carried out \u2014 by ourselves on ourselves.\\n\\n & gt ; \u00a9 Douglas Murray 2017\\n\\n & gt ; Extracted from The Strange Death of Europe by Douglas Murray , which will be published by Bloomsbury on Thursday at \u00a318.99\\n\\n",Germanic,English
