Not just immigrants to Slovenia , but people who live in those countries . Serb in Serbia and Serb in Slovenia are both \u010cefur for Slovenians . \\n\\nNo , this is simply not true . A Serb living in Serbia is a Serb . Infact it\\ 's the other way around ... It\\ 's the Slovene Serbs who don\\'t really fit in when they visit family in Serbia . There\\ 's a saying among them here : \ '' Bolje \u010defur v Ljubljani nego Janez v Bosni.\ '' ( Better a \u010cefur in Ljubljana than Janez in Bosnia . ) \\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; And that word \ '' \u010cefur\ '' came from the derogatory Slovenian term for Jews \ '' \u010civut\ '' . So for Slovenians , all people East of them are Jews , and that\\ 's an insult in Slovenia.\\n\\nOkay , this isn\\'t really true either . The word \u010cefur is used exclusively for Slavic immigrants from other republics of the former Yugoslavia . No one else . And the fact it comes from the Turkish word for a jew doesn\\'t really mean anyone is being called a \\'Jew\\ ' , whatever that means . I\\ 've never heard anyone call anyone a \u010divut.\\n\\nAlso -- The younger generation have taken up the name \u010defur as their own . They reffer to eachother as such .

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"we don\\'t have your high school , but we do have the gymnasium ( not to be confused with the German one ) that teaches general knowledge at a higher level than \ '' trade schools\ '' of sorts which still teach general knowledge but also have classes directed at various trades . Gymnasium lasts for 4 years and trade schools from 3 to 4 , usually from when you\\ 're 14 to 18 ( if you are born before June ) .\\n\\n1 . we grade 1-5 with 5 being best and 1 meaning failure , IIRC 0 - 49 % = 1 , \\n50-62 % = 2 , \\n63-75 % = 3 , \\n76-89 % = 4 , \\n90-100 % = 5 and it varies between schools and teachers a bit anyway.. grades are given for tests and oral examination and then averaged into semester grades which then average into the overall grade for the year of the subject . At the end of gymnasium is the all-encompassing Matura exam that is separate and independent from the grades of all 4 years.\\n\\n2 . In average you\\ 'd have 6 or 7 class hours in a day , one class hour being 45 minutes . That doesn\\'t equal 6 to 7 subjects in a day since some took up two class hours at a time . There are many subjects ( classes ? ) . You don\\'t take all subjects in all years , or even all semesters . *DISCLAIMER : from here on only counts for the school I attended . * From my days in gymnasium , 1st year I remember : Maths , Slovene , English , German ( some classes had French or Spanish or Italian , depends on what you picked when you enrolled ) , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Music , Geography , Physical Education , Computer Science , History . But Music and CS would stop after year 1 , in 2nd year you\\ 'd get Sociology ( only 2nd year ) , and in 3rd year you\\ 'd get Psychology ( only 3rd year ) and in 4th Philosophy . You also have obligatory \ '' additional classes\ '' that you have to pick out , and \\n\\n3 . those were usually the extra levels you talk about , so you could take Advanced Maths as the extra class , or you\\ 'd take Psychology again ( with different curriculum of course ) and you\\ 'd pick one for one semester and one for the other . The extra classes are also necessary when you pick two of the subjects for the extra exams in the final Matura exam ( consisting of 5 subjects , Math , Slovene , foreign language ( English , German , French , etc ) and two mandatory extras you pick ) , so if you pick Chemistry and Biology the two of four extra classes in your 4th year are those two and the two extra \ '' higher level\ '' classes . Here i\\ 'd like to distinguish \ '' class\ '' and \ '' subject\ '' more because there are many classes in one school year , as in , groups of students , usually up to 30 and labeled with letters ( so 3.B would be B class of 3rd year ) and all classes are taught the same subjects separately , so you don\\'t really mix students from classes in the ordinary subjects , **except** in the extra *classes* because there students ARE mixed since there are many more to choose from so groups get diluted . As I understand in the US you don\\'t really have \ '' classes\ '' like we do , you are taught every subject in a different group ( being the class ) depending on what you pick . Terminology differences fail me a bit here.\\n\\n4 . integrated systems come and go . We have Math as one subject but Algebra , Geometry and Calculus are all covered separately within it . Physics , Chemistry , Biology , CS and Geography are split.\\n\\n5 . Anything can be arranged if students are interested , but those \ '' exterior classes\ '' won\\'t count towards your final year grade .

Mostly . The victory was followed by the reprisals agains collaborators and their sympathisers ( see Foiba killings , Otroci s petri\u010dka etc. ) . It was a shameful time . \\n\\nThe role of your country in the war : Part of the Yugoslav partisans , the biggest and most effective partisan resistance to date . The Yugoslav partisan tied down some 100k German troops during the war.\\n\\nThe perception of your country-men who fought within the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS : Ahh yes , the Homeguard ( domobranci ) and MVAC ( milizia voluntaria anti-comunista ) . Up until recently they have been ( rightly ) seen as traitors , who joined the Germans , Italians and Hungarians in their war crimes . However recently there have been numerous attemnts by the right-wing to whitewash their crimes and present them as patriotic liberation fighters . There have also been attempts to rehabilitate other quislings such as Gregorij Ro\u017eman , a bishop who openly supported the Italian and German occupation.\\n\\nThe role of national partisans within your country : The partisan were basically the only resistance during the war ( since the Chetniks spent half their time doing the dirty work for Italians - claiming to be \ '' using the enemy\ '' ) . It is difficult to explain just how much of an impact the partisan had on Yugoslavia . The leaders drew their legitimacy from their achievents during the war and the army doctrine effectively became one of pre-planed nation-wide partisan resistance . The entire Yugoslav state existed on the collective memory of the resistance movement .

But no terrorism . No one can ask why - maybe its cause we care for the people , maybe its cause there is a working social net or maybe its because we make them feel at home and thus there is no need to find outlets of violence to get themselves heard . \\n\\n & gt ; What made you Europeans become so suicidal ? \\n\\nI dont see any notion that we are . \\n\\nThats just in your fantasy .

How we remember balls , and oppulant coffee houses , and magnificent parades but forget the squalor , the illness , the people who shared beds cause they couldnt afford places to live in . \\n\\nAnd i am getting more and more the idea that you and people like you have the same distortion of the past on their mind - that everything was better , brighter , greener in the past - which is simply not true - and dont get me wrong - i doubt that everything is greener , brighter and better in the future - but that doesnt mean that i will revert into some kind of hedgehog like state of fear and cowering due to the problems of the future . \\n\\nI know that all i wrote wont change your mind . i just hope that maybe - just maybe you start to see the future not as a hopeless place . \\n\\nBut then again who am i kidding .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"& gt ; and the future of the European people is to be less European and more multiracial , \\n\\nAs it has been since the romans decided to conquer an empire , europeans conquered colonies all over the world , from the Americas to Siberia , and down to Africa .

And you Really say that this is not possible on a continent that has so much more experience with that ? \\n\\nAgain - your idea of europe is so stuck in the past - a past that never was - a past in which only white culture counts and everything else doesnt exist . And that is a something that just never existed . \\n\\nSee the problem of for example terrorism in france or belgium is not immigration - very few to none of the islamic terrorists who commited those attacks in the last few years were actually immigrants . They were mostly 3rd generation citizens , immigrated from the colonies in the 50ies or even before , marginalised by people like you who pushed them to the outer fringes of society . Who often made it impossible for them to even have a chance to have a decent life . \\n\\nAnd i know - now you are gon na tell me how this is all bullshit , and its not true and so on . \\n\\nSee i liveed in Paris for some time , and one of my friends there is a teacher , a nice guy who lets his students in vocational school use his adress in the 17th arrondissement for job and internship searching cause as soon as they used the postal code starting with 93 for Seine-Saint-Denis he knows they wont get an answer . \\n\\nThat internal racism - thats the root of terrorism in france , and while the french motto is liberte , egalite , fraternite , they are extremly lacking in the egalite part - which shows in the banlieus on one hand and the Grandes \u00e9coles on the other hand . \\n\\nBut for you this doesnt count - its a culture war , or religous war - But actually - its good old class warfare - just that its not the white proletariat against the white owners of industry - its the black and brown masses who were pushed further and further to the brink , who were let to rot in the economic downturn of the last crisis and who now use islam as a way to get back to the people who pushed them there . \\n\\nAs i said before - i live in a country with a working social safety net - and see there - no terrorism - maybe - just maybe - if you give people the chance to live a decent life , they dont start to kill people . \\n\\nbut as you are from the country that just ended a large part of its social security ( and i guess you voted for the man who makes it possible ) i dont think you will understand this point . \\n",Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,Explain please - what exactly is moronic about it .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,No there is a right wing YouTube account that disagrees with me - pretty every relevant political group from the extreme left to to the middle right agrees that this deal is a good deal . The extreme left btw not so much - that\\ 's the reason why Nicaragua didn\\'t accept the deal - it didn\\'t go far enough for them . \\n\\n\\nIt\\ 's just the far right nationalists under trump ( and Everyhwere else too ) who don\\'t agree - but that\\ 's the problem - Nationalists will never say a multi national deal is a good deal - since it\\ 's diametral to their agenda of \ '' xyz first\ '' - the idea of a greater good between nations just doesn\\'t exist in their vocabulary . \\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,So you want results that are worth it ? Like a total reduction in climate change ? Not a rise in average temperature at all but a decline.\\n\\nSee basically no problem . It just won\\'t work - cause for this to happen the carbon emissions would have to sink even more then planned in the Paris accord . \\n\\nEspecially by developing nations - basically meaning that they would either need to forgo development of their nations and revert to being even poorer then now - or an even bigger financial burden on the guys with money ( so us ) to help them meet their energy needs without carbon emitting fuels . \\n\\nPlus - at the same time the developed world would need to cut back even more radical - and that\\ 's not a question of \ '' we need to bring more electric cars on the street and shut down coal\ '' - then the goal would be - no cars other the electric and shut down gas too.\\n\\nThis deal is the best that is available at the moment - and it actually got possible cause green energy generations is making huge steps forward especially in developing nations - a reduction would need even more and actually brutal policies - which no nation would go for . \\n\\nSo yeah - the stabilization of global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels is a huge thing -\\nJust to compare - if nothing is done it will ( depending on the model ) raise by 4.5-5C in 2100 - and if you belive that we have mass migration now - wait till 1/4-1/3 of Asia is uninhabitable and the Sahara stretches to the Congo .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Russia gets this \ '' bonus\ '' cause it closed\\nPretty much all it\\ 's dirty industry after the fall\\nOf communism.\\n\\nChina and India get their bonus cause otherwise they would not be on board at all - but they are actually doing something - India has shelved its plans for more coal power plants and china has done the same and will in fact close down several beginning this year.\\n\\nWhich leaves the biggest point why one is against it the redestribution of wealth - that\\ 's the real reason why you don\\'t like it right ? Why should we give any of our hard earned cash to those people . \\n\\nWell the reason is very simple - take hurricane season - I think there is no doubt that global warming influences the strength of hurricane which hit the US every year - and\\nThey are getting stronger and the season is getting longer . \\nKatrina cost 150 billion $ - not including 120 billion federal aid\\n\\nOne hit like Katrina costs the US economy more then all the transfers that happen In the Paris accord over the next decades . \\n\\nAnd those will get more and more common . \\n\\nSame with rising sea levels - at the moment it\\ 's just a problem for Nauru - but soon it will become a problem for cities like Miami and states like Florida - which will need to invest billions into flood protection . \\n\\nAnd then we have displaced persons - large parts of Mexico will become uninhabitable for humans due to the increase of arid climate conditions - same with conditions in the Sahel zone in Africa and large parts of Central Asia . \\n\\nAll this will lead to mass migration which we haven\\'t seen since the fall of the Roman Empire . \\n\\nAnd all this will be way more expansive then transferring a bit of wealth now.\\n\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,The idea is to stop global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels - which is doable and will hold the worst symptoms at a manageable level . \\n\\nSure if you want to reverse the warming which has already happend - then it would mean investing more money and even harsher rules for carbon emissions in developed countries - but it would also mean telling 6 billion people \ '' sorry guys can\\'t have what we have - for at least 50\\nMore years\ '' \\n\\nSo yeah while the accord is not perfect - it\\ 's a step in the right direction - especially since most countries are going along with it . \\n\\nAnd sorry - just saying \ '' it\\ 's not good enough that\\ 's why we can\\'t accept it\ '' is a bad argument - cause it means that nothing will happen which will make it even worse in the long run . \\n\\nThis is the best option at the moment - finely balanced between the developed nations need and want to stop global warming for the reasons I said - and the developing worlds need for energy and well - development . \\n\\nI don\\'t know if you have ever been to china -\\nBut if you ever go - take a train and look out of the window at night - whole villages in darkness with just one or two light bulbs here and there .

Aberfrog,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're not taking into account most trade wars are tit-for-tat . \\n\\ni know - but the 6 % in trade that will partly be lost ( not totally just partly ) will not hurt the EU in total . Switzerland is bound to loose more and sooner or later its population will accept that . might be later though . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm not Swiss , but that is just plain wrong \\n\\nNo actually i am right . Lets just look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss \\n\\nTrue - and as soon as they start the feel that their products \ '' Made in CH\ '' are less cost competitive ( due to renewed certification for example needed to sell in the EU ) they will ramp up their production in the EU plants and cool down production in their swiss plants . Those are multinationals . They are not bound by borders where they produce and in large parts the infrastructure is already in place . \\n\\n & gt ; Nestle \\n\\nThe same in food . Of the 340.000 employees of Nestle 8900 work in Switzerland . Nearly half of those 9000 work in the HQ and research divisions in Switzerland . So if it gets harder to sell Swiss made Nesquik in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg - they will simply ship french made there . The bottom line wont be touched . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R & amp ; D as Germany , so there are a lot of research based companies there as well \\n\\nAbsolutley true . But if you look at the why that is - you will find that CH profited extremly from several EU programs which they were part of so far . Programs in which swiss participation or the negotiation about that have already been shelved as a result of this vote . If it stays like that expect this ratio to go down south pretty fast . \\n\\n & gt ; but Switzerland does produce things.\\n\\nnever said that they dont . \\n\\nI said that a lot of the stuff they do produce is mass produced and can be produced in the EU as well . Nobody is doing it now since the swiss have the market cornered . But if they cant offer their services to a competitive price anymore - well lets just say that new options arise .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,& gt ; Do you expect me to have a full list of Swiss products ? \\n\\nno that would be ridiculous . But lets have a look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland is leading in tunnel construction\\n\\nNot so much . Switzerland does built a lot of Tunnels . True . The companies that built them are not only swiss though . For example the Gotthard Base Tunnel is built by a consortium of 3 non swiss and 2 swiss companies . \\n\\n & gt ; exports specialties such as chocolate and cheese\\n\\nso does belgium . Plus chocolate exports are 650 Mio . \u20ac out of 90 Billions . Doesnt really count much . And chocolate is not really hard to produce . The last major technological advancement ( and the reason for swiss dominance in this field for a long time ) was the conche - but it was invented / discovered more then 100 years ago . \\n\\nAgricultural goods actually account for 1.5 % of the exports to the EU from Switzerland . \\n\\nAnd belive me - if Lindt looses buisness from this - they will start the produce \ '' as good as swiss chocolate\ '' in the EU . \\n\\n & gt ; is an important manufacturer of medical products and chemicals\\n\\nabsolutely no doubt about that . But chemicals can be produced anywhere in the EU . and when it comes to pharmaceuticals - If the guillotine clause is invoked they have to be recertified in the EU - a long and expansive endeavour . So why should Roche and all the others not just produce in the EU and get rid of that pesky little problem . \\n\\n & gt ; their research and development in all kinds of areas is outstanding.\\n\\ntrue - but as we speak here it seems that the EU already has stopped negotiation for the horizon program with Switzerland . a program ( which if as successful as its predecessor ) would bring nearly 2.5x the amount of money to swiss universities and research institutions as the swiss paid into the pot.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's pretty sweeping and simplified remark to say that we can simply copy these products and do without their R & amp ; D. This will also be painful for the EU.\\n\\nWe dont have to copy . The products already exist . What will be painful ( for some maybe ) is a bit less competition . But thats it . And when it comes to R & amp ; D ? The swiss research facilities are good - no question . But the money that fed them so far stays and will just be redistributed to other institutes within the EU . I wouldnt worry so much about that .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Please give me a list . \\n\\nOr just some examples . Of goods that are or can only be produced in Switzerland . No doubt that they exist . But they are only a tiny fraction of the 90 billion \u20ac export volume Switzerland has to the EU at the moment . \\n\\nBut lets have a look at what is the main mass of export goods from CH to the EU . \\n\\nMore then 50 % of the export goods fall into this categories : \\n\\nChemicals and related products - & gt ; so chemicals produced in large quanties and pharmaceutical products ( which can be produced anywhere in the world and which will have the additional hurdle of EU recertification if it comes to the worst ) \\n\\nManufactured goods classified chiefly by material - & gt ; which encompasses everything from simple plastics to High Technology goods . There is also office / telecom equipment in this category . While i guess that there will be some companies that produce unique goods in this category most of it can and is produced by other companies in the EU already . \\n\\nMachinery and transport equipment : Same as above . There might be some swiss companies that produce very specialised goods in this category . But most of it will be run of the mill more or less standard goods that can be bought from numerous sources in the EU . \\n\\nSwitzerland and swiss goods are not unique . ( well most are not ) and thus can be replaced . \\n,Germanic,German

Since the import volume wont shrink - they still need the stuff we produce and at the moment they cant get it cheaper form a third source cause if they could they would buy it there.\\n\\nBut the export volume will shrink once the free market clauses get axed . \\n\\nIt will simply make buying stuff made in Switzerland more expansive then buying the same stuff from within the EU Market.\\nAnd they are not producing anything ( besides watches maybe ) that cant be produced at similar costs in the EU or worldwide.\\n\\n,Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,There is a difference between \ '' not talking about it\ '' and \ '' if I do it I will go to hell\ '' - for example it is still hard for people in western Austria to find doctors who will perform aboftions - those people generally had to travel to Vienna until a few years ago . \\n\\nThis was as far as I know never a problem in the Eastern European states .,Germanic,German

His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring .

In order to explain , i copy a previous comment of mine : \\n\\nHofer ( the right wing candidate ) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that Hofer and his supporters have shown . They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . At first , they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia . In the later phase of the campaign , they started calling VdB a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia ) and a neoliberal.\\n\\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . In an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel . The TV station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed . He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . He was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . A few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . When beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\\n\\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \ '' lies\ '' when VdB started citing him . There is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking Austria as a hostage with him.\\n\\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is , that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia . Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria . Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago .",Germanic,German

Assad still has widespread support . Despite predictions about a mass exodus from Aleppo in case of the expulsion of Al-Nusra , nothing like this happened . Before Aleppo was completely retaken , rumors of attrocities were spread in the media - 500.000 civilians were said to be starving , civilians were claimed to be murdered , so called \ '' activists\ '' were calling for a military intervention . Aleppo was retaken and none of these claims was ever attempted to be proven . The media and political instances have gone silent on Aleppo . I didn\\'t hear a single report about the per estimations 1 million people fleeing from the rebell-controlled parts of Aleppo , when it was still safely held by the so called Opposition . At no point did the media or the political decission makers complain about people having to flee from rebell-controlled areas , rebells calling for genocides against non-Sunnites . Before the insurgency , Syria was a mostly functioning state where people of various ethnic background could coexist . Neither the EU , the US or any single EU state have ever voiced concern about the cleansing of rebell-held areas from non-Sunnites . The \ '' people are scared of the Assad-Regime\ '' narrative only works , if the character of the insurgents is overlooked : They are sunnite extremists whose mission is to terrorise anyone who does not belong to their own sect . For the same reason , the christian population in Iraq has nearly vanished and due to similar motivations , the Lebanese Civil War has lead to a shrinking of non-Sunnite demographics . \\n\\nAny reason that could be given as a motivation for the government to conduct such an attack could also be used if such an attack was conducted in a planned manner . Southwards of the village in question , Rebels tried to push into the city of Hama two weeks ago . Taking Homs would allow the Rebels to reconnect to their areas between Homs and Hama . If chemical warfare agents were deployed , it would make much more sense to do so in an area where they would be of use and allow ground troops to take areas cleared of enemies . The insurgents on the other hand have much more reason to release toxic gas in an area held by them . For months , they have been asking for military action of western troops against the government . This time , they finally got it . However , it\\ 's not been the first time , The US supplied anti vehicle missiles to what they called the \ '' Free Syrian Army\ '' and an air raid conducted by american aircraft against the government held town of Deir-Ez-Zor that allowed Daesh to advance only happend a few months ago .",Germanic,German

Originally , ISDS was in the context of states used i.e . in trade treaties with the former Eastern Bloc to guarantee that legal principles such as the invulnerability of property would be honored . As both Canada and the EU have the most functional legal systems , it seems absurd to use a mechanism on them that was supposed to be used in states without a developed administration or a legal system . \\n\\nAppart from this , i.e . the German constitutional court has criticized CETA for beeing intransparent and not allowing an exit in case that it does not work in its preliminary judgement on the matter .

Autogegner,europe,"Hofer is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that Hofer and his supporters have shown . They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . At first , they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia . In the later phase of the campaign , they started calling VdB a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia ) and a neoliberal.\\n\\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . In an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel . The TV station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed . He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . He was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . A few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . When beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\\n\\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \ '' lies\ '' when VdB started citing him . There is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking Austria as a hostage with him.\\n\\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is , that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia . Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria . Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago .",Germanic,German
