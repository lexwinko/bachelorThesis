Dracaras,europe,Whats happening today ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Nazi German is the reason why France was humiliated heavily . Such things are not forgotten easily . Whole WW2 is shameful for French .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,The birth of Turkish republic is tied to this \ '' genocide\ '' ? TIL !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"It is weird because you are the one on the \ '' always right , saint\ '' side . I guess winners do write history .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Really ? Nearly nobody looks germans bad today . Yet when it comes to Turks its always evil , bad , satan incarnation .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,See ? This was what i am talking about . You guys are hilarious ! Hypocrites ...,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Armenians sided with Russians before those events . Nothing is black and white . Everyone at some time conquered europe . Yet nobody holds a grudge except when it comes to us .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea . Italy was playing to be 4th and BAM now they are playing to be the first . This group is so fucked up it makes me sad . Couldnt we be at group D ? ! We are getting wasted here . We have beaten Italians !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,How about us ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Because it is typical west hypocrisy . It is always how west how christians suffered . Nobody mentions how we suffered . Nobody knows [ this ] http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ottoman_Muslims where we suffered faar and faaar more than armenians but it is **always** overlooked and whenever it is mentioned , it is **always** mentioned as how we deserved it .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,And they lost and now its called \ '' genocide\ '' it wouldnt be if they had won .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,LOL is the only answer i can give to that . Appearsntly ottoman screwed europe soo much that the hatress still continues .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Because Russia acted as a \ '' defender of the orthodox faith\ '' ( still does , huh ? ) \\nGeneral population was expelled from asia minor however due to ottoman\\ 's little strength they were merely protected and raped and murdered and looted by turkish and kurdish irregulars.\\n\\nWhy not ? Europe *still* hates us and wants us gone from the map .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Lmao Turkey could due without his eastern side and still can . Nobody cares about eastern turkey . What matters is the western Turkey . We wouldnt be here if we lost against greeks , we would be if we had lost against armenians .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Thank you man : ) you are liked here : ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Werent much better ? I love the hypocrisy in europeans . Whatever war happened in europe at that time were ( something hard to admit coming in ) **as cruel as** this one . And at least ottos let their individuals do whatever religion they believed in/whatever they wanted to once the order was restored ( after all looting was done ) whereas in europe they were completely massacred if the enemy was catholic/protestant . Europe will never ever get past evil ottoman/turk circlejerk . Therefore europe and turkey will never be friendly in terms . Because they look us as barbarians/evil doers and say that we dont belong in here and if they could send us back they would . Fucking hypocrites , ignoring their past and blaming us for what happened centuries ago .",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"Unfortunately yes . \\n\\nYes he actually destroyed Turkish Nationalism and paved way for Kurdish nationalism . But however HDP succeded in taking nearly all Kurdish votes and some Turkish votes ( in hopes for a peaceful agreement between Turks and Kurds and strategic votes to get them pass the % 10 threshold ) After that HDP promised their voters that they wont betray their Turkish voters and be \ '' Turkey\\ 's party\ '' instead of an \ '' exclusively Kurdish party\ '' however they failed this and couldnt completely cut their relationship with PKK . Now they WILL lose votes because they are still with pkk and your casual Turkish voter will probably wont vote for them in the upcoming elections because their true face has been seen . \\n\\nHowever things arent going as expected for Erdogan as well . Despite his BEST efforts he still can not take enough votes to give his party absolute majority . AKP and CHP will gain some . HDP and MHP will lose some . In the end nothing will actually change . I dont trust HDP at all even though i want to but right now Erdogan is a bigger thorn and i want them to pass threshold but i will NOT vote for them and will support CHP as i did in the last elections . \\n\\nUltra nationalists are fucking idiot . First of all MHP =/= Ultranationalists . Even though they vote for that , leader of the MHP did everything to pacify those idiots and they told their voters to not be provocated and told that his party took no role in their actions . Ultranationalists have beaten koreans thinking as if they were chineese to protest China\\ 's actions against East Turkestan ( Wow , so genius to beat a tourist to protests its government to begin with ! ) They even torched the store of a martyr\\ 's relative to protest PKK . I think nobody else but themselves like ultra nationalists . They can only speak about \ '' removing all kurds\ '' but they wouldnt even join the army if we were attacked . They can only talk and attack unarmed tourists . They only look strong .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,True and if we were to make a gene test some of us probably wont even have that turkic gene but we all call ourselves Turkish . Calling them muslim greeks instead of greeks is just laughable .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . We had way worse in our history . Such thing wont happen .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Dead . Or living in an extremely poor country by the sea .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . Intent is the most important thing . Ottomans wanted to ethnically cleanse them not mass murder them .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea well the reason is not so many Turks were left after your independence anyway . And even your government still refuses west thracian Turks to call them as \ '' Turk\ '' instead they use muslim greeks .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ask reddit . We deserve \ '' whatever happens to us\ '',Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Jesus man . You are delusional beyond words . Go live in your murderous Turks vs secular Kurds world . I am done reasoning with you . You have completely lost it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,We only challenge the word genocide . We accept massacres and such . Genocide definitely defines the holocaust . What se see here is far away from what Nazis did .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,But we are the opposite of whatever ottomans were . And ottoman empire was deeply influenced by byzantine . If our religion was christianity then we would even be the continuation of them .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Appearantly you havent had enough time on reddit .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Idk . My grandfathers father was persecuted from bulgaria after balkan wars . So maybe I have some european blood . Who knows maybe there is a bit of armenian too or greek ? And lets not forget hittits , ionians , asurs and oh surely there must be some sort of turkic blood as well . Lol",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Are you serious ? Whole France surrenders joke comes from WW2 . All countries have a spot of shame in their history . No need to deny that . Maybe you are right though . What is shameful is that there is a lot of people that think thst we are evil faschist barbars . \\n\\nWe are not destroying ourself with nationalism .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Aww dont be so hard on your language : ( our language is pretty much useless too : /,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,I would like to see both communities peacefully coexist in future .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yep . Agree that its wrong to hold it . We should maintain bases and give lands to cyprus . We should never ever let go of bases until UK cedes 9 % of their lands in cyprus .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes . You see Cyprus is a base for everyone . UK has bases everywhere throughtout world . We should at least have bases in Cyprus and that should be accepted as one of the future treaties to be signed by Turkey and Cyprus . And no that doesnt make us colonizer , just having an unsinkable aircraft carrier . We should preserve our own interests while uniting the island . You cant take without giving anything .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Really ? Are you serious ? Greeks were the one who started this .Turks in retaliation armed theirselves to defend themselves . This also meant an expulsion of Turkish Cypriots in which they ran to uk , canada and austria to save their lives .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Why ? 1/3 of bulgaria used to be Turkish . Now its less than 1/10\\n\\nTurks used to be dominant in western thrace now much less .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Oh linking to a side called \ '' kurdistan\ '' on turkish war crimes i am sure that is not biased at all s./\\n\\nOh ethnic cleansing ? Cyprus ? Are you for real ? Greek cypriots were ethnically cleansing Turks first to begin with , to unite the island with Greece . You killed woman and children in their bathtub where they were hiding . Turkey occupation is a result of your evil doing . Stop blaming us . \\n\\nWe dont fight the kurds we fight the pkk . I am sick of explaining this , go learn the difference . \\n\\nThere is no solid proof that we helped isis . We sent arms to that shithole to help fsa and turkmen brigades . \\n\\nThere is no such thing as \ '' Turkish occupied Kurdistan\ '' those lands legitimally , rightfully belongs to the Republic of Turkey . There are minorities in every country which form majority in some parts . Turks also form majority in some parts of Greece and Bulgaria . Nobody calls them greek/bulgarian occupied Turkey . Do they ? \\n\\nWhats the source of those chart ? Which newspapers were taken into account ? I can also point golden dawn and their resources and how racist they are against us .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Showing the hypocrisy of those who want to unity cyprus . Their power is not enough to say anything to the big brother UK .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Cyprus is very close to Turkey . A base there may greatly help us however a base in pacific would be completely useless because we are not a world power and only thing we want is to defend .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What about this ? Which resulted in far more death and deportation than armenians.\\nhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ottoman_Muslims,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea as always a power issue . Well then i hope island doesnt unite in peaceful terms .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Turkey=/=Ottoman empire . This doesnt mean i disown my ancestors . They did great things and they did shittty things as well . Atrocities of Turkey ? The biggest atrocity i can point is the istanbul pogrom of 6-7 sept which was truly a shame for us but you just cant call us \ '' sons of the evil lords\ '' Oh we have oppressed Kurds but they are no longer oppressed but their terrorist organization keeps on killing civilians . \\n\\nKurds are islamist and tribalistic and their lands have nothing exactly nothing but mountains .

Dracaras,europe,"& gt ; Turkey is a hegemonizing nationalistic state\\n\\nNo\\n\\nYou are just another butthurt guy who blames everything on Turks since you are living in another ex-ottoman country .

Huge atrocities happen when empires crumble but this works on both sides . My ancestors come from Bulgaria where they were persecuted by bulgarians .

There is a truth in Serbia\\ 's \ '' remove kebab\ '' meme you know that , right ? \\n\\nWe are Turkey not Ottoman Empire . It is foolish to \ '' reconquer\ '' what we have lost . Kurds were oppressed but now they have deputies in our parliament . They are very well represented they can not and should not resort to terrorism . Pkk has killed many civilians .

Dracaras,europe,You know something else people dont ususally forget ? EOKA,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"No i didnt . May i have some proof for that ? \\n\\nTaksim means partitions . Obviously those communities couldnt live together at that time ( doesnt mean they cant right now ) This was the solution necessary at that time . A two state solution . Like israel and palastine . \\n\\nMilitary junta declared einosis , what are you talking about ? Do you know what bloody sunday is ? British is still there , occupying 9 % of thr island .

See , we are making progress . I guess you are right about that one . Status quo benefits us just like in israel & amp ; palestine . However it could be solved like what uk did back in time . Giving 2 bases to Turkey and in return ceding everything else to Republic of Cyprus . \\n\\n\ '' Why did you rape women bla bla ... \ '' Seriously ? Why did you started massacre-ing Turks in their homes ?

Dracaras,europe,Yea they were thats what i meant .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Dont think that armenian diaspora even protected the guy . He also heavily criticized armenians saying that they could actually do something for their countries instead of never ending crying about genocide .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ha ! You think all would be dandy in balkans if there werent any ottomans ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,At least you are much much more powerful compared to us .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Opposite for us unfortunately : (,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No the reason is religion and thats why i wish ottos had chosen christianity rather than islam.\\n\\nIf you really think roman empire gave its people only peace and prosperity you are definitely true s./\\n\\nWe are saying that they were GOOD compared to the civs at that time NOT MODERN 21st century states .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What i meant waa ottomans always get a bad rep but at least they had some kind of sense and defended against wahhabi idiots but people hate ottomans no matter what .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ottomans defended holy sites from wahhabi freaks who wanted to demolish anything about religion and that castle was exclusively build to stop them damaging historical and spiritual sites .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Yea destruction of greeks in Turkey was really sad . Relations with greece at the first few decades since our foundations were really good despite recent war . Istanbul lost its color without its greek community . Our government should act and offer citizenship and give property as gifts for their descendants not only greeks but armenians as well . We could have been a better country with them . I hope this happens in the future . I really would like to see us bff with Greece . We have much in common we should end hostilities .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,And british colonised america CENTURIES later we made to Anatolia . Should those pesky evil barbarian invaders pack up and leave where they came from ? You are talking nonsense . And justifying every atrocities committed by bulgarians and the bulgarian government . Those who died were living there for centuries and it was their home . And you are saying that you were tolerant towards them ? As if 600.000 Turks didnt run away from Bulgaria as soon as the borders with them were opened .

Dracaras,europe,And what entity is that ? Those who have committed the biggest genocides ? Hell we can even call hiroshima and nagazaki a \ '' genocide\ '' too then ! \\n\\nI am all for historians discussing the issue but it is all about political as of right now . \\n\\nThen there is literally no same person in this reddit .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,He should respect the dead for Turks first .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Here starts the stupid circlejerk .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Well I didnt want to repose on that but his name and surname is greek . He had a troubled childhood where his parents let go of him and he somehow got brainwashed to be like that . Besides looks can be deceptive .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . It means he respects the dead . Which means anyone would do that .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,See this is exactly what we are saying . We dont deny massacres we only say that it was not a genocide and that modern day Turkey is not responsible for it . If europe somehow says that it was a genocide and that the Turkey was responsible for it then they will only prove theirselves hypocrites .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yes . Amount of Turkish who accept genocide is like 9.1 % it will steadily increase until like 25-30 % and then it will drastically slow down .,Turkic,Turkish

Yet eu does nothing other than saying \ '' yeah well good for you\ '' Turkish soldiers WILL stay in Turkish soil we have no business in that war . Do you think there is an end to that ?

Dracaras,europe,You are fucking stupid .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,& gt ; EU can at the very least demand\\n\\nEU can only do that if they fund the said camps . We are not a member of EU . We have no obligations . I wish we could send all those refugees to your precious countries .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What does this comment mean ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"No . God no . We wont make them full citizens . You can take them if you want so much . I would laugh as you struggle with their stupid conservatism . \\n\\nWhere did you understand \ '' Turkey is so perfect ? \ '' Turkey is shit compared to eu states . We are heaven according to them , and you are heaven accorsing to us . If magically Netherlands would give me a citizenship i\\ 'd be gone in a heartbeat . And i\\ 'd have no trouble integratinf unlike those crazy people ... .but you guys seem to like them more . Well have fun then .

Dracaras,europe,We have not forgotten the first balkan war ... .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Hypocrisy as always . They still see us as \ '' you dont belong in here , go back to central asia\ '' but they defend tatars because its against russia . Idk what they would do if russians attacked us . ( Which will never happen for now )",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ooh right sorry . It was a deal between europe and turkey where we could make them stay and in return they would give our citizens visa . It is NOT about EU . Nobody here wants your precious EU anymore .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Well Turkic tribes did not contribute much to our gene pool only changed its culture . So we are the sons and daughters of the people who lived here since forever . Also we took in a lot of muslim refugees from balkans , caucassia and middle east which all became turkified in decades . We are genetically close to greeks and armenians .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,He is giving a possibility that Turkish troops are crazy people who shoot civilians ... .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,They kill our civilians with their terrorist organization ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"I dont support erdogan dont get me wrong . But we are fed up with your policy . Why dont you just go ahead and simply say \ '' we dont want you in EU\ '' it would make things much easier . Everyone here knows that you wont take us in anyway . And twitter is not blocked .

Dracaras,europe,& gt ; repressed sexuality \\n\\nDont think so .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,And what you think executing random innocent people is justifiable in a time where they are not even oppressed anymore ? \\n\\nTurkish intervention of Cyprus was a result of Greek Cypriots being killed by Greek Cypriots . Yet noone ever accepted this intervention .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,So its not freedom of speech if he doesnt agree with you ? Where will you draw the line ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea , of course you would . Why are we trying to be friendly against a bunch off assholes who wish seljuks disappeared before they made to europe ? Screw EU . They are alienating us . We must seek closer relations with Russia and abandon EU",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I dont agree with you most of the time but at least you are solid guy when it comes to Ataturk . I think he was even too kind to idiots . He shouldnt have just get rid of them he should have also killed his children and relatives . Pea doesnt drop far away from the tree .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Oh yea i have forgotten we are not even european lol .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Well i would immigrate to usa or canada if i had a chance haha . People in canada are better whereas the cities are better in usa imo .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,He didnt but the hate is there nonetheless because he was Turkish .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Nobody would call them turkish city if it existed 5K years ago as well as not greek/armenian/assyriam/syrian/bulgarian/georgian/russian bla bla bla ... \\nBut just so you know modern day Turkish citizens are far more indigenous than Turkic .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Why ? Us and Canada are pretty good .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,So . Turkish news are okay but the news of the kurdish people who live in Turkey are not ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,You are right . The reason is some islamist thinkers influenced that area a lot throughout history such as Mevlana . Now i would be okay if they minded their own business but they do not . Assholes\\n\\nRemove Konya . Konya of worst kebab .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . It was ethnic cleansing .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"And what do you think the people at Ottoman Empire knew what was going on let alone approve it ? \\n\\nOE was ruled with 3 pasha regime . They wanted to relocate them not to kill them . OE was a hell at that time . Murders , wars happening everywhere in the country . How did you expect them to protect them where they couldnt even protrct their own country .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Do you think Ottoman Empire was stable at that time ? Deaths were the most normal thing that could happen .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I bet my 20 Turkish liras that we will be the least liked country ( maybe ) after Rossiya .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Wow . Cool !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ours is the root . We have bo\u011fma rak\u0131 ( a branch of rak\u0131 ) which is similar to rakia afaik .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Wow . Europe should take an example of that in this matter haha .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"And what are you claiming that greek cypriots stay put and did nothing and evil Turkey invaded an island which USA did NOT approve ? Are you denying bloody sunday , EOKA , einosis and UN desperately trying to protect Turkish citizens but failing ? Whatever our intentions were doesnt matter we had a reason and it was greek cypriots . \\n\\nEurope would find Turkey guilty anytime they want but they wouldnt do shit if we were the the victim . They didnt do shit when greek cypriots started to kill our brother but they find us guilty for protecting our people ? ? ? For giving a reaction ? ? ?

Dracaras,europe,Economic crisis . They are only recovering now .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,I am not a crazy nationalist .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"No no thats the problem . We still have the brain drain problem . Valuable people out , invaluable ( not being racist , you got the idea ) people who hold us back and live with backwards retarded ( yes retarded ) mentality in . \\n\\nYes our equally ( or worse , yeah worse ) retarded asshole erdogan is letting them in . More people getting stupid more votes he gets . God i hate him so much . None of the government before has caused that much damage , it will take decades to repair ( if we can ) the damage .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Are you fucking kidding me ? Do you really think Nazi action and our intervention was same ? Those people were ACTUALLY murdered.\\n\\nTurkey of course wouldnt leave them to greece but if these had not happened and the island would become independent not dependent to greece then the Turkey wouldnt intervene . I am done with you and your copy pasta .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"For gods sake dont . We already have a ****load of immigrants . We cant take anymore ! You are so far away from them , go take some we cant deal anymore \u00fcber conservative religious nutjob arabs .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Completely irrelevant . They are not close to africa on anything even that piece is like 0.000004 % of the whole piece .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Turkey can not turn more islamic than Iran . Our westernization started long ago before we were founded . Military backs Ataturk\\ 's values so they wouldnt let that happen . And even if somehow islamists wanted to create an islamic state it would only result as breaking of turkey as west and east . As western turkey is predominantly secular and westernized . Even their muslims are not hardcore . \\n\\nCities names change through time . Should we all go back and use the old names of cities ? Especially for america ? I am fine with you calling it constantinople . But do you do the same for Edirne , \u0130znik , \u0130zmir ... .etc ? \\n\\nIstanbul was used by the locals of istanbul long ago ( both Turks and other minorities ) it is derived from Greek phrase \ '' to the city\ ''",Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"What are you talking about ? Even Europe Human Rights told me i could say anything . You moderator , will ban me ? How \ '' european\ ''",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Turkey is not deep down very muslim . West Turkey is pretty secular . Most if not all my friends wear in european style dress and nobody is having a problem with it . Stop demonizing us and Turkey . But there are assholes like that however they can not do anything other than hide in their caves . \\n\\nAlso you couldnt have gone to constantinople unless you are 550+ years old .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,God . Do you even read ? You keep repeating the same bullshit . At least most greeks i met here were not like you .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,He is right though .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea . So ? Just because they have access to black sea doesnt increase their signiriance .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,It is all about armenians nobody knows this where more Turks were killed than armenians any many more forced to run leaving their everything behind.\\nhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ottoman_Muslims\\n\\nPlus massacres were conducted by local kurdish beys mostly .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yes please ! ! !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,We are teal .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hmm yea but it never reached the cruelty levels of western colonial powers,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea but still we should take pride of how successful they were ( at some time ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ataturk did everything to remove ottoman influence from people . He didnt want any ties with the people and the empire .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Istanbul had and still has many secular people but they are outnumbered by those who arent . Yea conservativeness increase from west to east .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"I am a bit nationalistic and everyone should be . I am faithless and i literally hate islam . It is one of the main reasons why we are sooo fucked up.\\n\\nWoah i am impressed . I really am it looks like we are progressing . \\n\\nYes i can . On behalf of Ottoman empire ( or its successor state Turkey ) cleansing of armenians and assyrians were horribly wrong and i apologize it . \\n\\nThere . See ? When you take one step , we will take one step as well and in the end we may end up hugging eachother . \\n\\nCheers and good night .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"It was 18 % turkish and then you declared einosis and started massacre-ing turkish . I do support unification but you srsly need to stop with that Turkish army evil occupier bullshit . They were there to protect its people to begin with , i dont believe same thing will happen if we unite but i guess we are too scared for it .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Lol . And you think other european countries cooperate ? Sweet dreams . It all revolves around power .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Exactly . It is amazing how pathetic comments get the top comments in that sub . \\n\\n\ '' Turkey , out of NATO NOW ! \ '' This never fails to make me smile : )",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . We have 5 % of our lands in europe . Thats enough .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ottoman empire sucked on many ways .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,And may i ask why ? What are your criterias for a european ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Can you give examples of this \ '' human rights abuse\ '' or this another screw Turkic countries thing ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Ahahaha . Ottomans ? Imperialism ? Colonialism ? Britain of balkans ? Aaaha maan you are flattering me . Whole balkans have a culture on their own only difference is that they also mixed with the turkish culture . And we have bits of armenian and greek cultures as well . Whats the point ? Cultures mix by the time.\\n\\nYes ottomans stayed technologically inferior and this made them weaker and made easier for you to rebel . So you should be happy ? \\n\\n\ '' Poor misunderstood imperialists just wanted to civilise the barbarious Balkans with their unrich history and unvibrant culture.\ '' \\n\\nLol i have not said anything like that . You just stick words to my mouth . Balkans have a very rich history and culture.\\n\\n\\n\ '' Man you know what . Now that I think about it . Fuck you . Yeah go fuck yourself . if it wasn\\'t for your stupid conversions we wouldn\\'t be in this mess right now.\ '' \\n\\nHaha i think your madness is consuming you.\\n\\nAnd do you know that UK still has MANY overseas colonies which can be used as a base for them ? While we have ... .none ? Lol . And they are only doing it for the show they still suck them dry with cheap labour and resources . UK doesnt want them developed they want them under control . \\n\\nIf you wan na see countries who are not criticized enough , look to usa , usa and usa .

Dracaras,europe,Lol funny thing . I am not saying that devsirme is something amazingly good i am saying that it was acceptable according to his century .

Dracaras,europe,Hmm . I shouldnt visit Hungary then . Thanks for the warning .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Mostly hard . Very hard on eastern cities . They can not marry , afaik they can not adopt too i could be wrong though . It all depends on people . Some people and families are completely cool about it , most are idiotic .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"We are white . You calling us not white doesnt change this fact . We dont care if you call us white , brown , purple , black , green or yellow as color doesnt matter for us but it is racist for you to call us browns just to put us in another category .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,It is erdogan who set us backwards .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Turkish people are different in many areas . West/central anatolian/black sea/east/southeast/ all are different . West Turks are pretty much like Turkish cypriots .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,What the ducking duck ? Did they poll this in southeast Turkey ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea obviously secular Turks are different in regions as well . Pretty sure Cypriot culture also affected and changed those cypriots in a way and maybe even greeks changed by somehow . \\n\\nYea they are conservatives in west unfortunately but they are mostly immigrants from the lesser developed regions of turkey ( particularly east and southeast ) I was talking about those who were really English to their region .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ooh here is a proud murican .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I havent seen a single headline about kurds involment in the genocide nor heard anyone speaking about kurds involment in massacres .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Stop misleading .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Its a mixed bag . Those who have coast to aegean and mediterranean are developed and secular turks used to be majority . Why \ '' used\ '' ? Because those cities were literally bombarded by the people from east ( conservative ) and southeast ( conservative , tribalistic kurds mostly ) and whats worse is instead of integrating to the western society those people build up their own little communities and screw up everything ! They refuse everything we stand for . And whats even worser ? Your average western couple would make 1 or 2 children whereas a guy from east would make 3-4 and another one from southeast would make up to 10 damn children ! ! ! Wtf ? ? ! How are you going to raise those kids ? You wont , thats the answer . Crazy assholes ... \\n\\nAnd this is how cities fell one by one . Mediterranean is pretty much lost except Antalya which is a very tentative balance between two sides . And 2 other Adana and Hatay who are still can be salvaged but sad defeats.\\n\\nIn the aegean Izmir ( and a few other cities ) shines like a beacon of light with secularists outnumbering religious conservatives by a great margin . \\n\\nIstanbul ( despite having a great deal of good people ) with its 14 damn millions of population eastern migrants vastly outnumber than those who are not . \\n\\nYea i made that a bit overly depressive and they are not \ '' that\ '' evil : P but you got the point .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Aaah ! This is true . Not \ '' most\ '' since there was already secular people there . But some of the balkan muhacirs made it here and they were secular mostly . But i was talking about internal immigration from east to west .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Thank you ! Wish more people had actually seen us instead of living with stupid prejudices .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Believe it or not . It was better to be at ottoman than some western europe nation . YOU GET TO LIVE ! What else can be said ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yes i do not find it right that we are sending settlers . It is an ill thought . But Cyprus refused the annal plan whereas Turkish Cypriots agreed so you cant really blame us for not being cooperative . Turkey should withdraw its force or at least negotiate with Cyprus so that a few bases stay and the rest goes , since every power has force in that island such as uk , nato , russia ...",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Thats a good thing , we both need good relations .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Oh please ottomans funded all over balkans . The mostar bridge in Bosnia is an example .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Wish the ridiculuous \ '' big 5\ '' rule could be removed .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Did you know most albanian and bosnian parents willingly gave their kids to ottomans even after they have converted to islam ( which they dont have any obligations anymore ) because those kids would take the best education possible in ottomans and they could rise to be a greeat statesman or a military commander .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Okay . Sure . Give back our Turks and take our Syrians . I am all in for this solution ! WIN-WIN !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I am not shifting it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yes . Yes.\\n\\nYou can find lots and lots of examples of this ; ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Hmm interesting . Moldova looked like landlocked and stuck between ukraine and romania also . Arent you a mod ? Why is your name peasant blue like us rather than flashy green ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Agreed . Right now the Turkey which matters is the western Turkey . Seriously n-o-b-o-d-y cares about the eastern turkey . Wish this nightmare had never happened and i dont care about losing our eastern territory , this would even solve our Kurdish problem .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,They did hate -and still do- because religion . Religion is still an important factor but it was extremely important back then . For example catholics were under protection of ottomans because they were minority compared to orthodox churches and they choose muslims rather than orthodoxs .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"people burned this is the major point , minor killings by irregulars are irrelevant .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea eastern Turkey gets incredibly lot of snow in winter .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Well Kurds were minority in that region they wanted to be dominant and they were so willing about killing massacres they jumped to it .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"No greeks in izmir who hasnt fled the city yet ignited the fire and the wind contributed to burn the city . Most of the city was left in ashes , a big damage to already weak Turkey .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Yea ! Istanbul , it can get cold and wet but little snow : (",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,But persecutions mainly happened before the genocide and nobody will even think of doing anything about them since they completely hate us .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea we are literally worse than hitler . World will be a better place if we all die right now .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"See ? Why would we burn a valuable port city ? Your army followed a scorched earth policy and burned wherever they spotted during your retreat . Izmir was just one of them . Use your logic ffs . We should be the one hating you for damaging us soo much but we dont . \\n\\nArmenians do they are crazy about Turkey . They want property ( as if it was possible ) money , land whatever .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Ooh . Got it . I thought it was simply a landlocked country which borders only other 2 countries . Ok that makes a lot more sense.\\n\\nGrrrr you have shown your true face , i knew you were a mod ! Kill him ! Kill him with fireeeee ! ! !",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Most of the people still hold us responsible for the great fire of smyrna and we dont ask reperations for what happened in balkans . My wealthy great grandfather fled from bulgaria to save his own life i dont sue or hate bulgarians now or ask them to give me money or property .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Whats that ? No sane guy would say that ? Our cunterdogan pulled a stunt to get attention and made it and he said muslims not turks . He doesnt care about Turks all he cares is muslims,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Yea . It is interesting how climate is so much different in not so big country . To the west Izmir literally never sees snow while to the east snow blocks your entrance to the house . What was your business there ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No . We are fed up with your refugees . You will take care of them from now on .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"Nobody destroyed your culture its still there . Ottoman empire did horrible things but they were were good to the minorities COMPARED to their time . You cant just simply think with your 21st century logic . British and french were massacre-ing because they were in opposing sects of the same religion whereas you could peacefully live in ottoman empire and do WHATEVER you wanted to as long as you pay your tax . Ottomans did not care what their people did ! Its non muslim citizens were treated as 2nd class citizens i am not denying that but they could live and practise their religion whereas christians were killing christians in the west because they were not in the right path of christianity ! \\n\\nWhy the fuck we came here ? Blame mongols , we were running away from them . Plus war happens , civilizations enlarge and we are faar more indigenous people rather than our Turkish roots.\\n\\nYes we were the victims of the balkan wars i could not have been here if my great grandparent had failed to flee but i dont ask for what he has left behind , do i ? \\n\\nNow everyone has to gulp down the fact that this is our home now and nothing will change that fact including your hatress .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,You are welcome : ),Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,You dont need to thank anything . Just learn the facts and dont be crazy about ottomans .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,No no i am not saying that its great i am saying that it was great compared to other empires at that time . Sometimes i hope ottoman empire was orthodox instead of islamic that would have solved pretty much everything and they could have been truly the continuation of roman empire . Ottomans get screwed up after the rise of nationalism since they had everyone from everywhere and this led to dirty things .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Ooh sorry i misunderstood . Still every country has bad deed . It is wrong to not going them for x reason.\\n\\nBut about your \ '' imaginary victimisation\ '' you can see that anti-turkism is rampant in this subreddit .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Whats that thing just in the border between France and Spain ?,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I am not westophobic . I am one of those secularist Turks .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,They already had weapons . They were a power on their own . Ottomans had a central army and there were local powers in specific situations such as this one . There is a strong bond between those two . They willingly massacred armenians along with other ottomans .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Lol . I was talking to another Turkish guy so he can mind his own business .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,I would run to iceland or antartica . They are always the last one to fall . ALWAYS !,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,They could have . Ottomans already had lost all of its power and they were living like an old man with life support unit . It is the other way around State couldnt have done without the help of local Kurds .,Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,Only because you have no answer left because it is impossible to penetrate wall of hate of Turks .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,Blood tax in Ottomans meant you gave your first son to the state and they fought in battles however after some battles or time they could retire and live with the money they have received throughout the times they have fought and they would be free.\\n\\nAnd even in the later times the janissaries ( formed by the people of the blood tax ) did not even fight they took their money from the state but refused to fight and lived like everybody else and then much later state finally removes them which were once a good way to fight in battles.\\n\\nAnd fyi albanians who converted to islam continued to give their sons to ottoman empire for some time . \\n\\nAnd it is child slavery i am not downplaying that but know eveything about that not only \ '' how sons get stolen from their mothers\ '',Turkic,Turkish

Dracaras,europe,"No , you can see it on every website . Hatress against us because we succeed . There wouldnt be much hatress if we had failed our independence war .",Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,lol I am just reminding that Kurds are equally responsible as Turks at that time not \ '' mostly Kurds\ '' \\n\\nI just explained Ottoman empire and minorities go read again if you want.\\n\\nI have not suggested other countries paying reperations to us I criticized Armenians blindly throw responsibility to us . I dont want Bulgaria to give reperations for my great grandfather\\ 's loss but I dont wan na pay for some armenian\\ 's great grandfather\\ 's loss either . See the difference ? \\n\\nOf course it was religion based this doesnt mean every hatress is caused by it but its the main reason .,Turkic,Turkish
Dracaras,europe,"It is blood tax not child slavery . First born male son goes to ottomans . Yes this is very cruel . Imagining this in 21st century now is completely unacceptable , right ?

Another argument is that the Armenians were siding with the Russians during the Great War so a lot of Armenians weren\\'t just ethnic minorities but also political \ '' terrorists\ '' ( in the eyes of the Ottomans ) , and therefore actions against them shouldn\\'t solely be considered as actions against ethnic minorities.\\n\\nOf course I\\ 'm just laying out the arguments for you to understand both sides ( I\\ 'm pretty sure you already know what the other side thinks ) , I\\ 'm not taking a stance here.\\n\\n\\nCurrent situation looks like Turkey never will accept the term \ '' genocide\ '' , because officially classifying it as a genocide could make Armenia ask for compensation land , and what country on their right mind would give out land like that.\\n\\nIn the end though , this literally has nothing to do with Atat\u00fcrk .",Turkic,Turkish

Again , I\\ 'm not here to tell you which side is correct.\\n\\nObviously the diaspora has been able to spread their perspective a lost easily with the rise of Erdo\u011fan , because Erdo\u011fan is an evil figure and it\\ 's not hard to claim \ '' therefore everything he does is evil\ '' , which gives the setting to make claims such as \ '' PKK aren\\'t really terrorists\ '' or \ '' PKK serves the Kurdish people in Turkey\ '' ( they really don\\'t- Turkish Kurds and PKK have very different ideologies , and PKK often terrorizes Kurdish villages for not giving them support ) .\\n\\nThe final straw for the Turkish redditors came with that \ '' Greek genocide\ '' post in 19th of May . Not only Turks believed that the genocide did not happen and was a reactionary event to the Turks who were murdered by the Greeks , but also 19th of May is the national Youth and Sports Day in Turkey ( also the official birthday of Atat\u00fcrk , and the day that the War of Independence begun ) . \\n\\nObviously Turkish redditors felt that this was a huge \ '' fuck you\ '' to them , and they aren\\'t really wrong since the \ '' Genocide Recognition Day\ '' was set on 19th of May by the Greek government *specifically* to piss Turkey off . The Turkish-Greek relations at the time was very shit.\\n\\nThe thread in /r/turkey is a reaction to all these .

Someone literally forced it on Turkey . \\n\\nThe reason Kurds weren\\'t classified as an ethnic group was because some Kurds refused to call themselves Turkish ( which is considered an act of seperatism ) , unlike other peoples who went on to call themselves \ '' Turkish Armenian\ '' , \ '' Turkish Greek\ '' , and so on . A futile effort by the government , sure , but it\\ 's not as black and white as you\\ 're trying to make it sound ( i.e \ '' the evil turks are eating babies\ '' ) .\\n\\nI also like how you latch on to the Kurdish issue , because you realize what you said about the other minorities is straight out false . The reason Kurds are special is because their identity is often used for terror propoganda . It used to be Islamic terror , but now they do fascist terror under the name of socialism.\\n\\nAlso I think no one denies that the Islamic side of the Turkish culture is in fact regressive . Which is why Mustafa Kemal , the person you so dearly hate probably , was a very strong advocate of secular Turkish values . After all Turkish culture started thousands of years before Islam was a thing.\\n\\nI also love how you sprinkled a little bit of Armenian Genocide denial to your post , probably because you realized you can\\'t back up most of the things you said in the original comment and need another way of bashing the Turks.\\n",Turkic,Turkish

So in a way you trade one form of speech ( hate speech ) for another ( speech of minorities ) , because in the end it makes it more \ '' free\ '' as more people can participate.\\n\\nI don\\'t see how banning the discussion of genocides helps anybody .

Flaneusee,europe,"& gt ; Obviously , if you were a Muslim , it was fine for you . But for those in Hungary and Slovakia , it wasn\\'t so . ( Hungary , Slovakia , Austria , Czech republic were at the time p\\n\\nWhere did I say it was easier for those people ? You pointed out that Middle East is very unstable right now and I explained to you that that is because of the events that happened in the past 20 years or so . What international conflict was in Middle East during 17th century when Ottomans were conquering Europe ? \\n\\n & gt ; And what makes you think that this time they will surely integrate well ? The 60s was not a first failure in integration . In EE , there is a Roma population that failed to integrate since the end of WW1 . What exactly makes you think that this time it will be different , despite several failed examples in the past and despite the inability to properly manage their own societies in their own countries ? \\n\\nIntegration of Muslims has nothing to do with Romas . Romas in Eastern Europe has been living there long before WWI , their integration process was never similar to Muslims . The current Muslim population in Europe came mostly during 60s as guest workers . There was no initiative to integrate them because it wasn\\'t thought to be needed . Those people were supposed to back to their countries once their contracts were up . So politican ought to learn from this and enforce very strict integrations reforms and must make it clear that the only way to stay in Europe is to obey the follow , respect civil liberties of people and contribute to the society . If anyone disagrees , they must be made to leave.\\n\\nAlso I\\ 'm tired of seeing this \ '' It won\\'t happen , they won\\'t integrate ! \ '' rhetoric over and over again . If we keep on going with this mentality , we will never learn from our past mistakes and grow . Instead of complaining and objecting to every solution that is offered , one must try to find ways of making it work .",Turkic,Turkish
Flaneusee,europe,"& gt ; Why is it bad to oppose muslims coming into our countries ? We fought them for centuries and now we are supposed to give up ? Because ? World changed ? Or people changed ? People never change , only cultures change . It\u00b4s like Nazi Germany not losing war and after hundreds of years trying to expand to the world with lighter version ( but still dangerous ) of their ideology.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make sense in the slightest . Do you seriously oppose refugees because your ancestor had fought with them ? I hope you realise we aren\\'t in 17th century anymore . \\n\\nYou can criticise the current refugee situation form many angles but playing \ '' they were the enemies of my great grandfathers\ '' is simply ridiculous and will result in no-one taking you seriously even though what you say might have truth to it . \\n\\nAnd the Nazi analogy is simply wrong . Yes Syrians are muslims , but are they effectively trying to spread their religion to Europe/anywhere in the world ? No . I disagree with teachings of Islam especially regarding to civil liberties of human beings but I also don\\'t agree with the \ '' enemy is coming , they\\ 're going to take over Europe\ '' rhetoric either . \\n\\nAs I said , you can oppose how the refugees are handled and you can object to being patronised by EU and no-one is going to call you a xenophobe for that . But if one demonises people and shun them because you believe them to be terrorist , enemies or whatever based on their religion , then it makes one a xenophobe , by definition .",Turkic,Turkish
Flaneusee,europe,"& gt ; I don\\'t see a problem with non-syrians trying to get in here as refugees - because morally they have the same right . Many of them are from countries that even in peace had a worse standard of living than Syria . Others migrants also had to escape from war or prosecution . I don\\'t see a reason why Syrians should have the right to settle in Europe and get social benefits while people from other distressed nations don\\'t get the same privilege - just because they are not from the \ '' flavour of the month\ '' conflict area.\\n\\nYou first complain about migrants saying that they\\ 're only after welfare . When I mention I don\\'t agree with this because Syrians are in a more dire situation , you try to play moral card and say those people should have the right to claim asylum too , not just Syrians because there\\ 's war . It seems to me that , you don\\'t have a solution because you simply don\\'t want a solution . You just don\\'t like refugees and you try to cover it up by inconsistent statements.\\n\\n & gt ; If we did that we would actually get refugees - people that ran away because their lives were genuinely threatened - and living in a camp where they are safe and have access to food and water is a big improvement . These are the people we should help . Not someone who just wants to get a better shot at life\\n\\nSo Syrians should be prioritised since they\\ 're running away from war ? Yet 2 paragraphs up you said \ '' I don\\'t see a reason why Syrians should have the right to settle ... ... .just because they are not from the \ '' flavour of the month\ '' conflict area.\ '' Which one are you arguing ?

You act like Third Punic War stemed from nothing without any historical context.\\n\\nWell if go all the way back to , first Punic war wasn\\'t even fault of Carthaginians or Romans in the first place . What I am saying is Carthage\\ 's insubordination didn\\'t come from out of nowhere.\\n\\n & gt ; Carthage was a client state to the Romans as far as they concerned and they really didn\\'t recovered spectacularly ( You can look at Polybius talking about the meaning of surrender for Carthage ) .\\n\\nYes , that\\ 's what I said as well but Carthage didn\\'t see it as such so I don\\'t see anything wrong with them trying to resist . Their only fault was that they lost . \\n\\n & gt ; Fair term ? What the fuck is a fair term ? Do you think the peace deal after the Second Punic War was something about being fair to both sides ? Do you even understand how peace deals work at antiquity ? This is not Concert of Europe we are talking about.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say treaty was supposed to be fair , only that it was obvious why Carthage didn\\'t want to adhere to it indefinitely after their debt was paid.\\n\\n & gt ; You can\\'t just call it a rhetorical question and be done with it . You are just trying to spin this \ '' Also a lot of citizens got killed , records show only a minuscule population of them were forced to slavery.\ '' into something you can defend.\\n\\nThe majority of Carthaginians in Carthage itself died and were killed then city was razed and only survivors were sold to slavery which were only a small part of the population of it . I am sure this is a well accepted fact.\\n\\n & gt ; Can\\'t you see how broad this is ? You are talking like a freshman who just started to take a course about genocide . By your definition why do we have the word genocide ? \\n\\nWhat a genocide is defined very clearly . Targeting a group defined by an identity with intent to destroy them indiscriminately , whether it be killing , deporting or by other means is genocide . \\n\\n & gt ; Most people would say that but that doesn\\'t mean academic community and UN recognizes them as such.\\n\\nThis has more to do with the weight of invoking the word genocide because it automatically gets equated with holocaust , plus countries won\\'t easily capitulate to a claim that will hurt their political standing , there is no greater shame than genocide as far as states are concerned , it will be a long time before a lot of historical genocides are properly identified and recognised but they won\\'t stay the same number as they are now that\\ 's for certain.\\n\\n & gt ; You are saying you don\\'t compare them continue to compare them in the next sentence . Bashing and praising of Napoleon has different reasons and different past than doing same to the Caesar . You could have not talk about Napoleon at all ? \\n\\nIt could be anyone else I don\\'t see why are you fixating on Napoleon , the point was that books about important figures can be contradictory even when working around the same facts , Napoleon was just a particularly obvious example due contrast of how he is seen .

ForKnee,europe,"Let me explain what I mean this way . For the argument\\ 's sake today a regime in Central Africa rises that targets everyone they consider to be \ '' Nubian\ '' and they group Nubian as anyone between Sahara and Congo , now none of the people they target might consider themselves Nubian , hell they perhaps don\\'t even know what a Nubian is and Nubia is not even Sub-Saharan ethnic group , this wouldn\\'t be a genocide ? \\n\\nConcepts such as ethnicity and race are already social constructs and fluid with time and place , just because they might have not existed by our current understand now or be widely accepted when an event took place or the targeted group might have not even identified with what they are being labelled as but it\\ 's still a genocide nonetheless because the perpetrators are targeting an identity ( I.E , ethnicity , race , religion , nationality ) with intent of destroying it . \\n\\n\ '' Races\ '' don\\'t exist to begin with so trying to find an agreeable objective definition of what constitutes as an identity rather than instead understanding the intent and action of those who target is not important .",Turkic,Turkish
ForKnee,europe,"I think you are misunderstanding my position from start I am saying Romans did not target an identity and was only arguing from a point of view that just because they didn\\'t understand the identity groups as we did , they couldn\\'t have . They could have targeted particular Carthaginians , an identity we today wouldn\\'t consider to be an ethnicity or a race but still a solid and tangible one . \\n\\nBecause again concepts such as ethnicity and race are fluid because they are social constructs reflecting the concurrent context of the time . So just because they didn\\'t target Phoenicians or all Carthaginian citizens as a whole doesn\\'t mean there couldn\\'t be a genocide , just because we understand nationality and ethnicity of Carthaginians and Phoenicians with our modern retroactive viewpoint . Such as how we currently see several Italian groups as Italians but say Venetians could have targeted Milanese for destruction and it still would be genocide even though they are all \ '' Italian\ '' from our viewpoint . \\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish
ForKnee,europe,"Genocide is a term that can be used retroactively very well because again terms such as race and ethnicity are fluid social constructs , what we wouldn\\'t consider one today could have existed as a distinct identity even before nationalism came to be . I never said you can compare today\\ 's nationalistic identities with the antiquity , hell you can\\'t even compare them with anything before 30-years-wars in Europe and much more later in rest of the world . I am saying identity is not only tied to current concepts of nationality or ethnicity , only arguing that just because we don\\'t consider something to be a distinct identity today ( People of city of Carthage as opposed to ethnicity of Phoenician or \ '' nationality\ '' ) does not mean they couldn\\'t target an identity .",Turkic,Turkish

It is absurd . \\n\\n & gt ; I have stated earlier that Europe has had periods of decline of these values\\n\\nFor majority of its history you mean ? Besides , what part of Europe ? Greece , Italy , France , Spain and Russia for example have different amounts of individual freedoms at different parts of history . Italy had several republics while France was an absolute monarchy for example.\\n\\n & gt ; It\u00b4s not a romantic view of europe , its what happened.\\n\\nWhat you described is what happened but your view of it is romantic , disregarding all the parts that has happened in Europe as not western and only accepting what you consider good to be as western . If you equate west to individual freedom and disregard everything else that has happened in Europe , the west , as not part of the west , that\\ 's romanticising it . \\n\\n & gt ; I also am very well aware that ancient greece was not a democratic heaven , in fact only a handfull of city states were democratic and they were outnumbered vastly by different oligarchies and dictatorships.\\nEven the democracies of ancient Greece had large number of slaves , often outnumbering actual citizens . \\n\\n & gt ; There was never anything like it in Persia untill Alexander temporarily imposed a greek administration on its provinces and that didnt last long because none of the populace adheres to western values and none of the elites do.\\n\\nThe reason Alexander\\ 's empire has fallen has less to do with personal freedoms he granted and more to do with him imposing his rule over an unwilling population . Also I am talking about rights of peoples under Achaemenid empire before Alexander\\ 's conquest . There is no more symbolic fight between west versus east than Greek city states and Persians . I assume your position on the \ '' West\ '' is the Greco-Roman civilization . \\n\\n & gt ; However , they employed a model of citizenship that was inherently racist\\n\\nYou are thinking of Rashidun caliphate which gave more rights to Arabs . Abbasids were made of many ethnicities and belief was the determining factor not race . \\n\\n & gt ; ultimately decided to err on the side of Allah , which stopped them from making progress beyond a certain point\\n\\nPolitical turmoil and military instability is what halted their progress . Although this is all unrelated I don\\'t think Abbasids or any society whose social standards are based on Abrahamic teachings of submission can be for individual freedoms . Abbasids did have a certain degree of individual freedom but that was a result of not adhering to every Abrahamic teaching rather than due them . Which is a phenomenon in contemporary Europe as well.\\n\\n & gt ; Sweden certainly has had periods of un-western societies , such as the vikings . However , dont confuse womens suffrage with democracy , the fact that everyone gets to vote is a radical idea . \\n\\nWeren\\'t you tone one advocating freedom of individual as the west .

I wasn\\'t talking about Pre-Christianity Sweden but rather 1600s . \\n\\n & gt ; The traditional democratic system is that property owners and those with \ '' skin in the game\ '' get to vote , in a world where women had only the household to work it doesnt surprise me that women werent allowed to vote.\\n\\nNeither me but isn\\'t the whole idea of only those with power having a say in the politics of the nation a little bit against your definition of \ '' the west\ '' ? \\n\\nYour definition of west seems too idealized and romanticized to me , picking certain aspects of Europe you consider quality and not accepting anything else as west but rather decline of it .

ForKnee,europe,"& gt ; First of all thats not a \ '' Roman position\ '' . \ '' Carthago delenda est\ '' is a phrase used by some senators ( especially by a wrinkly conservative bum called Cato the Elder ) who were in favor of conquering Carthage for a wide varity of reasons . They weren\\'t the majority until Carthage broke the deal which gave them a wonderful opportunity , though even then it wasn\\'t a insant change nor a complete one ( Livy , Polybius ) .\\n\\nYou can describe both Hitler\\ 's situation and Enver Pasha\\ 's situation with similar terms . Both started within political situations without intention to genocide anyone but became fringe parts of their parties until they got wonderful opportunities to follow through their aims . There were people in both the senate and various generals that were against it , of course but it\\ 's what happened.\\n\\n & gt ; 1 ) Why is the word Carthago used instead of P\u016bnici ? Carthago by itself doesn\\'t imply a intent for destruction of a ethnicity.\\n\\nCarthage wasn\\'t inhabited just by a single ethnicity , it was a network of various peoples and cities , famously it\\ 's army heavily relied on mercenaries.\\n\\n & gt ; 2 ) Why was Punic people in Rome and the surrounding towns ( or in Corsica or in Hispania Ulterior etc . ) wasn\\'t harmed ? \\n\\nThis is an assumption that runs through modern nationalist lines . They probably didn\\'t consider Punics who wasn\\'t part of Carthaginian oligarchic government which was loose to begin with as \ '' Carthaginian\ '' . That\\ 's actually anachronistic to draw that line now.\\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) Why there wasn\\'t any recorded attempt to destroy their culture or religion ? ( both flourished and incorporated during the Roman rule ) \\n\\nAgain Romans had different understanding of what constitutes citizenship , see their treatment of Gauls , they got slaughtered wholesale by Caesar but then they were not once they accepted the lordship of him.\\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) Fire ( started by the deserters ) caused the most damage to the city and killed a fair amount of population . Did Romans do that ? \\n\\nNow where is the definite proof the fire was set by deserters ? Because there is as many claims that the fire was delibrate by Romans , considering they also largely razed it afterwards.\\n\\n & gt ; 5 ) Why did they sold them into slavery ( which certainly was very different from the slave-like conditions of Jews and Poles ) instead of killing them ( there isn\\'t anything to imply they worked them in the mines to death ) ? \\n\\nBecause there wasn\\'t a specific chain of command that intended to organise this . Also a lot of citizens got killed , records show only a minuscule population of them were forced to slavery.\\n\\n & gt ; Thanks for that . I am going to read the ones containing familiar names but can you show me the part with \ '' genocide as a term is newer than the events\ '' to me ? I find that the most interesting for the official stand.\\n\\nIt\\ 's within the article named \ '' The Armenian Allegation of Genocide : The issue and the facts\ '' : \\n\\n & gt ; The term \ '' genocide\ '' did not exist prior to 1944 . The term was subsequently defined quite specifically by the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention of the Crime of Genocide . This high crime is now recognized by most nations , including the Republic of Turkey.\\n\\nI will remind you again I am not sure whether the Romans wanted to commit genocide or not . I am inclined towards not because they were more focused on breaking the high command of Carthaginian network by destroying Carthage itself as to wrestle the control of Mediterranean out of them wholesale because it proved they weren\\'t that capable of constant struggle with various Carthagian settlements and war of attrition was proving too costly . My argument is that the term genocide being new doesn\\'t mean it couldn\\'t be one , so I played devil\\ 's advocate with my answers to your points.\\n",Turkic,Turkish
ForKnee,europe,"I think as you said this is becoming a bit of back and forth empty talk . I\\ 'll reinstate that I don\\'t think Romans committed genocide Carthaginians but \ '' merely\ '' intended to destroy city of Carthage to cut the head off the snake to finish Carthage itself so they could annex rest of their territories after their debt was paid . \\n\\nI was simply arguing against the claim that a historical even can not be described as a genocide because it predates the term genocide , you argued that since peoples of ancient world had different conceptions of what makes a people , the term is misplaced , which is a fair point . I still think however genocide can be argued as any intent to destroy a people based on their distinguishable identity whether that identity is tangible or retroactive . \\n\\nMy point with the siege was that yes while it\\ 's true sieges often resulted in starvation and general population loss , even worse often lives of the besieged were forfeit and were at mercy of those who succeed the siege if they indeed did , that still doesn\\'t necessarily mean there couldn\\'t be a genocidal intent after the siege . Would you consider it not a genocide if 10 % of an ethnicity\\ 's population was actually deliberately killed to finish them off after 90 % died in an unrelated famine few years prior ? \\n\\nAlso there are a lot of books on Caesar , often very contradictory especially since he built a cult of personality around him and so did Augustus , comparable to Napoleon for example who saw Caesar as a hero , so they all say very different things , especially because he is also one of the favourites of those who like great man theory .

The problem started when Carthaginians decided to act like they are in a equal footing to Romans and tried to reassemble their army.\\n\\nRomans treated Carthage as a de facto subject nation and repeatedly humiliated them with when it came to dealing with Nubians being very provocative overall , they used Carthaginians war against Nubians as an excuse even after they considered the treaty null and Greek jurists agreed with the sentiment , I guess you could say they didn\\'t intend to destroy them if they happily got themselves integrated to Roman system further , it\\ 's fairly obvious there wasn\\'t a dream of peaceful coexistence on Roman side either . Also Cato the Elder wasn\\'t the only person in senate to support destruction of Carthage\\n\\n & gt ; The problem started when Carthaginians decided to act like they are in a equal footing to Romans and tried to reassemble their army . Choosing mercenaries who are somewhat hostile to the Romans didn\\'t help of course.\\n\\nThe problem started when Romans didn\\'t want to see Carthage as anything but as a satellite state under Roman domination , after they recovered rather spectacularly from previous wars they wanted to see them stagnant . Should Carthage have been just subservient to Roman demands when Nubians constantly raided them and Romans sided with Nubians every time ? There was no mutual understanding , only that Romans wanted a weak carthage and when they considered them to be stepping outside their boundaries ( which were definitely not fair terms ) they destroyed them.\\n\\n & gt ; But this doesn\\'t matter . You said \ '' Are there no sieges which were genocidal ? \ '' after I told most of the loses happened during the siege . \ '' Also a lot of citizens got killed , records show only a minuscule population of them were forced to slavery.\ '' you said this which seems like you are thinking that major portion of the people killed systematically . I wouldn\\'t think that if this wasn\\'t a genocide discussion but it is a genocide discussion . Sorry but this part is just bad.\\n\\nIt was a rhetorical question.\\n\\n & gt ; But if you broaden what is a identity that much you can argue literally every war is a genocide . This would weaken the term itself and the guilt come with it more than anything.\\n\\nIt\\ 's about targeting an identity indiscriminately , rather than what that identity is and I would say there are more genocides in history than recognised ones.\\n\\n & gt ; Napoleon certainly was a fan of him but the cult of personality Napoleon created is different than those classical examples .

Not to mention Greeks , Armenians and Jews often held high positions in bureaucracy and trade . Istanbul was more cosmopolitan and varied both in terms of culture and authority back in Ottoman Empire than it is now , which is largely homogeneous . You also already started with an entirely false premise that Ottoman empire was always static on how it ruled and whats its principles are , they changed a lot from war to war and Sultan to Sultan . The suggestion that it should have stuck to old ways despite it not working anymore and why they became as vulnerable as they were even though once they were thought to be impossible to remove is also because they failed to adapt to changes and thought themselves better , a suggestion you are giving now , 300 years later after they already made that mistake and collapsed for it.\\n\\nAlso Ottomans didn\\'t try to administrate with terror but balancing local governance with loyalty to state by appointing state loyal people to administration from governed areas . The \ '' terror\ '' happened because they got corrupt and incapable.\\n\\n & gt ; One hundread years later all that was gone , the Ottoman way or we could say the Turkish way was gone , the european way took over most of it.\\n\\nThe \ '' Ottoman way\ '' being what here , exactly ? An outdated model of Empire that belonged better to middle-ages ? Would you say the same about French state ? When the Ancien Regime fell and Republic came to existence . Was the \ '' French way\ '' gone ? \\n\\nYes , Ottoman way was gone but because Ottoman way was aiming to be a multi-ethnic state based on religious hierarchy with economy depending largely on its position in global trade , as well as its extensive bureaucracy and small time core army and it\\ 's decentralised ruling system . Ottomans lost in wars when they were still doing the things \ '' The Ottoman way\ '' because it no longer worked , their economy became vulnerable and their armies fell behind the Europeans , by the time WW1 hit they did take some measures to modernise the state but it wasn\\'t enough . AFter WW1 why would Turkish state stick to \ '' Ottoman\ '' way when they lost all their territories and everything that made Ottoman Empire ? It would be completely delusional and pathetic , instead they recreated a state that was better fit for its conditions , a lot of mistakes were made on that aim and a lot of cruelty but that was due how extreme Three Pashas took the ideal of a nation-state with Turkish ruling class and a Muslim population.\\n\\n & gt ; The \ '' Europeanization\ '' , the conversion to secularism and so on was forced by the army . \\n\\nCompletely untrue . \ '' Europeanisation\ '' started with Sultans 150 years earlier but army , especially Janissaries were resistant to change and especially modernisation , they didn\\'t want to be recreated into a professional , uniform army in the image of European ones , they kept revolting and revolting until they were slaughtered by another section of the army ( Spahis ) . The first efforts to recreate the state was in Tanzimat Period , where religious classes were abolished and technically citizens were equal under law with a lot of other modernisation efforts but in practise it wasn\\'t so hopeful . Young Turk coup before WW1 turned the state into a parliamentary monarchy with monarch was merely head of the state as a figure alike to those of concurrent European states . These all happened because they proved to work , that\\ 's also Ottoman way , by the way , Ottomans in 1453 as willing to adopt to foreign concepts to better of them . The \ '' Ottoman way\ '' was one of meritocracy where ethnicity didn\\'t matter and an Italian or Frenchman could find work as soon as a Turk if they proved they were capable , even in their conquest of Constantinople they were accepted the offer of Orban . Their \ '' way\ '' was not suicidal conservatism , that was the reason Ottomans stagnated and fell , it was a short coming not a principle . \\n\\nThe army in after WW1 , Ataturk in particular built a democratic nation-state because that\\ 's what he believed to work best and was ideal . The \ '' forced\ '' secularisation happened much latter , after 1980s when army took \ '' Kemalism\ '' to extreme and started a campaign of extreme secularisation , which backfired , they also tried to Turkify Kurds forcibly which also backfired . Yet this is way after the \ '' Ottoman\ '' way changed already and way later than when UK and French influence over Turkey already waxed.\\n\\n & gt ; You did not , It was forced on you , by war , by peace , by modernizing the countries to European standard.\\n\\nForced by whom ? The Ottoman Sultans who kept losing wars and the corrupt bureaucracy which made the empire unable to compete with European powers anymore ? The Janissaries that refused to modernise in light of new technological developments even though when they were founded they were arguably the first modern professional army of the world ? The necessity to force 300 years of modernisation to 50 years was forced upon Turks and everyone else Ottomans used to rule by Ottomans themselves . Young Turks and later Ataturk did what Ottomans forgot to do for 300 years , their stagnation and extreme conservatism was their downfall not their strength . Japan is a similar example whose extreme traditionalism and conservatism brought their downfall followed by a period of extreme nationalism and army cruelty due this rapid pace of change , instead of more natural gradual evolution.\\n\\n & gt ; Which also explain why some people still dream of their long lost muslim empire that was stolen from them.\\n\\nThere are as many that dream of a \ '' Turkic Empire\ '' in Central Asia and as many that want neither but a unique Turkish state neither west nor east . A lot of this comes from the nationalism that\\ 's taught here both culturally and in education rather than any \ '' continuous consciousness\ '' from times of Ottomans . \\n\\nYou know nothing about neither Ottoman history nor comparable struggle of other Eastern empires who once were seen as immovable , such as China or who were extremely traditional such as Japan but failed to keep up with European advances after 1700s . The rapid modernisation was a necessity to survive , not a grand design by Europeans , which wanted to keep their colonies modern enough to be functional but overall traditional and divided . So Turkish state came to be what it is despite Allied wishes in WW1 , not because of it . Also similar phenomenos happened in Europe were other countries were forced to rapidly modernise their state structures when challenged , such as Prussia during 1700s , Austria during Napoleonic wars and Sweden during 30 years war . Yet you of course draw an arbitrary line to ignore this as if whole of Europe never got influenced or influence each other based on struggle and necessity . \\n",Turkic,Turkish

This are historical known facts.\\n\\nYes , also Austria , even before 1830 . That\\ 's not what you said in your post however is it ? Also the \ '' lesser known\ '' fact is taught in the schools here . In fact you ignored capitulations to French in 1600s and hiring of French advisers during the Tanzimat Period ( 1850s ) . As well as the help Ottomans needed during Crimean war.\\n\\n & gt ; The thing is , it seams you Turks just don\\'t learn what really happened at that time , but who would want to learn that his country is born on mass murders and being schooled by its neighbourgs ? \\n\\nThis is where everything is disconnected from reality . First of all no one denies Armenians got killed , they deny that it was an attempt to genocide , now I disagree with that but that\\ 's beyond the point.\\n\\n & gt ; The only one bending history and refusing to admit the genocides is your government for pretty much a century now.\\n\\nAre you a state ? \\n\\nYou said : \\n\\n & gt ; But France and the UK got what they wanted , for Ottoman to be out of Europe , North Africa and the middle east and act as a puppet state that would europeanize itself and become a buffer state.\\n\\nWhich is wrong . Primarily UK wanted to a colonial state similar to those they did in Arabia and India , to have an unpopular ruler in an occupied zone to be dependant on them so they could administer the place as a colonial territory while using the ruler to their advantage . They didn\\'t get what they wanted . Also the \ '' Europeanisation\ '' of the place goes back to 1800s not WW1 and it started due several factors , UK and France dismantling Ottoman territory was result of Ottoman incompetence and inability to progress because of various obstacles internally and some externally . The reformation efforts are older than Turkey , Young Turks were a product of this Tanzimat period of reform which \ '' Europeanisation\ '' happened , not the engineers of it . So no there is no \ '' puppet buffer state\ '' as you claim there is but a failed attempt to create one.\\n\\nYours is a complete revision and you lack the necessary general knowledge on middle-eastern history to make as bold claims as you do , which has no basis in reality but is purely speculation and rationalisation in your head.\\n",Turkic,Turkish

And cultural difference issues is actually more observed in nationalists , rather than conservatives though in Turkey many nationalists are also conservatives so , it\\ 's a bit tricky.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say cultural issues are not more observed in nationalists , they are . What I am saying is faith issues while might be existent in conservatives are a secondary issue and common sentiment among all political spectrums are about ungratefulness and arrogance.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's the issue actually , I\\ 'm not prejudiced at all . I even like Turkish people , but , from my long experience and from the others , the things are like I\\ 'm saying . It\\ 's not prejudice at all.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t mean you are not prejudiced just because you might like a group of people . You have already passed judgment on a whole group of people without considering them on an individual basis . When you say \ '' Turks are violent\ '' , that\\ 's prejudice , because you are judging the whole based on actions of individuals . Cypriots do have similar traits , in fact I have seen more stories about the possessive boyfriend in news of Cypriot , which is a common stereotype of Turks but you judge Cypriots on an individual basis while you judge Turks on a group basis.\\n\\n & gt ; Not really . They tend to categorise Turkish people in Cyprus by settlers and \ '' tourists\ '' , but not Turkish people . We know that some settlers are not like that , and people in Turkey are also not all like that . But , when you came to Cyprus , yes , there can be a prejudice about you since people can think if you\\ 're some maniac like other \ '' tourists\ '' .\\n\\nYou make too many contradictory comments , again last time you assert a position but disprove it in the next sentence . This is exactly the problem I have with many Cypriots , they don\\'t admit having prejudices against us while making generalizations about us all the time . Not only that , Turkey is a very polarized country , not only its politics but its regional cultures and even members of same political ideologies.\\n\\n & gt ; You know that I\\ 'm not talking about \\'74 , right ? \\n\\nYou can\\'t do that , the current situation and entanglement of Northern Cyprus and Turkey is inseparable from the events of Turkish invasion . \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's not about making black money though but eh.\\n\\nBeing a tax haven is not about black money , while it is questionable practice , it is how several smaller countries are so rich , since they benefit a lot per capita from having such laws that encourage business owners to direct their money flow through them.\\n\\nNorthern Cyprus wouldn\\'t have it because they are not part of EU and they don\\'t have such laws , it is not about illegal money laundering . \\n\\n & gt ; Well , nobody is saying anything about Turkish military intervention of \\'74 but , hm . And , actually , nobody is for a separate north too.\\n\\nIf there was no Turkish military invention there likely would be no Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus any more , they would have been either deported like the Balkan Turks or completely assimilated . \\n\\nSo saying Northern Cyprus would be better without Turkey is an absurd hypothetical scenario . So Cypriots often have this high horse about rhetorical instances of a better Cypriot in their own creations . Imagining a situation only where Turkey intervented to stop the actions of Greek junta then left and everything was how it has been once again.\\n\\nI\\ 'll repeat again personally I am not in support of Turkish occupation of Cyprus OR a military intervention in Cyprus . Any Cypriots in danger should have been deported to Turkey if they chose so . Brits would have probably intervened anyway against a Greek coup.\\n\\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish

ForKnee,europe,"& gt ; Generalised platitudes again with zero specifics . \\n\\nWhen someone makes a comment suggesting a specific case was exceptional , you provide a general statement to argue that it wasn\\'t specifically exceptional , because you are arguing exception versus general . If you try to disprove an exceptional case with another exceptional case , that doesn\\'t make it less exceptional and instead is whataboutism , you prefer that as an argument ? I would guess so actually , I am certain you would enjoy a pissing contest about who did what horrible things historically . \\n\\nSo , yes , my comment was general statement because I am not interested in making arguments about more brutal or bloody cases , I just gave couple examples above of exceptionally brutal and bloody occurrences , in hopes of giving you the hint of what exceptional cases of history are . If you want more I can give , such as Julius Ceaser\\ 's treatment of Gauls , Mongolian treatment of the Chinese and Assyrians in general , Leopold\\ 's Congo for occupation instead of war . \\n\\n & gt ; This is common to those that romanticise Ottoman empire and islamic civilization.\\n\\nCreating a strawman to argue against without taking into consideration anything I have said . I don\\'t romanticize either , if anything I dislike Ottomans , yet you see anything less than your own negative opinion of them as romanticizing , placing your own subjective standards as an objective measurement , which wouldn\\'t bother me if you had more knowledge in the area . \\n\\nI am not ignoring their wrongdoings or shortcomings thus I am not romanticizing them , I don\\'t even like them , you are the one focusing here specifically on one civilization while ignoring others , as an argument of alleged exceptional actions . Who is romanticizing whom when your selective conscience is targeting what you consider to be the other while ignoring what you consider the in-group ? \\n\\nBetter yet I think what you are doing is a bitter \ '' revenge\ '' for certain European leftists about white guilt because of slavery or perhaps idolizing Islamic caliphates during their peak , so you are not arguing about your own wrong statement about exception but rather as a general rule to prove that \ '' Others were worse ! \ '' . Which is whataboutism.\\n\\n & gt ; They were codified within civil law , and said children were then used as shock troops for further conquest as they grew a bit . \\n\\nYes , devshirme or otherwise known as blood tax was a systemic draft and enrolled kids into a specific education that made them either administrators or soldiers . In that it is forced slavery . You can\\'t think of any other examples of forced draft , levies or serfdom , really ? It is not similar to Atlantic slave trade for example , because devshirmes while technically slaves in that they were forced to service , were paid and could hold positions of power way greater than the average citizen . Not to say one is better or not , since Ottomans themselves were also involved in slave trade , like all of the empires powerful enough at the time until abolishment of it.\\n\\nAlso Janissaries were definitely NOT shock troops . Shock troops of Ottoman army were the cavalry , not elite infantry . Janissaries were support troops and were often in reserve , they also served as the Sultan\\ 's personal royal guard and were sent around the different parts of empire that didn\\'t have Spahis to bring local order.\\n\\nYou are completely and absolutely wrong and have no idea what you are talking about if you think Janissaries were shock troops when they were elite soldiers used generally to clean up enemy army . You also don\\'t know more than half of the Ottoman army was actually cavalry and janissaries were not a main body.\\n\\n & gt ; Codification of this barbarism in law over centuries is what allowed Ottoman conquest to be as powerful as it was , and as exceptionally brutal as it was.\\n\\nYes , national draft made powerful armies , that\\ 's why stronger empires switched to a draft system instead of relying on mercenaries and levies , making organized and professional armies . Which Janissaries and Tercios are considered to be first in modern era . What I have given was a side comment however , not related to discussion at hand about an exceptional case.\\n\\n & gt ; And eventually it broke down largely because said stolen children started to turn against them as they overextended.\\n\\nThe \ '' stolen\ '' children only turned against Sultans because Sultans wanted to abolish the system . Young Osman dissatisfied with performance of Janissaries wanted abolish them for a national army but they didn\\'t want their rights revoked , which at the time grow to such degree they were basically political and military elite above most of the society . Other times where they revolted were times that Ottomans wanted to modernize the army , since Janissaries were exceptionally traditionalist . \\n\\nA lot of the mistreatment of locals were done by the janissaries , by the way , some of the most brutal governors and events were all devshirme children . There is even a case where Sultan helped Serbians against Janissaries , because they were an uncontrollable , terrible bunch . An obvious mistake to rely on zealous and extremely traditionalist soldiers for local security . In comparison to janissaries , Timarli Spahis , the drafted cavalry and close equivalent of Knights of Europe , has way less mistreatment.\\n\\nA focus on janissary system in specific without taking into consideration anything else , ignoring rest of the world shows both a lack of knowledge and a deliberate ideological aim . Obviously not interested in actual rational discussion or objective consideration but pushing an agenda and using specific events in history to justify it . \\n",Turkic,Turkish

Gaethan,AskEurope,"AKP , or Justice and Development Party is one of the more recent additions to Turkish politics but they\\ 've succeeded some other parties , which were largely unsuccessful . To understand their views and their voters , one must examine the political history of the country . Turkey was founded on secular ideals but not everyone agreed with these , it wasn\\'t much of a people\\ 's revolution . For several decades , the state suppressed Islamism , or rather anything it perceived as Islamism : For example , for a long while it was illegal to wear a headscarf in any education institution ( including universities ) or in state departments . AKP was born out of that decades of victimisation ; when Erdogan , who had been arrested for reading a poem that criticized the regime in public , ( and some others ) founded the party , many Muslims saw it as a chance at religious freedom . You probably know how it turned out once AKP took power.\\n\\nCHP , or Republican People\\ 's Party is one of the oldest parties in the republic , and it is the oldest according to official history ( some sources claim the Communist Party is older ) . CHP was founded by the original MPs of the Turkish Parliament , during the revolution , and it still follows those guiding principles more or less . However , in practice , its rhetoric has shifted towards an anti-AKP one . It seems as if the party\\ 's only goal now is replacing AKP , they have no clear policy goals . Parliamentary sessions often turn into shouting matches between AKP and CHP MPs , and each party opposes proposals by the other on principle , regardless of the contents of the proposals . They used to have a stronger rhetoric , but they lost their spirit when their leader resigned after Erdogan revealed a video recording of him having extra-marital sex in a hotel.\\n\\nMHP , or Nationalist Movement Party is one of the lesser known parties abroad . They are pretty much Turkic supremacists . While they are vocally Muslim , they don\\'t advocate for Islamist policies . Their policies are classically conservative , sometimes economically leaning towards socialism . They advocate for raising the minimum wage , they sometimes even talk about basic income . However , the bulk of their rhetoric is about a strong state , with a strong military commanded by a strong leader . Their leadership has recently conceded that Erdogan might become this strong leader , though their voters aren\\'t entirely convinced.\\n\\nHDP , or Peoples\\ ' [ sic ] Democratic Party is the most recent one among the major parties . It surfaced as the major Kurdish party after the previous one , DTP was shut down by order of the Supreme Court over allegations of supporting terrorism . Like previous Kurdish parties , it advocates for greater freedom for the Kurdish people living in Turkey , such as the right to receive education primarily in Kurdish ; they are also the furthest-left party in parliament , they frequently take anti-war , pro-LGBT , feminist and environmentalist stances . Unfortunately , a lot of people see them as terrorist supporters , referring to their entry into the parliament as a \ '' PKK infiltration of government\ '' . Don\\'t quote me on this but I think HDP also has the largest percentage of women MPs and is the only party with multiple people as co-leaders.\\n\\nThere are numerous other parties , but none of them have any seats in parliament and aren\\'t likely to get any in the near future because in Turkey , you need to get at least 10 % of the popular vote to get any seats .

Its like arguing how Spain/Portugal colonized and killed locals in South America in a thread related to riots in Brazil . Or arguing how Soviets killed locals with Holodomor in Ukraine/Russia conflict . Heck , they make a lot more sense than this , because they at least have **some** a connection with countries . But bringing Armenian genocide in a current topic about Turkey/PKK conflict makes 0 sense . \\n\\nAgain : *\ '' So is this thread about \ '' Turkey does something connected with the Armenians\ '' ? \ '' *\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; The critical part of any state is its founding , am I wrong ? \\n\\nNo , Armenian genocide has nothing to do with founding Turkey , not even eastern borders . Treaty of Kars would be more releated to it , since its about borders and signed by both Armenia ( Soviet ) and modern Turkey ( Ankara goverment ) . Even then , it has nothing to do with this topic . We arent arguing how Turkey founded here , right ? If you wan na be smart about it , talk about Dersim rebellion . Its both connected to modern Turkey and somehow releated to Turkey/PKK conflict . But Armenian genocide has NOTHING to do with **this topic** , **NOTHING** .",Turkic,Turkish
GodwinsLaw64,europe,"& gt ; Err no . The current conflict with the Kurds just didn\\'t start yesterday , there are historical parallels and triggers for that , that\\ 's why I brought it up.\\n\\nYou do know the main force used in genocide was local Kurdish militias , right ? You do notice that today Kurdish populated areas are all old Armenian or Assyrian places , right ? So , Kurds were happy and ones the who \ '' benefited\ '' from so-called genocide , and Turkish state did nothing to \ '' stop\ '' them from benefiting . You see where im going ? Turkish/Kurdish problem has 0 connections with genocide . Literally 0.\\n\\n & gt ; If the US does something connected with the English Americans , you bring up their treatment of those people . \\n\\nSo is this thread about \ '' Turkey does something connected with the Armenians\ '' ? Huh , i must\\ 've missed that part , please help me.\\n\\n & gt ; If we were talking about AK Party\\ 's rise to power , it wouldn\\'t be mentioned . \\n\\nBelieve me , people mention it in every Turkey releated thread , no limit with Ataturk or AKP or Turkish state . Every . One . Just search my post history with toolbox . [ Example ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/39l8nj/newlysurfaced_video_footage_corroborates/cs4iol2/ ? context=1 ) \\n\\n & gt ; The Ottoman Empire and the modern Turkish State are wholly different , because in the beginning of the 20th century , the remnants of the Ottoman Government greatly changed the ethnic balance in Anatolia and that has had repercussions till today . \\n\\nSo , it has nothing to do with critical part of \ '' modern Turkish state\ '' , okay . \\n\\nEven if it did , it what connection that has to this TOPIC , i was actually asking that with my questions .",Turkic,Turkish

GunBro,europe,"I wish we publicly recognize the genocide , but it is not going to happen in near history . edit : not- because we don\\'t accept what happened , but because of the reasons I explain below . /end edit\\n\\nBut let me ask you something , do you think people will look into deeper , when it comes to rights of the non-Christian people ? I can assure you , the main reason of denial is this . Because Republic of Turkey is the follower of Ottoman Empire , but don\\'t forget , big majority of Turkish people was living in rural areas , and they even didn\\'t spoke the same language with the elite.\\n\\nDo you think Greece will accept the raping and plundering of Agean Cities , after WW1 ? No-one will look into it.\\n\\nWhen Republic of Turkey established , almost all of banking and manufacturing was in the hands of \ '' non-muslims\ '' ( I\\ 'm not classifying them , it was a classification in Ottomans ) . New Republic depended in a diverse population . In the first years , we had this \ '' Independence Courts\ '' which was a court of justice . And Turkish government harshly punished everyone who thought or acted againsts freedom of race , ethnicity , religion and so-on.\\n\\nAnd do you know what , nowadays almost half of the people hate Ataturk and first government because they killed religious fanatics and fundamental islamists in those courts.\\n\\nLong story short , almost every reasonable person in turkey is sorry , but you need to realize Ottoman Empire was a dynasty who acted only behalf of themselves , not for the turkish people . And when Turkish people try to say something reasonable and try to explain themselves , their ancestors and the difficulties of that times , people just ignore and close the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish
GunBro,europe,"No one has the \ '' option\ '' of making a genocide . Ottoman Empire had it\\ 's own facists at the end of it\\ 's era , and they did horrible things .

We have been told in our schools that Greek and Armenians killed our people for the sake of destroying the empire and enslaving Turkish people . Which I see in your comment , you have a minor hate against Turkish people . Or you have been teached that way.\\n\\nLook , Ottoman Empire has been the most diverse Empire in the history , and despite the long ruling , the has been a little revolts until 19th century.\\n\\nYou killed people in Greece , Cyprus and in our independence war . We killed Greeks in 19th and 20th century . But it\\ 's been a long time and I can assure you every Turkish is sorry and emberassed for that.\\n\\nBut don\\'t forget you need to be humble to accept the apology and realize it wasn\\'t a planned thing against Greeks or any other minority.\\n\\nEdit : I recommed you to look into establishment of the Turkish Republic and the relation between Republic and Empire . Because you need to know that Ottoman Empire was not a completely Turkish dynasty . Many of our high-end officers was from other ethnicities . The turkish people had less activity in the market , then any other minority . Because only thing the Turkish people did was self-agriculture and military activities . And of course being a government officer . Every single manufacturing and bank was in the hands of non-turkish people . Because almost every nation in Ottoman Empire lived in diversity , until the Balkan Wars.\\n",Turkic,Turkish
