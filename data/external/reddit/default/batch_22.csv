What a dick.\\n\\n & gt ; I believe that right to self-determination includes the right to democratically enter into and leave behind any sort of obligation.\\n\\nYeah , i have to say right away , i don\\'t believe in the right to self-determination .

But imaginary units of multiple people , those don\\'t and shouldn\\'t have the right to self determination\\n\\n & gt ; The idea that a polity could enter into but not leave a federation - as it is law in the United States - completely at odds with democratic values.\\n\\nDemocracy is a great system , but it\\ 's not everyone\\ 's lord and savior .

Wow , such amaze\\n\\nThey never even had major political movements in them , for fuck\\ 's sake . How could you say they\\ 're \ '' matured\ '' ? Neither of them was at war on their own soil , while the EU pretty much is with Northern Cyprus.\\n\\n & gt ; Neither the US nor Russia should be regarded as well-functioning federations.\\n\\nNever said we should copy them entirely . From Russia we should take the national personal autonomy and from the US i would take the states\\ ' right to make laws and kind of the mentality towards the states , especially in education.\\n\\n & gt ; Why would the Benelux and Sweden serve as role models as far as municipalities are concerned ? \\n\\nBecause the municipalities are highly autonomous there .

Istencsaszar,europe,"Nationalism is primarily an old phenomenon . It originates in a time where people , due to the language and distance barrier , never interacted with people of other nations ( or rarely ) . The rural/urban divide is simply that urban areas are more progressed socially and economically in general and therefore less likely to adopt the ideas that were designed to make sense in that environment 150 years ago",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; Quite the opposite , nationalism is extremely young . Before that class and religious differences were far more important.\\n\\nwe\\ 're both saying the same thing , just on a different scale . obviously for something that is such a hot topic in actual politics today , nationalism is a pretty goddamn old rusty thing , at its 150-175 year-ish history now . Others like immigration , integration , human rights , stuff like that are way younger.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's origin rests in the fact that written revolutionary material was dispersed along linguistic lines , and that formed the basis of \\'national identity\\ ' . In some places that identity became non-ethnic , like America and France , and in others it was hijacked into ethnic identitarianism , Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\nQuite the opposite . I think it was the westerners that hijacked the idea of a strong national identity into a generic \ '' anyone in the country = inside group , anyone outside = outside group\ '' , which mainly benefited their rulers , who played the game of thrones above the people . For the great powers of the early 1800s , this was awesome . They could alienate the entire population of the other great powers , in the public eye they turned them from \ '' my neighbor\ '' to \ '' someone loyal to xy other nation who i should distrust and i have nothing in common with\ '' . This is the attitude that crept into eastern europe , but without the great powers who would have the capacity or will to brainwash them into thinking same way . Here , it developed more naturally , along the ethnic and cultural divides that wouldn\\'t follow the arbitrary lines that separated one king\\ 's turf from another\\ 's . But the thing is , the clich\u00e9 of homogeneous nation states did arrive anyway , since this was \ '' in the package\ '' with the other liberal ideas of the french revolution like equality and democracy and that type of stuff . And so the nation state also became associated with the new free society everyone was - rightfully - demanding from the different monarchies of eastern europe . The rest is history",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"nationalism mainly developed in england and central france , neither are really places where you\\ 'd expect people to meet other nations en masse . Croatia obviously never developed nationalism by itself , it was influenced and/or created by the already-in-place German and Hungarian nationalism , both of which were inspired by the original French nationalism\\n\\ntherefore , obviously nationalism was designed to work in homogeneous areas with homogeneous people , which is why cultural genocide sprees like Germanization and Hungarization happened , but also more recently Bosnia.\\n\\n & gt ; Funny , my rural ancestors got moved about by various morons from various empires , countries , nations , they spoke several languages before an urban traitor in the capital did.\\n\\nWell the way i understand it , the cultural/social progress went like this : \\n1 , - aristocratic society where nations don\\'t matter and therefore is tolerant and accepting with different nations \\n2 , - nationalistic society where classes are formally gone ( still present but that\\ 's a different story ) and is culturally intolerant because of the rampant nationalism \\n3 , - modern urban society\\n\\nback then , rural places were still in the first phase , urban areas in the 2nd , while today , the rural areas caught up to the 2nd , but the urban areas are now in for something new which is hindered by the countryside . so yeah , I\\ 'm gon na \ '' spinning in my illusion\ '' , which was in no way challenged by your comment",Uralic,Hungarian

Istencsaszar,europe,"i really don\\'t care , even if i did \ '' notice a pattern\ ''",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,How the fuck are these two things related,Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"Well first off , Orthodoxy somehow survived being under Hungarian rule for 900 years . So did all the Slavic nations and Romanians in Hungary . Compare , say , how well West Slavic nations survived under German rule ( Ostsiedlung ) . Or how well Arabs survived under Spanish rule . Or how well the Irish survived under British rule.\\n\\nAs I also already said , under Hungarian rule was the first law on religious freedom enacted in Transylvania , that guaranteed the religiously incredibly diverse population to practice their religion freely . Those communities ( protestant , catholic , orthodox , unitarian , other Protestant branches I have no idea about , also Armenians , who I think are Miaphysite ? ) remained basically intact for centuries.\\n\\nAlso there was for example a joint uprising of Hungarian and Romanian peasants against the nobles ( 1437 )",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; the \ '' minorities\ '' that they ruled over for hundreds of years in not the most pleasant ways.\\n\\nwell , it\\ 's a fact that it wasn\\'t pleasant and I can emphatize , but Hungary was still the most tolerant towards minorities in pretty much all of Europe ( which is sad , i would really expect it from the west to be better , but they aren\\'t ) .\\n\\nThe first country with freedom of religion was Transylvania , ruled by Hungarians . The first country to enact experimental minority protection laws was also Hungary in 1849 . So it\\ 's not like there weren\\'t efforts.\\n\\n & gt ; If they were enlightened , if they allowed the minorities to preserve their religions , customs , languages and didn\\'t treat them as 3rd-class citizens\\n\\nyou know that this was exactly this way under the dualist system ? there was nothing on your citizenship that said \ '' this guy isn\\'t Hungarian , treat him worse\ '' . The legit complaints that you could have was the language use and English language schooling ( which was , albeit possible , limited ) . Voting rights were limited not by ethnicity , but by wealth , so a wealthy non-Hungarian could just as well vote and once again *poor Hungarians could also not vote* . Probably something about religion too but Hungarians are very divided religion-wise and it was even more so back then . And since Hungarians themselves aren\\'t all Catholic at all , I find it hard to believe that Orthodoxy was particularly oppressed , especially since Orthodox priests were on the countrywide religious council ( 10 seats out of 56 or 18 % , this is roughly the same as how many Orthodox people there were in the country ) , and Orthodoxy had the status of *religio recepta* since 1791 , the same status Protestant religions had .",Uralic,Hungarian

Hungary has been cut from its almost entire history in a series of incredible historical injustices in 1919-1920 .
