We had \\'serious\\ ' documentaries and talk shows focusing on divisive topics or political issues - I loved the science documentaries of \\'Quark\\ ' for example , thanks to my parents enjoying them with me and explaining stuff.\\n\\nBerlusconi\\ 's TVs turned the tables : mostly shows devoid of any content apart from dancing girls and silly scripts . Mini-starlets were generated continuosly , so lots of girls had the dream of getting in there . There message was \ '' hey , studying is for losers , come here and have fun and be famous ! \ '' . I\\ 'll mention the name \ '' Uomini e donne\ '' shuddering ( a gym rat guy sitting on a LITERAL THRONE as several girls had to woo him so he could pick one - the \\'courtship\\ ' would last weeks and the various characters would make the rounds of all TV channels being interviewed as bringers of Important Truths . They would earn lots of money just by touring around and posing - how can you convince a kid that it\\ 's worthwhile to pursue an education when they see that ? ) \\n \\nOnce he got in charge he also had control of the 3 state channels and pretty much all became the same . The most blatant example was the news program of Rai1 , the leading and most respected state channel , which started devoting half of its time to issues like how to solve your dog\\ 's digestion problems or what will StupidBimbo24 wear for her marriage - it truly became a parody of a news program.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying that it\\ 's all his fault , as of course there must have been a receptive audience for that to work , but he created and exploited a kind of \\'perfect resonance\\ ' and we now have the harvest : lots of people who don\\'t appreciate culture , don\\'t read books and have trouble understanding non-basic written texts , ready to follow who shouts louder and that forget what happened two days after they stop seeing it.\\n\\nI might seem to be exaggerating , but I have a friend that works as a tutor in a school to prepare people for the national lawyers state exam . She is constantly shocked by the fact that the MAJORITY of these aspiring lawyers , with Law degrees , CAN NOT write using correct grammar , let alone understand complex matters of rights .

We don\\'t even have a verb for \\'to spell\\'.\\n * Word order is quite free , with the subject often being optional . This allows for slightly different meanings : \ '' Vieni ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' Are you coming ? \ '' , \ '' Vieni tu ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' Is it you that will come or someone else ? \ '' , \ '' Tu vieni ? \ '' - & gt ; \ '' What about you ?

Arnold_Layne,europe,"As required by the mods , here is the full text of the article : \\n\\nEVERY winter , town squares all over Europe are filled by the hum of Christmas choirs . Towns in northern Italy follow this tradition too , but with a twist . Singers abandon Santa costumes in favour of the distinctive feathered hats of the Alpini , tough soldiers mostly recruited from remote Alpine villages . The Alpini repertoire is different too . Christmas songs are swapped for haunting ballads about the cruelty of war . These canti Alpini\u2014and the soldiers who sing them\u2014have become part of the region\u2019s cultural heritage . \\n\\nAt first glance , this is surprising . After all , to start with , the Alpini were a decidedly military outfit , established in 1872 to protect the new Italian state from its enemies to the north . Their baptism of fire came during the first world war , fighting the Austro-Hungarians high in the Dolomites . Conditions were terrible : avalanches and frostbite were a constant threat . Despite this , the Alpini notched up some impressive wins . They also fought courageously in the second world war , distinguishing themselves in battles from Ethiopia to the Russian steppe . \\n\\nUp to a point , the continued popularity of the Alpini can be explained by their reputation for courage . Their songs reflect their sacrifices . \u201cAmong rocks , wind and snow , we are forced to stay awake all night , \u201d one explains . \u201cWe started out as twenty-nine , \u201d begins another . \u201cNow we\u2019re only seven.\u201d This pride transcends the songs themselves . Monte Grappa , a famous Alpini victory in 1917 , is still commemorated on street signs across the country . Other songs , meanwhile , juxtapose Alpini bravery with the supposed incompetence of other Italian soldiers . In one , the choir warns Luigi Cadorna , the Italian commander in the first world war , that he\u2019ll need the Alpini \u201cif he wants to advance\u201d . The regular conscripts \u201care too weak\u201d to do the job , while other troops \u201care mafiosi\u201d . \\n\\nBut if some Alpini songs stumble towards chauvinism , their enduring reputation is down to their stark anti-war message . \u201cA \u2018happy\u2019 death has never existed , \u201d explains Massimo Marchesotti , conductor of the Alpini choir in Milan . \u201cWe sing about the truth : of the pointless death\u2026that none of those kids chose for themselves.\u201d The results are intensely moving . In \u201cOi Cara Mamma\u201d , the Alpini ask what their mothers will do when their sons don\u2019t come back . Elsewhere , the choir tells their lover that they are buried \u201cin a field of edelweiss\u201d . The choir concludes that \u201cwhen you are alone at home , the edelweiss and I will be with you.\u201d \\n\\nThe presence of edelweiss is not accidental . Alpini songs have a deep link to the mountain culture that bore them ; some of the songs are centuries old . And unlike other wings of the Italian military , \u201cAlpini herald from the same valleys\u201d as their songs , says Mr Marchesotti . Indeed , most songs are odes to the mountains themselves . When a soldier is thirsty , \u201crefreshing snow\u201d will be there to soothe them . A dying captain asks his men to give a part of his body to the mountains so that he blossoms into \u201croses and flowers\u201d.\\n\\nThis thoughtful melancholy is popular : Alpini choirs still release albums and play concerts all over northern Italy , and interest in them extends beyond their music . Several films and documentaries have been made about their story . A book of Alpini exploits by Mario Stern , a sergeant who fought near Stalingrad , has been republished five times , and has been made into a play . While in Russia , Polenta , as well as the cheese of his English valley , and of course the mountains themselves are constantly on Stern\u2019s mind . \u201cGhe rivarem a baita ? \u201d repeats one of his men , in thick Brescian dialect . \u201cWhen do we get home ? \ '' Home , or baita in the dialect , is literally a mountain chalet . Once again , Alpini culture is less about martial swaggering , and more a vehicle for nostalgia for beauty of Italy\u2019s northern frontiers . \\n\\nThis heritage is not as secure as it used to be . Most Alpini regiments were dissolved after the Cold War . The soldiers themselves now come from all over Italy , weakening their cultural link to the Alps . Still , the troops continue to play an active role in Italian life . They fought with NATO in Afghanistan . Their avalanche training has proved useful in earthquake-ravaged corners of the Apennines . Moreover , the national Alpini association , with its 355,000 members , is still important . As well as promoting Alpini culture , local chapters\u2014encompassing both veterans and eager civilians\u2014help their communities in numerous ways . They maintain chapels , and a series of mountain shelters for weary hikers . This dedication has not gone unnoticed , even among civilians . In the Piedmontese town of Biella , 36 % of the members of the local association were never soldiers themselves . \\n\\nWith the centenary of the armistice ending the first world war fast approaching , the Alpini look set to return to the forefront of Italian cultural memory . They are in fierce debate with their Austrian counterparts about where to hold joint commemorations of the fighting . ( The Austrians do not want to meet in Alto Adige , a region Italy annexed from Austria after 1918 , and which is still mostly German-speaking . ) The soldiers have even stumbled into controversy over a new videogame . \u201cBattlefield I\u201d features Alpini fighting on Monte Grappa . The head of the national Alpini association said that \u201cdelicate themes , like war , need to be dealt with differently.\u201d The beautiful stock of canti Alpini promises to do just that\u2014long after memories of the 2018 commemorations wisp into the mountain air .",Romance,Italian

MarsNirgal,europe,"I don\\'t know if anyone else who replied is gay , but I am , so I thought maybe I\\ 'd offer some extra insight on this . \\n\\n & gt ; Is Mexico tolerant of LGBT people ? \\n\\nYes and no . As most if not all countries , Mexico has a certain \ '' macho\ '' , ultramasculine culture that can make things hard for people like trans women and gay men ( and even lesbians , since they\\ 're seen as challenging men\\ 's manhood ) . \\n\\nAlso , Catholicism still has a lot of cultural power ( although not as much political power since we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country ) . But overall , I\\ 'd say we\\ 're improving . I\\ 've had three jobs and in none of them my sexual orientation was a problem . \\n\\nBack in 2009 , gays couldn\\'t marry anywhere in the country . Right now we can get married in 10 out of the 31 states of Mexico , including 28 % of the population and our three largest cities , and those marriages are legally recognized in all the country . \\n\\nEven more so , this year our Supreme Court stated that forbidding equal marriage is anticonstitutional , and our president ( whom I hate and I think is really bad for other reasons , but he had to something good at least once ) is working on a proposal to legalize equal marriage for all the states . \\n\\nThere has been a movement against it , of course . Last weekend we had marches in over 20 cities opposing equal marriage , but I think we\\ 're winning.\\n\\nWe\\ 're still a long way to go . People from the cities have it a lot better than people from rural communities ( I met a couple of gays from the country once , and the level of self-repression they endure is disheartening ) , LGBT people , particularly trans women , are still sometimes beaten , raped or killed , but overall , I think we\\ 're getting better , so fast that sometimes we don\\'t even realize it . \\n\\n & gt ; Does Roman Catholicism still strongly influence the country ? \\n\\nOh , dear ... \\n\\nOkay , let\\ 's go there . An overwhelming majority of Mexicans are Roman Catholic . That means they were baptized , made their communion , have religious weddings , and a lot of them go to mass every Sunday . The level of involvement varies a lot , for some it\\ 's just something the do , for some others is taken very seriously . \\n\\nOn the other hand , we\\ 're constitutionally a secular country and some other people take that very seriously . I recall a couple times when our national Anthem was sung in churches and people threw a fit , or when our then president kissed the pope\\ 's hand and there was a big uproar . Overall , any open attempt from the church to intervene in politics and ( kind of ) in society finds resistance from the left . This holds true mostly for the cities , people in small towns and rural communities are way more involved with religion . \\n\\nWhen you combine these two situations you end with a country that has deep and strong religious convictions , but has them at odds with political and social trends . The bigger the city , the more the secular side wins , the smaller the community , the more power is wielded by religion . \\n\\nRecently we\\ 're seeing a some sort of power struggle between those trends , taking equal marriage as a cause belle . There have been a lot of marches against federal equal marriage proposals , and of course the church is behind them , regardless of if they admit it or not . \\n\\nI think we\\ 're reaching , slowly but steadily , a certain equilibrium , in which people with sincerely held beliefs will live by them but will let other people live their lives . \\n\\nIt will be a long time before we get there , though .",Romance,Spanish

( They reserve simple past for things that are well in the past ) . \\n\\n* One of my favorites : Spanish students \ '' give class\ '' and the teacher \ '' takes the class\ '' , while Mexican students \ '' take class\ '' and the teacher \ '' gives the class\ '' . \\n\\n* There are , of course , words that have different meanings . \ '' Coger\ '' in Spain means just \ '' to take\ '' or \ '' to grab\ '' , while in Mexico it has those meanings , but it also means \ '' to fuck.\ '' \\n\\n* Spaniards curse a lot more . We use more double entendre . \\n\\nNow about music , prepare yourself for a flood of awesome .

Here\\ 's [ Mujeres Divinas ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gfX0ijwj1mw ) \\n\\n [ Pedro Infante ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=L9WHPPPG0ak ) was an actor and singer and the incarnation of the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema . Here\\ 's [ B\u00e9same morenita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=oMpjONW-Y94 ) and a funny duet with [ Jorge Negrete ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kHEhw0DTwnw ) \\n\\n [ Lucha Villa ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=0J4mmybyi6o & amp ; list=PLEE8688C1287B9A25 ) ( I haven\\'t heard that much of her , sadly ) \\n\\nA little less known , but I love her , [ Estela N\u00fa\u00f1ez ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Amv9X-q69_c ) My favorite song from her is probably [ El sauce y la palma ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4KxLgqwjKQE ) \\n\\n [ Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MZN0fVdsN20 & amp ; list=PL0DZg7zLu-KaEwh6mNcRAeNY6tJ73_MEz ) . My favorite song from him is actually not Mexican but Puerto Rican : [ Lamento borincano . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=sj1925V7hew ) \\n\\n [ Tr\u00edo Los Panchos ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=37G9Om5RnuQ ) ( Trios are a fixture of Mexican folk music , Los Panchos are the most famous of them ) . Here are they singing [ Quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s , quiz\u00e1s . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zdJ0KLJ3PmQ ) \\n\\n [ Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=05dcxPp62BQ & amp ; list=PL3EB848B98A657DE0 ) ( He\\ 's kinda modern folk mixed with pop , and he\\ 's in my opinion a great vocalist ) My favorite song from him is , hands down , [ Como quien pierde una estrella . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MXlwuZ_nEk0 ) \\n\\nOldies but goodies : \\n [ Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=S2icmNLT8B8 ) , one of the greatest vocalists from Mexico .

No one tell him ) \\n\\nPop : \\n\\nI\\ 've been a lot of touch with Mexican pop because I mostly hear European pop ( specifically , Eurovision . You don\\'t know how jealous I am that you guys are in Eurovision and we aren\\'t ) , so most of the pop I post will be slightly dated ( or very dated in some cases ) \\n\\n [ Gloria Trevi ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CjXbluRyHE4 & amp ; list=PLIS-NM3fM9AMet6qkht596KXq5l3MBWDm ) . She\\ 's an extremely controversial artists by farily good reasons . Always since she started her career she pushed the boundaries of political correctness . In the early nineties she released a string of widely successful and polemic discs in which she discussed religion , abortion , sex and a lot of other stuff Mexican society wasn\\'t comfortable discussing . \\n\\nThen in 2000 she was arrested an accused of being part of a ring of child abuse that involved most of her backup singers and dancers . Then she got pregnant in prison , she claimed that she was raped while the prison authorities claimed she got smuggled sperm from her manager and faked the abuse . At the end she was released for lack of evidence , and after ten years out of the spotlight , she returned stronger than ever . \\n\\nShe\\ 's still quite controversial , with people believing that she was part of the abuse ring , while others believe she was a victim of it . I prefer not to think about it and just enjoy her music . \\n\\nA lot of her more current songs deal with self-reliance and liberation , which is something I like a lot . Also , she\\ 's become a gay icon , kinda like the Mexican Lady Gaga ( except she was doing Gaga before Gaga was doing solid food ) \\n\\nI would be hard-pressed to name a single song of her , so I\\ 'll put several . I hope you enjoy : \\n\\n* [ Todos me miran ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TP7Kh2gWL8g ) \\n\\n* [ Me r\u00edo de ti ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=P6A-kw41eEk ) \\n\\n* [ Lo que una chica por amor es capaz ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ylfUkPD3IOA ) \\n\\n* [ Sabes ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=SCGrh7Ibg6k ) \\n\\n* [ No soy un p\u00e1jaro ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=EknNH7U90fA ) ( Warning : This song is HEAVY on double entendres and sexual innuendo . It\\ 's the kind of thing only she would dare to sing ) \\n\\nAlso , a classic from my childhood is the kid/youth band [ Timbiriche . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8Sc7XgsnhY4 & amp ; list=PL2E6A9599E3C49158 & amp ; index=2 ) My favorite song from them is [ Si no es ahora . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=CovfI2ij39o ) \\n\\n [ OV7 and Kabah ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pmYtefifbx0 & amp ; list=PLjMhKRttBctyPVNujwskInxGABOeIforS ) are a couple bands that were quite succesfful . ( Sorry , I found a joint playlist and I\\ 'm feeling kinda lazy ) . OV7 was formed as \ '' Onda Vaselina\ '' a long time ago but then they lost the rights to their name in a dispute with their managers , so now they just go for the initials . My favorite song from them is [ Un pie tras otro pie . ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BusFo75x3NA ) . About Kabah I\\ 'm gon na go for what I know and give you a song from a former member , [ No soy una se\u00f1ora ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=j5T1cYY-s8E ) by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 . \\n\\nGaribaldi is already vintage , ( late eighties , early nineties ) , my favorite songs from them are [ Que te la pongo ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UmDBmSTbuls ) y [ Tengo una bolita ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kFrD9Cidujk ) . \\n\\nPaulina Rubio is quite a successful singer .

Do you have this same rigidity in regards to other rules ? especially those that concern you personally ? \\n\\n\\nEDIT : I\\ 'm not advocating illegal immigration , I\\ 'm just saying that the argument about \ '' skipping in line\ '' is disingenuous and makes it seem as if people that immigrate illegally are just doing it that way because they are lazy or don\\'t like following rules just for the sake of it . The choice many illegal immigrants are faced with isn\\'t between legally immigrationg or illegally immigrating ; it\\ 's between poor economic prospects or illegally immigrating and simply saying \ '' well they should just come legally and follow the rules damnit ! \ '' is the rethorical equivalente of covering your ears and saying \ '' na na na na I can\\'t hear you\ '' .\\n\\nI repeat : This doesn\\'t mean that there shouldn\\'t be rules or proceedures or that they shouldn\\'t be followed , but the mere existence of a rule is not enough ( at least for me ) to justify its enforcement . It needs to be defended on its own merits , had you said : \ '' Legal Mexican immigrants like Trump because illegal immigrants depreciate wages/bring crime/are burdens on society/etc\ '' I wouldn\\'t be arguing about the \ '' skipping in line\ '' argument.\\n",Romance,Spanish

For instance , Mexicans who cross the border daily to work in a factory at Arizona increase their productivity 500 % over the average Mexican , they are in fact more productive than Japanese or British workers , that is not because they work 500 % harder or they are 500 % more motivated . Germans who travel to work at Colombia are 600 % less productive when they get down from the airplane , and that is not because there is a magic magnetic field in the Atlantic that changes people\\ 's levels of motivation . \\n\\nLabor Productivity is defined by the \ '' context of production\ '' , which is the sum of technology + education + investment level + infrastructure in a particular area . Personal efforts are good and welcomed , but they have a small relevance when we\\ 're talking about creating wealth in a modern scale . Doesn\\'t matter how hard and how early in the morning a baker starts his work doing muffins , if other baker , lazy and unmotivated , has an automated muffin machine and a powerful software to handle the factory processes , the lazy baker will get more and more money and eventually the hard-work baker will go to the bankruptcy .",Romance,Spanish

Miguel Hidalgo screamed \ '' Viva Fernando VII\ '' , the night he declared the Independence War .

anairam_macias,AskEurope,"I\\ 'm a Mexican , so I thought I could offer some thoughts on our end , after reading all of the comments . \\n\\nA little background on me , because this does influences the view on Spain from Mexicans , I am female , upper class , mid 20\\ 's , my last name is not common in Mexico but it is in Spain ( or at least more common than in here ) , and in Mexico I\\ 'm considered \ '' white\ '' ( people here associate skin color with social class ) , I work in politics ( translator and interpreter , but I work for a major political party ) .\\n\\nYou have to understand that Mexico is a very classicist country , there\\ 's the rich people , the work class or middle class and the poor , often people of indigenous-descent , and it\\ 's not common for people of different categories to mix outside the employer-employee relationship . Rich people\\ 's kids don\\'t go to the same schools as middle class kids , and more often than not , people from the lower social classes opt out of school to get a job and afford their food . And this is not only for which school kids go to , it\\ 's from the places people buy their food and clothing from , where they go on vacation , places they hang out , etc . This of course , makes people resentful with the upper class . And you\\ 'll find that this upper class , is mostly made up of people with Spanish or European descent . So this lower social class is ( generally ) the one that shows more resentment towards Spain and Europe in general , even to the U.S for \ '' stealing our land\ '' ( I know that\\ 's inaccurate , but that\\ 's how people see it ) , and people from my social circle tend to be more \ '' forgiving\ '' and refer to Spain as \ '' La Madre Patria\ '' ( Motherland ) . There\\ 's even a ( bad ) joke going around gatherings of a Political Party from here , that we \ '' should ask for Spain\\ 's forgiveness for attempting to gain independence from them , and beg them to take us back and get us out of the third world\ '' . Kind of fucked up , but that\\ 's how it goes . So you\\ 'll see that the resentment is wildly opposing depending on what social class is the person being questioned about it . \\n\\nNow about immigration , most people from upper class go to Europe , and lower class , to the US and Canada . Most people who choose the EU to go on vacation or for a longer stay , don\\'t have Spain as their first choice , though . Me for example , would never live in the U.S. , but that\\ 's because I have the choice not to , and can afford to live in a EU country . I was in Spain for a month , and although people in Mexico say that they treat you badly after they notice you\\ 're a mexican , I did not experienced this , but they did seemed surprised that I am white-skinned.\\n\\nAbout the whole \ '' stealing our gold\ '' thing , this is indeed common to hear among all social classes . In elementary school , they teach us that before Spain came , we had a civilization ( that some may call savage ) that worked , we lived in harmony and were happy . So comparing that to our current situation , this alone will set some resentment and idealization of our past culture , a longing for peace that was \ '' stolen\ '' from us . They also teach us that when they came along they brought disease , corruption and death , which is our current situation . \\n\\nSo in general I would say that most mexicans do not hate Spain , but we are encouraged to have some sort of resentment towards them and what \ '' they\ '' did to Mexico .

Spain needs to bail out its own banks , but obviously , it doesn\\'t have enough money to do this , so what do they do ? They ask for a bailout . I know that , right now , Spain is pretending they don\\'t need a bailout , but you , me , Rajoy , and everyone knows very well that they are not fooling anyone.\\n\\nIf you are implying that , somehow , this is the reason why Germany ( or Europe in general ) had an obligation to bail out Greece , so that they could in turn bail-out their own banks , as Spain will do , then you are forgetting that Greece and Spain are different countries , with different structural issues . Spain\\ 's issue is its medieval banking structure . Greece\\ 's issue is government corruption and untrustworthiness . Moral Hazard can take a back seat because the parties involved are not equally trustworthy , nor do their issues reflect similar urgencies : Spain may be better equipped to deal with the financial catastrophe than Greece . After all , Spain does have productive infrastructure.\\n\\nWhich is why I return to my point . There is no \ '' real\ '' solution except dismantling the Euro or instituting a centralized Federal Government for Europe . The bailout of Greece , the fiscal tightening , the talk , the posturing , they are all band-aids which won\\'t last long and may make the problems worse .

Oh , also , we did not request a bailout nor did we need one after the 2008 financial crisis . Our currency is stronger than 3 years ago , too.\\n\\nFor years countries from Europe and North America had lectured my country how to do things . When we finally did it a bit differently , we are now in a better position . So , forgive me if I\\ 'm a bit judgemental . But it is my opinion that all of the PIIGs countries could\\ 've done a lot better with their management . True , Germany is on the line , but it isn\\'t at all the German\\ 's fault for what the smaller countries are going through . Germany did not ask Greece to overspend on their olympics .

Otherwise , what incentive would countries in the euro zone have to behave properly ? \\n\\nAddition : It just occured to me , fiscal and monteray policy should be employed on matching geographies .

I am merely explaining why my point of view is valid . By the way , a random comment in Reddit does not at all have the same power as , say , a condition in an international trade agreement.\\n\\nOtherwise , I agree with what you are saying , but , ultimately , it wasn\\'t the German government who sponsored this \ '' irrational exhuberance\ '' of Irish banks ; it was German private investors and banks . Let them fail . If Germany wants to bail THEM out , then that is a German decision . Germany shouldn\\'t interfere , positively or negatively , in Irish decision . If Ireland decided to , on their own , back their banks 100 % at the expense of their people , that is Ireland\\ 's problem , not Germany\\ 's . If some German investors were benefitted by Ireland\\ 's move , that is beside the point.\\n\\nMy point is , you can not be half a Super Country and half independent . You NEED to be a single government to have a single currency . You can not have a single currency with multiple governments . You either split off completely , or unite completely , but whatever it is the EU is doing is unsustainable . Note : I am not saying it is either right or wrong , merely unsustainable.\\n\\nFinally , if there is a problem , it is because somebody sinned . In the case of Greece , I think it is very much the government\\ 's fault . In the case of Ireland or Spain , less so . But , in any case , if somebody sinned , that somebody should be punished . What I find wrong is this impulse of governments to shield their banks or Cajas , or whatever from the punishment , and then expect the rest of Europe to share the burden . Let the banks fail , and after that , clean up the mess . Don\\'t avoid it , because that is worse .",Romance,Spanish

I am currently suffering of obesity ( I\\ 'm in a diet , have lost 20 pounds -about 10 kgs- , downgraded from \ '' morbid obesity\ '' to regular obesity last month ) , and I can tell you that obesity hinders your capacity for work.\\n\\nMorbid obesity , in particular , elevates your blood pressure , makes you prone to incapacitating headaches , tires you quickly doing simple tasks , impairs your ability to think and to be creative , makes you require extended hours of sleep , and of course , increases your risk of contracting diseases such as heart disease that may lead to a heart attack , and diabetes.\\n\\nObesity is a disability AND overeating is an addiction . There\\ 's no reason why one would be exclusive of the other . Just because you disabled yourself doesn\\'t mean you are not disabled.\\n\\nNow , should that mean that you get special treatment from your employer or the government ? I believe you should , so long as you demonstrate a commitment to getting better . Unlike chopping off a leg , people can , and do , overcome obesity . I am trying to do so even now , and I can tell you , I function a lot better now than I did a month ago , and I expect to feel even better as I improve further .

And Chechens are the luckiest ones in the whole R.F.\\n\\nThe politics kind of bind together with the economics , they\\ 're angry on the US sanction because they think that US is the evil warmonger that wishes only destruction and chaos , and while they\\ 're believing that Russian culture is based solely on resistance and defensive wars ( Most of them think that they had all the rights to annex Crimea ) .\\nAbout oligarchs I\\ 'm not even talking , Putin is kind of the boss of this mafia-state , or so it seems that he\\ 's the honcho .

222baked,europe,"I didn\\'t say we identify as Slavic , as we most definitely do not . We identify as a Romance-speaking people of the Balkans . What I was trying to get at , is that we have much more in common with neighboring Slavs than with the people of the Italic peninsula , both in genetics and culture ( do Romanians eat mici , or lasagna ? ) . We have little in common with the modern French . Some 18th century exchange of our educated class in Paris didn\\'t really make the peasant masses French , and much of that French influence disappeared in modern times . Our academic and bureaucratic structures are some of the few things that are still admittedly French , but I don\\'t consider those culturally significant , and frankly , many countries modeled their institutions after the French . \\n\\nI have nothing against Southerners , other than the fact you generally come off as rude , and even that is mostly because the formal second person plural seems to have fallen out of common use in Bucharest , which comes off as extremely impolite ( clearly something that wasn\\'t adopted from the French ) . I am just saying that our country has regional variety and that despite the fact that that those regions aren\\'t ethnically homogenous , those ethnicities may have more in common with eachother than with those from other regions . Where I live , I see Hungarians , Romanians , and Germans all living very similar lives . Some segregation exists , sure , but that\\ 's mostly due to nationalistic and linguistic reasons . The people are identical . A Hungarian from Mures county has more in common with a Romanian living in Mures than he does with a Hungarian from Budapest , and the same can be said for the Romanian when compared with another Romanian from Bucharest . \\n\\nPeople aren\\'t very good identifying what makes them unique , we are good at pointing out other groups and defining themselves as \ '' not them\ '' ; despite their incredible similarity .
