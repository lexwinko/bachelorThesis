Unknown to pilot Zivi Nedivi and his copilot , the right wing was sheared off roughly two feet ( 60 cm ) from the fuselage . The A-4 disintegrated and its pilot safely ejected , while the F-15 nosed down and entered a violent roll . Zivi decided to attempt recovery and engaged afterburner to increase speed . He was able to prevent stalling and maintain control due to the lift generated by the large horizontal surface area of the fuselage , the stabilators , and remaining wing areas . The F-15 landed at twice the normal speed to maintain the necessary descent and its tailhook was torn off during the landing . Zivi managed to bring his F-15 to a stop approximately 20 ft ( 6 m ) from the end of the runway . He was later quoted as saying \ '' It\\ 's highly likely that if I would have seen it clearly , I would have ejected ... \ '' ; leaking fuel along the wing had obstructed visibility of the wing itself .

( The term \ '' haircut\ '' refers to the losses that private investors would incur on the current net value of their Greek bond holdings . ) Merkel\\ 's fear was that Athens would be unable to overcome its problems even with an additional haircut , since it would not be able to handle the remaining debt . Furthermore , she doubted that sending financial experts to Greece would be of much help in bringing the financial system there under control . Within the German cabinet , Finance Minister Wolfgang Schnaeuble alone continued to strongly back another haircut , despite Merkel\\ 's efforts to rein him in , while France and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso were seen to be in favor of a gentler approach . European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet was solidly opposed , with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde described as undecided on the issue . Finally , Merkel believed that action must be taken to enact a Financial Transaction Tax ( FTT ) ; doing so next year , she assessed , would be a major step toward achieving some balance in relief for banks . In that regard , the Germans thought that pressure could be brought to bear on the U.S. and British governments to help bring about an FTT.\\n\\n\\nUnconventional\\n\\nGerman leadership\\n\\nG/OO/526362-11 , 181753Z\\nhttps : //wikileaks.org/nsa-germany/\\n\\nAbout the private bond holders hair cut and how destructive that was for our economy you will find ( and lots more ) info here : \\n\\nhttp : //www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/080715/we-underestimated-their-power-greek-government-insider-lifts-lid-five-months-humiliation-and-blackm ? page_article=1\\n\\n\ '' The part of the second programme of the agreement of 2012 , after the haircut of the PSI [ Private Sector Involvement ] , which was about 170 billion euros , 50 billion out of that was for the recapitalisation of the banks . Of course , there was another problem . From the PSI , the public funds suffered losses almost , if not more , in their own reserves . Why ? Because they were forced under the law to save their cash reserves with the Bank of Greece , and the Bank of Greece had the right to use these funds to buy bonds on their behalf.\\n\\nFor me it was a big scandal because apparently what happened was a lot of politicians , bankers , a lot of people went and gave - they had bonds that they had bought 20 % - they went and they gave it to the Greek Central Bank , Bank of Greece , 100 % , they got their money and then the haircut comes to the public.\\n\\nBasically , what they were forced to do was to use their cash reserves , social security funds , pension funds , in order to buy government bonds that were going to be cut in real terms around 70 % in present value . So the funds right now , the pension funds , are facing a bigger problem than the banks are facing . The pension funds have to plan 15 to 20 years ahead to be able to pay pensions , when the aging population is increasing and the working population is decreasing . They also have to pay unemployment benefits and so on . So , all these debt locks came to the front now.\ ''",Greek,Greek

There were almost two years that EZ did nothing for that ( famous Merkel feet dragging ) and the crisis got out of control ( vultures took advantage , rates had gone over 30 % .\\nb ) Troika intervenes to save the day . We know that the chose the harsh austerity path ( which is debatable if it was correct ) . The austerity measures were severe and based on wrong multipliers . That made the crisis even worse . In fact this experience was what saved Portugal and Spain to have such strict austerity.\\nc ) as many sources reveal ( even wikileaks ) it was know that the programs would never work without debt restructuring/cut . Still the same incomplete and false programs were impemented up tilll now . \\nd ) We now know that Schaeuble at least since 2012 thought it was a good idea to let greece burn and use it as an example to scare other . Hence no real intention was there to help the situation.\\ne ) debt structuring is something that was put on the table very recently . Largely because of syriza behavior . Had we have the old government they would continue to follow wrong programs until they\\ 'd face an absolute and inevitable dead end.\\n\\nAs far as the IMF , we now know that with the strict austerity they\\ 'd proposed they did also proposed a debt cut . They reatret from that , because of EZ ( German ) pressure . In fact they acted as an EU body and not an independent one . \\n\\nHere are few interesting links on that : \\n\\n\ '' IMF has betrayed its mission in Greece , captive to EMU creditors\\nThe IMF\u2019s Original Sin in Greece was to let Dominique Strauss-Kahn hijack the institution to save Europe\\ 's banks and the euro when the crisis erupted , dooming Greece to disaster.\ '' \\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/IMF-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-Greece-captive-to-EMU-creditors.html\\n\\n\ '' How the IMF doomed Greece to disaster and put its own future in doubt\ '' \\nhttp : //business.financialpost.com/investing/how-the-imf-doomed-greece-to-disaster-and-put-its-own-future-in-doubt ? __lsa=dc7f-9a52\\n\\n\ '' An amazing mea culpa from the IMF\u2019s chief economist on austerity\ '' \\n\\nhttp : //www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/03/an-amazing-mea-culpa-from-the-imfs-chief-economist-on-austerity/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

[ 80 ] \\n\\nMost of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . [ 81 ] However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) [ 82 ] had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through \ '' falsified\ '' deficit numbers.\\n\\nIn the 2005 OECD report for Greece , [ 83 ] it was clearly stated that \ '' the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece\\ 's ] EMU membership qualification\ '' . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece\\ 's application , and thus the criteria had been met . [ 84 ] \\n\\nThe original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with Eurostat recommendations , theoretically lowering even the ESA95-calculated 1999 Greek budget deficit to below 3 % ( an official Eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999 ) .\\n\\nAn error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece\u2019s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives\u2019 deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to \ '' hide\ '' 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece\u2019s Eurozone entry . [ 85 ] \\n\\nA study of the period 1999\u20132009 by forensic accountants has found that data submitted to Eurostat by Greece , among other countries , had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation ; \ '' Greece with a mean value of 17.74 , shows the largest deviation from Benford\\ 's law among the members of the eurozone , followed by Belgium with a value of 17.21 and Austria with a value of 15.25\ '' .

But you have to pay.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; We also have a system of \ '' grandes \u00e9coles\ '' ( elite schools ) in which you need to pass an exam ( more of a contest ) to enter . Those are the cool ones which get the funding . As said in the article , these are not accessible to everyone . It\\ 's mostly \ '' I know this guy who knows this guy\ '' .

I would blame this on the separation between engineering school/business schools and regular universities . If you combine all of them together in a city then you might have something which can stand up to big campuses in the UK . But we chose to have the faculties + grandes ecoles and business schools apart.\\n\\nSome of our Business schools are top notch ( Insead MBA , HEC paris , ESSEC.. ) , some of our grandes ecoles are also top notch but less visible due to the concurrence of big monsters like Harvard/Oxford/Cambridge.\\n\\n",Romance,French

ABaseDePopopopop,europe,"[ Here is an article in French ] ( https : //www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/pourquoi-la-france-refuse-de-ceder-le-controle-de-saint-nazaire-fincantieri ) that goes a bit more into the reasons and French point of view.\\n\\nSome points taken quickly : \\n\\n- French government says they don\\'t want to take risks on jobs , skills , and strategic industrial area . Since it\\ 's a strategic activity , they don\\'t want to give a majority to a foreign investor . They say that if the Italians won\\'t accept the 50/50 proposal , they\\ 'll use their refusal right.\\n\\n- The previous agreement planned for 48 % for Fincantieri , 6 % for Fondazione CR , 33 % for the French state and the rest for Naval Group ( DCNS ) . The \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' was supposed to make it so that Fincantieri wouldn\\'t control a majority , but the Italians would still be able to buy it.\\n\\n- Since the Italians now said they won\\'t accept a new agreement and want a full majority , the \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' thing is shown to be a trick.\\n\\n- The previous agreement was made in 2008 because there was no refusal right for the French state . Since then they have acquired enough.\\n\\n- The Italians argue that they should be prefered to a Korean firm because they\\ 're European . The current feedback from STX is that the Korean firm was bad financially but \ '' very transparent\ '' , without technological theft.\\n\\n- Saint-Nazaire is the only plant able to build large ships for the French Navy , and is developing well on offshore renewable energy , which is seen as an important sector for France who has the second sea area in the world.\\n\\n- Fincantieri works with the Chinese for their future ships . They\\ 'll build in Shanghai the large ships that were previously made in Italy for the American Carnival Corporation . Fincantieri defends that the technology transfer is under control , but the French doubt their ability to resist to Chinese pressure , and are very wary of technology transfer to China.\\n\\n- The entire ship industry is preparing for China to offer a huge competition , supported by their state . They are very wary of any help to cover the technology gap they currently suffer . This is also the position of the German Meyer Werft . STX is considered along with Meyer Werft as among best expert for cruise ships.\\n\\n- Concerning jobs , the agreement secures them until 2026 . But 5 years later , Fincantieri would be able to decide directly the work share between its different sites . As the company belongs for 72 % to the Italian government , the French government is worried that they would prioritize work in Italy . \\n\\n- It is observed that among the company , its suppliers and customers , nobody supports the plan to go for Fincantieri . The ship-owners even went as far as proposing an alterEnglish to the purchase agreement of 2008.\\n\\n- The French position is that their opposition has nothing to do with the nationality of the buyer . They\\ 've been under foreign ownership since 11 years , and would have accepted much more easily a merge with the German Meyer Werft.\\n\\nTLDR : The French government is worried about jobs as Fincantieri is under Italian goverment ownership and could prioritize their plants , and more importantly about technology transfer to China because Fincantieri works with them already .",Romance,French

ALeX850,europe,"even languages where words are gendered aren\\'t out of reach I guess . Similar trend is happening in french where some people go out of their way to add diacritics like . or - or ( ) and \ '' e\ '' in between grammar agreements ( to indicate feminine gender ) . French has evolved in such a way ( and other romance languages too ) that masculine gender is used for both , say , \ '' male related things\ '' and \ '' neutral\ '' settings which let feminine alone for \ '' female related things\ '' . I\\ 'm caricaturing though : feminine is also used to indicate neutral with regard to inanimated \ '' objects\ '' but since masculine is used for neutral animated \ '' objects\ '' ( I mean living things ) , it stands out and that\\ 's where the political split come from . At the end of the day , it\\ 's a matter of grammaticality and morphology for lack of better option , I guess most people don\\'t see sexism behind it and really mean to be neutral when using the masculine gender accordingly for animated objects .
