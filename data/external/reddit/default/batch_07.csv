Bhima,europe,"A Financial Transaction Tax does not need to be very large to be effective . It simply needs to be large enough dissuade trading for gambling\u2019s sake but not so large it dissuades socially necessary business.\\nNaturally , it\u2019s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax in a way that it is harmonized across many markets . However , it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations . Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral . In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one . Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.\\n\\nIf the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT , the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous , volatile transactions towards other markets . Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile , so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets , which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.\\n\\nNaturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe . Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading . But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT ( but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized ) .\\n\\nAs far as Sweden goes , my understanding of Sweden\u2019s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected , they were less severely effected that less regulated markets . Furthermore their response was more effective , created a softer landing , and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets . Perhaps it\u2019s not perfect to be out front with a FTT . And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect . But it\u2019s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse , the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today . Perhaps , given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS , that\u2019s not an unqualified good thing\u2026 but that\u2019s another discussion.\\n\\nAnd yes , there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.\\n\\nlastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax .

I\u2019m advocating for a slight and smart readjustment of tax policy and regulation of financial markets .",Germanic,German

Moreover speaking English Englishly but not having a masters in English or Teaching is not a highly valued marketable skill in most of Europe.\\n\\nBottom line , as an immigrant with imperfect language and with skills which are not closely aligned with local business , I believe it is going to be hard to find a well-paying job outside of certain industries and positions ( like marketing in the semiconductor industry ) . \\n\\nSo those are the reasons why I think that most folks who are under educated and not not fluent in a few European languages need to prepare themselves to return to university for some time to get the skills that are needed in their new place of residence . If you have recent college experience in the U.S. it will probably transfer to most Universities in Europe ... so I don\\'t think you are looking at 6-8 years of work as I am.\\n\\n\\nI think that there is a very , very real possibility that much of Europe will slide into recession for 2012 .

( who would then be the main \ '' competitors\ '' / markets where the most volatile trades will go ) \\n\\nIf the EU implements an FTT and along with it an offset of some sort for companies doing business within the EU and engaged in legitimate hedging , a FTT will stabilize our markets and most likely push the most volatile non socially necessary trading overseas . So those other markets will become more active and more volatile . If it is EU wide and successful it\\ 's probable that a number of smaller markets will follow suite to stabilize their markets . \\n\\nUltimately then it becomes a competition within purely speculative high frequency traders and not corporations who , along with their primary business , engage somehow in the financial markets .",Germanic,German
Bhima,europe,"Kein Problem , Ich denke ihr Englisch besser als mein Deutsch.\\n\\n\ '' captured\ '' as it refers to regulatory bodies is closer to \u201censlavement\u201d and it means that such institutions are subservient ( slaves ) to the industries that they are supposed to be regulating .

So that\u2019s \u201cHigher Frequency\u201d \u201cMore Unstable\u201d \u201cLess Predicable\u201d \u201cLess Rational\u201d \u201cLess Beneficial\u201d\\n\\n\\nI am not an expert in Austrian economics ( yet ) and I do not know how large or central the Austrian financial sector is compared to our overall economy relative to similar metrics for the German economy . Nor am I an expert in Austrian politics ... I\u2019m just an American expat living here . However , my understanding of the Austrian politicians stance on FTT is that it is based more on their ideological beliefs and how corrupt they are than it does from a sort of technocratic assessment of facts and metrics . The prominent exception are Maria Fekter & amp ; Andreas Schieder but I have the impression that the media has concluded that both are \u2018too boring\u2019 to be allowed to go on at length least they actually explain something important using long words which many people don\u2019t understand.\\n\\nAbout the exposure of Austrian banks to risky loans in Eastern Europe : A FTT does not directly effect the ability or likelihood that private financial institutions will engage in stupid and risky transactions and I have not heard a serious proposal from any competent person which would . However , one thing is certain : There isn\u2019t anything about the markets right now that is all that different than summer of 2008 , there is no technical reason that similarly unpleasant circumstance might come together now as they did then and cause similar catastrophic events . More importantly neither Germany or Austria has the resources today to deal with such a hypothetical event as they did in the end of 2008 to 2009 . This emphasizes the need in some folks minds to gather those resources . However , some politicians have a sort of ideological / religious stance : No new , more , or different taxes . No agreeing with anything having to do with the EU . No taxing people who have enough money to bribe me . No management or \u201cinterference\u201d in the markets . Then conversely \u201cNo taxing the poor\u201d \u201cTax the bastards that caused all this mess to begin with\u201d , etc ... \\n\\nHaving said all of that , from a technical point of view a FTT does not need to be a large tax , it needs to be a broad tax . Nor does it necessarily mean that the government must earn more in tax revenue . A skillful FTT could leave the government with as much taxes coming in as it had before ( or not ) . Therefore the questions \u201cShould we implement a Financial Transaction Tax\u201d and \u201cShould the government increase taxation\u201d are two separate questions.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that we should prefer taxation on things that have complicated negative impacts which are not borne by the parties in the transaction ( Negative Externalities ) like pollution , health risks , carbon , consumption ( VAT ) or ultra-high-speed trading than real income ( this means things like wages for real work and things like profit from selling goods ) . I also think that governments around the world are facing the absolute need to reduce their public debt and that means both reducing spending and increasing the taxes coming in . It would also help if the U.S. would refrain from invading and occupying any more nations ... but here in Europe the military spending issue is different and more complicated .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"Well , currently there is no \ '' EU B\u00f6rse\ '' there are only national ones , like the ones in London or Frankfurt and there is no \ '' EU tax collector\ '' or \ '' EU taxation\ '' . In that sense the structure of the EU is very different than the structure of the Federal Government in America and the relationships between the EU nations and the EU ( and other EU nations ) is very different between US states and the Federal Government ( and other US states ) .\\n\\nSo it would take substantially different sorts of treaties in the EU to create those sorts things . Which complicates matters because it\\ 's completely possible that a Italian owned company having a division located in Austria making money on the B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt , london , and Vienna . ( I just described my bank , Bank Austria which is owned by UniCredit SpA ) .\\n\\nAlso while the US is a transfer union ( States pay in to the Federal Government more or less than they receive from the Federal Government ) the EU is not . So not only does the mechanism for collecting a broad , EU wide tax , and then redistributing back to member nations not exist , the idea does not already exist either . However , EU governance does cost money to run and currently there are bidirectional payments going on in this regard ... so it\\ 's not a completely novel setup.\\n\\nHaving said all of that , in broad strokes a skillful FTT would be collected EU wide ( this probably means harmonized national FFT tax rates collected by member nations ) with some sort of offset ( which is probably a harmonized lowering of business income tax levied by member states ) .

Chefdiplomat,AskEurope,"It is funny how you talk about people supposedly being misinformed yet you spew almost nothing but nonsense and propaganda.\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is actually corrupt and working for Wall Street . Your comment is 1:1 the defense of the Clinton campaign and not even accurate as Bernie Sanders did bring up Wall Street reform as one issue where she was clearly influenced by Wall Street donations . By the way this is not even a new accusation just listen to what people of her own party had to say about this in the past : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=12mJ-U76nfg\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is using Colin Powell as an excuse . She set up her own E-Mail server , which is unprecetented . There is simply no comparable case.\\n\\n* The generals working with her have described her as extremely hawkish and as always going for the most hawkish option . She is a war criminal and also responsible for the war in Libya , which was based on nothing but lies . One of the lies she kept peddling about Libya , the lie about black mercenaries , actually led to black genocide in Libya , which was conducted by the people she was supporting there and she didn\\'t stop peddling that lie when she was informed about that fact as her E-Mails prove.\\n\\n* Trump also did not go bankrupt personally four of his over five hundred businesses did and they were put into bankrupcy for restructuring . This is not about incompetence but using thebankruptcy laws for personal gain . It might not be the right thing to do but it is quite common and says little about the competence of an individual.\\n\\n* Trump would not have more money if he would gave invested the money he has received from his father in an index fund anyone , who knows a little bit about finance knows this . This is a completely bogus claim that has been falsified many times . Here is a good breakdown on why this claim is nonsense : https : //www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-03/should-donald-trump-have-indexed- .\\n\\n* There are legitimate criticisms about Trump University but the accusations about the Trump Foundation are mostly without real substance if you look into them f.e they accuses him of donating 100000 $ to veterans through the foundation as part of a settlement when the settlement said that that was exactly what he was obliged to do . If you want to talk about Scams you should look at the Clintons , who by the way have not only used dubious schemes to make money themselves but also have supported scams . Also if you want to talk about morality you should talk about how Hillary Clinton fought hard to keep the minimum wage in Haiti below 0,61 $ , how she is a war criminal , hiw ger husban starved over 500k Iraqi children with sanctions etc..\\n\\n* It is hard to argue that Trump is a sexist for treating men the same as women . He has also more women working for him in senior positions than men and has been hiring women for executive positions when that was practically unheard of in the building industrie . \\n\\n* He has not credibly been charged with rape . His Ex-Wife accused him of rape when they were getting a divorce , which she later admitted was a bogus claim and there were a couple lawsuits in which he was accused of rape , which turned out to be fraudulent . If you want to talk about rape and abusive men you should talk Bill Cinton and Hillary Clinton , who has not only bashed people inclusing Monica Lewinsky for talking about Bill Clinton\\ 's abusive behavior and let\\ 's talk about Hillary Clinton accusing a twelve year old girl of lying while defending a pedophile , who has raped that girl : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? =1 & amp ; v=Tor00iWUhDQ.\\n\\n* There is no actual evidence that Trump is a racist and he is actually quite the contrary as he has supported Jessie Jackson , affirmative action , the Civil Rights Movement etc . in the past and has put people of minorities in charge of big projects for his company for decades . Meanwhile you got Clinton calling black youth \ '' Superpredators\ '' in the past , which is an actual racist statement . People claim that Trump is a racist based on a statement about illegal immigrants coming from Mexico , which is not a race and a lawsuit about a building project he wasn\\'t even directly in charge of.\\n\\nStop criticising other people about supposedly believing in propaganda when all you pretty much do as I said in the beginning is repeating propaganda and spin .

The differences also depend on the region though as Bavarian German , which some also call Austro Bavarian is also different from the language the other parts of Germany speaks and more similar to some Austrian dialects but also Austrian German itself . Generally speaking if you compare the German that is spoken in Germany there are differences in the vocabulary , word and grammar usage as well as the pronunciation . Of course we usually understand each other as there are quite a ton of similarities but they are not as similar as it is sometimes portrait . I actually sent a Northern German something I had written and he understood most of the text but not all of it and said that I was missing words , that my word usage was way off and that the sentences partly made no sense when in fact all there was to it was just the difference between Austrian German and German Standard German .

Harris for example wrote a book about Islam while not even knowing the most basic teachings of Islam and he even thought that you get the death penalty according to Sharia for saying something that is actually Islamic doctrin . Fact of the matter is that by far the most people have died and suffered at the hands of atheist leaders wanting to erradicate all religions as they thought that their ideologie f.e Communism , National Socialism , other variations of Fascism or variations of Socialism are incompatible with any kind of religion and a religious society . In addition to that financial , territorial , geopolitical and political interests are the real reason for most if not all conflicts . These interests will most likely always be there hence there will always be conflicts regardless of religion or not .

The term is used in two broad ways , either descriptively or normatively . [ 1 ] As a descriptive term , it usually refers to the simple fact of cultural diversity : it is generally applied to the demographic make-up of a specific place , sometime at the organizational level , e.g . schools , businesses , neighbourhoods , cities , or nations . As a normative term , it refers to ideologies or policies that promote this diversity or its institutionalisation ; in this sense , multiculturalism is a society \u201cat ease with the rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their own identity in the manner they see fit.\u201d [ 2 ] Such ideologies or policies vary widely , including country to country , [ 3 ] ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society , to a policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity , to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group they belong to . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] However , two main different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different Government policies and strategies : [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures .

Arquinas,europe,"Well , really hard to think of many things . Most stereotypes are only half true.\\n\\nI guess I should say , \ '' lack of politeness\ '' . Finnish language has a different plural and singular form for \\'you\\ ' . Plural rarely gets used . And we don\\'t generally call anyone mr/mrs/miss ( Unless you\\ 're on super official business/dealing with high-value foreigners like hotel receptionist or your boss just suffers from some delusions ) For example , people working for the president probably call him Mr. President or some variant but if he\\ 's visiting or talking to random people they\\ 'll just probably call him by his nickname.\\n\\nMost people subconsciously use the plural form when talking to old people ( I do ) , but it\\ 's not necessary . Teachers are mostly referred by their first name or their occupation by slang unless your school is so big that referring them to by surname is easier.\\n\\nNow I might be talking out of my ass but this extends into work life too . Nobody really talks to their boss like a superior . They talk to their boss like he\\ 's just another dude working there.\\n\\nIf I\\ 'm travelling this is really the only rule I stick to . I don\\'t want to come off as rude to any foreigner but I think referring to other people consciously as sir or madam or plural you is humiliating.\\n\\n\\nThis really only came to my mind because someone once told me a story about a german CEO who was hired into a finnish company and was really confused at first because nobody referred to him like he expected to . Heard that he ended up loving the idea so much that he brought his family with him and stayed here .",Germanic,Finnish
