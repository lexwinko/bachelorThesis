Arathian,europe,"FULL TEXT : \\n\\nANGELA MERKEL , Germany\u2019s chancellor , is often seen as the West\u2019s last best defender of the liberal order against a tide of populism . She is likely to win re-election next autumn , but faces a challenge from the anti-immigrant AlterEnglish for Germany . So Mrs Merkel needs to buck up her own party , the centre-right Christian Democratic Union , which is disillusioned with the \u201cwelcome culture\u201d for refugees that she has promoted . Speaking to party delegates on December 6th , Mrs Merkel promised that the events of 2015 , when 890,000 refugees claimed asylum in Germany , \u201ccan , shall and must not be repeated\u201d . She vaunted her government\u2019s European values of sexual equality and religious tolerance . And , in a line that drew long applause , she added that \u201cthe full veil is not appropriate for us , and should be banned wherever legally possible.\u201d\\n\\nThere is a contradiction in Mrs Merkel\u2019s embrace of liberal values and her vow to ban the full veil , known variously as the niqab or burqa . Wearing it is regarded by some Muslims as a religious duty for women when in public . A ban infringes the freedom of religion . It is also unenforceable , polarising and serves to pander to populists.\\n\\nLike many other rights , religious freedom is not absolute . Sometimes the state has good reasons to require people to show their faces : at passport controls , for example , or if they are working as , say , social workers or teachers . For security reasons , Germany already bans ski masks and other facial coverings in public demonstrations . Yet Mrs Merkel did not speak in such limited terms . She proposed the ban as a means of preventing the development of \u201cparallel societies\u201d as Germany tries to assimilate its Muslim immigrants . Forbidding religious dress worn by only a tiny fraction of those immigrants is the wrong way to accomplish this.\\n\\nSome argue that the niqab ( as well as less concealing forms of Islamic dress ) is a form of oppression . Muslim women , they say , are forced to wear the veil by family members\u2014typically their husbands , fathers or brothers . That may be true in some cases . Yet a ban might simply prevent those niqab-wearing women from leaving the house at all . Other women may choose to cover their hair or faces out of piety , or because they dislike being ogled , or to affirm their Muslim identity . Governments concerned about the subjugation of Muslim immigrant women would do better to concentrate on integration and education schemes.\\n\\nEurope\u2019s fad for such bans is driven chiefly not by principles , but politics . France introduced a burqa ban in 2010 ; some municipalities even tried to prevent Muslim women from wearing the body-covering \u201cburqini\u201d at the beach last summer . Such measures only invite extremists to paint France as an enemy of Islam . Last month the Netherlands adopted a ban on face-covering garb in education and health-care establishments , government buildings and public transport . In both cases , the real motive was to fend off the rise of anti-immigrant parties , such as Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France and Geert Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom in the Netherlands.\\n\\nIf centrists like Mrs Merkel now see burqa bans as minor concessions to hold off populists , they are fooling themselves . Those who want to ban veils are not worried about security but about immigration and integration . To them , limited bans confirm only that mainstream politicians are too timid to embrace the real thing . Some of them worry legitimately that Muslim immigrants do not share Europe\u2019s liberal norms . But the best way to preserve those freedoms is to let women dress as modestly as they please .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text : **\\n\\nFEW places reveal the anguish of a frozen conflict better than the 180km long buffer zone between the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus and the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ( TRNC ) . In Nicosia , the island\u2019s divided capital , barbed wire and sandbags separate a fashionable caf\u00e9 from an abandoned bookshop . The former opened last year . The latter closed in the summer of 1974 , when Turkish troops invaded the north of the island following years of ethnic bloodshed and a Greek Cypriot coup . Deeper in the demilitarized zone , a flock of sheep graze along the runway of an old international airport , a cavernous time capsule littered with broken glass and forty years of bird droppings . An airplane rusts nearby . The scene does not inspire much hope . But analysts believe that a solution to the Cyprus dispute may be more likely now than at any time in the past decade . What has changed ? \\n\\nReunification talks between the Greek south and the Turkish north started less than a year after the Turkish invasion . The closest they came to fruition was in April 2004 , when a plan brokered by the United Nations was put to a nationwide referendum . ( Turkish Cypriots backed the deal . Their Greek neighbours rejected it by a three-to-one margin . A week later , Cyprus entered the EU as a divided island , with the north effectively frozen out of the bloc and recognized by only one country , Turkey . ) The election of Mustafa Akinci as president of the TRNC in the spring of 2015 breathed new life into the peace process . Both Mr Akinci and the Greek Cypriot leader , Nicos Anastasiades , now say that a settlement is possible by the end of the year . The Eurasia Group , a consultancy , puts that likelihood at 60 % . The islanders themselves are less optimistic . In a recent poll , 62 % of Greek Cypriots said reunification seemed no closer today than one year ago\\n\\nMany of the pieces needed for a solution are in place . Mr Akinci and Mr Anastasiades , having met at least 25 times , report that consensus is within reach in several areas , including governance , property , and the application of EU law in the north . Turkey , which has enough problems to deal with inside its own borders , has publicly backed an agreement . Without Cyprus on board , Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government can not hope to unlock stalled membership talks with the EU . ( Mr Anastasiades stresses he will \u201cnever\u201d drop his veto on the negotiations \u201cunless Turkey gives some signs that they mean business.\u201d ) The changing regional energy map also favours a deal . Greek Cypriots know that reunification might be their only chance to market the island\u2019s offshore gas deposits , possibly through an Israeli pipeline to Turkey ( assuming those two also manage to reconcile ) . \u201cIf we have a solution , we will be able to exploit our natural gas , \u201d says one former negotiator . \u201cIf not , nobody knows how Turkey will behave.\u201d\\n\\nYet the road to a deal remains mined with misgivings and disagreements over territory , power sharing , and security guarantees . In the economically stunted north , any agreement will have to allay fears of a flood of Greek Cypriot capital and underrepresentation in the governing bodies of a united island . To be palatable in the south , it will have to ensure property restitution and the withdrawal of the 40,000 Turkish troops stationed in the TRNC . Another hurdle is the cost of a settlement . Even with a mix of remedies , including reinstatement and property swaps , compensating the 160,000 Greek and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots who abandoned their homes in the 1970s will cost billions of euros . There is fear that the momentum is ebbing . The talks have already slowed ahead of a May 22 parliamentary vote in the south . In the north , Mr. Akinci faces potential pushback from a newly formed cabinet headed by hardliners . An increasingly unpredictable Turkey may yet throw a wrench in the works . \u201cThe longer the talks go on , the greater the chance that we could see problems arise , \u201d says James Ker-Lindsay at the London School of Economics . After four decades of talks and spilled ink , Cypriots have reason to hope for the best and prepare for the usual .",Greek,Greek

People created something called \ '' companies\ '' for that , in effect investment funds for singular , large-scale projects .

Private entities can be hired by the state to complete certain aspects of it but they have never made them privately . Never . Feel free to prove me wrong by linking a single case.\\n\\n & gt ; Why industry today should not be interested to build roads , bridges or hospitals today ( to improve mission-critical infrastructure ) has never been explained by statists.\\n\\nRoads , hospitals etc all multiply their economic cost into profit multiple times over , even in the short term .

Arathian,europe,"I am an atheist and support a ban on abortion ! \\n\\nYeah , I expect this won\\'t be popular here . \\n\\nI do add a few exceptions to it . If the life of the mother is in direct danger due to the pregnancy , she should have the right to abort . If the child has extreme , uncurable genetic diseases that will make its life miserable and/or very short , abortion should be an option.\\n\\nI also think it should be a state\\ 's top priority to seriously upgrade its motherhood support systems ( social care , free doctor visits and so on ) as well as a seriously improved state care of children in the adoption system . So no , the \\'caring for children\\ ' should not stop the moment they are birthed.\\n\\nI also should clarify I do not believe abortion should be available in case of poverty , teen pregnancy or rape . The child is not responsible for any of the 3 scenarios . I do , obviously , want support for the mothers in all 3 situations though , and very much including psychological support.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- \\n\\nSo , now to my actual reasoning behind the initial statement : \\n\\nMy default position on things are that they are none of my business unless proven otherwise . So until a few years back , I was obviously fully pro-choice.\\n\\nHowever , and this is where 99 % of you will disagree with me , I was convinced that embryos , from fertilisation on , are human the same way you and I am . Anyone who comes to that conclusion , I hope is obvious , would oppose abortion as it would be killing innocent humans in their perspective . And so it was with me.\\n\\nMy reasons behind that change were multiple , however , the main one was that the way we define \ '' human\ '' and \ '' not human\ '' in embryos is so entirely arbitrary it simply is made up.\\n\\nFor example : \\n\\n-A woman gets an abortion at 3 months old : not human\\n\\n-A woman gets assaulted and has a miscarriage as a result at 3 months : person who assaulted her is tried for murder ( and have been convicted of that multiple times ) .\\n\\n-Person whose heart doesn\\'t work - human\\n\\n-Embryo whose heart doesn\\'t work - not human\\n\\nThen we have the completely arbitrary dates . 3 months , 4 months , 5 months and so on . Like if an embryo that is 2 months and 30 days old is suddenly so much less human than an embryo that is 1 day older.\\n\\nIn short , I don\\'t believe there is any concrete , scientific reasoning on why an \ '' embryo\ '' would be any less human than a human grown man . Embryos are human and simply in a different development stage , the same way an old man and a baby are both human in different development stages . Showing me a picture of an embryo being a bunch of cells and going \ '' ooooo , that totally doesn\\'t look like a human\ '' is meaningless . Humans are extremely diverse in their development . \ '' A bunch of cells\ '' looks no more or less like a human than a baby or a 100 year old man does.\\n\\n -- -- -- -\\n\\n\\ntl ; dr I support ban on abortion . I am not a religious nutjob . Reason is I believe embryos are human.\\n",Greek,Greek

Is this the case ? \\n\\nMore young men than young women have indeed been coming to Europe . Of the 1.2m asylum applicants in the last 12 months of available data , 73 % were men , up from 66 % in 2012 . Those men skew increasingly young : according to Eurostat , the proportion of male asylum claimants who were 18- to 34-year-olds was 40 % in October 2015 ( the latest available data ) , up from 35 % in 2012 . Males between 14 and 17 years old accounted for 11 % of all asylum-seekers , up from 5 % in 2012.\\n\\nThe numbers , however , differ by nationality . Around 60 % of all male asylum-seekers from Algeria and Morocco were 18- to 34-year-olds . By contrast just 48 % of the Iraqis , 38 % of the Syrians and 31 % of the Afghans fell into this age group . Proportions of young males also differ by host country ( see chart ) . Sweden took three asylum-seekers for every 1,000 inhabitants in the 12 months to September 2015 . That is the highest ratio in Europe . Alongside this , it also has more young male asylum-seekers : in the past 12 months 17 % were 14- to 17-year-olds , compared with only 6 % in Germany.\\n\\n\\nThis will alter the sex ratio for some age groups in Sweden . As Ms Hudson points out , the teenage population will become more male : currently there are 106 male 14- to 17-year-olds for every 100 women . If all asylum applications are granted , this will change to 116 men to 100 women , while for those aged between 18 and 34 the male-to-female ratio will go from 105:100 to 107:100 . This is worrisome . Skewed sex ratios would mean lots of sexually frustrated young men , which is a recipe for trouble.\\n\\nBut the example of Sweden does not reflect what will happen across the whole of Europe . ( Ms Hudson also conflates asylum applications with asylum granted . Not all of the 20,000 16- to 17-year-olds she says entered Sweden in 2015 will receive full refugee status ; on current trends , around 17,000 will . ) The countries that will be most affected are small , with populations under 10m . Sweden , Hungary , Austria and Norway would see the biggest sex-ratio changes ( and only if they accepted all the asylum-seekers who applied ) . Germany has less to worry about . If it accepted all the young males who sought asylum in the year to October 2015 , its sex ratios would go from 106:100 to 107:100 for 14- to 17-year-olds and from 105:100 to 106:100 for 18- to 34-year-olds . Europe does not have a man problem . Sweden may have .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"[ Full article here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Yibdz6e.png ) \\n\\n**Plain text : **\\n\\nFEW people pondering how to vote in the referendum on Britain\u2019s European Union membership on June 23rd will care which group is designated to vie for their support when the official campaign begins on April 15th . Yet the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision on April 13th to pick Vote Leave from among rival pro-Brexit organisations matters more than many realise.\\n\\nOfficial designation brings with it the right to spend up to \u00a37m ( $ 10m ) , to send a free mailshot to all households , to make a number of campaign broadcasts and to receive \u00a3600,000 of taxpayer funds . Unofficial campaigners are far more restricted in what they are allowed to do . Brexiteers are already fuming because the government sent out its own leaflet this week advocating a vote to remain , at a cost to taxpayers of over \u00a39m . ( The government says it is merely following the examples of the Scottish referendum campaign in 2014 and the 1975 referendum on Europe . ) \\n\\n\\nWhat counts most , however , is the people putting across the message and how they do it . Vote Leave includes such heavyweight Tories as Lord ( Nigel ) Lawson , Michael Gove and Boris Johnson , as well as the UK Independence Party\u2019s only MP , Douglas Carswell . It was deemed by the Electoral Commission to have broader cross-party support than its main rival , Grassroots Out , which relied heavily on UKIP\u2019s leader , Nigel Farage and the financial backing of Arron Banks , a wealthy businessman.\\n\\nMore to the point , Vote Leave has been trying to make a liberal case for Brexit , with a focus on less regulation and freer trade . Grassroots Out and Mr Farage have instead put more emphasis on tougher immigration controls . Both groups recognise that concerns about immigration are the strongest source of support for Brexit . But Vote Leave is offering a more positive message and worries that relying on Mr Farage\u2019s to argue for Brexit might put off centrist and undecided voters . Because Vote Leave seems more sensible than its rival , its official designation may marginally boost the chances of a Brexit vote.\\n\\nThe two groups will presumably now come together anyway . Mr Farage has already congratulated Vote Leave and promised to work with it , as have two Tory MPs who helped to establish Grassroots Out . But Mr Banks and some of his advisers are talking of a judicial challenge to the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision . If they can get a challenge off the ground , which seems unlikely , they could even delay the date of the referendum by a few months.\\n\\nIn the fuss over which pro-Brexit group would be designated , less attention has been paid to the group selected to campaign to remain in the ( EU ) . Britain Stronger in Europe , led by Lord ( Stuart ) Rose , the former boss of Marks & amp ; Spencer , has no rivals , is well financed and has the backing not just of leading pro-Europeans but also of most British businesses . Yet even its fans concede that , by focusing largely on the risks to jobs and the economy from Brexit , it is offering voters a less exciting vision than the Brexiteers are . As our new interactive poll tracker , which will be up on the site Friday April 15th , shows the battle will be an extremely close-run thing.\\n\\n",Greek,Greek
Arathian,europe,"Okey , I say this hopefully without any offence caused but you are severely misinformed if you think \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's rather unlikely anybody will borrow you any more money for quite some time\\n\\nis the extend of what will happen if we bail.\\n\\nFirst of all , since it is a blatant disregard of international law , automatic sanctions will kick in . Know how Greece\\ 's economy is reliant on tourism ? Yeah , that kills that.\\n\\nSecondarily , the debt , even if we pretend doesn\\'t exist , every other country will continue aknowledging its existence . That means we can\\'t enter the market not for \ '' several years\ '' but theoretically forever until we are prepared to pay back and , with Greece\\ 's most important economic sector severely hit , this will take a long arse time.\\n\\nFinally , yes , they absolutely can seize stuff that belongs to the Greek state . A few obvious choices would be from the Greek merchant fleet of which Greece has a large one . Second , a lot of the money we currently \ '' have\ '' ( aka money we borrowed ) is not actually held in Greece , but outside of Greece . We will lose ANY security blanket . That means no oil imports , no energy imports ( of which we do for 80 % of our energy . Means all non-essential buildings could lose electricity for the majority of every day ) , no tharmaceutical imports unless done under humanitarian aid which ... yeah , we will need etc.\\n\\nHell , they could even pull [ this ] ( http : //www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/20/argentina-sailing-ship-ghana-release ) and , imagine , this was done by private individuals and not even a superstate.\\n\\nAnd honestly , this probably is just the surface of the shitshow that will follow immediately of the stupid decision to stop paying debt .

He spots none . A few months ago the seas around the Greek island of Lesbos were filled with overstuffed rubber dinghies ( \u201cballoons with engines\u201d , Mr Karakitsos calls them ) carrying Afghans , Iraqis and Syrians from the Turkish coast . Today they are home only to the more forbidding vessels of the Greek coast guard , Frontex ( the European Union\u2019s border agency ) and NATO , lately arrived to help with maritime surveillance.\\n\\nThe quiet seas are the result of a deal struck between the EU and Turkey to reduce migrant flows , which came into effect on March 20th . It took everyone by surprise , says a European official on Lesbos , and there were teething troubles : the police tailed a Turkish liaison officer stationed on the island , suspecting he was a spy . But for now the migrants have stopped coming . Some of the scrappy volunteer groups that flocked to Lesbos last autumn , when 6,000 refugees might clamber ashore in one day , are closing shop . Larger organisations are moving staff to mainland Greece , where 46,000 refugees have been trapped by the closure of the Macedonian border.\\n\\nThe drama has shifted to Greek ministries , EU agencies and the quasi-prisons on Aegean islands created by the Turkey deal . On Lesbos , all arrivals are taken to Moria , a \u201chotspot\u201d ( processing centre ) turned detention camp . Most will face return once their asylum claims have been found inadmissible , on the ground that they reached Greece from Turkey , now considered a safe country for asylum-seekers . ( Deportations of migrants who did not claim asylum in Greece have already begun . ) Activists consider the deal a shameful abrogation of the EU\u2019s commitment to human rights . The pope , who has attacked Europe\u2019s \u201canaesthetised conscience\u201d on refugees , will visit Lesbos on April 16th.\\n\\nWell over 3,000 souls have been stuffed into Moria , a grim place of barbed wire and watchtowers . Through a fence Muhammad , a Syrian refugee , tells Charlemagne of overcrowded shelters and a complete lack of information before a policeman cuts the conversation short . Pakistanis\u2014who , curiously , have been arriving in greater numbers since the deal kicked in\u2014have begun a hunger strike . The NGOs that used to provide services inside Moria have partly withdrawn in protest , leaving it short of infrastructure , expertise and food . Last week Amnesty International , a human-rights watchdog , criticised the \u201cappalling conditions\u201d at Moria and another centre on the island of Chios.\\n\\nWorse may be to come . All migrants on the island have the right to claim asylum and to appeal if rejected , and 95 % have taken this up . The Greeks plan to conclude each case within just 15 days . But there are endless unanswered questions over the process , from the treatment of unaccompanied minors to the provision of legal aid . \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for us , and for Europe , \u201d says Maria Stavropoulou , the director of the Greek asylum service.\\n\\nVery little about Europe\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis has gone right . This deal is unlikely to be an exception . Refugees who have spent vast sums to flee life-threatening situations may not go willingly . The fate of non-Syrians returned to Turkey is unclear . Legal challenges are certain . The timeline for processing may well slip . In the meantime , if arrivals pick up again , Lesbos could reach its capacity of around 6,000 . Officials have already begun offloading migrants from Moria to other camps . Dozens of EU asylum officials have been dispatched to process the claims . Ms Stavropoulou\u2019s service has doubled in number . But she can not bring herself to say that she is confident the deal will work.\\n\\nMuch of the criticism the deal has attracted is therefore deserved . And yet , as Yannis Mouzalas , the Greek migration minister , notes , by the time it was signed it was the best that could be done . The EU had learned the hard way that it was unable to create a relocation scheme to share the refugee burden , and without one , fences were the only alterEnglish . For those European politicians whose priority was to reduce the flow , the new arrangement looks like a success . New asylum registrations in Germany fell to 21,000 in March , down from over 200,000 in November . Fears that migrants stranded in Greece would find other ways through have not come to pass ; instead , they have camped out in wretched conditions near the border , and elsewhere , in the futile hope that it will reopen one day.\\n\\nAsylum or bust\\nThis has created a tinderbox in Greece\u2014last week Macedonian police tear-gassed migrants who tried to storm the border\u2014but breathing space for politicians . Not long ago pundits speculated that Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , might not see out her term . Now she enjoys rising approval ratings.\\n\\nThat could change if the deal collapses . But there is a bigger concern . There was , despite appearances , a noble idea behind the EU-Turkey deal : stop the irregular migrant flows to make way for regular ones . Europe will probably make good on its minimal commitment to accept one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one sent back from Greece . But the deal also includes a vague promise of far more substantial resettlements to Europe : optimists have spoken of 200,000 a year or more . On this there is little sign of movement , despite the efforts of German and Dutch politicians to corral their colleagues into making pledges.\\n\\nThroughout this crisis Europe has been accused of pulling up the drawbridge and shunting its problems onto its neighbours . So far the accusation has not been warranted . But it will be if the EU fails to make good on its resettlement promises . On the wall of Moria the graffiti is still visible behind the whitewash : \u201cEU shame on you.\u201d If Europe does not show that its refugee policy amounts to more than border closures , detention and forced deportation , it will become impossible not to agree .",Greek,Greek

If they didn\\'t , it wouldn\\'t be an issue in the first place.\\n\\nThe reason people should place the blame on the politicians first is not because the immigrants are innocent little angels , it is because politicians had the actual power to do something and failed misserably.\\n\\nIf you see blames put on immigrants , they are there for a good reason , regardless of your version of reality.\\n\\n & gt ; The article describes everything that is not British as disgusting and problematic and blames the politicians for \ '' siding with the foreigners instead of us\ '' . If that to you does not entail \ '' blaming the foreigners\ '' and it only entails \ '' blaming the politicians\ '' , I don\\'t know what to tell you .

Arathian,europe,"For this week\\ 's thread , I have another recipe . All you Americans or other people who have a grill/grill like machine will be excited : \\n\\n [ **Souvlaki ! ** ] ( https : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Souvlaki-plate.jpg ) \\n\\nPreparation : you need meat . The meat can really vary . Beef is the most common , but lamb , pork , chicken and even swordfish work really well . Cut it in rough , roundish pieces like the picture.\\n\\nMany people also love adding cut veggies , like peppers or even tomatoes . Personally , not a huge fun , but I know many people love it.\\n\\nYou need large , about 6-8 inches ( 15-20 cm ) wooden sticks . If you don\\'t have that , metal sticks also work . For wooden sticks , you probably want to let them soak in water for a few minutes before use . Helps keep them from burning up but it is by no means obligatory . \\n\\nSo , you skewer the meat leaving a bit on both ends for holding . Put your grill on high and wait for it to heat up . When it does , throw the skewered meat on it . Turn it around every couple of minutes.\\n\\nWhen the meat starts taking a colour , you add lots of lemon , a bit of olive oil , oregano , salt and pepper . You can also add garlic but it\\ 's kind of meh in my opinion . Right before you remove them ( after they have been skewered to about \ '' medium well\ '' status ALWAYS ) you can add paprika . That depends how much you like paprica . Some don\\'t put any at all , I love having a fair amount . Done ! Brilliant souvlaki sticks.\\n\\nSide dishes : traditionally ( and as the picture shows ) you have french fries with this . You can also have grilled bread with added olive oil and oregano as side dish as well as some feta cheese to go with the french fries . AlterEnglishly , some pita bread is also great ! \\n\\nAnd of course , [ Greek salad ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lv4re/tuesday_cooking_20150922/cv9ma4n ) which I explained how to do last week.\\n\\n [ Enjoy ! : ) ] ( http : //kalofagas.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/IMG_2232.jpg ) \\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; How is food not part of culture ? \\n\\nHere is the definition of culture\\n\\n & gt ; the ideas , customs , and social behaviour of a particular people or society.\\n\\nWhile certain kinds of foods can be considered \ '' customs\ '' within a cultural context , the food itself is in no way \ '' culture\ '' . Eating Magiritsa during Eastern is considered part of the Greek culture however a random American eating magiritsa ( delicious by the way , try it one day ) does NOT mean he adopted some part of the Greek culture.\\n\\nClear enough ? \\n\\n & gt ; But if you mix two cultures you get a new one in the sense that both influence each other.\\n\\nSo let me re-state it . Show me ONE instance of an organic mix of cultures in Europe . ONE . I don\\'t think it is too much to ask for you to support your theory with a single piece of corroborative evidence.\\n\\n & gt ; And last but not least , using the internet is a bad idea if you want to keep your culture from foreign influence.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to keep my culture from foreign influence . I want my culture to not be replaced by millions of immigrants who create ghettos and out-reproduce the locals . The majority will NEVER adopt the culture of the minority , neither will a very sizable minority . This is exactly what is happening all over Europe and why we are freaking out . \\n\\nLet me explain this a bit further : \\n\\nPeople got somewhat pissed off from all the \ '' Americanization\ '' of everything , but you never saw massive \ '' anti-American\ '' parties rise solely to expel American influences . People bitched and moaned about it , sure , but that is where it stopped.\\n\\nThe reasoning behind that is because the change happened organically and with no higher power forcing it on the people . Nobody came and forced us to eat burgers or watch some chick flick ( not that this is America\\ 's culture , obviously , just generalizing ) . People ARE being forced to be \ '' acceptive\ '' and \ '' inclusive\ '' and \ '' cosmopolitan\ '' now though . The change is NOT organic . This is further worsened by the fact that a cultural balance and demographic balance that held true for thousands of years is being upset.\\n\\nLet me re-re-re-re-re-restate what everyone in this thread keeps repeating : \\n\\nnobody wants to have a monolithic , unchanging culture . People just don\\'t want to be culturally replaced and see their people destroyed . \\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"You presume here the system will be as is today . You also presume that I simply want to ban abortion and not change anything to help support such mothers.\\n\\nUnlike what the user above said , I am EXTREMELY STRONGLY against \ '' ignoring them at birth\ '' .\\n\\nI think , even before banning abortion , there need to be severe changes to the following things : \\n\\n-Social support programs for single mothers and mothers in general\\n\\n-Adoption programs and state care of children\\n\\n-Benefits for mothers\\n\\nBasically , fund each vastly more than they are funded today ( in fact , I think motherhood should be as funded as things like healthcare and the army ) . Being a mother should be , at worst , neutral on your economics .

Its platform includes increased immigration , large benefits for asylum seekers and Greece to give its islands to Israel . Currently has 8-10 % of the vote.\\n\\nPOTAMI : the river .

Arathian,europe,"Hey again folks , \\n\\nOn the 5th of March at [ 7 PM GMT ] ( http : //time.is/GMT ) we start our **NEW EU4 campaign** after finishing the last one . The game , unlike last time , will last 4 hours per session because previously people said 5 hours was a bit much . It\\ 'll be ending at a more reasonable hour for most people which is a good thing.\\n\\nAnyways , you can drop off at any time before that . No hard feelings ! \\n\\nWe only ask to please take a major nation only if you\\ 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it\\ 'll be more fun for everyone if they don\\'t get imploded by the AI.\\n\\n*P.S.\\nNo reason you can\\'t become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . *\\n\\n**TO JOIN : **\\n\\n [ This is /r/Europe\\ 's steam group ] ( http : //steamcommunity.com/groups/EuropeReddit ) . It is open for anyone to join so you don\\'t even need an invitation.\\nThere are two ways to join the actual game.\\n\\n**First way : **\\nOnce you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group\\ 's chat . You can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat.\\n\\n**Second way : **\\nDakarans should be hosting , but you can send me ( The Hound ) , Arathian ( Arathian ) or Dakarans ( Dakarans ) a friend invite and then you can join the game through us by : \\n\\n* Entering EU4 and going into the Multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart EU4 ) \\n* Open your friends list where one of us is\\n* Click on that person\u2019s profile\\n* Click join game button as pictured here [ Friend profile ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/oIYscJI.png ) \\n\\n**FAQ : **\\n\\n*- Do we use some sort of communication tool ? *\\nYES ! For anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend EU4\\ 's whisper functionality ) , we use teamspeak . You don\\'t HAVE to join it , but we strongly recommend it . If you don\\'t know how to set it up , please ask.\\nThe teamspeak server details are : \\nAddress : 185.4.149.102:9152 \\n\\nRoom : EU4Game \\n\\nPassword : europe\\n\\n**-I didn\\'t play last session/last week , can I join now ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Absolutely ! The usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . But if he isn\\'t there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . If an absentee going to be late to a session and don\u2019t want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you\u2019ll be showing up . If you give notice , you can miss **one** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back.\\n\\n**Since this is a NEW game , we will be picking nations from scratch . ** \\nYou can reserve a nation here in this thread , or you can simply pick what\\ 's available when the game starts . You can drop in at the last minute if you wish.\\n**IMPORTANTLY** - Please choose one of the major nations only if you intend to show up every week.\\n\\n**-I can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . That\\ 's fine : ) \\n\\n**-I came 10 minutes late and you have already started/ I crashed /I got annexed and disconnected , what do ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** We will be playing with a ton of people . That means we unfortunately can\\'t be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . We will be having 3 or so restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it\\ 's not the end of the world.\\n\\n**-I am bad at this game**\\n\\nYou are absolutely welcome ! Most of us weren\\'t experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc.\\n\\n**-I have never played this game before**\\n\\nYou are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably won\\'t enjoy this . The game is super complicated and you won\\'t understand most things and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . I would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in SP first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . It is really fun ! \\n\\n**-My internet is trash , can I join anyway ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Sure but ... your internet probably can\\'t handle it if it\\ 's really bad . If you slow down the game too much , it\u2019s not practical to participate . We NEED to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you can\\'t handle that ... .sorry . If you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes : ) \\n\\n***************************\\n\\n**-RULES ? **\\n\\nAnswer : Last game we had only a surrender rule and no other rules which produced some weird situations , so we\\ 've agreed to set up some basic ground rules : \\n\\n* **We are limiting the number of player allies to 2 . **\\nBasically , what this means is that you can have at most 2 allies which are played by humans , but as many AI allies as you can get.\\nThe reason for this is preventing unrealistically huge alliances which stifle the whole game because everyone\\ 's too afraid to do anything . We want to get a lot of smaller alliance blocks for greater diplomacy and tension ! \\n\\n**CLARIFICATION ON THE ABOVE RULE : **\\n\\nThe above rule means that you have to stick with your allies . You can\\'t simply quickly break an alliance to ally someone else just to intervene in a war . If you want to defend/attack someone with some other player , you either have to ally them beforehand , you can guarantee them ( which does not count towards alliance limits ) , you can \ '' demand peace\ '' or you can simply declare a seperate war . Seperate war is important because if the attacked nation surrenders to one of the aggressors , they have to accept so they can turn on you , making ganking up more risky . Breaking alliances in peacetime is , of course , fully allowed . It is also fully allowed to not defend an ally that is attacked . \\n\\n* **If you\u2019re in the top 6 score at the start of the session you\u2019re limited to only 1 other top 6 score player as an ally . **\\nThese nations will be noted in a separate post in the thread before the start of each session . For the first session they\u2019ll stand as ( in no particular order ) : \\nFrance , \\nCastille , \\nAustria , \\nOttomans , \\nEngland , \\nLithuania ( or Poland-Lithuania if PU happens ) \\n\\n* **After the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or PU ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . ** You can pick one at the 1st round\\ 's start though.\\n\\n\\n* **You are allowed to play a player\\ 's colonial nation ( i.e . Thirteen Colonies in Eastern America ) once those are created . ** However , you are limited to two nations supporting your independence , and if you lose your independence war , you lose control of the colonial nation and it has to stay AI . Glory is there for those who seize the opportunity , but choose wisely ! \\n\\n\\n* **Try to be a sporting player . ** This is more of a suggestion since this can hardly be enforced . You are of course allowed ( and encouraged ) to declare war on whoever you think , and take what suits you and what you can conquer ! \\nDo try and play fair ( ish ) at least , don\u2019t deliberately gank people with like 5 separate alliances on your side , try not to gank someone completely at the very beginning of the game ( unless it\u2019s like you\u2019re Castille and he\u2019s Navarra because that\u2019s natural ) , etc.\\nFeel free to plot and scheme with/against players though , it\u2019s one of the most fun parts of the game ! \\n\\n* **No nation ruining . ** If someone surrenders ( by saying \u2018I surrender\u2019 in general chat ) , you HAVE to offer them a peace deal at maximum 100 warscore . Taking more than 100 warscore per war is not allowed.\\n\\nHave fun ! \\n\\n**P.S.\\nFeel free to ask any question regarding this MP game or EU4 in general in this thread or anywhere else . Don\u2019t be afraid to ask ! **\\n\\n**PSS : ** [ here ] ( http : //rghost.net/7mtCchFzp ) is an upload of the save file if someone wants to snoop around .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**FULL TEXT FOR THOSE WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE ECONOMIST**\\n\\n\\nGREECE\u2019S migrant crisis is getting worse . Macedonia has closed its border to all but a trickle of migrants , following the example of Austria and other countries along the so-called West Balkans route to Germany . Yet desperate Syrians and Iraqis continue to arrive at the Idomeni crossing point . On February 29th Macedonian police used tear gas against scores of migrants trying to break down the border fence . As The Economist went to press , more than 12,000 people were crammed into a tent camp with facilities for only 1,500 . Food is in short supply . \u201cIt\u2019s a tense situation , \u201d says Panagiota Siafaka , a social worker with the UN High Commission for Refugees.\\n\\nSo long as the border remained open , Greece could manage the flow of arrivals from Turkey . Now almost 30,000 migrants are bottled up in Greece . Nikos Kotzias , the foreign minister , expects the number to reach 150,000 ; local aid agencies worry that 200,000 people may arrive in March alone . Reception centres around Athens for migrants are hopelessly overcrowded . Half a dozen new ones , mostly refurbished former military camps , are quickly filling up . Local and international charities provide food and medical care . \u201cThe state seems absent , but luckily ordinary people are here every day to help , \u201d says Mariana , a paediatrician working at Piraeus port , gesturing towards a group of elderly Greek women handing out bananas and chocolate bars to harassed mothers in headscarves.\\n\\nThings will improve , if only gradually . Greece expects to receive a large chunk of the EU\u2019s new \u20ac700m ( $ 760m ) , three-year humanitarian aid package for countries that host a lot of migrants . Of that , \u20ac300m would be spent this year . Athens-based aid agencies hope that funds will bypass the slow-moving Greek bureaucracy , going straight to needy migrants in the form of vouchers for food and housing.\\n\\n\\nBut stemming the flow of migrants from Turkey is proving hard . A NATO naval mission was due to begin monitoring the strait between Greece and Turkey on February 29th , electronically locating smugglers\u2019 boats so Turkish coastguards could nudge them back to shore . But on March 2nd the NATO vessels were still in port . The Greek defence ministry said Turkey had raised \u201ctechnical problems\u201d.\\n\\nEU leaders hope for a breakthrough at a summit on March 7th with Ahmet Davutoglu , Turkey\u2019s prime minister . The Turkish government has yet to crack down on the people-smugglers . Diplomats in Athens believe the Turks will make a deal conditional on EU countries resettling Syrians from refugee camps in southern Turkey . Meanwhile , Turkey has agreed to take back economic migrants who crossed to the Greek islands from Turkey . After weeks of bureaucratic exchanges between the Greek and Turkish police , a first group of 270 Moroccans , Tunisians and Algerians were handed into Turkish custody on March 2nd at the land border in Thrace . A group of 150 Pakistanis will be next . It is a modest start , yet even a small reduction in numbers helps relieve Greece\u2019s migrant burden .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"***Full text***\\n\\n\\nHOW big is the world\u2019s appetite for things Danish ? Foreign audiences have already binge-watched the country\u2019s noir TV series ( such as \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cThe Bridge\u201d ) and raved over the new Nordic cuisine of Noma , Copenhagen\u2019s trend-setting restaurant . This autumn , publishers are testing the limits of the world\u2019s Danomania . Before the Christmas season , at least nine English-language books will come out devoted to explaining the elusive quality of hygge.\\n\\nHygge is difficult to pronounce . ( Try \u201chew-geh\u201d . ) It is also tricky to describe . Writers have tried \u201cthe art of creating intimacy\u201d , \u201ccosiness of the soul\u201d and \u201ccocoa by candlelight\u201d . It is an attitude rather than a recipe , evoking relaxation with close friends or family . Many see it as a quintessential element of Denmark\u2019s national character . There is some evidence for this : the Danes are Europe\u2019s biggest consumers of candles , burning through about 6 kilogrammes ( 13 pounds ) per person every year . Runner-up Austria manages just half that . Denmark often leads ( highly subjective ) rankings of the happiest countries , and hygge is being marketed as a way for foreigners to imitate the Danes\u2019 balanced , relaxed , egalitarian lifestyle.\\n\\nBut not all Danes agree . Jeppe Trolle Linnet , an anthropologist at the University of Southern Denmark , argues that hygge is not the great social leveller it appears . Danes dislike acknowledging class differences , but his research finds that the habits of hygge vary by income and social status . For some , hygge is a bottle of burgundy with soft jazz on the hi-fi ; for others it is a can of beer while watching football on telly . Worse , different groups are uncomfortable with others\u2019 interpretations of hygge . Mr Linnet calls it a \u201cvehicle of social control\u201d , involving \u201ca negative stereotyping of social groups who are perceived as unable to create hygge\u201d.\\n\\nIn this , hygge resembles the German quality of gem\u00fctlichkeit , which also implies a sense of cosiness , peace of mind and\u2014crucially\u2014social acceptance . And although the desire for communality does encourage social solidarity , it can also mean excluding strangers . Getting to hygge with a local is not always easy : in Denmark even crowded buses can be eerily silent . Danes have a reputation for aloofness.\\n\\nA recent report on the quality of life for expatriates in 67 countries , compiled by an organisation called InterNations , bears this out . Denmark\u2019s own Englishs may rank it top for happiness , but the immigrants in the survey ranked it 60th in terms of friendliness , 64th for being made to feel welcome , and 67th for the ease of finding friends . Finishing just ahead of Denmark on the finding-friends measure was Norway , the country from which the Danes imported the word hygge . If cultures are obsessed with the joys of relaxing with old friends , perhaps it is because they find it stressful to make new ones .",Greek,Greek

Which is a very strange idea , especially considering it is a well known fact we have huge problems with huge swaths of immigrants in the camps .

The convention also imposes other obligations on states , such as to secure equal treatment for refugees and issue special travel documents to refugees , which can be used instead of their national passport.\\n\\nThe effect of the convention is that states are required to determine asylum claims made by anyone within their territory . The principal exception to this is where there is a safe third country to which the person can be sent in order for substantive consideration to be given to their claim . Removing a person to a safe third country will not engage the removing state\\ 's obligations under the convention unless doing so exposes the person to a real risk of refoulement.\\n\\n**There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country . There has , however , been a longstanding \ '' first country of asylum\ '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . This principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined . ** \ '' \\n\\nSo books have been written , you just haven\\'t read them.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full post for those without an economist subscription** : \\n\\nWHAT a difference a month makes . On the night of September 4th Angela Merkel made the most dramatic decision of her decade as German chancellor : to suspend European asylum rules and allow tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary to enter Germany via Austria . It was a moral gesture that fitted the mood of the moment . As The Economist went to press , Mrs Merkel was considered a favourite to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\\n\\nIn Germany , however , that altruistic embrace has caused a backlash that could weaken a chancellor so far considered all but invincible . Using uncharacteristically missionary language , Mrs Merkel said repeatedly that the right to asylum has \u201cno upper limit\u201d . But Joachim Gauck , who as president is expected to keep out of workaday politics , responded that \u201cour reception capacity is limited even when it has not yet been worked out where these limits lie.\u201d As though on cue , the political tone turned against Mrs Merkel . \\n\\nThe numbers are dramatic . More than 200,000 migrants are believed to have arrived in Germany in September alone . For the year , official forecasts had already risen in August from 450,000 to 800,000 . This week Bild , Germany\u2019s largest tabloid , cited estimates that the number could reach 1.5m\u2014equivalent to the population of Munich . New refugees keep pouring in , and those granted asylum have the right to bring family later . No end is in sight.\\n\\nProcessing centres exceeded capacity weeks ago . Local authorities are struggling to find housing , since temporary tent cities will not suffice in winter . The government of Hamburg has begun seizing empty office buildings to house refugees , raising constitutional questions . Berlin and Bremen are considering similar measures . Schools are struggling to integrate refugee children who speak no German.\\n\\nFights have broken out inside overcrowded asylum centres , often between young men of different ethnic or religious groups . There have been more arson attacks on migrant centres . In Dresden , a xenophobic movement called Pegida is growing again : about 9,000 protested this Monday against refugees.\\n\\nMainstream society is tolerant but edgy . In a survey by German public television 51 % of Germans say that they fear the refugee influx , 13 points more than in September . Approval of Mrs Merkel dropped by 9 points to her lowest level since 2011 ( though it is still a respectable 54 % ) . In two other polls Mrs Merkel slid from Germany\u2019s most popular politician to fourth.\\n\\nThe fiercest criticism of Mrs Merkel comes from within her own conservative bloc\u2014the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , which she leads , and the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , which exists only in Bavaria and usually supports her . Horst Seehofer , the CSU\u2019s boss and premier of Bavaria , called Mrs Merkel\u2019s decision \u201ca mistake that will keep us occupied for a long time\u201d . In one meeting he threatened half-seriously to drop off busloads of refugees at the federal parliament in Berlin.\\n\\nGerda Hasselfeldt , a CSU parliamentary leader , wants to erect transit zones along Germany\u2019s borders like those in airports . Markus S\u00f6der , Bavaria\u2019s finance minister , has called for a fence . A group of Christian Democrats calling itself the \u201csecurity club\u201d debated closing Germany\u2019s borders to refugees entirely . Another group has written a letter to Mrs Merkel charging that her refugee policy breaks the law.\\n\\nIn response Mrs Merkel\u2019s government is scrambling to make changes . It has passed legislation that cuts pocket money to refugees , currently \u20ac143 ( $ 160 ) a month , and replaces it with vouchers . More police and administrators are being hired . All Balkan countries have been declared \u201csafe\u201d so that their asylum applicants can be rejected and deported faster . On October 6th Mrs Merkel took charge of co-ordinating refugee policy , in effect demoting the interior minister , Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re.\\n\\nNone of this , however , will reduce the numbers of Syrians , Iraqis and Afghans who are fleeing war . Nor will last month\u2019s agreement by the European Union to allocate 120,000 refugees among member states . Mrs Merkel had lobbied fiercely for it , but the compromise will barely dent Germany\u2019s refugee numbers.\\n\\nShe is now concentrating her effort on getting Turkey , whence most refugees cross into the EU , to intercept and keep more migrants . But Turkey already hosts more than 2m . It will demand concessions such as easing visa restrictions for Turks entering the EU . It will also expect Germany to tone down criticism of Turkish crackdowns on the press and on Kurdish separatists . It may ask for German help to create a buffer zone in Syria.\\n\\nMeanwhile , Germans have begun to feel that the refugee crisis could change Germany even more than reunification did 25 years ago . Back then the task was to let that which belongs together grow together , as Willy Brandt , a former chancellor , famously said . Speaking on October 3rd , the anniversary of unification , Mr Gauck\u2014like Mrs Merkel a former East German\u2014said that today\u2019s challenge is greater because \u201cwhat should now grow together has so far not belonged together.\u201d Germans worry whether Muslim refugees will accept German norms of sexual equality , secularism and Germany\u2019s special responsibility towards Israel and Jews.\\n\\nThe backlash does not yet threaten Mrs Merkel\u2019s hold on power . While extremist parties have become serious contenders for power in some other European countries , they remain marginal in Germany , and voters have faith that their government will restore order , says Timo Lochocki of the German Marshall Fund , a think-tank . The chancellor faces no Christian Democratic challenger . The centre-left Social Democrats are internally torn . And the leftist opposition can not attack her for a refugee policy they themselves support.\\n\\nMrs Merkel is under pressure as never before . Yet the crisis has brought out a new style of leadership in her . For years she has been accused of following public opinion rather than guiding it . Now she has found her moral calling . \u201cIf we start having to apologise for showing a friendly face in emergencies , \u201d she says defiantly , \u201cthen this is not my country.\u201d",Greek,Greek

I have many times before advocated for opening large refugee camps in the countries affected to process people in need from there to bring to Europe . That would screen people before arriving in our continent and also prioritize people needing asylum first over whomever has enough money/ has the physical ability ( meaning usually he is a 20something male ) to come.\\n\\nNot accepting the flood completely does not contradict our stance on human rights.\\n\\n & gt ; we are criticized by middle eastern countries for not reacting\\n\\nMost middle east countries have accepted exactly 0 refugees . if they criticize us , we are free to laugh in their faces.\\n\\n & gt ; it creates a bigger crisis at EU\\ 's door , probably needing more military intervention from EU countries\\n\\nThe majority of the youth leaving Syria is also a crisis for the country . Also , see my first point . Processing them is possible without fucking up our border situation.\\n\\n & gt ; more money spent by NOT welcoming refugees than by building welcome centers within and out of the EU . \\n\\nSee my first point on this . Also , how do we lose money by not accepting them ? \\n\\n & gt ; plus future citizens bringing consumption and potential growth to welcoming country\\n\\nImmigrants from outside the EU are proven to be a net loss in almost all cases . We won\\'t make money accepting Syrians , especially considering most of them are statistically uneducated , unspecialized and many have some very weird ideas about culture and religion.\\n\\n & gt ; most individual EU countries\\ ' constitutions grant full rights of asylum to anyone in need ( for example Article # 4 of the French Republic\\ 's constitution preamble , or art . 16 of Germany\\ 's constitution etc ) \\n\\nCorrect . Asylum and refugees however have very specific meanings.\\n\\n [ Here is an article by the guardian detailing it ] ( http : //www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position ) \\n\\nTo quote the relevant parts : \\n\\n & gt ; There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country . There has , however , been a longstanding \ '' first country of asylum\ '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . This principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"[ full article here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/A57tEX1.png ) \\n\\nFull text : \\n\\n\\nBEFORE reading a \u201cpoem\u201d on German television on March 31st , Jan B\u00f6hmermann , a satirist of questionable tact , explained that he wanted to clarify the boundaries of free-speech law . He then declaimed a series of obviously fictional passages ( in rhyming verse ) depicting Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the president of Turkey , engrossed in a series of athletically challenging sexual activities with barnyard animals . By the time the broadcaster took the video off its website a day later , it had caused a diplomatic fracas between Turkey and Germany.\\n\\nThe tension had been a long time brewing . In 2007 the chancellor , Angela Merkel , snubbed Mr Erdogan by opposing Turkish membership of the European Union . As Mr Erdogan\u2019s rule became increasingly autocratic , Mrs Merkel often chided him for nobbling dissidents and the press . But in 2015 refugees started streaming into the EU via Turkey . Suddenly Mrs Merkel needed Mr Erdogan\u2019s help.\\n\\nThe result is the deal that the EU , at Mrs Merkel\u2019s prodding , made with Turkey last month . In return for taking back migrants from Greece and cracking down on people-smugglers , Turkey gets billions in aid and new talks about joining the EU . Its citizens will also be allowed to travel visa-free in Europe . Mrs Merkel is now reluctant to criticise Mr Erdogan.\\n\\nBasking in its new importance , Turkey has summoned the German ambassador for a dressing-down three times in recent weeks . One complaint was over a mildly satirical song about Mr Erdogan aired on German television on March 17th . At that point Mrs Merkel declared press freedom sacrosanct\u2014prompting Mr B\u00f6hmermann to up the ante.\\n\\nOn April 10th Ankara dispatched a formal diplomatic note , invoking an antiquated German law against insulting foreign heads of state . In theory Mr B\u00f6hmermann could go to prison for three years , if the German government decides to prosecute . Amid howls of outrage in Germany , Mrs Merkel has yet to rule this out . Mr Erdogan has also filed a personal complaint on the same charges.\\n\\nMrs Merkel will need all her diplomatic skill to contain this spat . The stakes are greater than Mr Erdogan\u2019s fragile ego : freedom of speech , the refugee crisis and Syrian policy are all in the mix . Meanwhile , another blow-up is on the horizon . This spring the German Bundestag is set to vote on whether the mass killings of Armenians by Turks a century ago constituted genocide . Expect Turkish tempers to fray .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"# ARTICLE\\n\\n**The plan is fraught with problems , and will be difficult to enforce**\\n\\nALTHOUGH he was not there , it was hard to escape Donald Trump at the European Union\u2019s latest summit . Held in Malta on February 3rd , the day-long event focused on new plans for handling migration , particularly for stemming the flow of people making their way towards Europe from sub-Saharan Africa through Libya and across the Mediterranean . It also touched upon broader ( and slightly wonky ) questions of what the EU means 60 years on from the Rome treaty . But it was Mr Trump who dominated proceedings . Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , the French president , called his American counterpart\u2019s comments earlier this month denigrating the EU \u201cunacceptable\u201d . Describing the new migration plans , Federica Mogherini , the union\u2019s foreign policy chief , said \u201cwe do not believe in bans and walls\u201d , a slap at Mr Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees and his plans for a wall on America\u2019s Mexican border . Yet the EU\u2019s new plans could be just as chaotic and ineffective as Mr Trump\u2019s.\\n\\nAfter the EU struck a deal with Turkey in March 2016 to crack down on people-smuggling in the Aegean sea , the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece dropped dramatically , from 57,000 in February 2016 to about 3,400 in August . But the numbers making their way from Libya have not decreased . Some 180,000 arrived in Italy last year , with more than 4,000 dead or missing on the crossing . Many of them are economic migrants , not refugees . The largest proportion came from Nigeria , which has very low asylum acceptance rates . Most experienced extreme hardship on the route : reports of beatings , rapes and torture in Libya are common.\\n\\nThe EU is now attempting to implement a version of the EU-Turkey deal in Libya in order to stem the tide . A day before the summit Paolo Gentiloni , the Italian prime minister , signed a deal with Fayez al-Sarraj , the prime minister of the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) , the UN-backed Libyan government . Italy will provide money to try to persuade the GNA to stop smugglers sending thousands of people out on flimsy boats . The EU backed the deal at the summit , providing an additional \u20ac200m ( $ 216m ) to an EU fund for Africa ( already worth \u20ac1.8bn ) , and confirming plans to train up the Libyan coast guard . Transit countries , such as Niger and Mali , have also been targeted with promises of cash and international help ( particularly from Germany ) .\\n\\nThe point , said Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , was not to keep out genuine refugees : \u201cThis is not about who has the right to claim asylum.\u201d Rather , she said , it was about destroying the smugglers\u2019 business model . Along with preventing people from attempting the Mediterranean journey , Europe will need to try to make their home countries safer , or to establish safe havens in nearby countries . European leaders seem to hope that migrants can be persuaded to stay put . Mrs Merkel said that on a trip to Niger last year she spoke with former migrants who had travelled to Libya , faced horrendous conditions there , and been persuaded by the International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) to return to their home countries.\\n\\nYet Mrs Merkel acknowledged that at the moment the GNA does not have the \u201cnecessary stability\u201d to implement such policies . This is an understatement . Libya today is close to lawless : the GNA has limited control outside of Tripoli , the capital , while the coast is ruled by competing militias . The EU is mulling getting neighbouring countries , such as Tunisia or Egypt , involved , but the plans are vague . Training up Libyan coastguards , a good idea in theory , may prove ineffective ; they may belong to militias . Last year one group of Libyan coastguards boarded an NGO-run search-and-rescue boat . Other NGOs have accused coastguards of beating migrants with sticks.\\n\\nThe plan might not just fail to prevent emigration ; it could also make life more miserable for thousands of migrants . The Italy-Libya deal calls for establishing \u201creception centres\u201d , but does not explain what they would be , says Federico Soda of the IOM . Detention centres , run by different militias and other groups , already exist all over Libya . Most provide miserable accommodation to those who are stuck in them , almost always against their will . For the plan to work these centres would have to offer more humane conditions . The EU will also need to make a concerted effort at state-building in Libya , Niger and other countries along the route , with enough money and regular monitoring , says Elizabeth Collett of the Migration Policy Institute , a think-tank\u2014something for which Western countries no longer have much appetite.\\n\\nIf the situation now seems dire , that is partly because it has been left to fester for too long . The Italian government has been complaining to the EU about the failure to tackle African migration for decades . Indeed , the EU\u2019s plan to bottle up migrants in Libya is reminiscent of the deal Silvio Berlusconi cut with Muammar Qaddafi , the former Libyan dictator , to do the same . But it was not until the catastrophic overflow of migration from Turkey to Greece in 2015 that policies for the central Mediterranean route began to be implemented . Mrs Merkel acknowledged this at the summit ; at a lunch , she said , EU leaders had discussed why \u201csometimes we are far too slow\u201d.\\n\\nSuch deliberation over migration policy is preferable to the angry rashness Mr Trump has shown in his first weeks in office . But in the face of a humanitarian disaster such as the Mediterranean refugee crisis , hesitation can be as dangerous as haste .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text for those without a subscription to the economist : **\\n\\nWHEN the European Union picked Malta as the site for this week\u2019s EU-Africa migration summit , it seemed a logical choice . The island nation is perched in the Mediterranean halfway between Libya and Italy . For a time , it was one of the top destinations for migrants from Africa trying to reach Europe . And Valletta , Malta\u2019s fortified Baroque capital , is a very telegenic spot for a summit . ( In \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d , a television series , it serves as the backdrop for the port city of Pentos , whose own asylum seekers include the Targaryans , an exiled royal family . ) But Malta is also apt in a way EU leaders may not have intended : as a standpoint from which to observe Europe\u2019s increasingly confused attitude towards refugees and other immigrants.\\n\\nAfrican migrants encounter as much undisguised hostility here as anywhere in Europe . Neil Falzon , who runs Aditus , a local human rights organisation , says many have been spat upon in the street . As in much of eastern Europe , unfamiliarity breeds contempt . Until the turn of the century , the island had one of the most ethnically homogenous societies in Europe , though its unique identity is actually the product of centuries of racial mingling . ( The result is a English population who look a bit like Italians , speak a bit like Arabs and drive on the left like the British . ) \\n\\nIn the early 2000s , when thousands of African asylum seekers began landing here annually , it came as a shock . \u201cA lot of elderly people had never seen a coloured person , \u201d says the leader of the opposition Nationalist Party , who condemns racism ( while unwittingly using a politically incorrect term ) . Maltese xenophobes can fall back on a rational argument : Malta is both the EU\u2019s smallest state and its most densely populated one . Maltese feel they should have to take fewer migrants than larger states . \\n\\nYet strangely , without anyone much noticing , they seem to have got what they want . Malta is barely 200 miles from Libya , still a major transit country for refugees though no longer as important as Turkey . But the flow to Malta has virtually shut down\u2014and no one knows why . Over 140,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea in the year to November 10th ; in Malta , since the end of January , the number is just 20 . Meanwhile , the economy has been thriving . Malta has succeeded in becoming something Viktor Orban , the eurosceptic Hungarian prime minister , might dream of : an EU state with enviable growth figures and almost no migrants.\\n\\nThe signs of prosperity are everywhere . Winter sun-seekers throng Republic Street , Valletta\u2019s main thoroughfare . Everywhere one looks , sandstone palazzos are being converted into plush offices for foreign firms . Tower cranes dot the horizon . The Maltese economy grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of more than 5 % . Unemployment is the third-lowest in the EU . The budget deficit this year is expected to be 1.6 % of GDP.\\n\\nMalta has undoubtedly benefited from an \u201cArab winter\u201d effect , as tourists who might otherwise be in Egypt or Tunisia opt for a safer alterEnglish . But the government prefers to stress its own contributions . In 2013 Joseph Muscat , the leader of the Labour party , swept to office with an implausible pledge to cut the island\u2019s sky-high energy tariffs by 25 % . Helped by the fall in oil prices , he managed it ( though at the cost of getting the state-owned power company to set artificially low prices and rack up debt ) . \u201cI think that we can do what Singapore has done , \u201d says the 41-year-old Mr Muscat , who has the same missionary zeal as Matteo Renzi , prime minister of neighbouring Italy.\\n\\nOne would think such talk would have migrants hastening to his island . Yet there are virtually no new arrivals , no rickety fishing vessels full of human cargo . Not a single large boat has landed on Malta this year . Even migrants rescued by Maltese vessels in Malta\u2019s search-and-rescue area are being taken to Italy instead.\\n\\nConspiracy theorists speculate that the Italians are helping in return for a chunk of Malta\u2019s lucrative air space , or have secretly been granted prospecting rights for oil and gas . The prime minister denies any secret deal with his friend Mr Renzi , and protests that Malta has taken its share of refugees under burden-sharing arrangements with Italy and Greece . But Mr Falzon estimates there are today only about 2,000 migrants on Malta who arrived irregularly , less than 0.5 % of the population.\\n\\nFortress Malta , Fortress Europa ? \\nAt the EU-Africa migration summit , European leaders pleaded with African countries to help them to bring their migrant problem under control . Countries that arrest people-smugglers , and accept the return of migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected , will be given aid\u2014\u20ac1.8 billion ( $ 2 billion ) of it , says the European Commission\u2014as well as more access to European markets and more visas for their citizens . As the summit was meeting , Sweden , one of Europe\u2019s friendliest countries to refugees , announced it would set limits on asylum applications . Could Europe as a whole aim for the same migrant-free prosperity as Malta ? \\n\\nPerhaps , were it not that Malta\u2019s economic renaissance depends heavily on migration . According to the Malta Employers\u2019 Association , expatriates ( European or otherwise ) now make up 12 % of the labour force . Foreign workers have flocked to the island nation to work in growth industries such as financial services , generic pharmaceuticals and online gaming . Locals say some asylum-seekers who have been accepted in other Mediterranean countries , like Spain , are coming to Malta in search of jobs . The country even offers passports to anyone who invests \u20ac1m.\\n\\nMalta is not keeping immigrants out ; it welcomes them , but preferably if they are European , skilled or wealthy . This may be a viable strategy for small Mediterranean islands , but not for an entire continent of greying workers . Leaders who draw lessons from Malta\u2019s success should keep in mind that if Europe wants to bring in immigrants to grow its economy , they will by definition have to come from outside Europe . From Africa , perhaps .",Greek,Greek

Multinational corporations are , by definition , not bound to any one country . You can\\'t blame something as massive as \ '' Europe\ '' either . I mean , my country was a Muslim colony up until 1829 . Some cases can be more clear , like US corporations doing crap like blood diamonds in Africa or the ( British ) BP oil fucking up the golf of Mexico but even then it is the fault of the corporations , not the countries these happen to reside in.\\n\\n & gt ; I simply mean to say that they play a part and benefit from that system.\\n\\nThat is an unsubstantiated statement . How do we currently profit ? Did the Brits profit 200 years ago from the colony in India ? Yeah , they did , at least some of them . Did the French ? Also yes . But currently we don\\'t have colonies and we do not profit from our none-existent colonies . The \ '' past wealth accumulation\ '' is honestly a horrible argument . Are we also gon na go around demanding Turkey hand over their lands \ '' back\ '' to us ? Should we go to kaliningrad and kick out the Russians to put the Germans back there ? \\n\\nInjustices that happened on another era with another mindset might server as examples for today but the American attitude that people , who had nothing to do with it , profit or should feel bad about it today is absurd .

We can\\'t and shouldn\\'t try to right all wrongs , that is stupid.\\n\\n & gt ; It is pretty hard to say Europe has their hands clean when these countries were ruled by Europe and had their borders drawn by Europe .

That\\ 's kinda what we are discussion here , such laws . I disagree with them and think no state should have such laws.\\n\\nIf I say \ '' a state has no right to ban religious conversion\ '' and you state , correctly , that SA prohibits converting from Islam under the penalty of death , that doesn\\'t invalidate my point in any way.\\n\\n & gt ; The controversy with Orthodox Jews has pretty much nothing to do with their garb and everything to do with their beliefs and practices ( morality policing , refusing to work , etc ) . Ditto with Islam/Muslims . Nobody kicks a fuss about kippas and Sikh turbans.\\n\\nSo let me state that : I have a problem with kippas , sikh turbans and that thing that looks like a nijab Christians used to wear 100 years ago . I don\\'t think they should be banned , naturally , but I highly discourage people from wearing such garbs on a personal level and want to encourage such an attitude on a societal level.\\n\\nIs that satisfyingly inclusive in your opinion ? \\n\\n & gt ; Ultimately it\\ 's a philosophical difference , but I don\\'t see anti-discrimination laws as anymore a loss of freedom than , say , seatbelt or speeding laws.\\n\\nBoth speeding laws and seatbelts have a thing in common : they affect other people than you . If you speed , you will create accidents . If you don\\'t wear your seatbelts and get in an accident , you will be propelled from your sit and crash into the guy in front of you , killing them.\\n\\nThat\\ 's not the same as \ '' anti-discrimination laws\ '' that affect private businesses . \\n\\n -- -\\n\\nAs a side-note . I do think discrimination is bad . Some more than others , but all inherently bad . I want to reduce certain behaviours ( like overt religious expression ) but I believe that should be done through education , not societal exclusion.\\n\\nBut anti-discrimination laws are bad and only drive people to resentment against the protected group . \\n\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek
Arathian,europe,"& gt ; Freedom of religion is a central right in , like , every single western constitution.\\n\\nAgreed . \\n\\nBut private individuals can not violate your freedom of religion unless they actively harm you because of your religion .

West has ( thankfully ) abolished almost all of these but , for another example , would be orthodox Jews and their garb . Orthodox jews , of course , are far less of an issue as they tend to be a model minority otherwise . But the controversy is a very real one , especially in Israel.\\n\\n & gt ; There was a time when private businesses were allowed to openly discriminate ; it was so terrible for minorities that it led to us deciding as a society that such \ '' freedom\ '' isn\\'t worth the social cost ( and cost to some segments of society\\ 's ability to function and live as equal citizens ) .\\n\\nI disagree .

In fact , let me repeat it : \\n\\n**Wearing a Hijab is a brazen , absolute and utter rejection of Western culture , traditions and shows a complete unwillingness to integrate**\\n\\nJust because \ '' your friend\ '' wears one doesn\\'t make it okey . A hijab is a symbol of oppression of women and is being consistently used to oppress women , including in the West . The hijab is not a religious garb but a cultural Arabian garb that has been impossed as part of the islamist rise in the 60s . The hijab is a declaration that you do not wish to integrate in society by pointing yourself out and directly stating that your primary trait is your religion in a country where secularism is the law.\\n\\nYour friend and you should be ashamed for promoting such garb .

Arathian,europe,"So I will go back to what you told me above : \\n\\n & gt ; No one is expecting the west to take in every possible refugee.\\n\\nIf *we aren\\'t expected to take them all* but nobody else takes any ( as is very much the case ) , who will ? \\n\\nEither some will be left out or China will have the biggest change of heart from any country in history.\\n\\n & gt ; Being refugees , they\\ 're already in the category - most at need.\\n\\nJust to be clear : you believe an able bodied 20 year old Muslim from Syria is in the exact same danger and need as a pregnant , 20 year old Christian woman from Syria ? \\n\\nOr do you believe that the degrees of danger shouldn\\'t matter ? \\n\\n & gt ; The refugee convention says you should accept all that come , not that you should be obliged to pay for them to come to you.\\n\\nI don\\'t think setting a refugee camp in Syria ( or paying some country to host it ) to process refugees is \ '' paying them to come to us\ '' . It will be a space to actually hold people in immediate need while also processing people according to ( what I believe are ) differing degrees of need to come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; The reason we see so many people coming by more dangerous paths ( and hence makes who are more likely to survive ) is because of how European governments made the refugee convention work with airlines - namely that if an airline bring in an asylum seeker who\\ 's by a refugee , they have to pay for their flight back . If we got rid of this rule we would see the most vulnerable being able to make it to Europe first.\\n\\nCould you explain this further ? You can ask asylum at an airport to the best of my knowledge .

Arathian,europe,"**FULL TEXT : **\\n\\nON AUGUST 11th Amnesty International , a human rights charity , announced its support for decriminalising prostitution between consenting adults . Laws over prostitution differ by country : in Britain the sale of sex is legal , but pimping and brothels are not , while in America it is illegal in all states but Nevada . Increasingly , however , human rights campaigners are calling for it to be decriminalised , as it is in several European countries . Amnesty\u2019s recommendation follows on from similar ones made by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS . Is decriminalising sex work a good idea or not ? \\n\\nAmnesty\u2019s decision has found fierce opposition : a letter from the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women , an NGO , signed by a few former sex workers and actors including Meryl Streep and Lena Dunham argues that it \u201cwill in effect support a system of gender apartheid\u201d . Those opposed to decriminalisation argue that prostitution as a trade inevitably leads to the trafficking of vulnerable women : the letter from the coalition says that since sex work was legalised in Germany the number of women trafficked to the country has boomed and that it has become the \u201cBordello of Europe\u201d . Rather than prosecute women for selling sex , many think that the \u201cSwedish model\u201d , which made buying sex illegal in 1999 , is one which should be followed . Norway , Iceland and France have adopted similar models , and the European Parliament has championed it . The Swedish model attempts to wipe out prostitution by reducing demand.\\n\\nBut it is not completely clear that the Swedish model has worked . Those who support decriminalisation\u2014which includes this newspaper , along with many sex workers\u2014point to the fact that pushing prostitution underground can have ugly consequences . Violence against prostitutes can go unpunished , as women may be less likely to go to the police if they are considered to be at the margin of the law . Street work , which had declined in Sweden , increased again after the law was passed , putting many women in more danger than before . Prostitutes may also be less likely to seek medical advice . When Rhode Island accidentally decriminalised prostitution in 2003\u2014a legal loophole from 1980 was found to only criminalise the sale of sex outdoors\u2014the state did see an increase in the amount of indoor sex work . But , according to one paper , the number of rape offenses also dropped by 31 % between 2003 and 2009 , when the trade was once again made illegal , while there were 39 % fewer cases of female gonorrhoea . Making the purchase of sex between two consenting adults illegal is also deeply illiberal.\\n\\nFears over human trafficking and child abuse should not be dismissed lightly . But laws against both exist and should be strictly enforced . And prostitution , even if made illegal , will not be eliminated : old estimates put the value of the trade in America at $ 14 billion annually ( it is now likely to be far higher ) . Rather than chase the elusive goal of stamping out a trade , the safety of prostitutes who do their work willingly should be made paramount . Countries , as well as human-rights organisations , should look at the evidence .",Greek,Greek

By saying that Putin\\ 's actions were identical to Hitler\\ 's in regard to this , I\\ 'm *not* saying that the people of Crimea didn\\'t want to be part of Russia , same way that am I not saying that the people of Sudetendland didn\\'t want to be part of Hitler\\ 's Third Reich . They did and they did.\\n\\nYou\\ 're Hitlerists , because just like Hitler , you use that desire in order to grab the territory from the neighboring nation -- against any concept of national sovereignty . But if this was *reversed* , if some region within your borders wanted to leave you , then you would put that down with violence.\\n\\nThe borders between the Ukrainian and the Russian nations were fucking ESTABLISHED . You had *agreed* to them . You had never claimed that any region that wants to leave from each of those nations , must be allowed to leave them . That\\ 's not how national sovereignty works.\\n\\nYou seem quite ignorant of history in general ; and more specifically of what Hitler did and was and argued .

This was so absurd that no country in the world could support us , and indeed none did . \\n\\n**Turkey : ** Our mere membership helps defend against Turkish aggression . Same with Cyprus -- its EU membership is a tremendous boost to its physical security from Turkish aggression . \\n\\nIf you don\\'t see this to be the case , then imagine how angry Russia would be if we let Ukraine or Georgia join up as members of the EU -- because attacking them would then have much worse consequences for them.\\n\\nCould it do more against Turkish aggression . Sure . The EU could also have done more against Serbian aggression against its neighbours , or against Russian aggression against its neighbours . But it\\ 's not doing nothing either.\\n\\n**Immigration issue** : \\nWe have received officers from EU countries , we have received funds from the EU ( e.g . https : //www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/refugee-crisis-europe-eu-countries-greece-receive-700m-extra-aid-funds ) .\\n\\nWhat Greek establishment objects to is that the EU counties didn\\'t open their borders to receive hundreds of thousands of Middle-eastern immigrants . \\n\\nSo again it depends whether you desire to reduce the immigration crisis , or to instead spread the crisis to other countries . Greek government complains because other countries helped us in *reducing* the overall immigration crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; Romania and Poland blocked our borders.\\n\\nYes , we should be thanking them for that . EU countries closing their own borders , since we could not defend our own , was part of the necessary solution to the immigration crisis . No immigrant wants to stay to Greece , therefore if they can\\'t proceed to Europe , they don\\'t have any reason to come here in the first place . \\n\\nThe immigration crisis reached its height in 2015 , because it was then that the new Greek government instead of *hindering* immigration , started promising immigrants that they would be transported to Europe , and indeed was itself helping transporting them from the islands to our northern borders , where we were demanding that other countries would open their own borders to let them in.\\n\\n\ '' They wanted to defend their borders , so we should are fine with Russia threatening them militarily\ '' is an absurd imperialist position . Nothing in the EU treaties demands the acceptance of third-world immigrants by any EU nation . They do demand solidarity in the face of armed aggression though .

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Why is it that normal wear and tear of our cells can be stopped and errors made in replication averted ? I know of some organisms that are able to replace their cells quickly enough to make up for the process , achieving very long ( we still don\\'t know if infinite ) lifespans , but their cells do age normally.\\n\\nUnlike you I\\ 'm not speaking about an \ '' elixir of life\ '' that will forever stop aging ( that\\ 's why your sarcastic words are harmful to *your* understanding ) . I\\ 'm talking about any medical cure of aging , even if it\\ 's similar to us too \\'replacing our cells quickly enough to make up for the process\\ ' . Or if looks instead more like \ '' replacing our organs with artificial ones\ '' that would work too . Or any other method of either defeating or completely circumventing the aging processes.\\n\\nIf you care about specific techniques that current anti-aging researchers are thinking of using , you can again start with what a [ wikipedia article ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging-rejuvenation ) has to say : \\n\\n * Cell loss can be repaired ( reversed ) just by suitable exercise in the case of muscle . For other tissues it needs various growth factors to stimulate cell division , or in some cases it needs stem cells . \\n\\n * Senescent cells can be removed by activating the immune system against them . Or they can be destroyed by gene therapy to introduce \ '' suicide genes\ '' that only kill senescent cells . \\n\\n * Protein cross-linking can largely be reversed by drugs that break the links . But to break some of the cross-links we may need to develop enzymatic methods . \\n\\n * Extracellular garbage ( like amyloid ) can be eliminated by vaccination that gets immune cells to \ '' eat\ '' the garbage . \\n\\n * For intracellular junk we need to introduce new enzymes , possibly enzymes from soil bacteria , that can degrade the junk ( lipofuscin ) that our own natural enzymes can not degrade . \\n\\n * For mitochondrial mutations the plan is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy . The mitochondrial DNA experiences a high degree of mutagenic damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria . A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals , and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs . All mitochondrial proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria . \\n\\n * For cancer ( the most lethal consequence of mutations ) the strategy is to use gene therapy to delete the genes for telomerase and to eliminate telomerase-independent mechanisms of turning normal cells into \ '' immortal\ '' cancer cells . To compensate for the loss of telomerase in stem cells we would introduce new stem cells every decade or so . \\n\\nBut these are just some possible paths . If one of them doesn\\'t work out , we can always try something else.\\n\\n & gt ; If non-aging of mammals , amphibians or birds were possible without a major alteration to the organism , don\\'t you think of how much evolutional advantage would it give ? A non-aging population would need 100 times fewer births to be sustainable . \\n\\nUh , first of all , no . Populations of animals are mainly limited by the availability of food and the existence of predators . For you to say that a non-aging population would need \ '' 100 times fewer births to be sustainable\ '' it seems you\\ 're imagining that 99 out of 100 animals die from aging . Far from so . And since evolution would need the reproduction mechanism *anyway* it\\ 's easier to replace old organism than preserve them , much like it\\ 's cheaper to replace an old TV than repair it.\\n\\nGenes \\'care\\ ' about preserving themselves , not about preserving the \\'organism\\ ' itself . If all I cared about was the preservation of human genes rather than the preservation of human minds and the elimination of suffering , I wouldn\\'t be interested in agelessness either.\\n\\nSecondly , you know what else would give a huge evolutionary advantage to animal species ? If they could communicate instantly across many thousands of kilometers . But wow , look at us , here we are communicating instantly across thousands of kilometers , and we didn\\'t need to have major alterations to our organisms either.\\n\\nYou know what else could give huge advantage to land animals ? If they could fly across oceans . But wow hey , look at humanity , flying across oceans.\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t evolution provide us with internet and airplanes ? Well frankly they were beyond the ability of any single gene-cluster to create . In the same ways beyond the ability of any single one of us are surgery , gene-therapies , 3D-printed organs , stem-cell research , and any other methods ( e.g . nanobots ? ) we might use to defeat aging . \\n\\n & gt ; Lastly , I don\\'t know why do you bring religion into the discussion . \\n\\nYou treat aging as an immutable law of nature rather than a mere genetic condition of our organisms , treatable like any other genetic condition . And it\\ 's only religion that does that -- treating aging as if it\\ 's a law set down by God or a divine punishment or something . Whether actually religious , or a leftover from the religious elements in your society , that\\ 's where the idea originates of treating aging as something that will \\'never\\ ' be cured , rather than a mere medical problem that we can fight against and eventually defeat like any other .",Greek,Greek

Instead they always praise him ( Kammenos openly treats the \ '' Karamanlis faction\ '' as worthy of the utmost respect , unlike those supposed \ '' neoliberals\ '' like Mitsotakis ) . It\\ 's a bit bizarre really -- *I* know how to explain it ( via their mutual geopolitical ties to Russia ) , but I\\ 've not seen a convincing different explanation offered by those people who disagree.\\n\\n & gt ; But I would take for starters not evidence but even suggestions . For example Greece acting pro Russia for no reason . That does not include making business deals with Russian . Remember France wanted to sell warships to Russia , they wanted the money they were not troyan horses . It doesn\\'t include simply holding the same position as Russia . Russia does not recognize Kossovo , the same goes for Greece and Cyprus . This is does not suggest Greece is a trojan horse because there is the simple explanation that Greece recognizing Kossovo would compromise it\\ 's position against recognition of occupied north Cyprus.\\n\\nSure , I understand all that , and I\\ 've never used Greece\\ 's position on Kosovo as evidence for Greece\\ 's relationship with Russia . \\n\\nI could start by mentioning some of the purely-symbolic-but-otherwise stuff , like ( 1 ) Kostas Karamanlis making an announcement on the day of Anna Politkosvskaya\\ 's murder that he phoned Vladimir Putin to ... wish him a very happy birthday ( 2 ) Segments of the Russian army partaking in Greek national parades in Alexandroupoli under the Samaras government , though AFAIK not even NATO allies ever partake in those . ( 3 ) The Greek state TV under the Tsipras government spending hours broadcasting the Russian military WW2 celebration , when I don\\'t think the state TV has ever done the same for any foreign military celebration .

According to one of the leaked emails , this organisation signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with the influential Russian Institute for Strategic Studies ( RISI ) at the end of last year.\\n\\nThe RISI was linked to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service , the SVR , until it was brought under the office of the Russian presidency in 2009 . Leonid Reshetnikov , its director , is a retired SVR lieutenant-general . Kammenos\u2019s deputy at the defence ministry , Kostas Isichos , is another ardent fan of Putin . Last year he described EU sanctions on Russia as \u201cneo-colonial bulimia\u201d and saluted the \u201cimpressive counterattacks\u201d of Russian-backed militias in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nEchoing Russian propaganda , he accused the Kiev government of tolerating \u201cneo-Nazi abominations\u201d .

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Feels like you can\\'t really blame Syriza for Greece\\ 's plight at this point.\\n\\nWe can blame it for the part of Greece\\ 's plight that started or worsened only after they became government ( e.g . capital controls ) .\\n\\nWe can also blame it for its role in covering up the crimes of the predecessor government ( Syriza\\ 's \ '' investigating committee\ '' deliberately excluded all the years of Kostas Karamanlis from its investigation , though his term in office was the one primarily responsible for the crisis that struck Greece . And similarly Karamanlis did nothing when leftist thugs were burning down Athens in 2008 ) .\\n\\nTsipras of SYRIZA and Kostas Karamanlis of ND love each other deeply , as these two chief destroyers of Greece both mutually admire how much destruction each has brought upon the country while remaining personally untouched by anyone .

The liberal wing of ND hasn\\'t been in power since 1994 , instead ND had the populist Kostas Karamanlis , which sidelined the liberals and then helped installed fellow populist destroyer Samaras as his successor ( nationalist \\'hero\\ ' who as a minister caused the overthrow of the ND government in 1994 because they were more compromising with FYR Macedonia in regards to the name that he wanted ) .\\n\\nThe modern SYRIZA on the other hand is effectively the successor of 1980\\ 's PASOK of Andreas Papandreou , which like SYRIZA got power by insulting Europe , and then proceeded to remain in Europe because that\\ 's a useful position to be in if you want to take Europe\\ 's money and waste it . The most sickly bits of PASOK ( the parasitic nepotistic bureaucrats , masking their deep corruption behind a thin smokescreen of supposed social justice ) have migrated to SYRIZA .

Do you seriously doubt that such a referendum would have passed easily in Sudetenland if Hitler had bothered with one ? \\n\\nYour arguments that referendums are a fine method to divide up countries and annex parts of them to neighbouring countries makes a mockery of national borders , and turns every single minority in neighbouring countries into a tool for conquest . Your recipe would mean an endless new sequence of wars where every minority that becomes a local majority would either trigger a border change , or cause an ethnic cleansing to avoid such . ( In short : Turkey conquers a bit of Greece , Greece conquers a bit of Albania , Albania conquers a bit of Serbia , Serbia conquers a bit of Bosnia and Croatia , Hungary conquers a bit of Romania , etc , etc ) . Nice consequences eh ? \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' But it\\ 's interesting to see that you are not a democrat and reject the right of people for democratic self-determination\ '' \\n\\nRUSSIA rejects the right of people for democratic self-determination , you vile hypocrite .

In short I support Scotland\\ 's right to independence and Quebec\\ 's right to independence , and Basque Country\\ 's and Catalonia\\ 's and Chechnya\\ 's right to independence , but I do not support Kosovo\\ 's right to independence ( facade of Albanian imperialism ) , nor the Bosnia & amp ; Krajna Serb\\ 's right to independence ( facade of Serb imperialism ) nor the Abkhazians , South Ossetians , Transnistrians , Crimeans or Donbass right to independence ( facade of Russian imperialism ) .\\n\\nAnd Crimea\\ 's annexation was exactly that : a facade for a neighboring imperialism , and you are using the \ '' right of people for democratic self-determination\ '' EXACTLY AS HITLER USED IT , as a FACADE for your imperialism , as evidenced by the fact that no Crimean is no longer allowed to even SPEAK of separatism from Mother Russia or they face fines and jail sentences . Voting to join Russia is an irrevocable choice it seems , and you care about democratic self-determination only when you want to tear apart your neighbors , not to apply to yourselves.\\n\\nChristians say that even Satan can quote from the bible . I say that even Hitleric fascists can speak of \ '' democratic self-determination\ '' whenever it suits their purpose to tear apart and slaughter their neighbours in pursuit of their vainglorious nationalistic ambitions .

It had been threatening Ukraine with dismemberment and invasion since at least 2013 ( when it still had the \\'pro-Russian\\ ' government of Yanukovich ) because of the EU association agreement , and because of how this conflicted with Putin\\ 's dreams of a Eurasian Economic Union with Ukraine as a member .

I believe in a universal right to self determination . \\n\\nSo you support Hitler\\ 's annexation of Sudetenland , but like a coward you don\\'t want to actually state it out right.\\n \\nPerhaps you\\ 'll one day figure out why those of who have learned from the bad experience of Hitler know not to accept the words \ '' self-determination\ '' when imperialist conquerors use them to justify their ambitions.\\n\\nReally , the biggest problem Vladimir Putin and his various allies face , is that every educated person in the world who has studied WW2 in the slightest knows to recognize his Hitleric actions and excuses as Hitleric actions and excuses . \\n\\n & gt ; You support the self determination of Croats but refuse the self determination of Serbs in Croatia.\\n\\nYes , the Croats have the right to an independent nation . The Serbs already have an independent nation , it\\ 's called \ '' Serbia\u201d . The borders between Serbia and Croatia had been well established and mutually recognized through all the time of Yugoslavia . If the nation of Serbia wanted some territory from the nation of Croatia , then it should *buy* it from Croatia after peaceful negotiations.\\n\\nPerhaps one day you\\ 'll understand that it\\ 's they who respect people\\ 's right to have a secure home is they who also oppose thieves attempts to violate those homes . On the other hand thieves want their own homes secure but fail to respect other people\\ 's homes.\\n\\nYou talk about \ '' self-determination\ '' but you\\ 're arguing that any group of people can move to a part of some other country , and steal a part of it to annex it to a neighbouring one . So for example , 10,000 ISIL members can just travel somewhere in France , and they should be given the right to have their neighbourhood made independent , right ? \\n\\nBtw , I also support the right to Poland\\ 's independence from Germany , but refuse the right to \ '' independence\ '' of Germans in Czechoslovakia . History has shown that the countries most eager to invade their nations in order to protect the \\'self-determination\\ ' of minorities , are paradoxically the countries most eager to brutally crush the self-determination of other nations.\\n\\nActually ofcourse it\\ 's not paradoxical at all . It\\ 's the old phrase about how \ '' good fences make good neighbours\ '' . Mutually-respected borders make for peaceful relations.\\n\\n & gt ; You support the self determination of Bosnians but refuse the self determination of Serbs in Bosnia.\\n\\nYes , same reasoning as above . The Yugoslav constitution itself recognized the right to independence for *all* the constituent republics.\\n\\nAs for \ '' Serbs in Bosnia\ '' , they expelled hundreds of thousands of other ethnicities from their homes in order to have their ethnically pure territories to ( attempt to ) annex to Serbia . That\\ 's the direct consequence of people treating the \ '' right to self-determination\ '' as a justificable reason to tear countries apart -- ETHNIC CLEANSING AND GENOCIDE , because every country that isn\\'t \\'ethnically pured\\ ' will be divived up and destroyed.\\n\\nDon\\'t you *care* about those consequences , or is it those consequences what you\\ 're truly after ? What is your metaethical system if it\\ 's not consequentialistic ? What reasoning led you the the deontology of \\'universal self-determination\\ ' regardless of how nasty the consequences of such are ? \\n\\n & gt ; You use the same tired western propaganda points even tho Serbia was found not guilty in the cases of both Croatia and Bosnia in front of the International court of justice.\ '' \\n\\nI showed you how Serbia was directly responsible and participating in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.\\n\\n & gt ; You act like you don\\'t support the Kosovo secession ( while in reality you keep on justifying it\\n\\nI\\ 've been very clear on my stance in Kosovo , and how I opposed it and for what reasons , which have been completely consistent : I support the right to independence for every nation , region , city or village , AS LONG AS IT\\ 'S NOT A SMOKESCREEN FOR A NEIGHBOURING IMPERIALISM.\\n\\nI opposed Kosovo\\ 's independence because it\\ 's a smokescreen for Albanian imperialism . I\\ 'm very fucking clear on that , but I expect slander from a supporter of Hitler\\ 's annexation of Sudetenland , and Putin\\ 's annexation of Crimea.\\n\\nI think you\\ 're obsessed with pretending I supported Kosovo , because you are desperate to refuse the concept that I actually follow principles with reasoning behind them , and you instead need to portray me as some \\'puppet of western propaganda\\ ' .",Greek,Greek

ArisKatsaris,europe,"I didn\\'t support Kosovar independence , and I think it was an example of Albanian imperialism that it shouldn\\'t have been supported.\\n\\nBut the reason that it *was* supported by the West , was because Serbia had made itself utterly hated throughout the world for its brutal imperialism and attempts to tear apart Croatia & amp ; Bosnia.\\n\\nUnlike Serbia , neither Georgia , nor Moldova , nor Ukraine , had ever threatened the territorial integrity of any of their neighbours .

You claim to want \ '' independence\ '' , and then you join a different country where independence is forbidden .

But not quite that either really , because Yugoslavia recognized the different ethnicities and Greece melded them into one.\\n\\nIf Arvanites had sought to split off Greece and said they want to form \ '' Arvania\ '' ( or something similar ; - ) you wouldn\\'t be able to call that one a country designed to be multiethnic either .",Greek,Greek

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Nothing to do with religion . Like the witch hunts in the 16th,17th , 18th centuries . \\n\\nIn pre-Christian Rome , in 331 BC , 170 women were executed as witches.\\nIn 184 BC , about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft\\nIn 182\u2013180 BC another 3,000 executions took place.\\n\\nChristianisation actually drastically reduced the killings of witches , with the first church teaching actually calling for the punishment of anyone who *accused* people for witchcraft . From wikipedia : \\n\\nThe Councils of Elvira ( 306 ) , Ancyra ( 314 ) , and Trullo ( 692 ) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship . This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries . The general desire of the Catholic Church\\ 's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn , which , in 785 , explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch . The Lombard code of 643 states : \\nLet nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch , for it is not possible , nor ought to be believed by Christian minds . [ 22 ] \\nThis conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900 AD ( alleged to date from 314 AD ) , which , following the thoughts of Augustine of Hippo , stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was , itself , false and heterodox teaching . The Council of Frankfurt in 794 , called by Charlemagne , was also very explicit in condemning \ '' the persecution of alleged witches and wizards\ '' , calling the belief in witchcraft \ '' superstitious\ '' , and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches . [ 23 ] Other examples include an Irish synod in 800 , [ 24 ] and a sermon by Agobard of Lyons ( 810 ) . [ 25 ] \\n\\n ... \\n\\nPope Gregory VII , in 1080 , wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence . \\n\\n & gt ; Nine million of them just went puff.\\n\\nI suggest you recheck your numbers .

Bond_Ionic_Bond,europe,"To be fair to him though , the previous two governments ( that shared the \ '' wheel\ '' of the country since 1974 ) were the yes men of the EU .

Tsipras was the alterEnglish to all these technocrat , puppet governments.\\n\\nI think everyone would agree that the EU has problems , but Tsipras and Farage instead of wanting to improve the EU they chose to say a big *fuck you* to it . I can draw a lot of parallels between these two referendums . The \ '' leave\ '' and \ '' no\ '' voters were middle and mostly working class , communists , fascists , nationalists , eurosceptics , and people who just wanted to protest with their vote . The \ '' stay\ '' and \ '' yes\ '' voters were upper class , business men , economists , people whose interest was to stay in the EU . \\n\\nBoth Tsipras and Farage put forth the ( false ? ) dichotomy that we\\ 're either going to go our way , build a strong nation , be the bosses of our selves , yada yada yada ( actually Tsipras didn\\'t say exactly that - he said that we would be respected more within the EU - our minister of defense said it ) , **or** we would be under the control of bureaucrats and technocrats in Brussels . Even I was deeply perplexed and ended up voting a not valid vote , because on the one hand I didn\\'t want a \ '' yes sir\ '' government but on the other hand I didn\\'t want us to leave EU , not only because it was in my interest to stay , but because we kinda need it ; you wont believe how many infrastructures are co-funded by the EU , or in how many respects Greece has been improved because we had to comply by it\\ 's standards , not to mention the opportunities the youth and especially the students have within the EU .",Greek,Greek

Bond_Ionic_Bond,europe,"& gt ; Sure , saying that you aren\\'t required to murder strippers in a video game , despite them being there for that sole purpose , is a HUGE inaccuracy . Feminism debunked . Move along , society.\\n\\nWell you either didn\\'t see the video , or didn\\'t care enough to pay attention to it . The game is called \ '' Hitman.\ '' You can literally kill anyone , anywhere . You actually get penalized for killing these strippers - and any other innocent person as a matter of fact . The strippers don\\'t have a purpose , they\\ 're there because you\\ 're in a strip club . If Hitman enters a restaurant , the customers\\ ' sole purpose wouldn\\'t be to get murdered . On the contrary , if these strippers have a purpose is to make you hate your contract ( target ) more by listening how much he mistreats them . \\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , a lot of other videos that either criticize her and not her ideas\\n\\nThere are videos criticizing her ideas and/or debunk her arguments , and , granted , they may call her a few names in the process ; you just chose to concentrate on the name calling and not on the substance . \\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's a tight statistic . 44 % of video game players are female . \\n\\nIf you include iOS , Android and Facebook games , yes . But that\\ 's not our focus here . Our focus is platform and computer games . The paper says that 41 % of game purchases are made by women , but doesn\\'t specify if it\\ 's purchases in general or platform/PC purchases specifically . Probably the former . Furthermore , the most frequent female gamer is 43 years of age . I don\\'t think 43 year old women like to play fallout and doom . And in the games I play - flight simulators - , although they can hardly be called games , there are almost zero women players.\\n\\n & gt ; There\\ 's nothing wrong with that . What\\ 's wrong is having that in a character that doesn\\'t have anything else to her , that\\ 's just there for the male to ogle . It\\ 's objectification . If you think that\\ 's okay , well honey , there\\ 's no point arguing with you.\\n\\nAlthough I agree with you here , this can\\'t be applied universally . For example , the strippers in Hitman don\\'t contribute much to the game ( unless maybe for the reason I mentioned above ) , but they\\ 're not just there to satisfy the male gaze either . \\n\\n & gt ; If she is like that in the game -I don\\'t know , I haven\\'t played it- , then yes , it\\ 's sexist.\\n\\nI haven\\'t played it either , so there\\ 's no reason to discuss it further.\\n\\n & gt ; So you shouldn\\'t take the average gamers\\ ' maturity into account when criticising sexism in video games , but you should when calling the cops when that same gamer sends you death threats ? \\n\\nWell , it depends . On the first occasion you\\ 're talking about a whole society , on the second occasion you\\ 're talking about only a part of it . Most , if not all , threats come from immature \ '' basement dwellers\ '' , but not all gamers are immature basement dwellers . Yes , I agree , that if you\\ 're immature enough to make rape/death threats over opinions on the internet , you don\\'t have enough mental ability to differentiate game reality from actual reality . \\n\\nI like to draw a parallel with movies and movie goers here . How many great films have sexism , racism , violence , or all three ? Would you call all movie goers sexists , racists and violent ? \\n\\n & gt ; You just said society is sexist.\\n\\nWhen did I say that ? Are you referring to *\ '' What\\ 's wrong with having female characters in kinky outfits ? \ '' * Being attracted to sexy individuals of the opposite sex ( or the same ) is something natural , not taboo , nor is it discriminatory to individuals that don\\'t reach these standards . Male characters don\\'t have the average gamer\\ 's shape either ; they all have warrior bodies ! I should mention though , that I too am against displaying models of both sexes with \ '' perfect\ '' bodies everywhere , not because I feel bad that I can\\'t reach these standards - I don\\'t - , but because this objectification - as you\\ 'd say - takes away the feeling of appreciation when you see your SOs body . In simple words , you just grow uninterested to sexuality . \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong though , I\\ 'm not denying that there is *no* sexism in society , just not as much as 40 years ago . \\n\\n & gt ; If you raise a child in a racist background that doesn\\'t make him question racism , he will probably grow up to be racist . Playing a game where killing a black person has no consequences won\\'t help him question that happening , and leave him as he was . Playing a game where that behaviour is discouraged will hopefully lead him towards a different path.\\n\\nIf a child is raised on a racist background , the games he\\ 's playing is just a drop in the ocean . The real problem is the background into which he or she is raised . Personally , instead of trying to criticize content , I\\ 'd work towards building suitable backgrounds to raise children into . \\n\\nEDIT : some spelling",Greek,Greek

Carrotman,europe,"My tips are for around the Chania area , where I come from.\\n\\nThere are several wonderful gorges . Samaria being the most famous one and the longest one in Europe . A bus from Chania drives to Omal\u00f3s ( the starting point ) several times during the early morning hours and at the end of the gorge ( about 5-7 hours later depending on your pace ) you can get the boat to either Sfaki\u00e1 or to So\u00fagia and from there take the bus back to Chania . Better take an early bus so that you won\\'t have to hurry at the end . The last boat to Sfaki\u00e1 is around 5:30pm and to So\u00fagia around 5:00pm . I usually carry a sleeping bag with me and spend the night at the beach in So\u00fagia taking the morning bus to Chania ( aroung 7am ) .\\n\\nAnother nice gorge is Ar\u00e1dena . Reachable by bus from Chania . Around a 3 hour hike through the gorge to the beach ( M\u00e1rmara ) and then another 3,5 hour hike eastwards along the shore to Sfaki\u00e1 . When I did this one I did a late afternoon hike through the gorge , ate in the evening at the taverna on a cliff at the beach , spent the night under the stars and had pleanty of time for the eastward hike along the shore to enjoy the two little villages ( reachable only by boat ) and the sweet-water beach where an underground river flows into the sea.\\n\\nNice sandy beaches are Fal\u00e1sarna and Elafon\u00edsi . The boat trip to Grambousa ( from Kissamos , reachable by bus from Chania ) and the subsequent stop for a swim at B\u00e1los is also a nice day trip.\\n\\nI absolutely suggest a visit to a small tavern hidden in the mountains called [ \ '' \u039c\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\ '' ] ( http : //www.milia.gr/EN/ ) , but you need a car to reach it ( and plenty of courage for the last 2kms , if you\\ 're not used to the roads there ) . It can be easily combined with a visit to the aforementioned Elafonisi which is only about 45 mins away.\\n\\nSome nice wilder beaches are [ Ravdo\u00facha ] ( https : //maps.google.com/maps ? q=35.534841,23.725002 & amp ; num=1 & amp ; t=h & amp ; z=18 ) and [ Kedr\u00f3dasos ] ( https : //maps.google.com/maps ? q=35.269624,23.558334 & amp ; num=1 & amp ; t=h & amp ; z=17 ) , though the last one might be prove hard to find the way to .",Greek,Greek
