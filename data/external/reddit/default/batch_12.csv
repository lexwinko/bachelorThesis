CharMack90,europe,"& gt ; Ultimately your post points out that some bad feelings still do exist in Europeans and I\\ 've seen it myself but we are in a really difficult \ '' chicken and the egg\ '' ( which came first ? The chicken or the egg ? ) situation here . Do people have negative feelings towards migrant communities because of issues currently posed by them ( crime etc . ) or was that feeling there already and partially contributes to marginalisation ? \\n\\nI believe it\\ 's mostly because of people already having the tendency to being prejudicial towards immigrants.\\n\\nFor example , when the population exchange of 1923 happened between Greece and Turkey , hundred of thousands of Greeks were expelled from their ancestral homes in Anatolia and were brought to Greece proper.\\n\\nMost of them were settled to newly-abandoned villages and uninhabited areas near towns and cities . These places were usually marshlands and bogs unfit for settlement and the English Greeks were often prejudicial and even hostile towards the immigrants.\\n\\nThese people were forced to leave their homes and come to a ( to them ) foreign land , and even though they had the same ancestry , culture , religion , and language ( albeit , different dialect ) with the locals , they were still treated negatively and faced challenges in integration.\\n\\nThe immigrants , though , were good for each locale . They were among the most educated and well-versed workers and businessmen . They built villages and towns , made major contributions to Greece\\ 's economy , and still had to wait for generations before the local community accepted them.\\n\\nNow imagine how difficult it would be for people of different heritage to be accepted . Sure , 2016 is much better than 1923 in terms of social integration , but it\\ 's nowhere near perfect . I can\\'t be certain , but I reckon it starts from the Englishs first , before affecting the immigrants and making a vicious circle out of the situation .",Greek,Greek

And if you ask them why they would say it doesnt matter its just 1euro they should go catch the big fish first . They dont realise that even that is a problem .

D3va92,europe,"As i said to other post . Most people dont want to go back in drachma but they dont want to keep following the road that leads to nowhere . Also we do not believe that with no we would leave europe.\\n\\nP.S . All channels push for a YES with fear tactics and all politicians that led us here come out to say that they would vote for yes . Politicians , TV stars , singers , everyone that has a name and plans to vote yes has come out to say it . But when someone tries to tell that they will vote no they cut him off . They asked an old man at an ATM what he will vote he said no and they immediately pushed him away . Those tactics are working against them and force even more people to vote NO .",Greek,Greek
D3va92,europe,"Old people know how bad it can gets . Younger ones dont know that , they think that trying to find a work is the worst it can happen .

Anyway most people are unaware or misinformed about whats going to happen or what the referendum is about . And the propaganda makes it even worse .",Greek,Greek
D3va92,europe,Most comments i see hate the Eurozone but i doubt they actually see the common people as enemies .

D3va92,europe,"I dont know . All i have to say is that if the majority votes no and tsipras goes for a deal , i find it realy stupid to not make a deal . Its like a political suicide . People would kill them because most want to remain in euro . Also i dont think europe will ever say that there is no deal to be made .

Plus alot other shit that he didnt do in the end . Personaly i dont trust them one bit , and i didnt vote them at the last election . They were a mess and you can see it even better now . Varoufakis tweets that capital control is against what they believe , then we learn that he said different things on BBC and after some hours they anounce capital control . I dont know what they are planning but it seems like they are trying to lie to Europe and Greece at the same time and they are failing .",Greek,Greek
D3va92,europe,Propably . Well searching doesnt do much help either . I wish could vote for the offer and the Euro at the same time . Then i would have voted Yes in euro but No in the plan that leads nowhere,Greek,Greek
D3va92,europe,"In case of a grexit and return to drachma things are gon na get worse . There is a small percentage that wants that . And those guys are gon na be happy . But the rest are gon na have a problem . A lot of companies say that in case of grexit we will close the company and move out of the country , that means that a lot of people in private section will lose their jobs and any savings if they have them in greece and a lot of people got savings in greek banks . And i dont mean savings above 50000 euros , but still an amount that will make you last for some years without a job . So most of those people will vote yes . In case of a no and grexit it will leave them with nothing . Then i am pretty sure that this gon na lead to riots and hate towards the goverment and propably against its other . In such times its not hard for some groups to act and make things worse . Anyway things can get pretty bad if we split and i believe something like that is possible . You can see it from now the people that vote No call everyone that votes YES stupid along with other things . And when channels suddenly say that not matter the outcome we have to stay together i see a possible problem.\\n\\nP.S . Also in a yes vote this scenario is possible . The guys that voted no start riots etc and one thing leads to another . It might seems far fetched but in desperate times you never know how people might react .",Greek,Greek

Had it been a situation only between two armies with no civilians in the way and the one army chose to retreat because they were outnumbered it would have been perfectly excused but in this case there were hundreds of civilians in the way that they had to protect so even though i undertstand their bad situation , i can\\'t help but criticize it , being fully aware that i\\ 'm doing that from the safety of my desk .

In both cases , the outcome for Turkey were/are the same.\\n\\n\ '' Enosis\ '' specifically means the Union of Cyprus and Greece . So i repeat again.. where do you see any such plan \ '' covered\ '' or not in the current talks ? If you mean something else entirely like simply the fact that Cyprus will be in the EU just like Greece , then you should pick your words more carefully cause that\\ 's not Enosis . Germany is in the EU with Greece two and there\\ 's no Enosis there.\\n\\n The outcome for Turkey SHOULD be the same anyway , it should be like it was before the Turkish invasion , where Cyprus was independent . If you\\ 're refusing to let that go , it makes Turkey\\ 's plans for the island even more evident and it explains why you invaded.\\n\\n & gt ; Because Cyprus was never independent , and will never be.\\n\\nYes it was . Although for a brief time . It gained its independence in 1960 . Even before that though it wasn\\'t controlled by neither Turkey nor Greece so it did have its independence at least from these two countries . \\n\\nIf it won\\'t be independent as a whoe , that\\ 's because Turkey illegally invaded it and it\\ 's not refusing to let it be independent which honestly says a lot about your country . At least the southern part is independent and not isolated . \\n\\n & gt ; You are a naive kid with zero understanding of realpolitik . You live in the world of unicorns and rainbows . Cyprus is not an independent state ( and never was in history ) and will never be.\\n\\nAs above , learn history . It was an independent state .

No one says that two european civilizations have to be identical , otherwise one is european and the other isn\\'t.\\n\\nConsidering that the Greeks laid the foundations that would shape the Roman Empire and later with its expansion to Europe , the entire western world , arguing that the Greeks are \ '' eastern\ '' is retarded . They\\ 're the basis of the western world . The fact that they have similarities with eastern people because they dealt with them due to their location doesn\\'t change that.\\n\\nEven when talking about western/eastern/northern/southern europe , Greece is commonly referred to as southern europe and even Western Europe ( even though it\\ 's not even close geographically ) , exactly because it\\ 's so strongly connected to the west . \\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe # Western_European_and_Others_Group\\n\\nGreece is a western culture with shared elements with the east",Greek,Greek

First of all , Greece wasn\\'t the one that said \ '' pay us or we crash the EU.\ '' Greece was the one threatened with an exit . There\\ 's a difference . Still , Greece has voted everything that was asked of it so far has it not ? My question is , what\\ 's the point ? Everyone can see that the debt is not sustainable but Germany ( more precicely Schauble ) keeps insisting on more reformation which result in more debts wich combined in turn result to Greece being in a worse shape , people having even lower wages and more inability to pay so the market is frozen , more businesses close and on top of that , the debt is even bigger cause we take loans for older debts .

Well obviously , we don\\'t have something personal with Hitler other than that fact that he did what he did.. Turkey has been muslim since the beginning but only now that it\\ 's going more radical people are vocal about it . Do you think that\\ 's somehow wrong ? Turkey has been muslim 15 years ago and it was best buddies with the West so no , it\\ 's not about Islam , cause Turkey has always been there . It\\ 's about allowing someone to tether Turkey to Islam and allow religion to affect its society.\\n\\n & gt ; See this is exactly what I am talking about . The perpetrators of those get arrested and locked up you guys act like these are actually encouraged by the state they are not . You guys trying to push that stuff like this is ordered by islam and supported by muslims while perpetrators are generally violent idiots.\\n\\nAs far as i know the guy that attacked the girl in the bus was released . If that changed , good . I\\ 'm not trying to say if it\\ 's Islam that orders it or not but since you mentioned it , the attacks happened because of religious reasons right ? These typically don\\'t happen in secular countries . Obviously it\\ 's not the rule in Turkey but the whole picture is getting increasingly worse for you guys . Try to understand that it\\ 's not a matter of Islam . In Greece if you follow what religion dictates , people are not supposed to eat meat during Easter too but we don\\'t have cases like this one . Regardless of the religion , if that happened people would be mad because it\\ 's not a secular thing but a sign of backwardness . So no , it\\ 's not about Islam . It\\ 's about Turkey getting closer to being a society with bullshit laws dictated by religion and moving away from what it used to be.\\n\\n & gt ; Another example that proves my argument . Do you see the pattern here ? Death penalty maybe coming back to Turkey has absolutely nothing to do with islam yet you act like it does . Why ? I know why but please answer.\\n\\nIt\\ 's very simple . Because unlike what you\\ 're claiming , i\\ 'm not using Turkey to bash Islam . As you just pointed out , this has nothing to do with Islam . Other things do have to do with religion generally , but this one doesn\\'t.\\n\\n & gt ; Islam is barely relevant here if majority of Turks were non-religious Erdogan\\ 's methods would simply change he uses religion because we are religious people.\\n\\nThat\\ 's correct . He\\ 's using religion to get what he wants but i\\ 'd except from a country like Turkey to be able to resist that given that even though you\\ 're religious people ( like us pretty much ) , there was a strong secular core . Unfortunately Erdogan is taking Turkey away from that from what i see . His motives might not be religious but the outcome affects exactly that . Again , this is not a beef against Islam . It\\ 's a beef against a country slowly turning theocratic regardless of the religion it adheres to.\\n\\n & gt ; No it is you who want that . So that you can say \ '' I told you so\ '' . If you actually cared you would get informed.\\n\\nThat\\ 's a pretty childish mentality , it\\ 's all i can say .

We\\ 're talking about a 2500 years gap . Nowadays Greece has preserved the things that tie it to the ancient one . The alphabet , the language , the history , and the continuation of its people living there all this time . Obviously things like customs , buildings , technology etc change with time . Were you also expecting to see legionaries in modern Italy ? People painting their faces blue in Britain ? Priests sacrificing slaves to Tlaloc in Mexico ? \\n\\n & gt ; Yes , I think modern Greece has profited a lot from carrying the same name like the ancient civilization.\\n\\nYes of course . We should have erased our history and brought oure temples down so that some random guy online can\\'t accuse us of profiting from our past ^/s . Are you serious ? Every country benefits from their past . Italy , Greece , Egypt , China , you name it . \\n\\n & gt ; I think it also helped Greece during the recent debt crises , because I doubt the global public would have cared so much about a bankrupt of Bulgaria for example.\\n\\nAre you seriously saying that bankers , organizations like the troika and corporations like Moodys give loans with better conditions or more favorable evaluations because of a country\\ 's ancient history ? \\n\\n & gt ; What I dont understand is why caarying the name of ancient Greece ( with all these advantages ) is not enough for you , but you also claim the sole representation for the name \ '' Macedonia\ '' . In my view it wouldnt harm you to be a bit more generous in this regard ! \\n\\nYou\\ 're mentioning carrying our own history as if it\\ 's a handout and we should be grateful just to have that , which is silly . We don\\'t claim the sole representantion of the name \ '' Macedonia\ '' , FYROM does that by having its people called \ '' Mecedonians\ '' which is a name tied to an ancient kingdom with which they have absolutely no connection . We happen to be the first country to have coined and used that name so if anything , it\\ 's Greece that it\\ 's tied to , at least historically and culturally . The thing is that the name was also given to the wider area in general which complicates things . We can agree to other people using the name in the geographic sense but in order for that to happen the name must change . Why should we tolerate countries that have no connection with the ancient Macedonia to try to claim that history simply because they migrated to that area ? \\n\\nI don\\'t know where you\\ 're from ( and i\\ 'd be interested to know ) but you can be generous with your own country\\ 's history and give it away to your neighbors if you want . We choose not to do the same . Will Egypt also be generous and give us its history with the Pharohs and the pyramids ? No . why should it ? Do we claim Egypt\\ 's history ? No .

Now imagine those governments facing a decision that would bring them in war with Turkey ( NATO\\ 's 2nd largest army ) for the sake of Greece . I bet a lot wouldn\\'t do it . \\n\\nIn my experience , interests play a huge role and most countries would be hesitant to compromise their interests , let alone go in war . There would most likely be a period of warnings , talks , negotiations while Turkey is performing a full scale invasion . By the time the talks are done a possibly large part of Greece might have been lost and then we\\ 'd start talks and negotiations about how much of our country we\\ 'll be allowed to get back .

If the allies wanted you exterminated , you\\ 'd be exterminated . If anything the Great Powers spared the Ottoman Empire turning it into Turkey . You posted a link about prosecutions of muslims and i posted a link about prosecutions of christians . Your only counter argument was \ '' yes but this was before that\ '' which isn\\'t even accurate cause the link i posted talks about 1800+ as well . It\\ 's simple .

Yes no one else is mentioning of the extermination of 5 millions Turks other than you . I guess you have to counter-balance the genocide accusations somehow.\\n\\nAbout that there are no demographics of the Greeks being a majority in the areas given to them , you\\ 're wrong.\\n\\n\ '' According to the U.S . Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time , Henry Morgenthau , more than half of Smyrna\\ 's population was Greek . [ 27 ] The American Consul General in Smyrna at the time , George Horton , wrote that before the fire there were 400,000 people living in the city of Smyrna , of whom 165,000 were Turks , 150,000 were Greeks , 25,000 were Jews , 25,000 were Armenians , and 20,000 were foreigners\ '' \\n\\nMost demographics show that they were close to 50-50 and some reports mention the Turks as a majority and some mention the Greeks as a majority , both with a slight advantage . \\nAlso the Greeks didn\\'t invade Smyrna . The area was given to Greece and the army landed peacefully , not counting some fights with irregulars.\\n\\n & gt ; Yes obviously there couldn\\'t be a compromise after how the Greek army behaved itself and the treaty of sevres . I\\ 'm talking about a compromise prior to that.\\nAtat\u00fcrk was not bloodthirsty warmonger and without the Allies going crazy after ww1 his resistance wouldn\\'t even have been necessary.\\n\\nWell it\\ 's not up to Ataturk to decide what\\ 's fair and what\\ 's not . He\\ 's on the losing side . Ataturk could also not have compromised with even the slightest land loss or penalty against the Ottoman Empire so how is that \ '' Ataturk didn\\'t like the treaty so he didn\\'t compromise\ '' an argument ? If the Great Powers wanted to enforce the treaty they could have , but the change in the Greek government changed things so they went with Kemal instead and made a different deal/treaty . \\n\\nJust to clarify , I\\ 'm not defending that war here . By modern standards the treaty of Sevres was bullshit . I\\ 'm just saying that it\\ 's the same that the Ottoman Empire had done to the past . Total conquest and loss of independence of the opposing side . \\nThat war shouldn\\'t have happened in the first place . Greece was used as fodder to enforce a treaty that the Great Powers didn\\'t really care about enforcing , they got us into another war with Turkey and the whole \ '' Megali Idea\ '' thing on Greece behalf was greedy but inspired by a desire to liberate parts where rather big number of Greeks still lived .",Greek,Greek
Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"There were definitely not 5 million turks living in either Greece , Serbia or Bulgaria . Unless you can show me some demographics or death tolls but i guess you can\\'t . That was my point . Most of the muslims were displaced back to the Ottoman Empire . In greece most of them went back during the population exchange . If they had been slaughtered , there would have been no muslim population to be exchanged in the first place . Ponder on that.\\nAlso these happened - again - both ways . Since you like reading wiki articles about prosecutions , take a look in this one as well\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians # Persecution_of_Orthodox_Christians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire\\n\\nKeep in mind that the Ottomans/Turks are charged with 3 genocides . \\n\\n & gt ; The Ottoman Empire didn\\'t get its start until the 14th century . At that point the Byzantine\\u200bEmpire was already in full decline and only controlled Constantinople , a few surrounding areas in Anatolia and European possessions . Everything south and east of the tiny Ottoman domain was ruled by other Turkish dynasties . The countryside was completely Turkish made up of farmers and nomadic tribes.\\nHere\\ 's a map from 1326 : \\n\\nAre you stupid or something ? You\\ 're showing me maps that show Turks in the TURKISH anatolia , which means that they had already conquered these grounds . You specifically said \ '' the Greeks weren\\'t a majority in these for more than a thousand years which brought us to around 900 AD and you show me a nap of 1326 AD when the Ottomans had already conquered most part of it.\\nHere\\ 's a map from 867 which is way closer.\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire # /media/File : ByzantineEmpire867AD4lightpurple.PNG\\n\\nAs you can see Anatolia was clearly Byzantine . turks started becoming the majority there AFTER they conquered it . Just like with Constantinople . \\n\\n & gt ; It made no sense . The Greek population wasn\\'t the majority . There could have been a compromise where each side got some of the land according tp population size . But you got greedy and lost everything.\\n\\nLike i mentioned earlier , more demographics show that the Greeks and Turks had about the same numbers , and some stats even show the Greeks as actually being more than the Turks . So if the Greeks weren\\'t the majority , The Turks weren\\'t either . \\nAnd no , there couldn\\'t have been a compromise since Kemal straight out ordered the Turks to attack Smyrna and kick the Greeks out . Even if Greece hadn\\'t been greedy they would have had to attack anyway . Yes , the truth is that they did get greedy and were influenced by the Megali Idea but it\\ 's also the truth that the Turks kept attacking Greek positions . Also we didn\\'t lose everything cause we got greedy . The defeat came when the change in the government came and Greece went with the royalists instead of the Venizelists . Venizelos wanted to to continue the war ( the greek army was almost outside of Ankara by that point ) but most Greeks were war-weary and against the war . Venizelos\\ 's political enemies campaigned saying they\\ 'd stop the war and indeed the won the elections . Venizelos wasn\\'t even elected in the parliament . The thing is , after the win , the King not only didn\\'t stop the war , but they also replaced a lot of the veteran officers of the old regime with new ones that were completely inexperienced and basically useless which rapidly led us into getting our asses kicked . Kemal on the other had was an exceptional leader and strategist so it\\ 's no surprise . But yeah greed ( although obviously bad ) wasn\\'t the problem . Most say that if Venizelos had remained in power , the greek army would have probably entered Ankara . The rest is unknown . \\n\\n & gt ; And yet only ever the Turks are admonished . \\n\\nWell.. it\\ 's not ONLY them that are admonished , at least not in that particular war . But in the end the atrocities in Smyrna kind of echoed louder with people drowning , the city in flames and all so i guess that\\ 's what\\ 's easier to \ '' stick\ '' .\\n\\n & gt ; This makes no sense . I\\ 'm talking about the lands that make up Turkey today . The lands given to Greeks and Armenians was already egregious . But additionally\\u200b the Allies occupied other areas as well . What was to happen to those areas eventually ? Based on the example of the Italian behavior of giving their possessions in the Adriatic to Greece they would have again been given to the Greeks and Armenians with the Turkish population getting ethnically cleansed.\\nJoining a war is no excuse for a war of extermination . Neither Germany\\u200b nor Austria were treated that way . Yes they lost their imperial possessions and had to make territorial concessions but areas of German settlement weren\\'t just given away nilly willy until both Countries were at 20 % of today\\ 's size.\\n\\nAn area being egregious isn\\'t the same as changing hands entirely . Smyrna would pass to the Greeks , the rest of the areas wouldn\\'t go to Britain or France , these countries didn\\'t work that way . They preferred control over the Empire . I agree that joining a war is no excuse for a war of extermination although keeping in mind how far the Ottoman Empire spread and how many countries it completely conquered and enslaved , it\\ 's funny to me how \ '' unfair\ '' you think it is that other countries would do the same with the Ottomans . If you could you have completely wiped off the map every European country back in the days of the strong Empire , but when you lose and you\\ 're about to lose your country to others you\\ 're like \ '' they\\ 're trying to enslave us and wipe the great Turkish nation off the face of the Earth\ '' as if it\\ 's so unfair.. it\\ 's kind of hypocritical.\\nIf we were being fair the Great Powers SHOULD have completely dismantled the Empire , like you did with the Byzantine Empire and others . You value independence differently when you fight for it instead of taking it away from others , don\\'t you ? \\nGreece didn\\'t have a country for centuries . Think about that .

Greece has the 2nd highest defence spending ( by percentage ) in NATO , right after the USA .

In a period where Greece is basically crippled economically , its defence spendings actually increased last year . \\nAnd the even funnier part is that this is happening EXACTLY because Turkey is seen as a threat more and more lately and allowed to even dispute the sovereignty of 130 islands in the Aegean sea while shitting on treaties in which Turkey denounces all claims on these island groups.\\n\\n\ '' Turkey serves our interests\ '' is an honest and true statement but don\\'t go all romantic by saying something silly romantic like \ '' the goal of Nato is to guard the sovereignty of its members\ '' cause the largest member of NATO puts interests above that .",Greek,Greek

Furthermore , Turkey illegally brought in settlers from mainland Turkey to live in the grossly disproportionately ( considering the island\\ 's demographics ) occupied lands which is a clear violation of the Geneva convention . In other words , Turkey went from simply intervening ( which is how it likes to call it ) , to straight out occupying almost half the island and bringing settlers to solidify the division and occupation of Cyprus .

If you\\ 're saying that the Turks came from central Asia to conquer Constantinople , that\\ 's a fact , i don\\'t know why you\\ 're objecting to that .

Yes people are sensitive about Constantinople cause it used to be our old \ '' capital\ '' . That would be the case with many nations . It\\ 's a significant part of our history is that\\ 's expected . But like i explained , very few people actually want to retake it . Every sane Greek realizes that it\\ 's a thing of the past . Would it be cool if we retook it ? Sure . Wouldn\\'t it be cool for you guys if something happened and expanded in Greece ? Yes , how would that be bad for you ? Does that mean that your majority wants to take Athens ? No . You do however have claims over other parts . \\n\\n & gt ; By whom ? NATO , yes . USA would prevent that . By average people ? No . As I said , half of their hearts are under Hagia Sophia . It is a very important figure for a Greek.\\n\\nNo , i\\ 'm talking internally . Any government that would suggest that would automatically crumble . Simply put , Greece doesn\\'t pursue any kind of conflict or idea of occupation . It\\ 's just the country\\ 's mentality . Kind of like with Germany . Perhaps it\\ 's weird for you to understand that cause you\\ 're from Turkey ( and i\\ 'm not saying this as an insult , but Turkey\\ 's policy is quite different ) .\\n\\n & gt ; One is a populist speech given to get votes ( and not done jack shit on later ) while the other is a common belief in Greece which you are denying for some reason.\\n\\n\ '' Just a populist speech to get votes\ '' ... I can just imagine Hitler being all like \ '' We need to exterminate the Jews and conquer more lands ! ! \ '' and Germans being like \ '' calm down guys , he\\ 's just saying that to collect votes , it\\ 's all good , nothing to worry about\ '' . See what i\\ 'm saying ? Populist speech or not , it establishes the idea and precedent if you like , that there are islands that Greece is occupying which is retarded , and this can be used now or in the future accordingly . So while you might perceive is as a populist speech , Greece doesn\\'t care . It affects her directly.\\n\\nAs for the common belief , i\\ 'm telling you that you\\ 're taking an emotional bond about a city and you\\ 're translating it to a desire by the majority to retake that city , which is pure bullshit .",Greek,Greek

Some joke about how we managed to lose that war thanks to the King basically and arguably thanks to Kemal\\ 's charisma . Others see it as a nationalistic war driven by the Megali Idea that pushed beyond the area that was granted to Greece after the war . By all accounts it was a tragic war that was a catastrophe for Greece and it saved Turkey .

Innocent civilians died by both armies , generally a big mess . \\n\\nI also agree that the war is romanticized more than it should by the Turkish side .

I mean it\\ 's exactly the same thing that the Ottoman Empire had done to other empires/countries . You lose the war and get occupied/enslaved right ?

It could have been communist but not USSR communist . Would things have been better or worse ? Hard to tell for sure . But i believe that a country has the right to explore that possibility and decide which path to take itself , something that the British denied Greece at that time by force of arms . \\n\\nThe key points are : a ) like you said EAM was definitely leftist but it was not hardcore communist in its majority . Even many right-wing people sided with them because they saw what EAM did for Greece during the occupation , and the alterEnglish was far from saints as well . \\n\\nb ) EAM wasn\\'t anti-west , it was anti-western meddling as you pointed out about the king . They had every desire to work with the Allies like they did during the occupation but they wouldn\\'t trade one occupation with another ( British ) , nor would they want to reinstall monarchy . The Greeks were free to decide what to do with their country and for better or worse the majority was pro-EAM , yet the British couldn\\'t let Greece slip to communism so they intervened and actually supported the nazi collaborators , the very same people they had been fighting during the occupation , and turned against their former allies of EAM . \\n\\nc ) EAM never sought to stop the British when it could . They could have marched into Athens and secured it before the British arrived and the British would have a REALLY tough time fighting them there , yet the EAM stood and let the British enter Athens not seeking confrontation . Even Churchill couldn\\'t believe it . \\n\\nIt\\ 's a largely unknown story but to many Greeks this was a betrayal by the UK .

You merely found it there , it already existed almost 1000 years before it was \ '' yours\ '' so your argument is hollow . It was basically a church for way longer than it was/is a mosque .

Every time I\\ 've met a Roma it was either because he was begging , trying to steal or selling drugs , guns , protection , stolen goods or their children for sexual use . The community is poorly integrated and very resistant to police interference . \\n\\nThey rarely send their kids to school , which sort of creates a vicious circle as their only option ends up being crime .

The blame is a different discussion . A huge discussion . Briefly , I\\ 'll say that I don\\'t even blame our politicians . I blame us . Our mentality towards the state in the last 40 years has been vomit-inducing . We have always been fundamentally antisocial . Greeks are not interested in building a strong society , with the rights and responsibilities that that entails .

If men are more rational and women have more empathy ( which is baron cohen theory apparently ) , then why would we think that one is better than the other in order to make a good society ? What is even a good society ? \\n\\nThat\\ 's the thing . We don\\'t .

It\\ 's to ensure that any occupation is untenable , to ensure that you alienate rather than befriend the population , and that your support is not accepted.\\n\\nYes , and even guerrilla groups have someone supplying them with real weapons and supplies , usually an external power that has special intrests in stopping the invader .

Now , a week in , a resupply truck coming to supply a German outpost is attacked and the supplies taken . You are the officer in charge of the occupation . What do you do ?

Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah.It sucks inhaling this shit for 25 years despite being a non-smoker.At the place where i learned English the teachers ( all women ) smoked so much that every time i passed outside of their office and went home my mother ( a smoker ) told me i reeked of cigarettes .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,To be fair refugees have also burned parts of their camp.2-3 weeks ago furstrated that their applications were taking so long they burned down the office that was processing them.Seems that noone likes the camps .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,How about we ban smoking altogether here.40 % of the population as smokers is really dropping life expectancy.Also the crisis didnt do us any favours ( less money to spend on homecooked meals=more junk food which is cheaper ) .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Of course not.I was just pointing out that there is a lot of frustration in and out of the camps.And i mean the refugees and the local populace , not the neo-nazis .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"It must have been a tremendously proud day for the German people but that and what followed ( Germany humiliates France ( 1870 ) , France humiliates Germany ( 1918 ) , Germany humiliates France ( 1940 ) ) shows clearly that despite its flaws the EU is one of the best things to happen for Europeans.\\n\\nWhether is flourishes/improves or dies away its up to us .",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Yes Brexit should become and official EU meme If it hasnt become already,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,If i had to guess Its because we have so many inhabited islands .And also some of those islands enjoy a lot of tourism .I looked up a catalogue of all the airports in Greece and i was amazed.Here is a link in english : https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_Greece \\n\\nGot to get those tourists to the beaches asap .How else can they turn red ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Just to rectify one thing about your post.While we wouldnt understand each other 100 % koine greek ( ancient ) is much closer to modern greek than shakespearean english is to modern english .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Golden Dawn wont win.Before the crisis they were nobodies.They have gained a lot of traction compared to before the crisis but they have proven with their actions that they are thugs.Sure there are some fascists or supremacists that believe what they preach but the majority of their voters are just disgruntled and desperate .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,In Greece they always bring the water before even ordering .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,"I dont know If they are trying to \ '' destroy\ '' us.Its a bit extreme . \\n I can say a few things about Greece.We had been subjugated for more than a millenia ( Romans then Ottomans ) .We gained our independence less than 200 years ago.The new Greek state didnt hit the ground running.To this day most Greeks are still treating the state as we did the turkish pashas or Sultans.\\n\\n1 ) Hostile and repressing entity thats out to take our money , at the worst.\\n\\n2 ) Collaborator in making a quick profit by stealing money from taxes and securing jobs for your family in the public sector , if you bribe it with votes , at its best.\\n\\nNext we have our European \ '' allies\ '' and \ '' partners\ '' .There is no such thing ( talking about goverments here ) .Just profit to be made.Looking throughout history bad things come from the west for Greece ( generally ) .Siemens has been bribing our politicians for years ( a scandal broke out in Greece a few years back ) .Our minister of Defence ( Tsohatzopoulos ) famously corrupt took bribes and bought German submarines that werent fuctioning properly.Greece ( along side other Countries ) forgave the German debt after WW2 so Germany could grow , yet they refuse to do the same with us.\\n\\nMy point is not to put blame on the German people ( or any other peoples ) .I am not looking for a scapegoat.We as Greeks need to change some of our mentalities that lead us here.We ( some of us ) voted for corrupt politicians , profited ( shorterm ) from it and now we pay for it.But in my view the punishment is a bit harsh for the crime.Our economy is dying.We are having a third exodus ( first in the 1920\\ 's ,2nd in the 1960\\ 's ) of people.Many people are suffering from poverty and we are being painted as the black sheep , that despite Its good friends efforts just wont walk straight.\\n\\nI may sound a bit bitter but the E.U . is starting to look as a good way for Countries with strong economies to walk all over weaker ones.No \ '' solidarity\ '' .With both crisis ( economic and immigrant ) we are being thrown under the bus again and again.And I am a proponent of the EU.\\n\\nTo conclude I believe that should we change we can stop the rest of our \ '' allies\ '' Taking advantage of our weakness.And have a country thats good for everyone who wishes it to live in .",Greek,Greek
