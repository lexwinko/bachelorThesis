The US weapon embargo in 75 hurt the TuAF so bad that we didn\\'t have more than 20 airworthy jets .

These are built in conjunction with foreign partners mainly South Korea and Italy . Turkey owns the production license of all these items . If a war breaks out and assuming it is a conventional one , you can be sure that factories will be pumping these out en masse .

Now the entire unity of AKP is threatened because of this event and they will lose power because of it while it gave strenght to secular people parties who are actually more numerous . It\\ 's just that seculars are always divided and fractioned and can not unite like AKP which currently is an umbrella party for a myriad of right wing parties . Once the umbrella breaks , they break . It all falls on how secular opposition can use the situation to their advantage and this protest is a step towards that.\\n\\nTL ; DR for lazy folks ; Purges are directed against G\u00fclenist ( islamists -YES ALL 50k+ OF THEM- ) and protests were made by seculars and it\\ 's a good thing.\\n\\nEdit : NOT all protests are made by seculars .

Kerberos_is_Weak,europe,"He is a Nusayri ( Syrian Alawite ) from one of the villages of Latakia as far as I know . Since most of my relatives lived close to the Syrian-Turkish border which fell in to the rebels\\ ' hand quickly , they must be dead I assumed .

KubilayTaskiran,europe,"Even without Erdogan and political islamism I wouldn\\'t even dare to call us \ '' European\ '' and I\\ 'm not saying this as a bad thing directed to Turks or Europeans , I just don\\'t see how Turks will see those other European countries as \ '' brother nations\ '' or themselves as part of Europe , neither did I ever encountered a Turk in my life who told me \ '' Hey an union or better relations with Europe would be amazing.\ '' , compare that for example with how many Turks want closer relations with the other Turkic countries and to a smaller extent with other Islamic countries . \\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish

KubilayTaskiran,europe,"I only saw them misrepresenting an issue with [ the police ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=euL6rL942-g ) , others than that I\\ 'm no expert on them since they tend to be directed more towards the side of *the Aegean coast elitist left wing white Turkish population* and I\\ 'm not exactly part nor fond of those people . \\n\\nLeaving that side , I hugely despise the arrests , just like I despise arresting people who **actually support** the PKK/G\u00fclenists for 2 main reasons ( aside my support for freedom of speech ) . The two reasons are these : \\n\\n**1 ) ** It\\ 's unfair , people like Erdogan or current PM Binali Yildirim among other have hugely supported the G\u00fclenists , yet they remain untouched because they got \ '' fooled\ '' . Infact there are plenty of videos on youtube where you see them openly praising the G\u00fclenists.\\n\\n**2 ) ** It doesn\\'t work , people have the internet and no matter how hard you try to arrest them all , there will always be people voicing those opinions , aside that if you are really against them and their ideology you should be coming with counter arguments , which are the best weapons against ideas you don\\'t like . \\n\\n",Turkic,Turkish
KubilayTaskiran,europe,The only reason why he opposed this in the first place before accepting it is to gain more popularity since the communists in his region are growing stronger and stronger every day .,Turkic,Turkish
KubilayTaskiran,europe,well I was more directing towards the Turks who victimize themselves a little bit too much here and to the non-Turks who keep acting like every Turk having a \ '' pro-Turkish\ '' stance is a quasi-fascist not bein able to think independently .,Turkic,Turkish

KubilayTaskiran,europe,"Yeah hence the reason they pulled of the coup so quickly and weakly organised , however all is not really that negative since the lack of officers in the army forced the AKP to put former kemalist generals back on command .",Turkic,Turkish

Turks in Europe are the worst kind of Turks . Turkey deserves a lot worse with this election outcome . Not to mention our bloody history .

Leatra,europe,"Turkey killed socialists , nationalists , Alevis , Kurds alike . It was a brutal coup and everyone was damaged by it , even my dad .

Leatra,europe,"lol , if we got angry at minor stuff like this , we would have a heart attack in /r/worldnews . You can call it whatever you want .",Turkic,Turkish
Leatra,europe,They made several pro-PKK comments . Like saying \ '' millions voted for us for release of \u00d6calan ( PKK leader ) \ '' .

Leatra,europe,"Right wing voters are more organized and have higher attendance in elections worldwide.\\n\\nAKP sometimes pays people to vote for them , gives them bags of coal , pasta , etc , and sends buses to their houses to take them to ballots .

Older cops tend to be better and more reasonable than young cops , since young cops are usually recruited by G\u00fclen movement and that\\ 's how they join the police force and quickly climb ranks.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you watched it enough to know the characters ( I don\\'t remember their names myself ) , but the aggressive \ '' bad cop\ '' always wearing black leather and a black cap who seems like a walking PTSD disorder reminds me something . My father told me about a retired cop who walked into a k\u0131raathane ( they are like cafes ) and shot a guy dead on the basis of he didn\\'t reply to his greeting . I always remember that story after seeing that guy on TV.\\n\\nCops can get really bloodthirsty when they are dealing with protests . There was a [ video ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8I7-lFyrBN8 ) of a cop shouting to another cop who is holding a gas weapon of some kind but he is reluctant to fire it upon the crowd . So his superior screams at him \ '' fire it , you idiot , fire it ! \ '' \\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\ 's for creating a better image of the police . Propaganda is very blatant in Turkey and somebody eventually uncovers it if it\\ 's not . I think it\\ 's just a money grab . They have been milking that series for some years now and it\\ 's mostly repeating itself by now .",Turkic,Turkish
Leatra,europe,"Turkey Turks generally don\\'t like Germany Turks . This kinda leads to Germany Turks not feeling at home in both countries . Auslander in Germany and yabanc\u0131 in Turkey . Germany Turks are too conservative when compared to Turkey Turks . \\n\\nThere are a lot of negative stereotypes about them . Conservative , nouveau riche , show-offs , naive , votes for the left in Germany and for the right in Turkey . Especially anti-AKP people hate them for contributing to getting Turkey fucked by Erdo\u011fan with their votes , which they give without any idea about what it\\ 's like to live there They only visit Turkey during Summer vacations to spend hard Euros with a 1:3 exchange rate with Lira and they assume Turkey\\ 's economy is doing so well ( of course all thanks to Erdo\u011fan ) because Lira is basically worthless and they can buy anything they want.\\n\\nThere was this one time one of them told me all the great stuff AKP did , even though he was born and raised in Germany and only visited their glorious and stronk Turkey during Summers . This \ '' I know all\ '' attitude regarding Turkey can be annoying . I really wanted ask him to switch places with me and live one year in Turkey he adores so much.\\n\\nOf course as it is with any peope , they are cool people when you get past the stereotypes . Their insistence on speaking German amongst themselves even though you make it clear that you don\\'t understand German is kinda annoying though lol . But I do like their Germanized accents when they speak Turkish . They use a German manner of speaking sometimes , directly translating German words to Turkish in their minds in a literal way and forming Turkish sentences that way.\\n\\nThey seem to be stuck between identities . But mostly they seem well integrated to me . They seem really varied . You got people who can barely speak Turkish on hand and on the other hand , those who know the grammatical rules better than me.\\n\\nEdit : Also , people who really needed the money and the work went to Germany . Most of them went from uneducated and conservative parts of Turkey , if you were wondering why Germany Turks are more conservative than Turkey Turks . Some Turkey Turks feel Germany took their worst and Turkish immigrants around Europe are showing a bad example of Turkish people . So they feel ashamed of them .",Turkic,Turkish

The attitude is pretty much \ '' meh , it was war\ '' for both the genocide and that \ '' persecution\ '' in Balkans .

Yeah , I\\ 'm one of them . I accept the genocide but can\\'t say I care much if I\\ 'm being truly honest . Unfortunately genocide turned into a political stance , it\\ 's not about historical facts anymore . Can\\'t really take any of the sides seriously.\\n\\nAnd most people who accept the genocide don\\'t really want to pay reparations , so they\\ 'd rather have the government deny it .

These two points are enough for EU to stall the ascension process for a century.\\n\\nFrom the Turkish side , well , people are simply not interested in EU anymore . Like a decade ago being \ '' Europeanized\ '' was the thing but people got sick of it . I think it\\ 's a case of butthurt at the result of being denied by EU master race . I remember some negative remarks from Europe back in the day , like from Sarkozy . Turks believe Europeans think of Turks as barbarians who has no place in Europe , so people started to dislike Europe as time went by . Combined with butthurt , the mindset changed from a push to being Europeanized to \ '' huh , we don\\'t like you and your cool kids club either ! \ '' \\n\\nThat\\ 's not harsh . That\\ 's how a very big majority of Turks feel . I read a poll where only 17 % of the population believe in the ascension process in 2012. so-called EU ascension process became something of a joke over here , but even that joke got old . EU is simply irrelevant nowadays . In Europe people seem to think Turkey still has a chance which I find weird.\\n\\nIn general , Turks distrust pretty much every country , but the West probably tops it . I think people feel cheated or something.\\n\\nI think Turkey has no place in EU either.\\n\\nedit : fixed a typo . 17 % of the population believe in ascension . 83 % doesn\\'t consider it realistic .",Turkic,Turkish

On top of that youtube\\ 's rules are very very strict and cause a huge number of false positives , where in my case there are more legitimate comments that are caught by filters and I have to manually approve than hurtful or spam comments .

Or alterEnglishly it\\ 's just stupidity by the lawmakers and since it\\ 's Germany both could be true , since we have instances of stupid laws surrounding censorship in Germany before and we have also seen how much German lawmakers seem to clash with \ '' foreign companies\ '' ( eg Google News stuff ) .",Uralic,Estonian

Nobody protests that . They are professions for which there is not only a market , but a great deal of public demand and appreciation . Yet somehow the humanities have become identified with useless , self-referential and obscure disciplines . It is truly bizarre.\\n\\nMuch of the problem is that the stereotypical humanities are incompetent at what they do , and instead of working to get better , they go to impossible lengths to cover it up . \ '' Not even wrong\ '' is patrician , coherence and rigor are plebeian , because coherence and rigor might reveal the fair patrician as a quack whose statements are absolutely trivial or incorrect .

That does not mean there\\ 's a slippery slope to banning every other unpleasant ideology - just this particular one , and any others that may prove to be as dangerous to free society and human civilization . The threshold for banning forms of speech is and should remain incredibly high . But to demand that there should be no threshold , even in the face of homegrown suicidal mass murderers produced by an ideology completely in opposition to every value that our civilization is built upon - that is utter lunacy . It is refusing to puncture your body to excise a malignant tumor.\\n\\nIf your country was in a conventional war with a neighbor , would you think it appropriate to preserve absolute free speech by allowing the enemy to set up recruitment camps inside your country ? After all , their speech is not *directly* harming anyone , they\\ 're just trying to convince people to harm you at a later date .",Uralic,Estonian

As someone from Eastern Europe , I have experienced negative stereotyping and prejudice , my country has been a pawn of imperial powers redrawing maps according to their interests . If Putin invades and annexes us tomorrow , I will not feel a sudden urge to slaughter ethnic Russians.\\n\\nIf the \ '' moderates\ '' are actually so volatile , then maybe you should stop exhorting people to not light matches and instead figure out how not to sit on a powder keg in the first place ?",Uralic,Estonian

Clifford_Banes,europe,"Dictators will also keep it a shithole of oppression , which is fertile ground for religious and tribal zealotry . It\\ 's a band-aid on a gangrenous wound , and deposing the dictator and saying \ '' hey democracy\ '' is just ripping off the band-aid and leaving the wound to fester.\\n\\nThe correct answer is an invasion and military occupation under a UN mandate that enforces law and order for multiple generations . Not just Syria , but also Iraq and every other ME state that can\\'t keep internal order.\\n\\nUntil we let go of the ideological idiocy that only immediate democratic reform is an acceptable outcome of intervention , nothing will ever improve . These societies are absolutely broken by religion , tribalism , and generations of totalitarian oppression.\\n\\nThe height of this idiocy is the fetishization of Iraqi elections where hordes of illiterate people held up their inked thumbs because they couldn\\'t sign their names .

Clifford_Banes,europe,"Democracy is not compatible with countries that have been run like prisons where one tribe are the jailers and the other tribe are the inmates.\\n\\nThe best scenario for all of these failed states is a military invasion followed by a generation or two of decidedly non-democratic administration by a UN-sanctioned coalition . Bring peace , prosperity , and rule of law first . Ease in democracy at local levels first . Write their constitution for them . Reinstate full democracy once the country is functional and people are invested in civil society.\\n\\nThe delusional idea that democracy itself ( will of the people ) is the end goal is absolutely toxic . The will of the people in deciding on who represents them is a *necessary evil* to prevent autocracy and corruption , it is not a virtue in itself.\\n\\nStates should exist to protect the rights of individuals and serve all of society equally , not use its monopoly of violence against whomever and whatever the mob decides to point it towards .",Uralic,Estonian

Clifford_Banes,europe,"But the whole point is that immigration itself is not the problem , but immigration from places with a culture that\\ 's incompatible with the host country.\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention that many Dutch people of Moroccan decent have integrated just fine\\n\\nMost immigrants integrate \ '' just fine\ '' because they kind of have to . They need jobs and they need human interaction . So if there\\ 's a handful of people from Country X , then they\\ 'll have to get a job alongside the English population , and their friends will have to come from the English population.\\n\\nThe bigger the difference in culture , the bigger the culture shock for the immigrant , but the onus to deal with that has always been on the immigrant . They have to adapt to the culture of the host country.\\n\\nAs soon as the immigrant population from their country of origin hits critical mass and becomes an enclave , they no longer have to deal with the culture shock at all . They don\\'t need to assimilate or integrate or adapt , because they get all their social needs filled by their compatriots . Add to that an overly generous welfare state and they don\\'t even need to integrate into the workforce and interact with locals there.\\n\\nThis is only problematic for some countries of origin . Chinese immigrants have tended to form enclaves and resist integration . But I highly doubt Wilders would give two shits about a Chinatown popping up in Amsterdam . Because Chinese culture is largely compatible with Dutch culture . There are no Chinese morality police vigilantes roaming the streets of any Western country . They stopped practicing misogynistic ritual mutilation ( foot binding ) a century ago.\\n\\nPlease stop using the word \ '' racism\ '' to refer to opposition to particular cultures . \ '' Racism\ '' means the belief that certain groups of people are biologically inferior to others . People who believe that exist , and they are dangerous . Their form of racism should be opposed , but if you define that word to mean \ '' anyone who is not an enthusiastic believer in universal multiculturalism\ '' , it becomes toothless.\\n\\nI do not want mass immigration of Muslims in my country because I think Islam is a horrendous ideology completely at odds with the values of liberalism that our societies are based on . I specifically say \ '' Muslims\ '' , because the fact is that their religion is such a totalitarian force in their lives that this is their self-professed primary identity . Before ethnicity , before nationality , they are Muslim . It is an inextricably political religion that has a proscribed scriptural duty to enforce theocracy . There is no \ '' render unto Caesar\ '' in Islam . And because of this , if they don\\'t culturally integrate , they will never politically integrate.\\n\\nI actually do want immigration as a whole . More people from a diverse selection of cultures will enrich my own . I want my country to be less uniformly white ( which is a result of not ever being a colonial power , not xenophobia ) . But I don\\'t want a single person in my country who could realistically be convinced to join ISIS . Anyone whose worldview offers a path to see that perfect distillation of evil as anything but repugnant is a danger.\\n\\nAs to Wilders , it takes a special kind of willful misreading to construe his comment as a call to ethnic cleansing . I never understood lumping him in with Jobbik and Le Pen , and it really strikes me as a political hatchet job to paint him as some sort of \ '' far right\ '' lunatic . He doesn\\'t fit . He\\ 's not a Putinist shill . He\\ 's not a racist . If Wilders is \ '' far right\ '' , then your Overton window should probably not be centered on Mao .",Uralic,Estonian

Companies get cheaper workforce to boost their companies revenue to expand ( if they expand it can be seen useful for the whole nation as they will create extra jobs among them legal ) and short term workers get an extra money boost as their employers can pay them more with no/less tax to invest in their own .

It must be said that they are simply proposing ideas and thankfully most have been \ '' open to the public\ '' so to speak so peoples general opinion is taken into account and nothing bad so far has come of it . Still even seeing these ideas made me start checking local news again . Before it was on \ '' automated\ '' as I trusted our second to last PM and his vision.\\n- That we are seemingly slowly losing the economic race to Lithuania and Latvia in the long run if predictions are to be trusted.\\n- Standstill in economy , we aren\\'t going nowhere and we haven\\'t yet found our niche in economy.\\n- The whole economy ladder situation in general , we are at the place in economy that we don\\'t see that much support , our prices are slowly starting to match our Western ones but our wages are still quite low tbh . My generation kind of got f\\'ed , a world economic collapse ( thanks Wallstreet ) , Russian trade embargo eg again slow growth ( for good reasons ) and overall situation of becoming \ '' developed\ '' so we pretty much have the weight of our economy on us.\\n- Uncertainty of my own future , how much of the pension fond will be useful as again the government only recently proposed an idea to totally reform it . Like come on guys , this is the life of every future granny and grandpa you are talking about.\\n- I do hate that we have a large minority inside our country that you can\\'t simply fix as they obviously do have their right to be different but such a stupid hand of cards faith has dealt our country , put around a quarter of the population inside your country that invaded your nation and ask to get along . I mean it is the same irony for them also , live inside a country that was apart of a superpower only to now be first , second or third generation minority inside a tiny nation while your ancestors were the majority just a couple of decades ago . I am talking in suprelatives , obviously individually very few alive today are directly responsible for past events but the historic context and embedding of ancestry and origins is different for a large percentage of the population . In reality it means we have a lot of problems to deal with that we shouldn\\'t have as a nation , Narva being a big town and a very big Russian majority is a good example . It slows down progress having to fine tune laws and ideas for a larger audience . The fact that we even have to learn Russian is something major that affects our lives , not that an extra language is bad but looking back I might of wanted to learn English and instead of Russian , Swedish or German.\\n- Also I would like a more metropolitan capital and a larger population.\\n\\n\\nOh jeebus , that became a wall of text mighty fast .",Uralic,Estonian

A youth riot broke out that spread to Tallinn center region . Again because censorship denied something and the Soviet regime was partly blamed but it again showed that people were kind of being allowed to riot and Moscow didn\u00b4t really heavily crack down on such events.\\n\\nPoliticians used these events as kind of \ '' independence polls\ '' and seeing how many are singing along , well even coming to such events was a good sign . Obviously the main deal was done by our politicians of that time that took the move , declared independence , seeked contacts from foreign people and played a \ '' nothing at all going on in Estonia\ '' game with Moscow . This was the \ '' official official\ '' red line point where things hit the fan.\\n\\nThen the people were mobilized , Toompea was fortified , TV tower and border points were blocked by human walls and everyone hoped for the best .

Also how they built St.Petersburg on the Baltic sea coast as a new capital of Russia to be more into the region.\\n\\nNot until the people all over Europe moved from being serfs of the land into a more citizen of a nation type deal , has Russia started searching for a self image along with other countries , keyword being here the scary \ '' nationalism\ '' . Suddenly they find themselves in a situation of Me vs Europe while before they tried to co-operate as much as they could .",Uralic,Estonian

Dicios,europe,"Depends , we will still have a lot of Soviet baggage for ... I would guess 50-100 years.\\n\\nOn the top of my mind : \\n\\n1 ) Buildings and entire city blocks , a lot of those Soviet concrete city jungle houses , Tallinn was expanded by like 50 % by those things . So a lot of infrastructure around the country tbh.\\n\\n2 ) Economic difference , we still have a lot of catching up to do , Portugal and Greece are closeby but 70 years is 70 years , its hard to make it up in ~25 years , where the first 5 years you are even worse off than you were before as a fresh re-independent country.\\n\\n3 ) Mentality , some statistics still show us as what we were , ex-commie block , we perform usually as top 3 best in whatever category but we still are in that group . Last thing I viewed was something about female to male ratio in jobs , were we were top 2 when compared to old block countries.\\n\\n4 ) Nation itself , like it or not we have 1/3rd to 1/6th ( depends on your definition ) of Russian first generation or second generation badly bubbled people here and it will take time to assimilate into a one united nation with common ideas . Some people have hammer and cycle flags with Putin shirts ( unironic ) who speak no words of Estonian while the other guy might be some former Werchmaht fighter drafted into the army and still alive and kicking at 85 , such people I doubt will see eye to eye - ever . I once drew a comparison of it being like a mild Palestine/Iran over here when the \ '' right\ '' people meet.\\n\\nStill having said that semi-bad stuff we do have made immense progress in 25 years . A lot of right choice by our early politicians in terms of long term policies . Also closeness to rich countries like the Nordic block is a very nice payoff . More so the 0,5-1,5h distance between Helsinki and Tallinn has allowed for fast idea exchange and a slight boost in catching up.\\n\\nWe have stagnated in recent years ( as has Europe and somewhat Sweden/Finland ) but as such a small economy we can\u00b4t expect to do well when other partners aren\u00b4t . Still our \ '' bad\ '' currently is a small growth so it isn\u00b4t technically that bad at all.\\n\\nWhen we look at Sweden or Finland we cry out of our predicament , when we look at other Soviet block countries we cry out of joy seeing we should not complain that much . I believe we are somewhat half way still \ '' Ex-Soviet\ '' and half of something of a unique entity as Estonia , Baltic region , Nordic partner , EU or whatever you want to call it .",Uralic,Estonian

Its also really is like quarter scandinavia , quarter Russia , quarter Baltic in terms of traditions/attitude/legacy . Depends in what area and with whom you communicate.\\n\\nLiving costs are really high for our average salaries and with food you are going to pay like 50-70 % of your wage into just being able to live . This is for average salaries though that are around 900 eur.\\n\\nWe have entered some kind of second stage as a country/population as we are slowly creeping up on \ '' west Europes\ '' slower runners as are Portugal , Greece and a few others in terms of living standards/economy so we have all these \ '' new\ '' problems as \ '' is the wage increasing too rapidly ? \ '' and \ '' are we going to see somekind of bubble burst in terms of some pricing not catching up\ '' , \ '' is our country still good for investors if we keep growing in terms of taxes ? \ '' . Our minimum for example is being increased by 40 eur each year . It used to be 355 in 2014 , last year it was 390 , now its 430 . Next year 470 so this benefits the \ '' small guy\ '' the most . So it shows the general \ '' slow progression\ '' we are witnessing.\\n\\nFor being a small nation we actually do need just 1 startup to succeed and stay in Estonia for our entire nation to tigerleap in terms of economy . This is our current \ '' country mission\ '' . Before it was the unoriginal \ '' get into NATO , EU , Euro\ '' deal.\\n\\nI find it interesting that our government itself is kind of trying to be a startup with many interesting ideas as is selling ID cards to foreigners in trade of a easy way to do business through our legislation . Also the whole X-road program of allowing all kinds of ideas to link up with the government . Just picture a country establishing a linux server and actually allowing everyone into it who has an idea , to data with legal binding force .\\n\\nIt is however a fairly common opinion that the country is being built up in the correct way . We have our taxes in order , we have our economic discipline and our only gripe is that our economy is growing slow . This is a big fault of ours we can\\'t fix though as losing a chunk of Russian market and the general European growth affects our markets quite badly . Second fault is our population growing old so at some point we will reach a tipping point of social taxes vs taxpayers , it will be interesting to see how it will be solved.\\n\\nEconomy while \ '' growing\ '' , more importantly is not in any way in the negatives for a while so the growth is constant for the forseeable future , much easier to plan ahead a steady economy if you aren\\'t flip flopping around on the scale . In terms of investment we aren\\'t the cheapest anymore and even Lithuania has a lot of startups there , I think even Google went with Lithuania ? Too lazy to Google right now . People friendliness , lets just say we save up on friendliness so in close quarters with closer people we burst out but in general we are \ '' nordic cold\ '' , we do have more European \ '' keep smile\ '' relations though with each year and younger people are in the \ '' Youtube\ '' generation so they kind of are more open.\\n\\nFood in general is shit . We eat peasant grub to this day , potatoes , macaroni , chicken , pork etc . With a touch of more veganism and common sense of cutting back on sugar , oily foods etc ( at least in my social group ) . We are known to eat unhealthy fatty food though.\\n\\nWe are in demand of skilled labour with mostly in IT markets ( and I have seen plenty of foreigners in IT firms ) , if you average the costs of living you can live pretty well with what they offer . Around 2000-3000eur wages ( someone can correct me on this ) afaik.\\n\\nI would conclude and say we are the jack-of-all nations currently . Bad at nothing but also not good at anything , so we kind of average in this mild economy growth slowly trying to build up . Everything is done correct , nothing major is happening at the moment . Perhaps that is good enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Uralic,Estonian

Governance systems were set in stone and they were hard to restructure . You still hear from one institution or another how the basic idea how something works is still from the Communist era , not that surprising considering Communism collapsed only ~1988-1991 but I would consider it a bad thing seeing how corruption seeped in , in such a large system as USSR was.\\n\\nEconomy suffered because again , such a large system , does not govern everything correctly .

Dicios,europe,"& gt ; A question for you , if I may -- do the Russians have a sense of cultural superiority w.r.t the Estonians ? I agree with you that people who are comfortable in their enclaves do not have a pressing need to integrate ( in fact , the world outside the enclave becomes a \ '' scary\ '' prospect ) but is there an element of \ '' our culture/language is superior to that of the locals\ '' ? Or are you on pretty even footing ? \\n\\nI\\ 'm sure a Russian Estonian can answer it better but we are pretty much on equal footing.\\n\\nThere are a small percentage , with sometimes loud voices who wants to deport every Russian back if they say anything negative about Estonia or them and those who want back the \ '' good old Soviet times\ '' when Russians still had an empire or blame every personal fault on the Estonian government . So both sides have the obvious , unstable ... I guess , people.\\n\\nRussian speakers simply have a strong enough culture to draw from right next to them . The biggest stepping stone for everyone is language , Estonians mostly learn Russian but that quality isn\\'t good at all . Same way Russians do learn Estonian , probably better than Estonians Russian , but even for them its hard enough with pure classroom knowledge to come into Estonian groups.\\n\\nMore importantly I think Estonians don\\'t have a realistic inferiority complex . A country of about a million managing to regain independence through a history of different rulers , also the fairly recent loss of the Russian Soviet empire , is something that lifts most of the peoples spirits . Even if some Russians do feel superior there are enough Estonians who probably boast just as much.\\n\\nI do think most Russian Estonians are trying to find their role in society as they aren\\'t fully Russian and they aren\\'t fully Estonian so each of them has to find their comfortable zone of how much of their home brought up culture they want in their life and how much of \ '' Estonian side\ '' they want to experience . Choices like \ '' Do I put my kid in a Russian or Estonian speaking kindergarten ? \ '' is something that come up for Russian Estonians and not the other way around . Also mixed families where kids often speak fluently Estonian and Russian have something of a conundrum from what speaking school to what working environment.\\n\\nSo I guess yes , the knowledge that there is a 140 million big state and even bigger cultural sphere of Russian speakers is something that holds Estonian Russians back knowing they are having to learn the ways of something that was just some decades ago their small territory , perhaps deep inside somewhat demeaning I guess ( and unique when it comes to immigration problems ) but its not superiority per say . More of a sad predicament they find themselves in and having to adjust quickly within same generations.\\n\\nI do think it is still early and a 30 % minority does not go away in 25-30 years .

Instead of physical humans sitting in rooms and counting votes you have IT techs across multiple instances seeing how the votes flow.\\n\\nI mean again , the traffic is still very much grounded into the physical system , the computer connecting to the voting server has to give some sort of identification . Usually , as logical , its some sort of Estonian address and as they don\\'t need to hide it its easier to verify if it is indeed where the packet got sent . If a diverse range of locations where used and all the traffic nodes of various companies can confirm a inflow of traffic through their servers it can be again physically verified that the traffic indeed came from multiple sources and not some uber hacker sending a lot of information about all the votes from one place . These things can be traced , its usually a question of \ '' how long it takes\ '' .\\n\\nWe still have that diverseness as people use different locations and their imprint of connecting and sending that packet gets left in the log . You can\\'t perfectly fake such an imprint of multiple , thousands of thousands of naturally incoming packets.\\n\\nEven some sort of infecting bot net type of deal wouldn\\'t really work as you still need the physical card to be in to send any information and you can verify from your end what vote was cast from your card later.\\n\\nThe votes themselves are also encrypted again , in a physical way .

In Europe , you\\ 're called a \ '' foreigner\ '' even if you\\ 're a 3rd generation immigrant , born and raised in Europe . If you\\ 're German , you understand who the word \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' applies to . My Turkish friends who are very secular , open minded , speak perfect Germans are still referred to as \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' by people like me.\\n\\nBut the US is a very different country . Every American is basically a new age immigrant . Only in US a question like \ '' Where are your roots ? \ '' is common enough to get an answer \ '' Originally part Irish , part Scottish\ '' etc etc.\\n\\nThere is no real \ '' American\ '' besides the Indian tribes.\\n\\nEuropean countries are old enough with indigenous populations that people have a picture of an average Swede or Brit , or German . Obviously a third generation Turk will stand out.\\n\\nYou are somehow trying to \ '' wish away\ '' the differences between origins and citizens.\\n\\nIn US from the get go ( besides Indians who sardonically got wiped away by the immigrants ... ) . US has no real first timers alive , everyone is simply a citizen . In Europe things are a tiny bit complicated and you can\\'t simply do away with thousands of years of history . There is a heavy percentage of citizens who also have their origins in that place for hundreds or even thousands of years by some bloodline . Old habits and traditions are slow to fade away and you are asking the near impossible . Again US had a very different start.\\n",Uralic,Estonian
Dicios,europe,"Integration services are horrible , otherwise integration would be successful . There are no people that can not be integrated even if they don\\'t want to .

This is the children PG13 integration . You are basically saying \ '' it simply happens\ '' .\\n\\nEstonia has had a culturally different community for ages . We are a good \ '' testtube\ '' of a country with a large minority . \\n\\nEstonian Russians and Estonians still live in two different worlds . Different tv channels , different languages , you can even tell apart different clothe styles and hairstyles that Russian kids have and Estonian kids have.\\n\\nYes there are free state ( and thereby tax funded ) Russian language schools that also teach Estonian heavily and yes there are all kinds of projects done on media landscape or \ '' cooperative\ '' type of projects . Problem is they don\\'t work . If they feel comfortable ( as most Russians do feel ) they don\\'t see a need to change anything , they have Russian schools , Russian friends , Russian tv channels , all state sites have Russian versions etc etc . \\n\\nThey don\\'t need to integrate at all . The society has already changed enough to accompany them and not the other way around as they forcefully became apart of Estonian society . Obviously not their fault at all , just as Estonians were deported to Siberian regions , they were semi-forcefully deported to Estonia ( some came as families with the army to keep locals under a solid foot ) .\\n\\nIn Siberia also Estonian villages formed and they created their own culture sphere trying to keep it alive.\\n\\nPoint being its idiotic to expect a nation to basically handfeed and cart every single individual to force them to integrate . If they don\\'t really want to integrate they won\\'t , simple as that . Integration is a two way process.\\n\\nWhat is \ '' positive\ '' at least in Estonia is that a very slow process is bringing Russian Estonians away from the Russian federation citizens so at least they are their own culture group besides actual Russians and Estonians . Also a small percentage do get integrated toward Estonian averages but it will still take decades to get anywhere.\\n\\nAlso as a disclaimer I must say I am not xenophobic , Russian Estonians have every right to have their space , just as Americans say \ '' I might not agree with them but I will defend their rights with them\ '' but the willy-nilly integration that you picture is not real , its in la-la land . It is not that black and white and simple.\\n\\nLiving in a country with a forcefully relocated minority of 30 % is not something you want in a country .

Again I am not saying women couldn\\'t do it but on average they would be the weaker links in units.\\n\\nAlso the way it is built up women who volunteer for service have basically a \ '' kids happy meal version\ '' service , they usually serve less time ( unless they want to continue , career reasons for ex ) and they have easier requirements for physical tests etc etc .

Dicios,europe,"Well your question should then be worded as publishers . Simply major investors who pay for the development costs and share revenue.\\n\\nThere are probably many puzzle pieces why there is no European majors besides Ubisoft ( that is actually comparable to even EA ) .\\n\\n1 ) What is a European market ? We have a lot of different languages , cultures , world views . It would be nearly impossible to produce a game that hits off to the \ '' European market\ '' . There is no easy way to entice entire Europe to play \ '' EU Call of Duty\ '' , you can\\'t fistbump the European Union flag and hope people share that ideal.\\n\\nSo a very mixed market makes it hard for their own buyers to buy anything.\\n\\n2 ) In the game of banking or investment the early bird does get the worm . Americans , Japanese have had time to gobble up plenty of practice and smaller developers that produce their main titles . As we gamers all know it only takes like 3-4 major series to lift your company from zero to hero . Assassins Creeds , World of Warcraft , Call of Duty etc . All had quite a humble beginning.\\n\\n_______________________\\n\\nBesides European developers usually don\\'t aim as high and don\\'t always go for $ $ bill . Eg Notch selling Minecraft , arguably a fairly established \ '' world player\ '' .\\n\\nThen for example World of Tanks that proclaim to have 60 million users with 1,1 million players at the same time . They even passed World of Warcraft in terms of ingame item revenue . Yes WoT is based on only that as a f2p game but even the fact that a f2p game managed to one up the already paying WoW huge userbase speaks volumes.\\n\\nObviously we can\\'t miss Ubisoft that managed to luck out and create a uber successful 3-4 game hit studio that again as mentioned before rivals EA in terms of revenue estimates.\\n\\nAlterEnglishly the most successful Youtuber gamer is Pewdiepie who probably earns \ '' per capita\ '' the most , he is probably the most valuable gamer thus far . No actual running costs as any of the large firms have . ( Also hard to continue the brand once he puts gaming on hold but still , shows something ) \\n\\n____________\\n\\nSo to conclude I would say we simply don\\'t have a unified market enough to boost our own companies and have to by default appeal to mostly English speaking nations or Asian ones.\\n\\nSo the American companies kind of have a better starting hand and European companies have to work a little harder to appeal to firstly the large established American base , then the Asian world and Europeans , already having integrated to the common gaming base that is mostly influenced by American companies , tags along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Uralic,Estonian

As liquid is usually denser than gas you can ship quite a lot of it.\\n\\nAs for prices pipe is a lot cheaper as you only have to worry about building a pipeline and have some maintenance done now and again.\\n\\nThis illustrates the story even better . Russia charged Lithuania more for the pipe gas than the price Lithuania negotiated for LNG.\\n\\nObviously Russia dropped the price a little below the LNG price even when negotiations where going on but I am quite sure they would still be using the highest price if there was no LNG in Lithuania.\\n\\nSo Lithuania already won in the long run by getting LNG.\\n,Uralic,Estonian

All that happened is someone messaged me on Facebook that they found it on the street but I had already closed my card and got another one.\\n\\nThere is a common PIN/PUK security if someone manages to get your card , after they guess 3 time wrong they have to enter the PUK and if they get that wrong the card locks.\\n\\nDon\u00b4t know how easy would be to hack the chip itself but they do use 2 way ... whats the IT term , well basically a two way \ '' key\ '' with one part on the chip and the other part in government servers to verify each other so its harder to counterfeit as the keys wouldn\\'t be in the server.\\n\\nBut it is recommended to close the card immediately as it possibly could be used for ill intent . There are other security hurdles like constant updates for one , the software basically gives no time for people to hack it as it constantly has you downloading newer versions of it just for the sake of changing something.\\n\\nThe most believable security risks I read about so far is either : \\n\\na ) The software gets trojaned , zombied from my side , overtaken so my clicks become someone elses clicks.\\n\\nb ) The software gets trojaned from the government side where apparently one computer is the vote counter among other things.\\n\\nI\u00b4m not familiar with David Brins material but I guess it goes for the similar point of \ '' The more information we give to our government the more the government can control and monitors us or whoever gets access\ '' idea that people generally bring up.\\n\\nI would say currently this information isn\u00b4t important enough that the government has on us . Even if some more vivid scenarios of someone changing everyones bloodgroup would probably be tracked after checking change history or seeing how suddenly people started dying due to wrong tranfusions and that scenario would be doable without our system.\\n\\nThe system lets us see who checks up on us so if some cop logs in to check our information we know about it so low level foul play is taken care off . If the government itself is corrupt or some part of it then it is a general problem , I mean stealing millions/information on or offline is both ways bad.\\n___________________________\\n\\nSo in conclusion if you gave some specific questions I would be able to answer better , more honed in . Currently I just gave you an overall \ '' Uhhh ... .so far nuthin ! \ '' kind of response.\\n\\nI do feel that big foul play has a big enough smoke track that it would be seen .

Eestiball,europe,"There is a lot of discussion about it over and the only answer the public seems to know is : \ '' give us more money\ '' . I think that\\ 's wrong . Don\\'t get me wrong , Im not saying more money wouldn\\'t help raising kids , it certainly would . Just like it would help with anything else - Hell , I can\\'t think of a single aspect of my life that wouldn\\'t be improved if someone threw money at it but when it comes to children then there is just much more to it than just money . \\n\\nHow many of us can honestly say that they consider themselves to be at an age , in a good rock-solid relationship and are ready to be in it for the long haul but just don\\'t have the money to raise children ? Generations today simply aren\\'t wired like that . Many of us have shifted towards two separate extremes . The first simply find the idea of having a family unappealing , they might even be in a relationship and well off financially but would rather just extend their youth , travel and see the world rather than get bogged down with a couple of kids . For others the idea of a family has become extremely romanticized and idealized and finding such a perfect partner ( who would also reciprocate your feelings ) has become nearly impossible.\\n\\nAnd coming back to money . You don\\'t really need that much money to raise a kid but we think we do because our expectations have grown . If we drop the high expectations and the urge to appear to be better , raising your children suddenly becomes a lot cheaper : \\n\\nChildren\\ 's clothing is expensive ... only when you shop at the expensive stores , you can dress your child up for less than a tenner at your local second-hand store ( minus the shoes ) .\\n\\nSports practice , dancing and music lessons , hobbies etc are all expensive ... but your child doesn\\'t really need them . Here is a football , take it and go play with other children at the playground.\\n\\nUniversity tuition fees are exorbitant ... so don\\'t go there . Trade school and your child can start making money on his own right away.\\n\\nThat\\ 's how the previous - mostly working class - families did it , and that\\ 's how the population grew.\\n\\nThe society today almost demands us to be more successful than our parents and to demonstrate our success .

The most common way is they order a ton of stuff ( usually food that spoiles quickly ) and then when the trucks and trains are already at their border they suddenly find there something wrong with it or quickly change their regulations . Usually it\\ 's something super ridiculous like \ '' shoe soles of workers who process fish are too thin\ '' or they just hit you with a dictionary sized book of Russian regulations and you have to figure out which of their silly new regulations you fail to meet on your own . By that time of course the food spoils and the Estonian produces carries the loss . It\\ 's super annoying and has been a common practice for over a decade now . \\n\\nWhat\\ 's funny about it is virtually entire Estonian transit business is run and owned by ethnic Russians so they are mostly just screwing their own . Honestly they all can go fuck themselves but for the time being it will reflect on the national GDP a little .",Uralic,Estonian
