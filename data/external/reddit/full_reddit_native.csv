"Your points on the refugee convention are interesting and I thank you for that info . I would like to point out that throughout my comments I have not suggested that Australia simply opens its borders . I believe we do need to have a tough immigration policy because , yes , people do die at sea trying to come to Australia , and also , lets be honest , if we did let everyone in , many many many people would come because Australia is amazing ( most of the time ) . \\n\\nHowever , I think we can agree that the current conditions refugees are kept in are unacceptable , and the political language and policy used against refugees by BOTH major Australian parties is deplorable . For example , they are not referred to as \ '' asylum seekers\ '' or \ '' refugees\ '' , but as \ '' illegal maritime arrivals\ '' ... . My opinion is , we can do better . We can deter refugees while still allowing open and honest journalism , without major human rights organisations accusing the govt . of torture , without keeping children locked up and witness to and victims of abuse . \\n\\nThis situation goes back a long way , I don\\'t know if you know about the Children Overboard scandal , where the government lied and said refugees threw their own children into the ocean so that they would be rescued by the navy , and then used that lie to their own political gain.\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Overboard_affair\\nSo you\\ 'll have to excuse me if I don\\'t trust our government to treat these people with decency.\\n\\nThis is a very nuanced situation , and one that 100 % needs changing . \\nI\\ 've said it already , but its not black and white . It\\ 's not no refugees or all refugees , there is a middle ground that needs to be sought.\\n\\nI think at this point we will probably just keep going in circles , we obviously disagree , which is fine . Thanks for the interesting debate .",English,Native,,Native
"But you\\ 've still failed to provide a reason as to what benefit they would have from reporting torture . Not a hypothetical situation , any sources ? Anyone else suggesting the UN is telling lies ? I\\ 've given you a link in which the Prime Minister ( whose policy this is ) has even admitted to bad conditions . Now he hasn\\'t called it torture for obvious reasons , but if you can look at reports from the UN , Amnesty International etc and think \ '' oh it\\ 's just all politics\ '' then I don\\'t know what else to say .",English,Native,,Native
"Again , the report of torture comes from\\nthe UN . Not some Australian guy with family in Afghanistan who he wants to come and join him . THE UNITED NATIONS .",English,Native,,Native
"At what point did I say we should let the refugees who \ '' skip the queue\ '' in ? I didn\\'t . I simply said the way they are treated now is insane . Priority should be given to refugees in camps , and those who come by legal means ( but that\\ 's not to say those coming by boat may not be legitimate refugees ) . \\n\\nThe world is not black and white . It\\ 's not either- let them all in OR lock them up indefinitely . There is a middle ground , and that\\ 's where Australia\\ 's policy needs some serious changes . \\n\\nEDIT- I should also point out that out current system costs SO much money . More money is spent on asylum seekers held in offshore detention than it would cost to house them in Australia . Here are some articles : \\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-09/dunlop-accepting-refugees-makes-the-most-economic-sense/6761770\\n\\n ( an older article but interesting all the same ) http : //oppenheimer.mcgill.ca/A-Price-Too-High-the-cost-of ? lang=fr\\n\\nhttp : //www.amnesty.org.au/resources/activist/Handling_Objections_About_Asylum_Seekers.pdf\\n\\n^^^ this article in particular is a good read . \\n & gt ; But isn\u2019t offshore processing cost effective ? \\nThe Commission of Audit found that it costs more than $ 430,000 to detain an asylum seeker in offshore detention for a year ( or about $ 1200 per day ) . It is estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 a year to hold an asylum seeker in community detention and less than $ 50,000 to host them on a bridging visa . This means **offshore detention is more than eight times more expensive than onshore alternatives** , and asylum seeker policy costs , including offshore detention , are forecast to exceed $ 10bn over the course of the current government.\\n\\n",English,Native,,Native
"Again , my qualm with the policy is not that it doesn\\'t \ '' work\ '' ( debatable considering the cost etc ) but I suppose it comes down to whether or not you think breaking the UN convention on human rights is okay because it \ '' works\ '' . \\n\\nEdit to include a source : \\nhttp : //hrlc.org.au/un-finds-australias-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-violates-the-convention-against-torture/",English,Native,,Native

As i always say when this page is linked , I do not condone the actions of the British in India , however in your own linked article it goes on further to discuss ALL causes of the famine , not just it was the British\\ ' fault , but the inability of the national Indian government to implement coherent policy . \\n\\nFrom the Wiki Page : \\n\\n\ '' Whatever the cause of the famine , deaths could only be prevented by supplies of food from elsewhere in India . This was not forthcoming\ '' \\n\\n\ '' In 1942 , with the permission of the central government , trade barriers were introduced by the democratically elected Provincial governments . The politicians and civil servants of surplus provinces like the Punjab introduced regulations to prevent grain leaving their provinces for the famine areas of Bengal , Madras and Cochin . There was the desire to see that , first , local populations and , second , the populations of neighbouring provinces were well fed , partly to prevent civil unrest.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' even when the Government of India decreed that there should be free trade in grain , politicians , civil servants , local government officers and police obstructed the movement of grain to famine areas\ '' \\n\\n\ '' Eventually there was a clear threat by the Government of India to force the elected governments to provide grain , when the new Viceroy , Archibald Wavell , who was a successful general , was about to take office . For the first time substantial quantities of grain started to move to Bengal\ '' \\n\\nEven if the British were able to assist : \\n\\n\ '' Any imports would have had to come from Australia , North America or South America . Some supplies from Australia entered the region . The main constraint was shipping . The Battle of the Atlantic was at its peak from mid-1942 to mid-1943 , with submarine wolf packs sinking so many ships that the Allies were on the verge of defeat , so shipping could not be spared for India\ '' \\n\\nIt is worth remembering that at this time , Britain was at war with the Nazi\\ 's , their presence in Asia had been greatly reduced and India was largely in control of its affairs . As i said previously , some British policies helped contribute to the Famine , but it was not the only cause and people need to recognise this when they continue to link to this wiki page . \\n\\nAs i said , I am not condoning British actions , I just wish that when we discuss issues and provide evidence to back our claims , that we discuss all factors in the conversation .",English,Native,,Native

"The Famine of 1943 can not just be summed up in one nice little paragraph that says \ '' Britain Bad , India Suffer\ '' . \\n\\nThere are so many reasons for this famine not just that Churchill diverted grain for troops . You also need to look at this from a whole of India situation . \\n\\nCertain areas of India were not producing enough food to feed their populations and were reliant on imports of grains and rice from Burma ( also a british territory ) . \\n\\nWhen Burma fell to the Japanese , this import source was gone . \\n\\nIndian states had a large degree of self governance at this stage and rather than ensure that food was made available to Bengal etc by sending food from states with surplus as they had done in previous decades , they decided to implement price controls etc to try and solve the issue - something that had not previously been tried in India . These price controls meant that states that had surplus food were not willing to send this food to these provinces as farmers would make losses and profits may be released outside of their states . \\n\\nThe failure is the inability to get Indian States to work together for the good of the larger nation , rather than the recently democratic states within India - politicians in these states now felt the need to show that they were standing up for locals first . \\n\\nSo really , if this article was looking to tell a complete story it should expand these subsections . \\n\\nThe British had largely handed power over to the Indian Government and didn\\'t have their hands on their day to day \ '' levers\ '' of running India . \\n\\nI am not saying that this is not the responsibility of the British to fix , but I am sick and tired of the Bengal Famine being bought up as a prime example of how the British Empire failed and as such - should be considered 100 % horrible . Authors always actively ignore the circumstances and go with the revisionist narrative and ignore the fact that India had achieved a level of self governance at this stage sufficient to handle this issue themselves . \\n\\nIf this had happened in 1843 then it would have been 100 % Britain\\ 's mistake . In this case the issue was caused by an inefficient Indian Bureaucracy and an apathy and unwillingness of the British to step into the devolved power of the Indian Government .",English,Native,,Native

These arrangements seeks to use the sheer size of the american economy as a carrot to get countries to adopt american investment , safety , environmental , financial , copyright and trademark and IP laws . It seeks to give corporations the ability to sue countries who seek to pass laws that would damage their businesses . These agreements were originally explained as harmonising laws across regions , but as text has leaked out , they are not about taking best practice from across the world and sharing this knowledge , it is about ensuring that American Pharmaceuticals , Entertainment Industry , Industrials etc get rid of any foreign restrictions that limit them in raising prices etc . \\n\\nThe second point would have to be the Iraq war . I really don\\'t want to get into it to much , but 2 points must be covered . The first is Old Europe/New Europe ...

"Trigger Alert : S\u00f8nderjyde ( Synnejyde ) \\n\\nThe constitution of 1849 is the result of a new king Frederick VII coming to power after his father Christian VIII passed away . He was a more liberal king and agreed that Denmark should have a more liberal constitution similar to Norways and so ended the absolute power of the king of Denmark . \\n\\nNow this constitution is a great thing , but also helped break Denmark up further . Danes believed that the extra rights that the Constitution of 1849 should apply to all Danes ( Denmark Proper , Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg ) . Schlesvig Holstein and Lauenberg were in personal union with the Danish king , so not part of Denmark proper , but had large Danish populations , majorities in some areas , minorities in others . Based on the fact that Schlesvig was perceived to be majority Danish , the constitution intergrated Schlesvig into Denmark proper\\n\\nThe majority germans in Holstein and Lauenberg believed that schlesvig should be in union with them and so fought against the Danish king . Denmark won the first Schlesvig war in 1851 , but lost the second in 1864 , resulting in the loss of Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg , as well as the region of southern Denmark ( S\u00f8nderjylland , Synnejylland ) .\\n\\nSo the constitution was good , but indirectly led to the loss of 1/3 of Danish territory and 56 years in exile for my ancestors , who only returned to Denmark in 1920.\\n\\n",English,Native,,Native

"And back with sources . First of all , the literacy level in Syria , defined as \ '' *the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can , with understanding , read and write a short , simple statement on their everyday life . Generally , \u2018literacy\u2019 also encompasses \u2018numeracy\u2019 , the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations . *\ '' , [ Syria only has a literacy rate of 86 % in their own language ] ( http : //data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS ) , let alone useful foreign ones . Countries in the developed world don\\'t even bother tracking this statistic , but note countries like Azerbaijan have that at 100 % .\\n\\nSecondly , their tertiary education level , defined as ISCED 5 and 6 ( for reference , this standard includes [ both short cycle , practical focused education as well as Bachelor level courses ] ( http : //www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf ) ( see p. 48-54 ) , [ is at around 33 % ] ( http : //data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR ) . Note that this is enrollment , not completion . Compare the stats for OECD countries , it is night and day.\\n\\nAs noted in [ this EU report ] ( http : //eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/higher/syria.pdf ) at page 15 , the infrastructure for education is not great ( and I\\ 'm being generous ) and a large number of the enrolled students are totally unprepared for studies and drop out , which is an indicator that the graduation rate is substantially lower . It also notes that only c.4000 students are educated overseas each year , so it\\ 's not like there is a large cadre of Harvard grads slumming it in Damascus waiting to get out.\\n\\nStatistically are Syrian migrants likely to be better educated than Afghanis , Pakistanis and those from Africa ? The stats from the world bank say yes . But they\\ 're miles away from migrants coming to the EU from OECD countries , East Asia and even migrants from conflict zones in former Soviet bloc countries like Ukraine . Most of these migrants simply are not set up to succeed in Europe.\\n\\nNote all the sources are from the World Bank , UNESCO or the EU - I\\ 'm not citing fringe sources .",English,Native,,Native

What this means is that , whereas ( for example ) a Typhoon pilot either has to rely on the target data his computers or an ally has supplied , or to look down on his console to task a pod to zoom in on it , an F-35 pilot can target a contact in the same manner as the Typhoon pilot and the F-35 will automatically provide him with zoomed in TV / IR video footage , synthetic aperture radar scans , etc . \\n\\nIn providing CAS , this is an important distinction as it allows you to maintain flight attitude to keep your flying situational awareness , while allowing you to look through your jet to see exactly what is happening on the ground and to confirm or alter directions provided by ground forces.\\n\\nIn the air , it also means that if you wanted to , you could trigger a video portal showing stabilised video of an enemy fighter .

This also extends to things like electronic warfare , radar mapping , carrying certain types of bombs , the range that aircraft can fly , etc.\\n\\n3 . If ( eg ) a British jet has an uncommon part break while at an airfield in Iraq , the British commander can talk to an American or Norwegian or Australian commander and request a spare part from their inventory , allowing them to fix a plane in hours instead of days , while the governments work out a transfer of funds later.\\n\\n",English,Native,,Native

The only thing Russia could do is defend what they have for some time , but when their sam sites are taken out ( probably by cruise missile ) even that would be though.\\n\\nEU would not attack Russia , they simply don\\'t have the forces in position to do such a thing , Russia does have forces in position to attack the EU.\\n\\nYou would not use cruise missiles for fear of Russia using theirs against the EU , of which they have an huge advantage in numbers.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; This is not even taking into account the large number of f-35\\ 's already ordered . Airsuperiority would also make any strategic bombers of Russia totally useless . Strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority , like the US in Afghanistan or Iraq.\\n\\nAgain with the mythical unit , the EU does NOT have the F-35 and Russia is also bring the PAK-FA online at the same time , so their is no advantage to be had here , merely status quo , plus , most EU nations aren\\'t using the F-35.\\n\\n & gt ; Strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority , like the US in Afghanistan or Iraq.\\n\\nThat\\ 's not how strategic bombers are designed to work , especially the TU-160 , do you know anything about military equipment at all ? the TU-160 would fly north into the Arctic then curves around and strikes from the Norwegian sea with stand-off cruise missiles.\\n\\n & gt ; *Lt.

"Your attitude , and the people who share it , are the # 1 reason why our economies keep failing to choose the correct economic policies . What you think is cruel , wrong , and utterly , utterly , utterly stupid.\\n\\nTell me , how are children born into poor families are going to be able to compete in an economy when they grow up ? When their parents are struggling to feed , clothe , educate , and keep them healthy enough to actually have a chance ? \\n\\n\ '' Oh\ '' , you say , \ '' maybe they should have thought of that before they had children.\ '' \\n\\nWell , maybe they should have . But what now ? The kids are sitting there in front of you , and they\\ 're not going to become doctors , lawyers or engineers unless *someone* bloody well makes sure they do not grow up in poverty.\\n\\n\ '' Well\ '' , you say , \ '' that\\ 's their problem.\ '' \\n\\nIt certainly is . But it also represents an *opportunity cost* for the whole economy . How are you supposed to run a sophisticated , productive , first-world nation , where talented employees are available to fill the increasingly sophisticated jobs , if a huge chunk of your population grew up in poverty , because some thoughtless cad 20 years ago decided that \ '' rewarding\ '' people on welfare was just a little too much to stomach ? \\n\\nThe fact is this : Policies that ensure that the poorest people in the nation are fed , clothed , housed , educated , and kept healthy , as well as given realistic paths to further education and employment have a **positive return on investment** for a nation . This is a **good investment**.\\n\\nIf you are *still* silly enough to interpret this as a \ '' reward\ '' , you are also forgetting the counterfactual : If you took away welfare and redistribution , there would be a **massive** cost you\\ 'd have to pay . That cost is the money you spend on security guards , 12-foot concrete fences with broken glass on top , getting your car stolen , getting pick-pocketed , blah blah blah ... If you\\ 've ever been to a country without a welfare state , you\\ 'd know what it looks like . Not as pretty as the countries that have welfare states .

[ And then some . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt ) \\n\\nTax money goes straight back to the people in a way that is ( ideally ) economically , socially and environmentally productive . Hoarded private wealth would *rarely* be invested in a way that was much better at this , btw.\\n\\nHoarded wealth ( if it\\ 's not spent on building pointless monuments and luxuries ) will mostly go into investments designed to get the best return/risk profile . You can absolutely guarantee that it will *not* be invested in the most efficient way from a social , environmental , sustainable , or long-term point-of-view.\\n\\nThis ROI maximisation is not the same as overall value maximisation . It\\ 's therefore distortive , and thank god we\\ 've got a second mechanism - government - which counters some of this distortion.\\n\\nBut of course - this cuts both ways . If we had a purely centrally-planned economy , I would be arguing in favour of markets to reduce the distortion of a wholly-government run economy.\\n\\ntl ; dr - Mixed economies work .",English,Native,,Native

"I just want to point something out that our American friends sometimes forget : *Absolute* freedom of speech is *not actually a good thing* . \\n\\nFreedom of speech is *generally* , most of the time , under normal circumstances , a wonderful thing . Yay , let\\ 's all be free to say what we want ! We definitely want to be standing on the *freedom* end of the spectrum . The other end of the spectrum ( like North Korea ) is not a pretty place . Not at all.\\n\\nAnyone from a developed country would agree with this . Freedom is mostly a great thing.\\n\\n***BUT*** be very , very , *very* careful when you decide to do something *absolutely* , with no exceptions.\\n\\nWhen you push this idea of \ '' freedom\ '' of speech *to the extreme* , you start to get some very , very nasty problems pop up . \\n\\nSome examples : \\n\\n - Alice copies Bob\\ 's work , and sells it as if it were hers . ( copyright ) \\n - Bob claims Charlie is a child molester . ( defamation , slander ) \\n - Charlie sells Dianne fake artwork claiming it as original ( counterfeiting ) \\n - Diane runs a business and knowingly misleads her customer , Ernie . ( trade practices ) \\n - Ernie hates a minority group , and organises anti-minority rallies against them . ( hate speech , incitement ) \\n\\nIf we have *absolute* freedom of speech , you can never solve these problems . Ever . People can cheat , lie , and slander , and incite with absolute impunity . *Absolute* freedom means that there are *no ( legal ) consequences* . Because if you\\ 're free to do anything , then the law has nothing to say.\\n\\nSo there are *always* going to be a class of situations where what you say ( or do ) *MUST* carry consequences.\\n\\nThat means we will never ( regardless of what country we\\ 're in ) , have *absolute* freedom of speech . Our speech will be limited in some way or form regardless . And that\\ 's both a necessary and a *good* thing.\\n\\nSo what we\\ 're *really* talking about here is *where* do we draw the line of freedom of speech ? \\n\\nAt the moment , America is *pretending* that freedom of speech is absolute . It\\ 's not . That\\ 's a delusion . ( Try making a bomb joke at an airport . ) \\n\\nOther developed countries don\\'t bother pretending , but instead are honest about where the limit is . There\\ 's a limit , there\\ 's got to be a limit , so let\\ 's talk about it like adults.\\n\\nSo forget about \ '' freedom of speech\ '' . Let\\ 's talk instead about the limits of speech . Where are they ? Where should they be ? What\\ 's okay ? What\\ 's not okay ? \\n\\n\\nThe one thing Americans need to do is just understand that \ '' freedom of speech\ '' isn\\'t a universal , god-given , flawless principle .

On the other hand , if it\\ 's state-run , and something unforseen comes up , then they\\ 'll just adapt and fix it.\\n\\nWe had a practical example of this where I live , where the train system was quasi-privatised ( it\\ 's owned by the state , but run by a private company through long-term contracts ) ...

This isn\\'t about some \ '' offensive\ '' affront to one\\ 's delicate sensibilities , this is much more serious than that.\\n\\nThat\\ 's why your use of the following is rubbish : \\n\\n - the right to not be offended\\n - politically correct crowd\\n - \ '' being offended\ '' appears to be a new pastime\\n - some segments ( ah , the good old \ '' some people\ '' trope ) \\n\\nThis is all nonsense .

"Interesting research by Mr. Tenenbom . What\\ 's clear to us from the headlines and broadcasts are people\\ 's ( particularly Europeans\\ ' ) manifested reactions to other races , but never the depths of the psyche where the root of a problem can be truly found . Conscious reasoning often takes you nowhere with a racist.\\n\\nHis \ '' eight in ten\ '' statistic was alarming for me , until I read what it was based on : \\n\\n & gt ; Tenenbom defines anti-Semitism as a belief that Jews hold vast power relative to their numbers , that they are obsessed with money and that Israel is solely or overwhelmingly responsible for the conflict with the Palestinians . \\n\\nI don\\'t know whether to be disappointed or relieved , but his results are definitely exaggerated because the definition was objectively *wrong* . \\n\\nAnti-Semitism is a serious phrase and should not be tossed around lightly , in Germany of all places . It encompasses simple , dumb hatred . Not the observation that relative to their numbers , the Jewish people are pretty high-achieving , due to historical and socio-economic factors that would take another wall of text to discuss . And in contrast with such a troubled past ! Like every Jewish person I\\ 've befriended or met , I\\ 'm sure Mr. Tenenbom would happily , at least humbly acknowledge this . Why get upset when others notice and automatically assume a case of tall poppy syndrome , when many other cultures are snidely frowned upon for being \ '' ignorant\ '' or \ '' uncivilized\ '' ? That perspective in Europe poses a much larger threat at the moment . It\\ 's a source of my relief that the findings aren\\'t entirely correct , since the only clear criteria for anti-Semitism would be the second , which brings me to the main point : \\n\\nI am frustrated as always to see people who support the Palestinian cause instantly branded as \ '' anti-Semetic\ '' or \ '' self-hating Jews\ '' ( self-hating , honestly ? ridiculous ) . There are many humanitarian motives for condemning Israeli policy , and if you disagree with that , by all means discuss it - just don\\'t resort to strawman labels . We could do without that narrow dichotomy of thinking.\\n\\nIn fact I would go even further to argue that many are inclined to support Israel do so out of a far uglier subconscious bigotry , one cultivated by selective journalism which presents the Arab people as angry but fails to reveal why , shows men rallying in the streets without the wives and children they aim to protect , reports killings by Arabs rather than the killings of Arabs , which are *unimaginably* greater in number.\\n\\nThe truest irony of all shines through when people like myself try to point out the ethnocentrism of Israel , and its failure to provide equal rights - and are called racist for it . \\n\\n**TL : DR** : Biased findings , sensationalist article , and the continued abuse of a once solemn , meaningful phrase .",English,Native,,Native

The country itself may need enough space to accommodate a significant amount of people . So maybe 100 million ? There are three places in the world that might fit the bill - **Outback Australia , Siberia and the Western Sahara . **\\n\\nThe location of the new country can only work if the current owners agree to it , obviously.\\n\\nOnce a location has been determined , the next thing to do would be to create some sort of legal framework . It is not necessary for the new country to be a straight democracy at first because , obviously , no one lives there . A move towards a Democracy would occur over time , but at first the country would exist as a United Nations protectorate . Member countries of the UN would provide law enforcement , legal officials as well as medical experts.\\n\\nThe next thing to do would be to design a city . Considering the locale , food production is probably out of the question so the city would essentially be a city-state , capable of housing 100 million people.\\n\\nOnce a city has been designed and the capital secured , refugees ( and anyone else who wants to go there ) are allowed in and are put to work building the new city . Associated industries are also set up with private investment in small businesses that begin to employ refugees who are not suited to the heavy labour of city building.\\n\\nAs this continues , note that there will be laws set up to prevent the sort of abuses that went on in rich Middle Eastern cities . Allowing the workers some level of profit sharing in the building of the city will allow money to flow more freely to the bottom rather than simply at the rich investors . There will be a universal health care system and free school education for children.\\n\\nAs time goes by , the city would become a manufacturing hub for the world . Like Japan , raw materials would go in and industrial goods would go out . The location of city - in a desolate place - precludes any ( or much ) mining of natural resources and the only thing \ '' going for it\ '' economically will be that people live there and are willing to work.\\n\\nAfter much time has gone by - say ten or more years - democratic and constitutional changes are undertaken to allow self-determination.\\n\\n**YES THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS AND NO IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT** , but the inability to create a completely perfect and efficient alternative to the current problem should not be the reason to reject many of its good points .",English,Native,,Native

"I was waiting for someone to say that.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not Germany\\ 's trade surplus/mercantilism that makes them a successful economy . The principles of Germany\\ 's economic success can be applied to a nation which has a trade deficit . Applying German principles won\\'t turn that country into an exporter.\\n\\nI think it is far too simplistic to assume that \ '' Germany is successful because it\\ 's a great manufacturer and exporter\ '' .\\n\\nGermany has some very good labor market regulations . Unions and Employers work together to seek the common good . Unions recognise the need for Employers to make a profit , Employers recognise the need for workers to have good wage and working conditions . It\\ 's not perfect but it is a better system than anywhere else in the world.\\n\\nApply this to a country that has a trade deficit . The economy is based more on consumption than production , so people are employed more by the service and retail sector . So instead of unions and employers making agreements that apply to factories and steelworks , you have unions and workers making agreements that apply to cafes , restaurants , discount stores and supermarkets.\\n\\nGerman businesses are also often privately owned by families spanning many generations , as opposed to ownership being publicly purchased and traded on the sharemarket . What matters to German business owners is not the share price , but revenue.\\n\\nGermany also has a smaller property market . Many Germans live in long term rental accommodation . The property bubble which blew up the rest of Europe was not present in Germany in the same way . Had Europe kept their property market sustainable ( like Germany ) they would be better off.\\n\\nThe German government was more fiscally responsible , with tax revenue being sourced from a broad base . The governments of Ireland and Spain , for example , were not so responsible . They ran surpluses for a while , yes , but much of this excess tax revenue was sourced from the property bubble . When that popped , these governments went into deep deficit.\\n\\nOff the top of my head , those are Germany\\ 's main advantages , and none of them are based upon mercantilism .",English,Native,,Native

This has had the effect of reducing the value of the Euro as a whole , but there is also a lot of inter-euro bond trading going on - investors are dumping Greek Euro bonds and buying up German and French Euro bonds.\\n\\nI\\ 'm someone who supports the concept of a monetary union and the Eurozone is a very interesting experiment . This crisis will certainly test the bounds of people\\ 's assumptions ( from both Euro supporters and Euro skeptics ) .\\n\\nThe advantage that Greece has over , say , Iceland , is that this capital flight away from Greece has not resulted in a plummeting currency and the inflation that it brings . Those in Greece who have been responsible and paid off debt and saved would usually be punished unjustly in a currency crash ( the value of their savings drops in relation to the rest of the world ) , but this time around they have retained their savings.\\n\\nIn many ways Greece\\ 's economic woes have been transferred onto the Eurozone as a whole , allowing the larger economies of France and Germany to help dampen the market unhappiness with Greece.\\n\\nUltimately Greece\\ 's economic future is linked with the success of the entire Eurozone : the recovery of France and Germany and other main Eurozone players will act to bring Greece out of its woes ... eventually .",English,Native,,Native

Cut public spending , which means less money for schools and hospitals , but also any bloated bureaucracies.\\n\\nb .

"I live in Australia but this argument is still the same.\\n\\nThere are multiple factors which have led to the US being high in gun violence - not just the occasional mass shooting but the common one-on-one murders that occur every day and which hardly ever get reported.\\n\\nOne factor is the lack of a welfare net . We in other western countries choose to pay our poor and unemployed more money and give them more generous benefits overall . We also have universal health care . The US has very little of these benefits . Turning to a life of crime is seen as a legitimate career opportunity for many . Moreover , people are expected to \ '' look after themselves\ '' so much that the potential for failure is huge . This puts a great amount of psychological pressure upon people . I\\ 'm confident that an expansion in the welfare system in the US to be at European levels will result in less crime overall , and thus less gun crime overall.\\n\\nBut then there is also the issue of gun availability . The US has the highest level of guns per capita in the western world . They also have the highest levels of gun crime in the western world . This is one of those cases where correlation does equal causation.\\n\\nMost gun crime is committed by those who have illegal weapons , but where did these illegal weapons come from ? There aren\\'t illegal gun factories operating in third world countries that are shipping their products to the US . Most of America\\ 's guns are made legally and made in America . How did these legal firearms end up in the hands of criminals and becoming illegal ? There is obviously a HUGE movement of guns and firearms from the LEGAL gun owning community to the ILLEGAL gun owning community . Thus restricting legal firearms will lead to a drop in the amount of illegal firearms .",English,Native,,Native
"I\\ 'm finding it difficult to understand the logic you\\ 're using here . You\\ 're saying that because inflation isn\\'t predictable - but rather unpredictable - then it is good to reduce risk.\\n\\nI agree with you here 100 % What I\\ 'm finding difficult to understand is that you think that \ '' Zeroflation\ '' is \ '' unpredictable\ '' .\\n\\nIn the end what I\\ 'm talking about here is \ '' Price Stability\ '' . The reason why I believe in \ '' Zeroflation\ '' is because of the following.\\n\\n* Inflation is the reduction of money\\ 's purchasing power . The higher inflation gets , the less purchasing power a person or business has . Money is supposed to be a store of value so if money keeps losing its value it also begins to lose its usefulness . If inflation then moves into hyperinflation , you then have a system in which money ceases to have value and is no longer used for economic activity . A barter system then emerges.\\n\\n* Deflation , however , is an increase in money\\ 's purchasing power . The more deflation there is , the more value a person\\ 's cash and bank deposits are . But this is also not a good thing because if money keeps getting more and more valuable , people will cease to use it to invest in capital and instead keep it under their beds . The use of money as a method of exchange then drops considerably . As deflation gets worse , so too will a barter system emerge.\\n\\nSo the problem is this : when prices are unstable and when a person\\ 's money changes in value considerably ( either as a loss of value with inflation or as an increase in value with deflation ) , then the inevitable result is a breakdown of the monetary system and a return to the more inefficient barter system of pre-civilised times.\\n\\nSo armed with these two different but similar facts ( or axioms if you like ) , there is obviously a median between the two , whereby money is used in its most efficient way . Inflation leads to an imbalance , as does deflation.\\n\\nSo what is the best median between the two ? I would argue that it is *Absolute Price Stability* , where money neither goes up or goes down in value . Such a situation makes for a stable economic environment ( all things being equal of course ) .\\n\\nIn practice there is no doubting that a policy of absolute price stability would not succeed in having prices remain stable every single day , month , quarter or year . That is actually not a problem . The issue is whether prices remain stable over the long term . There can certainly be short term price hikes or price drops , but over a period of a few years , monetary policy should focus upon keeping the index stable ( If the index is at 100 in year one , and is 100 in year three , that\\ 's good policy ) .\\n\\nI won\\'t address the issue of high European Wages as I honestly think that\\ 's a Furphy argued by Eurosceptics that has been influential for too many years.\\n\\nA tax on European financial transactions , a Tobin Tax , is the best solution in this situation.\\n\\nAnd why not use inflation to reduce debt ? Probably because that is what many countries have done in the past to their own detriment . Many countries in South America , for example , had very high inflation levels throughout the 80s and 90s as they sought to inflate away their debt . They\\ 're only now recovering - and mainly because they have sought to keep prices stable instead.\\n\\nGermany after WW2 is another example . In the years following WW2 the West German government was hampered by US economic controls and experienced very high levels of inflation . Living standards dropped considerably from the time the US took control of the West German economy . When the US gave up and let the West Germans control the economy themselves , the first thing they did was enact policies to reduce inflation . Once the money ( the Deutschmark ) reliably retained a store of value , the economy began growing again . Within 20 years they were the richest country in Europe.\\n\\nAnd what about the US during the 70s ? It wasn\\'t Reagan , but Paul Volcker who saved the US economy . How ? By killing off inflation.\\n\\n ( BTW , don\\'t somehow think that Zeroflation is equivalent to zero money growth . It isn\\'t . The money supply can still be growing during a period of deflation . It is also possible for the money supply to be shrinking during a period of inflation . The money supply is an important factor in inflation , but not the only one )",English,Native,,Native
"Well the UK can leave the EU if it wants to but remember that the financial sector is what got the world into the mess its in , and the UK has a bigger financial sector than most.\\n\\nAs for zero economic activity due to inflation I would like you to consider the fact that there are plenty of examples of economic growth in deflationary periods , not to mention economic decline in inflationary periods . My feeling is that the best long term potential for economic growth can be partly met by having \ '' zeroflation\ '' .",English,Native,,Native

It\\ 's still bad in Europe , but there are a number of really important things that people ( esp English speaking pundits ) seem to ignore.\\n\\nAs regards to Budget deficits and Government debt , the EU and Eurozone have smaller budget deficits than the US ( about -4 % of GDP compared to around -8 % of GDP in the US ) and a **smaller** amount of government debt . This may confuse people so let me explain : \\n\\nCertain countries in Europe ( eg Greece ) have huge levels of government debt while other countries do not . One of the problems with comparing Europe to the US is that both areas have different ways of comparing debt . When we hear that the US government has debt of 65 % of GDP , that does not include debt accrued by state and local governments . In Europe , however , the debt figures that are reported DO include this debt . When you add US state and local government debt to the federal figure , it ends up being equal to if not more than that of Europe . [ I blog about this here ] ( http : //one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2010/05/busting-myth-of-european-debt.html ) \\n\\nAnother important fiscal statistic is tax revenue . Although some countries in the EU are famous for their inability to collect tax , overall EU/Eurozone governments have maintained a reasonable revenue base throughout the recent crisis . By contrast US tax revenue has plummeted . This means that the US needs to grow more and grow faster just in order to maintain its public spending than the EU/Eurozone will . Again I blog about it [ here ] ( http : //one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2011/08/us-government-needs-more-revenue.html ) .\\n\\nAnd finally we shouldn\\'t forget Germany . Germany really is the engine of European growth and its economy has performed stunningly well throughout the crisis . Germany\\ 's growth is linked to the EU/Eurozone as a whole . So when we weep and wail over places like Greece and Ireland , just remember that these countries need a strong and resilient Germany demanding their goods and services in order to recover.\\n\\nAnd finally look at politics in the EU . No politics is ever \ '' good\ '' , but apart from the radical fringe groups there is no popular political party in any country that is anything near the radicalism of the US Tea Party and Republican party generally . There\\ 's no one in Europe yelling \ '' Communist\ '' at those who support universal health care or generous welfare spending or public education.\\n\\nLong term , Europe has it made .

Because it was a kangaroo court.\\n\\nHow in the hell is it a eurocentric concept ?

The point being made is that you either stand for the principals of democracy or you don\\'t .

"& gt ; He couldn\\'t be the epitome of Free Secular Western Capitalism which defeated the fascists , because that would go against your narrative , right ? \\n\\nNice narrative , but I really wish people would stop pretending that it was the USA who defeated Nazi Germany . The Soviet Union was a much bigger factor in defeating the \ '' fascists\ '' than the USA . That\\ 's not me defending one ideology over the other , it\\ 's me stating a simple fact . By the time the Normandy landings came around , it was already clear that the Third Reich were going to lose the war because they\\ 'd already suffered crippling losses to the Soviets in the east ( Stalingrad and Kursk to name the two biggest ) . The only thing that wasn\\'t clear was how long it was going to take to defeat them and how many were going to die until that point was reached.\\n\\nThe Soviets wanted the western allies to open a western front from pretty much the moment Hitler invaded them . They\\ 'd been fighting the Axis since 1941 and the USA didn\\'t actually join the war in Europe until 1944 at Normandy.\\n\\nOf course , there\\ 's more to it than this - but it\\ 's far too simplistic to say that it was \ '' Free Secular Western Capitalism\ '' that defeated fascism , because that\\ 's patently untrue . The Soviet Union was a communist regime and they contributed as much , if not more , to the defeat of fascism than their western allies did .",English,Native,,Native

"The short answer is \ '' Why *not* let gay people get married . Sure , you could make the argument that no kids will actually come from it , but the same could be said of elderly or infertile couples , and you don\\'t see anyone saying \ '' *Well* , do they really *need* the right to vote ? \ '' .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; 1 ) You\\ 're presuming that gay people want to get married though . I\\ 'm unsure why gay people would want to get married anymore than straight people , and the latter have been increasingly looking down on marriage - especially the youth.\\n\\nAlready answered \ '' Tax credits , adoption rights , inheritance , next of kin , visitation rights , etc.\ '' \\n\\n & gt ; 2 ) civil unions and cohabitation are valid forms of marriage that don\\'t require the government to tell religions what to do ; the majority of Hindu/Buddhist Asia has split the idea of marriage and legal-marriage.\\n\\nRight , again , you can make a perfectly valid argument against the government being involved in marriage at all , but until the day when that gets resolved , do you propose just leaving out gay people altogether ? Also , do you acknowledge that cohabitation is less than marriage ? \\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) You\\ 're presuming that government has a right to say what a church can do . The definition of marriage can vary from organisation to organisation . If a priest doesn\\'t want to marry a homosexual couple , then why should he be forced to ? \\n\\nWhere ? Where did I do this ? Show me.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying a priest should be forced to do anything . I\\ 'm saying if the priest is *also* willing , where is the problem ? \\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) And you\\ 're focusing on Christianity . I presume that you don\\'t think marriage is backwards and that Christianity is an integral aspect of European culture . In that case , it\\ 's not a gay right , but rather an issue for Christians.\\n\\nI\\ 'm focusing on Christianity because Ireland is predominantly Christian , and the Catholic Church has historically had a significant presence in the laws of this country .

There are many differences between the two . That is not up for debate . \\n\\nHere\\ 's a sample \\n\\n & gt ; And yet some very important inequalities remain . For example , Civil Partnership : \\n\\n - does not permit children to have a legally recognised relationship with their parents - only the biological one . This causes all sorts of practical problems for hundreds of families with schools and hospitals as well as around guardianship , access and custody . In the worst case , it could mean that a child is taken away from a parent and put into care on the death of the biological parent.\\n\\n - does not recognise same sex couples\\ ' rights to many social supports that may be needed in hardship situations and may literally leave a loved one out in the cold.\\n\\n - defines the home of civil partners as a \ '' shared home\ '' , rather than a \ '' family home\ '' , as is the case for married couples .

"He\\ 's far from a fully-fledged fascist , but he certainly [ flirts with the concept ] ( http : //www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htmhttp : //www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm ) to say the least.\\n\\n & gt ; \\nDr . Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Germany ) , Mussolini ( Italy ) , Franco ( Spain ) , Suharto ( Indonesia ) and several Latin American regimes . Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each : \\n\\n & gt ; **1 . Powerful and Continuing Nationalism** - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . Flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\\n\\n & gt ; **2 . Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \ '' need.\ '' The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc.\\n\\n & gt ; **3 . Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists , terrorists , etc.\\n \\n & gt ; **4 . Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\\n\\n & gt ; **5 . Rampant Sexism** - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid . Divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\\n\\n & gt ; **6 . Controlled Mass Media** - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . Censorship , especially in war time , is very common.\\n\\n & gt ; **7 . Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\\n8 . Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed\\nto the government\\ 's policies or actions.\\n\\n & gt ; **9 . Corporate Power is Protected** - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\\n\\n & gt ; **10 . Labor Power is Suppressed** - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed.\\n\\n & gt ; **11 . Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested . Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\\n\\n & gt ; **12 . Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\\n\\n & gt ; **13 . Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; **14 . Fraudulent Elections** - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham . Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates , use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and manipulation of the media . Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections .",English,Native,,Native

"Paywall , text : \\n\\n & gt ; European leaders are preparing to recognise the potential for a united Ireland\u201d within the EU , confirming that Northern Ireland would seamlessly rejoin the bloc after Brexit in the event of a vote for Irish reunification . In a step that may stoke concerns in Britain that Brexit could hasten the fragmentation of the UK , diplomats are planning to ask leaders of the EU\u2019s 27 post-Brexit member countries to endorse the idea in a summit on Saturday . It would allow the province to follow the example of German reunification in 1990 and reflect the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , which ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland . The agreement allows a referendum on reuniting Ireland where there is reason to believe a majority in the province is in favour.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Britain and Ireland are committed to upholding the Good Friday Agreement as co-guarantors . But the increased talk of Irish reunification will reinforce the fears of those in Britain who believe & gt ; Brexit will bolster those championing a UK break-up . Nicola Sturgeon , Scotland\u2019s first minister , has already called for a Scottish independence referendum within two years , as Britain\u2019s departure from the union is finalised . Saturday\u2019s gathering in Brussels will mark the formal adoption of EU guidelines for Brexit talks with the UK , staking out a tough opening stance with a common front on issues such as Gibraltar , ? & gt ; Northern Ireland and the rights of EU migrants.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Britain on Thursday not to harbour illusions about the bloc\u2019s resolve . \u201cI have to put it in such clear terms because unfortunately I have the feeling that some in Britain still have illusions , \u201d Ms Merkel told the Bundestag . \u201cBut that would be a waste of time.\u201d No final decision has been taken on a specific text on Irish unity . It would be part of accompanying documents to the guidelines for Saturday\u2019s summit , because it is seen as a clarification of law rather than something to be negotiated in Europe\u2019s talks with Britain.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Officials warned that a reference to the idea could still be excluded because of the acute sensitivity around independence questions in Scotland and Catalonia in Spain . EU27 ambassadors were first told of the plan at a meeting on Wednesday but Donald Tusk , European Council president , has yet to share a text , which was suggested by Dublin . Enda Kenny has pushed for a \u201cunited Ireland\u201d reference in the final Brexit treaty that will confirm the UK\u2019s exit , but an EU statement at the outset of talks would be seen as a diplomatic coup as he prepares to step down as taoiseach \u2014 prime minister \u2014 after six years . Advocates of the reference to Northern Ireland and reunification say the reference simply reflects the Good Friday pact , signed long before Brexit was anticipated . But it would still send a powerful signal at a sensitive moment in the politics of the island.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Under pressure to hand power to a younger generation , Mr Kenny has said he will make his intentions for his political future clear once the \u201cground rules for Brexit\u201d are set . This has fuelled expectations that he will step down within weeks , setting in motion a contest for the leadership of his centre-right Fine Gael party . Ireland is the most exposed of the EU\u2019s remaining member states to Brexit . Dublin is desperate to avoid a clean break between the UK and the EU , which could severely damage Irish-British trade that runs to \u20ac1.2bn a week . But it also wants to be seen to play a full part in the negotiations on the EU side . \u201cWe will not be a proxy for the British in the exit negotiations , \u201d Irish foreign minister Charlie Flanagan told the Financial Times in an interview .",English,Native,,Native

He\\ 's a frog hopping and croaking in the breeze with regards to how much hurt he can actually bring to western values , but he creates enough noise that he seems bigger than he is .

"\ '' Another source of revenue in Tonga has been the sale of Tongan passports .

For $ 10,000 , someone who was otherwise stateless could become a Tongan Protected Person ( T.P.P . ) and carry a Tonga passport , which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except Tonga , where a T.P.P . was forbidden to settle.\\n\\nWhen some countries rejected the validity of these passports , the King was informed and a new Tongan passport went on sale for $ 20,000 ( or $ 35,000 for a family of four ) . This gave the holder Tongan nationality and a right to settle . South Africans and Libyans as well as hundreds of Hong Kong Chinese were quick to snap up these passports . Imelda Marcos bought one , and in the process became a Tongan citizen . In the past seven years this has produced $ 30 million for Tonga as well as a constitutional crisis .

"Contrary to your assumption , most people know about the Islamic Golden age and the sack of Baghdad by the Mongols . However , the point is that Islamic societies as a scientific and cultural force never recovered after that . The Ottomans became the core Political power in the political power in the islamic world and the seat of the caliphate , in which scholasticism and scientific pursuits regressed in comparison to Europe . \\n\\nAnd yet the Golden Age did not promote secularism or other humanistic values , nor did it discourage the practice of taxing dhimmi and treating their non muslim population disproportionately worse . It was not an equal society . My point was that Religious freedom in Europe was a twofold process - The Reformation provided an alternative to Catholicism , and The Enlightenment and the secular principles it generated for governing the realms allowed the expression of differing ideas and religious practices . Any secularism that exists in Islamic nations today , exists through European occupation or influence . The muslim world did not have an autogenic reform like in Europe . \\n\\nNo , you\\ 're right on this point . The Ottomans were no worse than many other empires . However this doesn\\'t excuse the suffering that the population of Balkan nations underwent . Today , Turkey not only ignores ethnic cleansing of three ethnic groups , but also is hostile to their former colonial subjects like the Greeks . Europeans have long apologized for the faults of their colonial endeavours , but because of Caliphatism and nationalism , it seems muslim turks aren\\'t going to apologize for forcing their faith on christian communities . \\n\\nAnd yet you\\ 're not disputing the fact that it was only under the oppression of the Ottoman Empire that caused Europeans to convert to Islam . There was no history of Islam in France , Italy , Germany , Scandinavia , Britain or a majority of other European countries before Colonialism . We willingly imported islam to our countries , the same can not be said about islam to the Balkan nations.\\n\\nI have no hostility to immigrants , so long as they adapt to the culture of their host countries and arrive in them by legal means . This is expected of migrants in every country , except it seems for Europe . Stereotyping my disregard for Islam as \ '' Evil Brown People\ '' is a character accusation with zero grounding . Why can you not divorce the fact that islam is not tied to one ethnicity , and critique the faults of the religion based on its merits , like you can with any other ideology . Christianity has more African and South American followers as it does Europeans , but I doubt you would call it a religion of \ '' Brown People\ '' . The fact is that is that these migrants are coming to Europe illegally , they have little to zero education , and they hold attitudes and a religion that is fundamentally hostile to the west .",English,Native,,Native

"Contents Posted Below as behind a Paywall . \\n\\n & gt ; **EUROPE SIGNS ITS OWN DEATH WARRANT**\\n\\n & gt ; **With the continent wrestling with mass immigration and losing faith in its traditions and beliefs , its civilisation faces collapse**\\n\\n & gt ; Europe is committing suicide . Or at least its leaders have decided to commit suicide . Whether the European people choose to go along with this is , naturally , another matter . When I say that Europe is in the process of killing itself , I do not mean that the burden of European Commission regulation has become overbearing or that the European Convention on Human Rights has not done enough to satisfy the demands of a particular community.\\n\\n & gt ; I mean that the civilisation we know as Europe is in the process of committing suicide and that neither Britain nor any other western European country can avoid that fate , because we all appear to suffer from the same symptoms and maladies.\\n\\n & gt ; As a result , by the end of the lifespans of most people currently alive , Europe will not be Europe and the peoples of Europe will have lost the only place in the world we had to call home.\\n\\n & gt ; Europe today has little desire to reproduce itself , fight for itself or even take its own side in an argument . Those in power seem persuaded that it would not matter if the people and culture of Europe were lost to the world.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no single cause of the present sickness . The culture produced by the tributaries of Judaeo-Christian culture , the ancient Greeks and Romans , and the discoveries of the Enlightenment has not been levelled by nothing . But the final act has come about because of two simultaneous concatenations \u2014 sets of linked events \u2014 from which it is now all but impossible to recover.\\n\\n & gt ; The first is the mass movement of peoples into Europe . In all western European countries this process began after the Second World War due to labour shortages . Soon Europe got hooked on the migration and could not stop the flow even if it had wanted to.\\n\\n & gt ; The result was that what had been Europe \u2014 the home of the European peoples \u2014 gradually became a home for the entire world . The places that had been European gradually became somewhere else.\\n\\n & gt ; All the time Europeans found ways to pretend this influx could work . By pretending , for instance , that such immigration was normal . Or that if integration did not happen with the first generation then it might happen with their children , grandchildren or another generation yet to come . Or that it didn\u2019t matter whether people integrated or not.\\n\\n & gt ; All the time we waved away the greater likelihood that it just wouldn\u2019t work . This is a conclusion that the migration crisis of recent years has simply accelerated.\\n\\n & gt ; Which brings me to the second concatenation . For even the mass movement of millions of people into Europe would not sound such a final note for the continent were it not for the fact that ( coincidentally or otherwise ) at the same time Europe lost faith in its beliefs , traditions and legitimacy.\\n\\n & gt ; More than any other continent or culture in the world today , Europe is deeply weighed down with guilt for its past . Alongside this outgoing version of self-distrust runs a more introverted version of the same guilt . For there is also the problem in Europe of an existential tiredness and a feeling that perhaps for Europe the story has run out and a new story must be allowed to begin.\\n\\n & gt ; Mass immigration \u2014 the replacement of large parts of the European populations by other people \u2014 is one way in which this new story has been imagined : a change , we seemed to think , was as good as a rest . Such existential civilisational tiredness is not a uniquely modern European phenomenon , but the fact that a society should feel like it has run out of steam at precisely the moment when a new society has begun to move in can not help but lead to vast , epochal changes.\\n\\n & gt ; Had it been possible to discuss these matters , some solution might have been possible . Looking back , it is remarkable how restricted we made our discussion , even while we opened our home to the world.\\n\\n & gt ; A thousand years ago the peoples of Genoa and Florence were not as intermingled as they now are , but today they are all recognisably Italian , and tribal differences have tended to lessen rather than grow with time.\\n\\n & gt ; The current thinking appears to be that at some stage in the years ahead the peoples of Eritrea and Afghanistan too will be intermingled within Europe as the Genoans and Florentines are now melded into Italy . The skin colour of individuals from Eritrea and Afghanistan may be different , their ethnic origins may be further afield , but Europe will still be Europe and its people will continue to mingle in the spirit of Voltaire and St Paul , Dante , Goethe and Bach.\\n\\n & gt ; As with so many popular delusions , there is something in this . The nature of Europe has always shifted and \u2014 as trading cities such as Venice show \u2014 has included a grand and uncommon receptiveness to foreign ideas and influence . From the ancient Greeks and Romans onwards , the peoples of Europe sent out ships to scour the world and report back on what they found . Rarely , if ever , did the rest of the world return their curiosity in kind , but nevertheless the ships went out and returned with tales and discoveries that melded into the air of Europe . The receptivity was prodigious : it was not , however , boundless.\\n\\n & gt ; The question of where the boundaries of the culture lay is endlessly argued over by anthropologists and can not be solved . But there were boundaries . Europe was never , for instance , a continent of Islam . Yet the awareness that our culture is constantly , subtly changing has deep European roots . We know that the Greeks today are not the same people as the ancient Greeks . We know that the English are not the same today as they were a millennium ago , nor the French the French . And yet they are recognisably Greek , English and French and all are European.\\n\\n & gt ; In these and other identities we recognise a degree of cultural succession : a tradition that remains with certain qualities ( positive as well as negative ) , customs and behaviours . We recognise the great movements of the Normans , Franks and Gauls brought about great changes . And we know from history that some movements affect a culture relatively little in the long term , whereas others can change it irrevocably.\\n\\n & gt ; The problem comes not with an acceptance of change , but with the knowledge that when those changes come too fast or are too different we become something else , including something we may never have wanted to be.\\n\\n & gt ; At the same time we are confused over how this is meant to work . While generally agreeing that it is possible for an individual to absorb a particular culture ( given the right degree of enthusiasm both from the individual and the culture ) whatever their skin colour , we know that we Europeans can not become whatever we like . We can not become Indian or Chinese , for instance . And yet we are expected to believe that anyone in the world can move to Europe and become European.\\n\\n & gt ; If being \u201cEuropean\u201d is not about race , then it is even more imperative that it is about \u201cvalues\u201d . This is what makes the question \u201cWhat are European values ? \u201d so important . Yet this is another debate about which we are wholly confused.\\n\\n & gt ; Are we , for instance , Christian ? In the 2000s this debate had a focal point in the row over the wording of the new EU constitution and the absence of any mention of the continent\u2019s Christian heritage . The debate not only divided Europe geographically and politically , it also pointed to a glaring aspiration.\\n\\n & gt ; For religion had not only retreated in western Europe . In its wake there arose a desire to demonstrate that in the 21st century Europe had a self-supporting structure of rights , laws and institutions that could exist even without the source that had arguably given them life.\\n\\n & gt ; In the place of religion came the ever-inflating language of \u201chuman rights\u201d ( itself a concept of Christian origin ) . We left unresolved the question of whether or not our acquired rights were reliant on beliefs that the continent had ceased to hold , or whether they existed of their own accord . This was , at the very least , an extremely big question to have left unresolved while vast new populations were being expected to \u201cintegrate\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; An equally significant question erupted at the time around the position and purpose of the nation state . From the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 up to the late 20th century the nation state in Europe had generally been regarded not only as the best guarantor of constitutional order and liberal rights but the ultimate guarantor of peace.\\n\\n & gt ; Yet this certainty also eroded . European figures such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in 1996 insisted that \u201cThe nation state . . . can not solve the great problems of the 21st century.\u201d Disintegration of the nation states of Europe into one large integrated political union was so important , Kohl insisted , that it was in fact \u201ca question of war and peace in the 21st century\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; Others disagreed , and 20 years later just over half of British people who voted in the EU referendum demonstrated that they were unpersuaded by Kohl\u2019s argument . But , once again , whatever one\u2019s views on the matter , this was a huge question to leave unresolved at a time of vast population change.\\n\\n & gt ; While unsure of ourselves at home , we made final efforts at extending our values abroad . Yet whenever our governments and armies got involved in anything in the name of these \u201chuman rights\u201d \u2014 Iraq in 2003 , Libya in 2011 \u2014 we seemed to make things worse and ended up in the wrong . When the Syrian civil war began , people cried for western nations to intervene in the name of the human rights that were undoubtedly being violated . But there was no appetite to protect such rights because whether or not we believed in them at home , we had certainly lost faith in an ability to advance them abroad .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; **CONTINUED **\\n\\n & gt ; At some stage it began to seem possible that what had been called \u201cthe last utopia\u201d \u2014 the first universal system that divorced the rights of man from the say of gods or tyrants \u2014 might comprise a final failed European aspiration . If that is indeed the case , then it leaves Europeans in the 21st century without any unifying idea capable of ordering the present or approaching the future.\\n\\n & gt ; At any time the loss of all unifying stories about our past or ideas about what to do with our present or future would be a serious conundrum . But during a time of momentous societal change and upheaval the results are proving fatal . The world is coming into Europe at precisely the moment that Europe has lost sight of what it is . And while the movement of millions of people from other cultures into a strong and assertive culture might have worked , the movement of millions of people into a guilty , jaded and dying culture can not .\\n\\n & gt ; Even now Europe\u2019s leaders talk of an invigorated effort to incorporate the millions of new arrivals . These efforts too will fail . If Europe is going to become a home for the world , it must search for a definition of itself that is wide enough to encompass the world . This means that in the period before this aspiration collapses our values become so wide as to become meaninglessly shallow.\\n\\n & gt ; So whereas European identity in the past could be attributed to highly specific , not to mention philosophically and historically deep foundations ( the rule of law , the ethics derived from the continent\u2019s history and philosophy ) , today the ethics and beliefs of Europe \u2014 indeed the identity and ideology of Europe \u2014 have become about \u201crespect\u201d , \u201ctolerance\u201d and ( most self-abnegating of all ) \u201cdiversity\u201d.\\n\\n & gt ; Such shallow self-definitions may get us through a few more years , but they have no chance at all of being able to call on the deeper loyalties that societies must be able to reach if they are going to survive for long.\\n\\n & gt ; This is just one reason why it is likely that our European culture , which has lasted all these centuries and shared with the world such heights of human achievement , will not survive.\\n\\n & gt ; As recent elections in Austria and the rise of Alternative for Germany seem to prove , while the likelihood of cultural erosion remains irresistible , the options for cultural defence continue to be unacceptable . Even after the tumultuous years they have just had , the French electorate go to the polls next weekend to choose between more of a disastrous status quo or a member of the Le Pen family.\\n\\n & gt ; And all the time the flow into Europe continues .

"German auto industry would be demanding it . There are several countries with which UK trade put them into a surplus . Reduce it and they\\ 'll start running a trade deficit so they\\ 'll be open to the idea . The only reason I can think why europe would reject such a deal is to \ '' Send a message\ '' to other EU countries . Personally , if the rest of europe is so petty and power hungry to refuse one , then I wouldn\\'t want to be in any union or deal with them anyway . Refusing would just be showing that the EU is weak and needs to put on a show of strength to keep it from falling apart in the wake of the first exit .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; No one tries to explain migration problem by poverty or lack of education , usually it\\ 's \ '' they are muslim\ '' or \ '' they are arab\ '' .\\n\\nI do as do many others . I don\\'t think these migrants do what they do because they are inherently bad people or because of their skin colour or faith makes them bad people , but people are a product of their environment . These people have grown up with little education in a culture that is over a century behind ours . They have grown up used to the idea that women do not have the same right as them and are looked down upon . This isn\\'t going to change overnight . You\\ 'd need extensive re education classes for these migrants to fit in fully , it usually takes decades and generations for that to happen . The more migrants you take , the fewer ( % wise ) will westernise.\\n\\nWhat we really need to do is register them better , with a full database that lists where they say they are from . As most will say Syria , we need to stabilise Syria then they can be returned there . This migration problem should be looked at as a short term problem with the solution being sending them back to their homes when it\\ 's at peace . We talk about it as thought they are going to be here forever , they won\\'t/shouldn\\'t be .",English,Native,,Native

"Firstly , there have not been \ '' 3 models\ '' for Brexit put forward , it\\ 's the Remain camp that keeps trying to box the Leave camp into rigid constraints of pre existing deal . The UK can and will get it\\ 's own separate , unique deal that does not include free movement of people in any form . Now , if you\\ 're looking for the closest approximation of what that deal would look like , look to Canada or South Korea . \ '' But 7 years ! ! Hur Dur ! \ '' All other countries that have gone for a free trade deal have been negotiating from a blank slate . The UK is already compliment with all EU regulations , we\\ 'd just be negotiating on which parts to drop which will take far less time that Canada did.\\n\\nNow , as for why the EU would give us a good deal . Now , I expect you think they\\ 'll try to screw us over to stop others leaving I.e . the abusive partner theory . I disagree with this because you have to think about what will happen in the future . Let\\ 's assume they\\ 're deliberately harsh . Now , if the UK does badly , everyone will blame it on not getting a good deal . Now , while this will certainly discourage other members from leaving , it will leave the EU wit a hostile reputation . Other countries will be less inclined to join the EU , rather they\\ 'd just try for trade deals than locking themselves into a partnership they know they can never leave . \\n\\nConversely , if the UK sees good economic growth , even with a shitty deal with the EU , it will spell the end of the EU . All countries will see the UK thriving outside the unions , even with harsh penalties . This will open the flood gates . The more that leave , the less the bad deal matters as all newly independent countries will trade with each other as well . If that happened , the EU would probably not survive for many years after . Not something the EU wants.\\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about what will happen if they give the UK a good deal . If they give a good deal , and yet the UK does badly , it will send a message to everyone in Europe that membership of the EU is by far in a way the best thing for their economies . All countries in it will give up on the idea of leaving , seeing the economic benefit of staying . Countries not yet in the EU will make it a priority to join , so they can also get the economic boost it provides . All in all , if the UK gets a good deal but fails , it will ensure the further if the EU for decades to come . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about if the UK gets a good deal and also has good economic growth . People will see it as a country doing well , with most of that success based on the free trade deal they got , this reflects well on both parties involved . Now , some countries in the EU will see this as a reason to also leave , however , the EU has several ways to discourage them this way . They can say the UK only got a good trade deal because of it\\ 's large economy , something that would not be afforded to the smaller states . In the case of larger countries like France , they can say the UK is only doing well because it never had to float its own currency after exit , playing up fears amongst eurozone countries that it would be impossible for them to exit the EU because of the Euro . Now , his isn\\'t a perfect way to keep members , but it certainly gives the EU more room to manoeuvre.\\n\\nTLDR : If the EU gives the UK a bad deal , at best the EU will have a hostile reputation and find it much harder to attract new members , at worst , it will lead to the break up of the EU within a few years . If they give the UK a good deal , best case they secure the future of the EU for decades , worth case they have to work hard to stop any further members leaving , but the eurozone members will be easy to keep in the fold . I think in the grand scheme of things , they\\ 'll come down on giving us a good deal .",English,Native,,Native

Free movement only really works if it is between equals . Countries that have a very similar standard of living with similarly developed economies . For a time this worked well amongst western europe , the problems with the policy began when the former Soviet sphere countries began to join . They had far less developed economies and a standard of living well below that of western europe . This resulted , quite predictably , in a influx of peoples from east to west .

"I think the idea that the UK is eurosceptic because of the empire is utterly wrong . I see it touted a lot by Continentals as the reasons , but it does ring true with reality .

"Russia has updated some systems but has neglected others . So in some areas they are outdated in others they are up to date . The biggest thing that sticks out me about their military is that it is not really geared toward what we would call modern warfare and is more geared toward WWII style combat . Meaning they still rely on numbers of soldiers more then high tech weapons . That has its pluses and minuses . Having a large number of troops makes fighting many fronts easier but also slow down mobility . It is my opinion that Russian military would fare well in a defensive role but would suffer greatly is a large offensive war . \\n\\nJust like the US military is heavily designed to counter the Russian military , the Russian military is deigned to counter the US military . However the style of warfare the US has fallen into ( modern warfare ) is a lot different then it use to be and Russia has not really made changes to address that .

"& gt ; Um , that wasn\\'t Colonialism . At all.\\n\\nFunny , I don\\'t remember saying that it was.\\n\\n & gt ; Firstly , Mongol \ '' rule\ '' in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute . They didn\\'t settle and they never went further West than & gt ; Hungary . They were far too busy fighting themselves.\\n\\nThey were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe . \\n\\n & gt ; Seondly , the Muslims did not colonize Iberia . They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates . There\\ 's a & gt ; distinct difference between conquering with migration , and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the & gt ; overlord , regardless of the conditions of the native population . The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval & gt ; Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.\\n\\nSo numerous slave raids , land grabs , and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods ? Are you saying that they didn\\'t exploit us economically ? \\n\\n & gt ; Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination ? \\n\\nWhat\\ 's funny is the fact that they\\ 're not . They have benefited from their ancestors\\ ' enslavement . They enjoy the same rights as whites do , and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action . They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards . \\n\\n & gt ; To make it simple for you , problems such as wanton corruption , abysmal education , wars , ethnic conflict , and wealth leaving the country are & gt ; extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism , and American neocolonialism during the Cold War . \\n\\nSorry to say , but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history . It\\ 's not the white man\\ 's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape . Not being able to read doesn\\'t cause someone to burn their neighbors alive . \\n\\n & gt ; On top of this , what you are saying is amount to victim blaming , it\\ 's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern & gt ; themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so , and this is directly contradictory to the right of & gt ; self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \\n\\nAnd we did allow them to govern themselves . Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn\\'t obligate us to let them all come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources , and it is in the name of these corporate & gt ; interests that many European interventions have been made , the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.\\n\\nAnd ? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it . If those nations want restitution , they should get it from the companies that exploited them . And again , it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place . \\n\\n & gt ; For an indefinite period of time . We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations , when those problems have been solved & gt ; and we show genuine good will to act in their interests instead of our own , when it comes to the problems in the region , then we can start talking & gt ; about absolving ourselves . In historical terms , this was yesterday.\\n\\nHow about those that exploited Europe then ? Should we continue to make them pay for their past sins indefinitely ? The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid . Some countries I\\ 'm sure , only remain solvent because of the aid we give . Where would you draw the line ? \\n\\n & gt ; Again , the nations are , as these are the same nations today that existed then , only in a more evolved ( or devolved , depending on where you & gt ; stand ) state .

If someone is , it certainly isn\\'t your average Brit . \\n\\n & gt ; No , the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust , but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the & gt ; people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation . \\n\\nBut Germany wasn\\'t responsible for the establishment of Israel , which impacted the people already living there . \\n\\n\\n\\n",English,Native,,Native
"On your first 4 points ( to save some space ) : We weren\\'t only talking about colonialism . You suggested that we have these obligations to foreigners for ALL the sins we committed . Not just colonialism . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm saying it\\ 's nothing compared to Colonialism . Slavery was a two way street , Christians sold captured Muslims into slavery during the & gt ; Reconquista . Due to the fact those people had then been living there for a sum total of 700 years , would you call that economic exploitation , & gt ; or just simply the spoils of war ? \\n\\nYou\\ 're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others . It suits your argument to do so . I don\\'t fault you for that . Interestingly enough , your point about the Reconquista seems to indicate that you think we are even with the muslims . Good , then we don\\'t owe them anything . \\n\\n & gt ; Actual foreign direct investment as opposed to simply handing over a few billion to a government as long as they tow your line , because make & gt ; no mistake that aid money doesn\\'t go to all post-colonial states , just the ones that do what we like.\\n\\nWe could go back to giving them nothing if you like . I\\ 'd certainly like that . \\n\\n & gt ; You should pick up a history book sometime , it might fix that problem of yours.\\n\\nSub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans , Arabs , and Europeans . Maybe you could enlighten me.\\n\\n & gt ; Do you think that the blacks have twice the unemployment simply because they\\ 're lazy and like living off welfare ? Or maybe it\\ 's because & gt ; there\\ 's fuck all educational investment in working class areas . \\n\\nI guess white people don\\'t belong to the working class , right ? Your insults aside , there are many ways one could explain black unemployment numbers . One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with some imaginary inter-generational post traumatic stress . That\\ 's one of the more outlandish explanations for black Americans\\ ' over-representation in violent crime and under-representation in higher education.\\n\\n & gt ; For example , it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests . So , yes , the state does endorse this . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.\\n\\n & gt ; The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief . The thief has all of your shit but you still want him & gt ; to get the fuck out of your house . At the end of it all you have nothing left . Is it your fault ? \\n\\nInfrastructure , education , modern medicine , and a written language in some cases . We gave these things to the colonized . I\\ 'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.\\n\\n & gt ; The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state , which the state benefited from and as such , successive generations of & gt ; people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.\\n\\nWhere does the state get its money ? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution ? That\\ 's my point . Generations today shouldn\\'t be made to suffer for sins of the past . \\n\\n & gt ; Are you some sort of Libertarian that believes everyone can quit a job and move on with their lives ? \\n\\nPeople do it all the time . They weigh the risks and take their chances where they might have more opportunity . Many third world immigrants come to Europe with nothing . Many come illegally . If they can just quit their countries and move to Europe , they can certainly quit a job and move on with their lives.\\n\\nI doubt many of these people care about colonialism . They\\ 've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want . If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners , why don\\'t you do the \\'tolerant\\ ' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis ? Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections ? The possibilities for saying , \ '' We\\ 're sorry\ '' are endless.\\n\\n",English,Native,,Native

"EU to force Facebook and Google to give police data under terrorism proposals\\n Social media apps \\nTech companies could be obliged to had cloud data to police CREDIT : AFP\\n Cara McGoogan \\n8 JUNE 2017 \u2022 5:26PM\\nThe European Union wants to give police new powers to obtain information from internet companies including Facebook and Google as part of new measures to fight terrorism . \\n\\nThe European Commission has proposed multiple ways to make it easier for police to retrieve data stored in the cloud directly from technology companies after complaints of slow investigations . \\n\\nSocial media companies are increasingly under pressure to assist law enforcement in the wake of terror attacks . Facebook faced intense criticism following the Westminster attack , for example , for refusing to give law enforcement access to the final WhatsApp messages Khalid Masood sent . \\n\\nThe most radical option the Commission has proposed would allow security services across Europe to have direct access to data from internet companies , even if this would jeopardise the safety of the information.\\n\\nOther , less intrusive proposals would allow international police to go directly to technology firms with a request rather than having to go to local law enforcement first , or for companies to hand over data when requested even if it is in another country . \\n\\n\ '' I am sure that now in the shadow of the recent terrorist attacks and increasing threats in Europe there will be more understanding among the ministers , even among those who come from countries where there has not been a terrorist attack , \ '' Vera Jourova , EU justice commissioner , told Reuters . \\n\\nMay highlights UK security needs in campaign speech\\n01:27\\n\ '' The third [ most radical ] option is a kind of emergency possibility that will require some additional safeguards protecting the privacy of people .

The selected ones will form the basis of a legislative proposal from the EU executive that will be published at the end of the year or the beginning of the next . \\n\\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd has accused WhatsApp of giving terrorists \ '' a secret place to hide\ '' .

"[ Does this work ? ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Rhodesia ) \\n\\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the Rhodesian Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a first past the post principle . At some stages , however , there were two-member constituencies , and in the early years there were some appointed members . The 1961 constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\\n\\nAt the time of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence , Rhodesia\\ 's amended 1961 constitution ( which was annexed to the UDI ) provided for an Officer Administering the Government , to be appointed by the British Sovereign ( or by the parliament if the Queen made no appointment ) , with political power residing with the unicameral Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nUnder the 1961 constitution , the Rhodesian Assembly had 65 elected members : 50 constituency members and 15 district members . The voter rolls had education , property and income qualifications . The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95 % of its members were white and 5 % were black or Asian . The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90 % of its members were black and 10 % were white or Asian . The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll . Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts , but for elections in the constituencies , the B roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total , and for elections in the districts , the A roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total . This procedure was known as \\'cross-voting\\ ' . In practice , the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\\n\\nThe 1962 general election was a watershed for the country , since it resulted in the election of a Rhodesian Front government led by Winston Field that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia . The defeated United Federal Party led by Edgar Whitehead had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\\n\\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969 . It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided . African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register , and those that had registered not to vote . Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote , and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25 % .\\n\\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution . This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic , following a referendum result in favour in 1969 . Under this new constitution , there was a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected Senate , and a directly elected House of Assembly , in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the 1961 constitution . The new office of president was a ceremonial post , with executive power remaining with the Prime Minister.\\n\\nThe 1969 constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly . The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans . The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll , and 8 B roll seats . It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached . In addition to the B roll seats , the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members . The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly , with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well . These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.\\n\\nThe new constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms . The concept of \ '' separate development\ '' for blacks and whites was written into that constitution . The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted . This last feature underpinned the concept of \\'equal partnership between black and white\\ ' as an alternative to majority rule . However , the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely , if not for ever . White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance , given enough time .

"& gt ; That\\ 's a big one . You can\\'t buy social peace with laissez-faire capitalism and still insist everyone to make babies - your people are spoiled consumerists who basically view children as a huge opportunity cost . Those who do have children rightfully demand that their children\\ 's lives are better than cheap labour ( which every society still needs to function ) , and your business leaders will continue to demand cheap labour . Without immigration , you will either have to create and exploit your own underclass or fall behind countries who have immigration.\\n & gt ; As for humanitarian aid , I wholeheartedly agree it is not a sound policy - some societies do need help to get them through droughts and famines ( but if climate change makes these droughts and famines permanent , they in reality simply have to move somewhere or die on the spot , which is not something you can really rationally expect ... ) , but to keep people afloat while turning a blind eye to huge corruption problems in their societies , not helping them with their institutions and keeping their warlords in power so your corporations can continue to extract their resources for peanuts is not an acceptable solution . But today , if you stop the aid , they will come in even larger numbers , and if you empower their institutions , your electronics , fruit and chocolate will become much more expensive.\\n & gt ; In any case , both demographic problems in your society and humanitarian aid for other countries are transnational problems which can only be solved by cooperation with other countries and institutions , but that would probably exceed your democratic mandate , since you made the decision to run on the policy of \ '' my country first.\ '' \\n & gt ; \\n\\nTL : DR : A lot of these are fundamentally problems with capitalism as it works today .

"My employer pays 100 % of my premium , which are the monthly payments , as part of my employee benefits . For things like doctors\\ ' visits , minor procedures , and prescription drugs , I pay a co-payment and the insurance company pays the rest ( my monthly prescription has a co-pay of $ 10 , the insurance pays the rest ) . \\n\\nFor major procedures and hospitalizations , I am responsible for paying a deductible ( $ 4,500 per year ) . If it costs more than that , I pay 20 % co-insurance with my insurer covering the other 80 % up to my annual \ '' out-of-pocket\ '' maximum , which is $ 6,600 . Everything above $ 6,600 is covered 100 % by my insurance company.\\n\\nI also am allowed to have money from my pay check deposited into a Health Savings Account ( HSA ) .

For retirees , we have a program called Medicare , which covers most healthcare expenses for senior citizens . Everyone is entitled to this since the same tax that funds Social Security also funds Medicare . \\n\\nFinally , we have subsidized insurance through Obamacare , which help reduce the cost of premiums for people who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid , but not enough to afford private insurance on their own . Obamacare also made it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , so everyone is now eligible for health insurance.\\n\\nOur system isn\\'t as horrible as it\\ 's often made out to be on Reddit and the quality of care for those with private insurance is very high .",English,Native,,Native

"That breakdown on the US is very interesting . If you\\ 're familiar with where each of those districts is located , you notice a pattern that districts with the highest GINI coefficient are almost entirely urban , while the districts with the lowest GINI coefficients are either rural areas , or wealthy suburbs . It\\ 's also interesting to see that while nearly all of the districts with high GINI coefficients are represented in Congress by left-liberal Democrats , the districts with higher GINI coefficients don\\'t seem to be politically correlated.\\n\\nThe district with the lowest GINI is VA-11 , which contains the wealthy Washington DC suburbs of Fairfax County and eastern Prince William County south to Dumfries . It is represented by a centrist Democrat.\\n\\nThe district with the 2nd lowest GINI is MN-06 , which covers the wealthy exurbs northwest of Minneapolis , the city and suburbs of St . Cloud , and the rural counties connecting and surrounding the two population centers . This district was represented by ultra-right Tea Party Republican Michelle Bachmann until last year.\\n\\nThe district with the 3rd lowest GINI coefficent is NY-02 . This district covers Long Island and contains southern Nassau County east of Brookyn and southwestern Suffolk County . These suburbs of New York City are prosperous , but not as wealthy as the Hamptons further east ( this is district NY-01 ) . This district is represented by Republican Peter King , who is moderate on economic and social issues but is also one of the biggest foreign policy \ '' Hawks\ '' in Washington.\\n\\nMy own district , VA-05 , is one of the outliers in that it\\ 's a primarily rural district , but it has the 85th highest GINI coefficent . This district was gerrymandered to include the city of Charlottesville and its\\ ' surrounding suburbs in Albemarle County , while the rest of the district is quite rural . The city has a lot of really poor , primarily black residents , as well as the prosperous neighborhoods surrounding the University of Virginia and the central business district . The surrounding suburbs are some of the wealthiest in Virginia , so the inclusion of these very poor and very rich areas makes the 5th district much more unequal than the typical rural district .

"I agree , we share many similar if no the same technologies , but my argument still remains the same : the problem is that the EU is still too uncooperative with each other to have a solid unified military .

However that is case though , so far they can only protect themselves as independent countries but not as a singular EU force . And until they do , they NEED American assistance , and I don\\'t mean to brag or be nationalistic or anything , but they especially need our logistical expertise .

The U.S. have been wanting to shift our focus to Asia , but we simply can\\'t reallocate all our resources over there because European NATO allies still needs it .

USA was supplying the Allies long before they joined . The US was also hurting Japan in an attempt to help the Allies as well before they officially joined the war .,English,Native,,Native
It increased the commute a little .,English,Native,,Native
Fuck that . So Hitler could have fortress Europe ? What could possibly go wrong ? No matter what is done there will always be a pissed off contrarian group that will turn literally any action into something negative . There are people that complain even when they literally are given free things .,English,Native,,Native
Well at least I can appreciate American style propaganda .,English,Native,,Native
Oh well in that case I guess he needs to take over all of Europe then to make sure he can secure gas delivery to every single household.\\n\\nThere is more to Ukraine than just having a pipeline going through it.\\n\\nAre you trying to say Putin is justified in his actions ?,English,Native,,Native
"Are you trying to say Putin is justified in his actions ? \\n\\nHurr , hurr , I am just a stupid American , never heard that one before.\\n\\nWhy does Russia need to take over Ukraine ? Ukraine is a consumer of their gas . Many other countries in Europe are as well . Tell me again why Ukraine should be annexed against their will and how any of that is justified versus seizing any other country in Europe ?",English,Native,,Native
"Well if Germany could actually be a leader , there would be no need for military equipment to cross oceans instead of moving a couple countries over to the East .",English,Native,,Native
"I was being sarcastic . I think it was a mistake to give up nukes when next to Russia . I wish USA would do more for you . I am honestly not sure about memorandum , but it seems like USA and UK are keeping up their end of the deal by respecting the territory of Ukraine , no ? Russia on the other hand , well , they are doing the usual .",English,Native,,Native
He has known the rules that would result in the adjustment of GNI for all of EU for years yes . It was agreed to for years by everyone . Literally no surprises that this was happening . Cameron is a liar playing populist politics . The UK also absolutely 100 % is not being punished for a damn thing .,English,Native,,Native
My sides . Why not just reroll an account and go with village_idiot instead ?,English,Native,,Native
"No , no . You misunderstood me . Those are two independent statements .",English,Native,,Native
I would imagine from frustration at Russian propaganda game . I know I am guilty of making the comments myself often .,English,Native,,Native
Haha . I will watch with popcorn from here as Germany and rest of Europe fucks over France and UK instead of USA.\\n\\nWhy should we pay taxes ? No one will attack us . UK and France have nukes and army .,English,Native,,Native
That poor invading army . I hope someone is praying for them . If only we could have peace by giving Putin his USSR territory . EU are a real big group of meanies .,English,Native,,Native
Could you expand on that ? What are you referring to ?,English,Native,,Native
Shocker . This is like the Godwin of /r/Europe .,English,Native,,Native
Look at a map lately ? Check the size of Russia and ask yourself if Russia is going to run out of conscripts .,English,Native,,Native
"Well , I don\\'t disagree with anything you said . I just think \ '' gas\ '' is inaccurate . Europe doesn\\'t need Ukraine for gas and Russia had zero issues selling gas without annexing Ukraine . Russia just wants to annex Ukraine before another country joins EU and improves their situation . You see how they react to countries like the Baltics or Georgia .",English,Native,,Native
I only wish US forces could have GPS malfunctions .,English,Native,,Native
"Oh , so your frame of reference was half a century ago ? When did American military invade ? \\n\\nDo you know what the words \ '' same shit\ '' mean ? \\n\\nItaly are real warmongers too . Punic wars , same shit .",English,Native,,Native
"Yes , just like all the courageous people in the US Coast Guard that protected Florida beaches against the Nazis .",English,Native,,Native
And nothing was lost .,English,Native,,Native
You are saying the government actually pays people to do shit like that ? That picture is insanely depressing no matter if it is true believers or paid shills . I honestly have trouble understanding Russia . All I ever hear and read is how much the people love the rule of Putin in Russia . This comes even from \ '' Western\ '' media which has an obvious bias against Russia and would love to portray Putin in a bad light .,English,Native,,Native
"So all the \ '' support\ '' of Putin you think is fake ? Are you being sarcastic when you say there was too much freedom in the 1990s ? Hard to tell over text . \\n\\nI know Yeltsin was a disaster , no one disputes that . Does that make it where basically Putin can do anything because at least he isn\\'t Yeltsin ? This is just my own thinking on the matter . Feel free to tell me I am completely wrong . I just seem to run into so many people online that are willing to make excuses for literally any and every action Russia takes .",English,Native,,Native
How is it any different ?,English,Native,,Native
The president was elected on the premise that he take that deal that was years in the making . He was bought and paid for as a Putin puppet .,English,Native,,Native
"Yeah , I agree . North Korea is all about opinion polls and a happy populace . Literally the only difference between North Korea and the countries in EU is term limits .",English,Native,,Native
He will hate whatever stops him . He hates Ukraine now . They were the same country only decades before . Appeasing him stops nothing . You going to break all relationships with USA ? Russia is killing Ukrainians as a way to show power and strength and being relevant super power as a proxy attack against USA will happen no matter what .,English,Native,,Native
The point is you don\\'t leave the country and actually show up to fight . I could have mentioned national guard for USA but those people are actually still called into active duty and sent overseas . The ones on the front are the ones doing the actual \ '' defending\ '' .,English,Native,,Native
Still going strong with the first occupation .,English,Native,,Native
Pathetic attempt .,English,Native,,Native
State television openly talks about Russia going to war and Russians escaping to bunkers ?,English,Native,,Native
But again they can always outnumber . Russia has tons of nukes of every variety . They are also crazy in thinking nukes DE ESCALATE .,English,Native,,Native
Sounds like something out of a North Korea official press release .,English,Native,,Native
Snails are fucking delicious .,English,Native,,Native
What the hell is \ '' on the west\ '' ?,English,Native,,Native
"Oh , so I guess the weak economy of Germany can\\'t handle 2 % unlike the powerhouses of Poland and Greece ? Somehow UK manages just fine to keep above 2 % .\\n\\nSo , unless there is the threat of being kicked out , freeload with a train of excuses including referencing economies in the 1940s at every opportunity ? \\n\\nThis is why there will never be an EU military . Just a bunch of countries trying to fuck each other over at every opportunity by one upping each other . It is a mutual defense treaty , but all these countries just putz around saying who gives a shit I can\\'t be punished for it and the other countries protect me . If that isn\\'t selfish freeloading I don\\'t know if anything is.\\n\\nYou have a country like Spain that says fuck it and cut their military more and more , but then they cry about taking care of illegal immigrants from Africa . Why should anyone in EU care when Spain proves very effectively that they don\\'t give a shit about anything that happens in Eastern Europe ? It is only \ '' team\ '' when it is asking for everyone else to help you.\\n\\nBy the way . That crisis affects Americans , too . I didn\\'t realize a crisis that also happens in USA is a good excuse to say we don\\'t want to spend on defense , let American tax payers take care of it for us so we can have other things we want .",English,Native,,Native
WWII being used as an excuse for free loading on budgets in 2014.\\n\\nK.\\n\\nWhere are these war torn areas in Western Europe ? Why are countries that were behind the iron curtain able to meet the AGREED UPON goal ?,English,Native,,Native
And how would writing off all of Europe help USA ? That would mean one country owning the whole continent . Leaving an alliance also is an excellent way to lose influence . Taking your ball and going home doesn\\'t improve anything.\\n\\nIf anything USA has the most to complain about in regards to NATO . It wouldn\\'t be \ '' an Anglo club\ '' if everyone weren\\'t such cheap bastards that freeload with pride . The exceptions to this prove the rule .,English,Native,,Native
"Simple , a big army kept them honest in Germany during Cold War . A big army would have kept them out of Ukraine and Georgia and would kick them out of Moldova . The point of military is being ready to always use it which prevents you from having to . Not having a military causes more war .",English,Native,,Native
I do agree with you but give credit where it is due . I think Poland and Greece pay their share and all of the Baltics are either projected to hit 2 % or are already there .,English,Native,,Native
And then what ? Internal passports restricting their travel ? They would be able to move anywhere they wanted and like all immigrants would form ghettos because they would be most comfortable around each other .,English,Native,,Native
Because it is true .,English,Native,,Native
I completely missed that .,English,Native,,Native
"Well , in that case , it would be with a sub or ICBM . At that point , tactical or strategic is just a matter of size . It wouldn\\'t be used in a \ '' battlefield\ '' setting which is the intent of tactical nukes . Russia has tons of ICBMs and a huge fleet of subs from soviet days that can launch nukes as well . You would need A LOT of missiles in order to guarantee a likelihood of stopping the attack . Plus subs introduce a real wild card . It is basically impossible to stop sub attacks.\\n\\nThey even have bombers that can drop nukes , but that is more risky . Nowadays they are mostly used for dick waving by violating NATO/EU airspace .",English,Native,,Native
Must be from Texas with whatever was laying in back seat on quick notice .,English,Native,,Native
How convenient .,English,Native,,Native
They don\\'t need to invade Germany . They work the edges and weaken the EU politically in the meantime because their main rival is EU not the USA . EU has a much bigger effect on Russia economically and politically versus the USA . The last thing they need is a strong EU . That is why they invaded Ukraine multiple times . They take full advantage of funding opposition parties and \ '' protecting Russians\ '' around Europe .,English,Native,,Native
"Russia can\\'t do shit . If they did that , they would only be guaranteeing their own destruction . You don\\'t earn \ '' respect\ '' through nukes . You earn it by giving respect to your neighbors . That is why countries run from Russia at first opportunity into the arms of USA and EU and NATO .",English,Native,,Native

What could Sweden do to prevent a Russian planting a flag on Gotland ? Check out what is happening in Ukraine and getting sliced apart .

You are just excusing Russia . Russia invaded because they lost their puppet president . End of story .

They have a right to prosperity . EU has more to offer them.\\n\\nFuck this apologizing . I don\\'t care about their motives . Stop invading Europe . They operate as though they are a vast WNP pure and no one may dare touch the USSR that still exists in their mind and they are so confused why Warsaw pact countries prefer the West.\\n\\nEdit : yes you are lying . Pushing propaganda about \ '' promises\ '' that NATO isn\\'t allowed to accept countries that aren\\'t written anywhere . Just more bullshit from Russia to excuse their naked aggression .

What does ISIS have to do with the other rebel groups ? They are different groups . USA is already saying that they would do that . You are mentioning things to do that are already in the works .

"In Australian rules football a few years ago diving became quite an issue . It got a lot of attention because a lot of people who follow and play the game like to think of it as a tough sport where anything like diving is a disgrace to the game , to the point where if you spent more than a few seconds on the ground , you 'd want to be going off on a stretcher otherwise you 're a softcock . Anyway , there is a 'push in the back ' rule where , strangely enough , if someone pushes you in the back you get a free kick . As the game has evolved into a fully fledged elite sport , some players began to go to ground at the slightest touch to their back to win a free kick and often a shot at goal . The league 's solution to the problem was not to punish the diving , but to make the rule black and white that any contact to the back would be punished with a free kick . At first there was a bit of outrage from supporters saying the rule was soft and too hard on defenders , but eventually they became used to expecting free kicks being paid for contact that once may not have been punished . More importantly , players soon came to learn that they had to learn to defend without making any contact to the back , and so play has now evolved so that it is no longer an issue . So whilst there was for a little while a rise in the number of 'push in the back ' decisions initially , and groaning from supporters when it happened , players eventually adapted and that rate is back to normal , and diving is no longer an issue .",English,Native,,Native
"Yeah I 'm not saying the rule change could directly be transferred to another sport , because the issue , whilst related , is not the same . Goals are far more frequent in AFL and free kicks are taken from where they occur , not a penalty spot , so are less of a sure thing . My point is that a carefully considered rule change could help fix the problem .",English,Native,,Native

Your misreading me . Everything you mention relates to ideology and culture and I agree with that view . Russians and Americans are definitely culturally related thanks to their European roots . Perhaps I should have specified that I mean that the concept of the `` West ' in modern speech implies that you are both European and aligned with the Nato block . For example South Korea fulfills the second category but not the first . Russia does not fulfill that second requirement . I believe you were partly getting at that when you said some say differently . This is why I distinguished with Culturally western and Politically western .

As to producing Children the government does n't seem very generous when compared to most European countries and some family subsidies have already been removed in the past 3 years . I recall people getting pretty annoyed about a paid maternity leave scheme the conservative government had , which did not get implemented . So I would n't call it pro natalist and our fertility rate is below replacement .

Logically it don 's t make much sense as a child would add more demands and stress to the situation and thus seems like a recipe for a big mess , but if the expectation is that it would add fulfillment or make them happier as is suggested by culture then it makes sense .

I 've revisited it lately as I 've been helping look after my grandmother for the past 4 years . Kind of had a moment where I realized that this must be like an easier version of parenting , that I do n't like it and started hanging out here and looked into a vasectomy .

But deep down I think the answer is no and everything else is surface theatrics . I do n't foresee my self enjoying the positives so much . I do n't see my self as a father , it feels very strange .

This is true for some people that they do despise children in general but enjoy their own .

"So its useful to think of ships as filling three roles . There are Capital ships , Escort ships and Raiders . Capital ships are the biggest most expensive parts of your fleet of which you will build many fewer of than your Escorts . These are fleet Carriers , Super heavy Battleships , Battleships , Battle Cruisers and Heavy Cruisers . Which you build will depend on who you are and how much infrastructure you have to support a fleet . Generally Fleet Carriers are the best but need a complement of air craft built for them as well.They have much greater range than any other ship and can support land operations with their aircraft whilst other capital ships can only bombard a province adjacent to the sea . I believe battle cruisers are as fast as carriers with close the same firepower as a battleship , but do n't have as much Armour . Escort ships like Light Cruisers and destroyers are built in greater numbers to escort your capital ships . Light Cruisers are bigger than Destroyers but are not as effective at anti submarine warfare . Use Submarines are used to attack convoys .",English,Native,,Native

I 've never met either Assad [ Bashar or his father , Hafez ] . I was among the first to criticise the Ba'ath Party , because I 'm against an ideology based on a singleness of ideas '' . Adonis said on the subject : What 's really absurd is that the Arab opposition to dictators refuses any critique ; it 's a vicious circle . So someone who is against despotism in all its forms ca n't be either with the regime or with those who call themselves its opponents . The opposition is a regime avant la lettre . '' He adds : `` In our tradition , unfortunately , everything is based on unity – the oneness of God , of politics , of the people . We ca n't ever arrive at democracy with this mentality , because democracy is based on understanding the other as different . You ca n't think you hold the truth , and that nobody else has it . '' `` In August 2011 , Adunis called in an interview in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Rai for the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down because of his role in the Syrian civil war .

A terrible measure in a terrible war , though Assad 's bombing campaigning is no where as effective and seems to be a waste of resources .

"On the face of it , the remarks made by Iranian President Hassan Rohani during a meeting with senior editors from media organizations on Friday should not have come as a surprise . `` I do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria , '' he said , seemingly contradicting a flurry of reports in recent weeks that Moscow and Tehran were tightly coordinated over the deployment of Russian forces in Latakia , Syria . After Rohani 's unclear statements , Putin 's laconic affirmative to the question posed to him by interviewer Charlie Rose whether his country sent its troops to prevent Bashar Assad 's downfall ( `` You 're right , '' Putin replied ) , was nearly refreshing in its simplicity . We ca n't , of course , accept Putin 's and Rohani 's statements at face value . However , they do show that , despite reports of Iran 's Quds Force commander General Qassem Suleimani 's visit to Moscow and the Fox News report on Friday that Russia and Iran are coordinating actions in Syria from Baghdad , reports by Western journalists stationed in Tehran and Damascus , that Russia 's latest maneuvers `` surprised '' the Iranian leadership and were n't to its liking , were fairly reliable . So far , Russia and Iran were considered to be allies , sharing the common goal of keeping Assad in power . Both supplied arms , lines of credit and military advice to the Syrian regime , with Russia also putting up a diplomatic umbrella by using its UN Security Council veto to prevent anti-Assad resolutions . Iran , through Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militias , supplied manpower to replenish the Syrian army 's thinning ranks . The abrupt entry of the Russian expeditionary force has tilted the scales in the Assad coalition : Russia turned from a distant supporter to an active participant on the ground , becoming overnight a much more influential factor , in a way which made her different interest in the survival of the Damascus regime plainly evident . For the leaders of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran , keeping Syria on the Shi'ite axis as a link to their proxy in Lebanon , Hezbollah , was almost an existential need . Without Syria , Iran 's regional influence and its ability to control what is happening in Lebanon – to direct , arm and maintain Hezbollah as a central force – would have been crippled . For Putin , however , leaving Assad to his fate would have , at worst , lost the Kremlin some of its prestige . The Russian president 's decision to take a chance and invest resources in Syria after all was primarily driven by a desire to take advantage of the vacuum created by U.S. inaction in the Middle East . Putin seeks to create leverage that would allow Russia to regain the place it lost in the international arena in the wake of last year 's invasion of Ukraine . Syria , Assad and Iran 's interests have now become hostages to Putin 's geopolitical goals . The Russian president could decide , for example , as he apparently already agreed to at his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week , to coordinate his steps with Israel as well and to permit the Israeli air force to continue to fly over Syria and attack Hezbollah weapon convoys ( as foreign reports claim Israel has already done in recent years ) . With the consent of Europe and the United States , he could force elections on Assad as well as cooperation with members of the opposition , including those who oppose Iranian involvement in Syria . Putin could decide that it would be better for Russia to involve Iran ’ s Sunni rivals – Saudi Arabia and Egypt – in a future solution to the civil war . Moreover , at any stage , he could also decide to bring the Russian forces home with their gear . Unlike Russia ’ s support for separatists in Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , there is no Russian national yearning for Syrian land in Aleppo and Homs province . In the event of a deal in which Russia would receive Western recognition for a portion of its aspirations in former Soviet areas in return for cooperation in finding a long-term solution in Syria that might stop the flow of refugees to Europe , and maybe even allow their return home , Putin would not hesitate to abandon the Iranians . Another angle in the relationship between Russia and Iran can be currently seen through the eyes of the masses of Syrian refugees flooding European highways . Among them are a considerable number of citizens who are actually from areas and population groups that support Assad . They recount that they decided to leave because they came to the conclusion that even if the Assad regime survives , it will only be as an Iranian satellite - an alternative that in their view , as secular Syrians , is not much more appealing than being ruled by Islamic State . The entry of Russia into the region raises the prospect that areas in Syria that remain under the Assad 's control , or anyone who would replace him , could actually end up under Russian influence , rather than an Iranian Shi ’ ite province . In Western eyes , that may not be such a great deal , but for many Syrians , it would be a lot preferable than the other options .",English,Native,,Native

"Nuclear warheads would do it , but that would carry severe diplomatic consequences in a first strike on a non WMD armed nation . They do n't need to launch those via Subs either , they have land based missiles that can do the job . In terms of Aircraft , it is still too far away . The military analysis has been that the Israeli Air Force does not have enough planes or refueling aircraft to strike the several Nuclear sites within Iran even if they find a suitable flight course . Cruise missiles also wo n't be able to penetrate the deeply fortified sites beneath a mountain . Furthermore such a strike would be a temporary set back to the Iranian program as the technical know how would still exist within the Iranian nuclear industry . In addition a surprise attack on both tactical and strategical levels is unlikely to be achieved as Israel would need to mobilize its army as Iranian retaliation through its proxies is very likely , giving Iran indication that something may occur . [ Article about the difficulties Israel would face . ] ( http : //www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/world/middleeast/iran-raid-seen-as-complex-task-for-israeli-military.html )",English,Native,,Native
"Ordinarily going nuclear out of the blue would probably create more problems for the Iranians than it would for the North Koreans . Iran is a big , powerful country within the middle east and a major power player in the conflicts . Besides having very formidable natural defenses deter a invasion by making an American invasion unsuistianbly painful . Furthermore Israeli military might may was well be a joke to Iran , they have no expeditionary power as shown by Israel taking no military actions in contrast to their interventions in Syria and Iraq . Going Nuclear could frighten the neighboring Arabs into also going Nuclear which would limit Irans ability to throw its weight around . Besides the extreme sanctions that Iran would have to cope with . It is unwise for them to go nuclear whilst the west exists as a meaningful block . However irrationality within the USA can distort this arthiamatic and make going nuclear attractive . Which is not good . This contrasts to North Korea which is very weak , can not intervene in east Asian politics in any meaningful fashion and is hemmed in by greatly more powerful countries , China , Russia , Japan and South Korea . The possibility of being sold out is a valid fear for them .",English,Native,,Native

Take your nuclear bomb analogy as an example . Imagine that some government ( we 'll say the US for the sake of argument ) is torturing someone who they think may know which city is about to be targeted and when - and the man eventually has enough and tells them that the bomb will land in San Francisco at 4pm .

You obviously enjoyed the episode , I did n't . For a detective show , so many things were left completely unanswered . How can Eurus control minds ?

"& gt ; If you accept that constitutional politics was always the only way forward , then I fail to see why they should get credit for being so late to acknowledge it . Especially when they were part of the problem . The cognitive dissonance that people have on this topic is nothing short of incredible to me . Constitutional politics was the only thing that could actually bring about peace in the end - but you seem to be drastically underestimating how difficult it would have been to convert an organisation as inherently violent as the IRA to politics . Adams and McGuinness could n't just get up one morning and say `` You know what , no more violence ! From now on the IRA are political '' . The IRA would have pushed back , and both of them might well have lost any influence they had with them to begin with . It took a long time because it 's not something that can be achieved overnight . & gt ; You praise their `` achievements '' . I do n't see what they 've achieved that would n't have been achieved anyway through politics and the ECHR with far less bloodshed . As far as I can see , all they did was knock a United Ireland back another hundred years . The Troubles was a completely predictable conflict . It became inevitable because of how the orange state was set up and how the majority ( Protestants ) reacted to the pretty tame demands of a minority ( Catholics ) . They reacted with violence , violence and yet more violence . To say that we could have gone from that to a power sharing government through entirely political means is revisionism at its worst . Political methods were already attempted well before the PIRA gained support - that 's what the civil rights movement was all about . It was the reaction of the Loyalist community and the RUC to that movement that led to the growth of the PIRA and the escalation of the conflict . This also began before Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness became involved with either the IRA or Sinn Fein .",English,Native,,Native

No ... that 's not my narrative . Not everyone in the IRA died for equality and not all of them joined because of civil rights . I did n't say that . I was making the point that it seems extremely unlikely to me that we could have gotten to the point where Loyalists and the British government would be willing to engage politically with Republicans and Nationalists without the latter resorting to armed action .

"The `` Orange State '' - or Northern Ireland as it existed from the mid 60 's until the 70 's when direct rule was imposed , was a hugely sectarian state . Catholics did n't have the same ability to vote , they were routinely passed over when housing was allocated in favour of Protestant families and because so much of the land and property was controlled by Protestants , there was really high unemployment among Catholic communities because Protestants simply would n't hire one of them before a Protestant . The civil rights marches that started to take place in the early 70 's opposing these injustices were met with state and , in particular , Loyalist violence . In one incident , entire streets of Catholic residences were burned to the ground in Belfast by armed Loyalist gangs . In reaction to this , the PIRA started to gain more and more support among the Catholic and Nationalist communities because they promised to fight back . I think you probably know how the rest of it went . That disgusting little statelet does n't exist in the same way anymore . Could that have been achieved without armed actions ?

The PIRA in Northern Ireland were a reaction to a pre-existing situation . Catholics and Nationalists were , in effect , second class citizens . They organised peaceful civil rights marches to oppose this and the response of the good , non-terrorist police force of the Northern Irish statelet was to beat these marches off the streets . The response of the loyalist community was to orchestrate what can only be called pogroms against Catholic communities in Belfast . This is the environment that the PIRA grew out of . They were a violent reaction to violent oppression and they would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness .

Are you disputing the assertion that Catholics in the late 60 's and early 70 's were treated with discrimination by the government in Northern Ireland ?

Are you disputing that Loyalist gangs burned over a thousand Catholics out of their homes in Belfast and elsewhere ? Are you disputing that the PIRA therefore gained support from the Catholic community because of the latter 's treatment at the hands of their own government ? Nelson Mandela was the leader of the violent wing of the ANC ( MK ) . This group was responsible for bombings all over South Africa . These bombings often happened in public places like shopping centres , bars , bins in public streets , and inevitably led to civilian casualties . Sound familiar ?

Now , I 'm not trying to make these attacks any more palatable and I 'm not trying to justify them - but what I am saying is that you need to have a special kind of wilful ignorance to pretend that the people who joined the `` Old '' IRA were morally superior to people like McGuinness who joined the PIRA in the late 60 's . Both organisations were willing to use extreme violence to achieve their goals - and civilians were caught in the crossfire in both instances . More notable , in my opinion , is the actions of McGuinness after he left the IRA . He turned himself away from violence and he also turned others away from it with him .

"& gt ; It 's weird to hear talk of unification again . Grew up with the understanding it 'd never happen , now it 's a possibility I fear emotions will overtake logic and I 'm just not sure it 's the best idea for the north or the republic . & gt ; It 's almost impossible to discuss with people though because it 's such loaded topic . I happen to think that Brexit has made unification an inevitability . Maybe not in the immediate future but to me , it just does n't make sense to have Northern Ireland outside of the EU and the Republic inside it . Something will give , I think . The onus is really on the Nationalists to show Unionists in Northern Ireland that they have a place in a potentially united Ireland - and I think that with Martin McGuinness ' death , that just became more difficult .",English,Native,,Native
"That 's fair enough , the Troubles affected a lot of people and they ruined a lot of lives . People get emotional about these things and for a lot of people , Adams and McGuinness were the faces of a movement that may well have been responsible for the deaths of their family members or friends . I would never ask these people to think of Martin McGuinness as a hero because I have no right to . The same goes for the other side . With that being said , I think that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply would have been impossible without men like Adams and McGuinness . It 's pretty hard to describe the gravity of what was achieved . The IRA went from being an organisation that was violent to the core , to laying down their weapons in ceasefire , supporting the peace process and eventually decommissioning all of their weapons under international supervision . That 's no mean feat and it must have taken a lot of strongly willed people to bring that about . McGuinness was undoubtedly one of the main men in that regard , along with Adams . The Good Friday Agreement is probably the most important document signed by the UK and Ireland since the Anglo Irish Treaty .",English,Native,,Native
Omagh was brutal . I have a family member who had a pretty narrow escape that day as well . At least now people in NI are looking back at stuff like this instead of seeing it out their front windows every day .,English,Native,,Native
"McGuinness grew up in a sectarian statelet that viewed Catholics like him as second class citizens and who responded to their demands for civil rights with extreme violence . The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit . Northern Ireland is a better place today because they managed to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Plenty of men go down the violent path and never turn back . McGuinness not only turned back from it himself , but he turned others back from it along with him .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; Mandela should n't apologize for anything , did the apartheid government apologize for enforcing an inhumane system ? I 'm not saying he should - that 's my point .

Interestingly ( and to go off point a little ) , Margaret Thatcher 's government also supported the Apartheid regime in South Africa .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; in the worst cases , they intentionally sent police to the wrong areas . I assume you 're talking about Omagh here , which will lead me to point out that it was the Real IRA who carried out that attack and not the PIRA - or are you going to tell me that Martin McGuinness was involved with the Real IRA in 1998 when he was negotiating the Good Friday Agreement ? I 'm not going to sit here and try to defend planting bombs in public areas because that 's indefensible . But it seems to me that if your sole objective is to kill civilians then it seems odd that you would give warnings before you do so . That was my point . & gt ; This is splitting hairs - he was very likely to have been involved in several bombings , and was even briefly arrested for being near bomb parts . To say otherwise is just denial of the evidence . It 's not splitting hairs . How does being second in command of the IRA 's brigade in Derry equate to being second in command of the whole IRA ?",English,Native,,Native
"I do n't think Mandela ever admitted that he was wrong in doing what he did , but I suppose that 's a separate argument . Of course McGuinness played a role in planning IRA attacks - I did n't dispute that . As I see it though , you 'd need to be equally magnanimous to assume that Mandela did n't know about the pub bombings , car bombings and street bombings that MK were carrying out . Pretending that the IRA targeted civilians when they planted bombs in public areas but that MK were only targeting industry and economy when they did it is ... well , ridiculous - especially when the IRA gave warnings before their bombs and MK did n't ( as far as I 'm aware , correct me if I 'm wrong ) . Also , McGuinness was n't second in command of the IRA overall - he was second in command of the IRA 's operation in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday . He 's also rumoured to have been a part of the army council - but that also does n't really equate to being second in command if true , because the army council had seven members .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; Why do you think Mandela is the be all and end all here ? He was wrong to oppose that . Shock horror . I have similar feelings on him as I do the IRA lot , except he noticeably changed which only Marty really did with the IRA . & gt ; My apologies Marty went to jail for 6 whole months for being near a bomb . He 's obviously served his time . /s I do n't , I just happen to think that peoples attitudes on this subject tend to be hypocritical . Mandela 's an example of someone who completely supported using violence to achieve political change , only to change in his later years ( but not a whole lot as that article I linked shows ) . Martin McGuinness clearly believed the same thing when he was in the IRA but his view obviously changed as well and Northern Ireland is a better place now because of that fact .",English,Native,,Native
"What murders is McGuinness implicated in ? Are you seriously going to tell me that Nelson Mandela played no part or had no knowledge of the attacks that his organisation was carrying out ? I 'm not sure Mandela himself ever even pretended that . Also , MK 's violent campaign started in December 1961 - Mandela was arrested in August 1962 . McGuinness also campaigned for peace and equality from pretty much the mid 1980 's onwards .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; Mandela went to jail . Mandela apologised . Neither McGuinness nor Adams will even confess .

Also , Mandela was imprisoned by an Apartheid regime - or did you forget that part ? McGuinness was imprisoned as well by the Special Criminal Court in Ireland .

"& gt ; The old IRA and the Provisinal IRA are as legitimate as east other according to Sinn Fein supporters . It 's true , though . You can tack on `` according to Sinn Fein supporters '' all you like but it does n't diminish the fact that there was little to no public support for armed rebellion in the Republic until the British were foolish enough to execute the leaders of the 1916 Rising . Also , Irish people in the mid 10 's were n't treated as second class citizens in their own country - as was the case in Northern Ireland when the PIRA began to gain support . There was nothing glamorous about the way the `` Old '' IRA fought the war of independence either . It was bloody , it was brutal and it often led to the deaths of innocent people as well as British forces . That 's how guerrilla warfare tends to go . This notion that the IRA in the early 1920 's were in some way morally superior to people like Martin McGuinness who chose to join the PIRA in the late 60 's is just hypocrisy . And lazy hypocrisy at that .",English,Native,,Native

& gt ; Some on here will dispute what I said and I will be downvoted by the Celtic shirt wearers but I really could not care .

I do n't know why you seem to think you 're being controversial here because you 're not .

Your point about the government is n't exactly accurate either . Look up the Arms Crisis . Two cabinet members ( Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney ) attempted to smuggle arms to the PIRA in the North . Blaney claimed that the then government was fully aware of the conspiracy .

Gandhi was born into a completely different system . You ca n't just transplant him from India to Northern Ireland and expect him to turn out the same way . Also , Gandhi made frequent use of Hunger Strikes to get his point across - I do n't think I need to remind you of what happened when republicans tried the same . The Hindu religion also heavily influenced Gandhi and how he interacted with the Indian population . Religion in Northern Ireland was the exact opposite of a unifying factor .",English,Native,,Native
For people outside of Ireland and the UK who may be curious - Northern Ireland has a devolved government with a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister who are essentially Northern Ireland 's co-equal leaders . They 're the leaders of the biggest Nationalist party ( Sinn Fein ) and Loyalist party ( the DUP ) respectively . McGuinness resigning essentially means that Arlene Foster 's position as the First Minister is rendered null and void too . This almost certainly means an election unless Sinn Fein nominate somebody to replace McGuinness - which they 've said they wo n't do .,English,Native,,Native

If everything he 's saying about Adams is true then that would be an incredibly stupid move because it would all but confirm it to the public . The point I 'm making is that it 's an allegation made by someone we do n't know anything about apart from what you heard on that programme . You 're saying it 's dumb for people to mindlessly defend Adams and it is - but it 's also dumb to completely believe what a TV programme is saying when they 've provided scant to no evidence to back it up .

"I 'm not sure what you want me to tell you - what you 've said is right , but the prevailing attitude at the time was that France was the biggest land power in Europe . That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",English,Native,,Native
Agreed . The problem with trying to portray the conflict as a simple religious conflict is that it completely oversimplifies the origins of it . The conflict was political . The Orange state was segregated - one side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of influence and power over the other and they abused it . The RUC ( and later the army ) responded to peaceful Nationalist protests by beating them off the streets and Loyalist gangs burned entire communities out of their homes in Belfast . That 's why the PIRA started to grow . Nobody joined the PIRA in the early 1970 's because they were Catholic . Painting the Troubles as a purely religious conflict is revisionism at its worst . It makes it seem as if this was something that was always going to happen in the North regardless of what the political situation was . It absolves the British and Loyalist communities of the responsibility they have for the origins of the conflict in the first place .,English,Native,,Native

"Ah now , you 're being even more revisionist . The ceasefire broke down mostly because the British Government were refusing to allow Sinn Fein to take part in peace talks unless the PIRA completely decommissioned all of its arms . John Major 's government was depending on unionists to keep its majority so they refused to back down from that position . It 's also complete nonsense to suggest that the IRA came to the negotiating table because John Bruton had no time for them . The ceasefire was resumed because the British Government eventually decided to include SF in the peace talks if the IRA reinstated it . Which they did . It 's why Loyalists will later accuse Blair 's government of being `` Bombed back to the table '' . Either way , and to get back to the point a bit , the 1994 ceasefire pretty much ended the majority of the violence . Loyalist paramilitaries announced ceasefires shortly after it . Reynolds played a very active role in achieving that and I think he deserves a lot of credit for it .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; Also , Bruton set up the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement which Ahern finished off . Huh ? What sort of revisionism is this ? The IRA ceasefire broke down when Bruton was in power .

It was something that required an enormous amount of work , diplomacy and risk from all sides but mostly from the parties in N. Ireland itself . Ahern and Bruton before him might have facilitated dialogue between the conflicting sides in the North but they certainly did n't come up with the whole agreement ( and the plan to implement it ) all by themselves . Also , did n't Bruton ( while in power ) say he was fed up talking about the peace process ? I have n't heard another political leader from Ireland or Britain say that . Especially not when it was in its most crucial period . I do n't see why he deserves any additional credit for the peace process but I 'll gladly stand corrected if there 's more to it .",English,Native,,Native

It 's very easy to apply hindsight to the situation and say `` well non violence was clearly the better option '' . Any one of us can say that .

Also , as per the GFA , the Republic would need to pass a referendum on Irish unity too - not just the North . & gt ; I 'd argue that your involvement in hypothetical unity talks would actually hamper the whole process because you carry too much toxic baggage . And the Loyalist side does n't ? Really , this sort of mentality just breeds whataboutism . Sinn Fein are in government in the North and they 're the 3rd largest party in the Republic . Do you seriously think it 's reasonable to exclude them from unity talks ? They 're signatories of the GFA as well , you know . Partisan attitudes like yours really do my head in . You ca n't start excluding people from a United Ireland before it 's even fucking happened .",English,Native,,Native

"Your tinfoil theory is n't really all that tinfoiley - it 's mostly true . They 're not taught about it in their schools and they 're not typically taught about the terrible things that the British Empire has done all around the world . They know quite a lot about the good things the Empire did for the world , but next to nothing of the bad things . British people are brought up to be proud of their history even though a lot of them do n't even understand it properly . Most of them know nothing about Churchill 's more controversial actions , for example , and yet they all but deify the man . This applies to their actions in Ireland too . What always irritates me about how the Troubles is talked about is how often it 's categorised as a religious conflict . That 's just patently untrue - it was a political conflict that arose because of the way the Orange state was treating the Catholic/Nationalist minority . It arose from the state forces ' decision to brutally suppress civil rights marches and movements . Pretending that it was simply a conflict of religions that was always going to happen because of how divided the North was almost completely absolves the Northern and British governments from their responsibility in starting the conflict to begin with .

Surely that alone immediately means that we wo n't be paying the same amount as the UK government ? .

"Honestly , nobody really knows what the actual cost of unification would be . It 's universally accepted that there would be a significant short term cost . The long term costs/benefits are much less clear . I happen to think that in the long term , it can only strengthen the Irish economy because gaining two strong economic centres ( Belfast & amp ; Derry ) will bring growth to the communities surrounding them . This helps places like Donegal that have been pretty isolated ever since partition . It also removes currency as an obstacle - the Republic no longer loses trade to the North when the sterling currency is weaker and vice versa - the economic environment is much more consistent . Also , I agree that the Defence costs would be increased by a decent amount , but foreign affairs ? Ireland already has a Department of Foreign Affairs ...",English,Native,,Native

There will be a significant cost to the republic if reunification happens , of that there 's no doubt , but I sincerely doubt that we would end up funding the same amount that the UK government does . Incidentally , reunification can only be a positive thing for the border communities that have been left isolated since partition .

It might cost us in the short term but in the long term , cities like Derry and Belfast can only bring economic benefits to the country as time goes on .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; Are you trying to paint Austin Stacks in a bad light because he renege on a deal with the group that murdered his father ?

Now , Austin Stack wants Adams to reveal this man 's identity , and he even claims to know who the man is - but seems to stop short of informing the Gardai of his identity himself . He also stated in 2013 , before he even met with Adams , that he was confident he knew the identities of those involved in killing his father - and yet we 're led to believe that he would n't put those names to Adams when he meets with him ?

"You 're applying your own perspective to the situation . The facts are that Adams facilitated a meeting between the Stack brothers and a senior figure in the IRA who supposedly knew who carried out their father 's murder .

As for me , I think it 's pretty damn unlikely that , after over 30 years in his position , Adams has suddenly decided to name names . Nobody seems to like to acknowledge the fact that if Adams did give these names himself without Stack providing them to him , then he 's likely to be in pretty big trouble - the IRA are n't likely to take kindly to it . Stack is likely to deny providing the names for the same reason .

Cuba spent the better part of 60 years under a crippling blockade by the most powerful country in the world - pretty soon after they overthrew a properly brutal dictator who made Castro look like Pope Francis .

I do remember reading a study that stated that about 1/3 of Seoul is within range of the North Korean artillery stationed along the DMZ - but they also supposedly have quite a large stockpile of chemical weapons . The contaminants in these chemical shells could spread a decent bit further away from where it impacted - depending on weather conditions and such . North Korea is a state that will be fighting for its own existence if war breaks out . I think it 's pretty likely that they will resort to using these kinds of weapons .

Artillery pieces that are also capable of launching chemical and biological weapons at the south too , by the way . Americans presuming that they have the right to decide the fate of a city like Seoul , or the fate of the millions of North Koreans that South Korea and China will need to house and feed when the war is over is one of the most fucked up things about all of this . Nobody else in that region wants this war to happen at all , nobody else is frothing at the mouth to get in a conflict with the North Koreans - the USA and North Korea are both unique in that respect .

North Korea has literally thousands of conventional artillery guns pointed directly at Seoul . They can kill thousands , perhaps even millions , of South Koreans without needing nuclear weapons .

North Korea would definitely lose in a conflict with South Korea , the USA and Japan . But they pack a punch .

You can also clearly see the very high percentage of Muslims who support the death penalty for apostasy . More and more polls from across the Islamic world show the same thing - very high levels of support for these kinds of beliefs . This is a very complicated issue and there are no easy solutions - but we need to be honest about what the problems are . These toxic beliefs , and the readiness with which many Muslims adopt them , are a very big part of the problem . Pretending that the vast vast majority of the Islamic world holds the exact same sorts of values and beliefs that we do , and that the extremists are just a fringe group whose beliefs are completely different from the core faith , is just being wilfully ignorant , and it does n't line up with the facts .",English,Native,,Native

Partisan politics is the whole reason that America is in this position to begin with . Stubbornly clinging to it wo n't bring them out of it .

He wo n't do anything that damages this self-centred image he has of himself .

"& gt ; We are talking about a middle east/north Africa country that has spent the last 7 years trying to prevent Islamic extremists from taking over their country and turning it into another syria style shithole . Egypt elected the Muslim brotherhood into power - democratically . They were overthrown in a coup d'etat by the Egyptian military who have pretty much been in power ever since . El-Sisi is essentially a military dictator - but the west does n't like to call him that because he overthrew the Muslim brotherhood who , again , were elected . If you 're fine with supporting yet another military dictator in an African country , then that 's your problem . & gt ; So I believe in democratic principles in democratic principled countries , but unfortunately the middle east and North Africa is n't exactly well known for their history of democratic principles .

It is possible for countries to not know what they 're missing or to not know how democracy could benefit them . Perpetually denying these rights to people who live in these countries because they do n't fit your template for a country that deserves them is ridiculous .

I do n't need to be a defender of the Muslim brotherhood to point out that people should not be imprisoned and face the death penalty because they attended a protest . If you disagree with that , then you should probably take a long hard look at yourself . Viewed through that lens , the Irish government has every right to get involved . Like it or not , Halawa is an Irish citizen - and he is facing the death penalty for attending a protest in Egypt . Does that mean I agree with him ? No .

Halawa was a fucking idiot to attend that protest in Egypt - but if you think that someone deserves to be facing the death penalty for attending a protest , then you 're making a very undemocratic argument that plays perfectly into the hands of the Egyptian regime . Ireland has every right to get involved when one of its citizens is imprisoned for 4 years , and is facing the death penalty , for attending a protest .

If there is a war though , it 's very likely that South Korea will have its capital either destroyed , or nearly destroyed . This is a city with 25 million people and it has thousands of conventional artillery pieces pointed at it from the North . North Korea does n't need nuclear weapons to reduce Seoul to rubble .

"Of course it furthers my argument . Mass deporting all Muslims implies that all Muslims are our enemy and completely ignores the fact that Muslims are fighting and dying in greater numbers in the war against ISIS and other extremist groups than pretty much anyone else . ISIS wants us to see them as the legitimate voice of the Islamic world and we grant them this legitimacy if we act in this way . With all of that being said - there is a massive problem in the Islamic world and with the Islamic faith . If someone can kill dozens of innocent people and expect divine reward for doing so , and if their `` interpretation '' of the faith remains a pretty straightforward one as far as the original texts are concerned - then of course there is a massive problem within the faith . This is why this should be considered a war of ideas and this is why we need to empower moderate Muslims within the Islamic world . How do we do that ? Again , I do n't know . But mass deportations is definitely the completely wrong approach because it alienates *everyone* - including the moderates .",English,Native,,Native

I have no problem whatsoever with deporting Islamic extremists and even fundamentalists , who are a threat to our people - but when you start alienating the people who you need to win this war of ideas then you 're only making the problem worse because you immediately grant that the most extreme elements within Islam are representative of the entire group .

"But it 's simply the best value for the money that you 're spending in many cases .

Ryzen is much much better for streaming , editing , multitasking or basically anything that can take advantage of multiple cores . Intel 's i5 's ca n't hold a candle to the Ryzen 5 's in this respect . For gaming , the performance difference favours intel for sure - but again , if you 're looking at the price to performance ratio , Ryzen still comes out pretty well because the difference in gaming performance is relatively small . If you have a decent GPU in both cases , then you really wo n't see a tangible difference . I ca n't remember who but one reviewer explained this very well . Ryzen is better at gaming than the corresponding Intel chips are at multitasking and cpu intensive workloads . So basically , you end up with a chip that really is a jack of all trades .

"You know perfectly well what I mean and you 're deliberately misrepresenting it - so please stop . I never tried to imply that the region was `` peachy '' . Saddam Hussein was probably the single worst dictator we 've had since the second world war , and his regime was brutal . However , the region itself was kept in a relative stability because Saddam Hussein saw Islamic extremism as a threat to his authority and he suppressed it - often brutally . To answer your points - no . Neither of those things contributed to destabilising the entire middle eastern region in the same way that invading Iraq and deposing Saddam did . How do I know this ? Because the entire region ( ie . not just Iraq ) did not become what it is today until after Saddam was deposed . The schism between Shia and Sunni has existed for literally centuries - so that has always been a destabilising factor in the region . The chemical attack on Halabja was a crime against humanity ( along with Hussein 's entire genocidal policy on the Kurds ) - but it did n't destabilise the entire region .

"& gt ; Yeah i hate the way the SCC restricts the rights of serious criminals and terrorists to intimidate juries . In most democratic societies you are a ) . Innocent until proven guilty and b ) . Entitled to a fair trial in which you will be judged by a jury of your peers . The SCC does n't uphold those two principles . You can make all the noise you want about terrorists and the intimidation of juries , but that still does n't alter the fact that it is by its nature an unfair court . The UN Human rights commission , Amnesty International and the ICCL are just three organisations who have criticised the SCC . Also , when it was established in 1972 it was intended to only be a temporary court . So we 've had a temporary court with wide-ranging , undemocratic powers for the last 45 years . You might be fine with that , but I 'm not .

These people are literally willing to die , as long as they kill as many innocents in the process . You might not want to accept that there is a difference - but there quite obviously is . These are people who do n't even value their own lives enough to give themselves pause . I did n't resort to any sort of mental gymnastics when I made that point . It 's wilful ignorance to pretend that there is no difference . At no point did I say that the IRA never intended to kill anyone either . Stop twisting my words .

The IRA did n't plant bombs with the sole intention of killing as many innocents as they possibly could - evidenced by the fact that they gave any sort of warning in the first place . They also had no expectation of divine reward and they were n't willing to blow themselves up in the process . It might seem trivial to some people considering the end results - but these `` trivialities '' are important . They made a peace process possible .

SF are , by quite a margin , the biggest nationalist party in the North . They represent a large number of Nationalists - they 're already key participants in power sharing so to me it seems inevitable that they need to be key participants in showing Unionists that a United Ireland is a place in which they are welcome .",English,Native,,Native

Why would Unionists be any more willing to vote for one of two parties who never even attempted to run candidates in the North ? What hope does a party like Fine Gael , who have little to no connection with Northern Ireland , have of convincing a population from there to see things their way ? Unionism is still at odds with Republicanism in the North . The only way to bridge this gap is by having Unionists and Republicans in the North working together - that 's the pre-requisite . Sinn Fein have a large majority among the Nationalist community so the onus is arguably on them to convince Unionists that their vision for a united Ireland is one that includes them .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; I really hope this does n't trigger a resurgence of the IRA . The last thing the UK needs is a repeat of The Troubles . Unlikely . Northern Ireland in the late 60 's and early 70 's was basically a sectarian shithole . Catholics/Nationalists were essentially second class citizens - they did n't have the same ability to vote , most of the land/businesses were owned by Protestants who refused to hire Catholics and when the Catholic community arranged peaceful protests to oppose this situation , they were met with state violence on behalf of the RUC ( police ) and later the British army , and also violence from the Loyalist/Protestant community who started rioting at these protests and even burned entire streets of Catholics out of their homes . The British army was actually sent into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect Catholic communities from loyalist pogroms and gangs . It was within this climate that the IRA gained its support among the Catholic/Nationalist community . They promised to defend Catholic areas from Loyalist violence and to push back against the state forces . As you can imagine , this was a popular idea among Nationalists and the IRA grew in support - particularly after Bloody Sunday . Northern Ireland is a completely different place today . Organisations like the IRA simply would n't gain the support of entire communities anymore because the political climate is so drastically different . Put simply , most people have no reason to resort to or justify violent acts anymore .",English,Native,,Native

Catholics are n't second class citizens anymore and they are n't having their peaceful protests being met with state violence - so there would be literally no public support for them today . It 's more likely that the smaller dissident groups may become more active - but nothing like there was during the Troubles .

That 's not the same thing as `` not answering the question '' . The UK has also always had a certain level of dependence on migrant workers . The notion that you can just get up one day , stop immigration and then expect your country 's problems to disappear with all of those brown people is just ridiculous . Now , Corbyn 's stance on it might have been obscure I 'll grant - but the British media was never going to be happy with any answer that did n't broadly align with the Tory position .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; Hume 's role was to persuade the IRA to stop killing people . That 's what he set out to and did achieve . Hume had no influence with the IRA - it was n't Hume who persuaded the IRA to do anything . It was people who held influence with the IRA , like Adams and McGuinness , who convinced them to call a ceasefire . Hume 's role was in convincing people on both sides that the conflict was pointless and in opening a dialogue with Sinn Fein that led to them putting pressure on the IRA to call a ceasefire . Hume made an immeasurable contribution to the peace process so I 'll never understand why people still try to attribute things to him that he did n't do , when his actual contributions were pretty hefty in the first place . He did n't persuade the IRA to do anything because he did n't have any influence with them to persuade them to do anything . Hume would not have succeeded in his endeavors without Sinn Fein and the peace process would not have happened without them either . That 's a fact . I do n't see the issue with acknowledging that .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; There is this unbearable tendency in the west today to treat Arabs like children who can never act but can only react to what the western adults do -- naked , brown children running around without any agency whatsoever . & gt ; This is absurd , and if this were a western organization they would never be shielded from responsibility this way . & gt ; They are adults , responsible for their own choices and actions . No one forced them to adopt the principles of medieval theocracy and try to carry them out in the 21st century . They chose to do this . While I do concede that those who actually physically formed and organised ISIS do deserve the bulk of the blame , your response seems to ignore some general facets of human nature . I 'm not viewing Arabs and Middle-Easterners as children . They are no more susceptible to falling victim to tyrannical regimes than any other group of people - hell , it was happening in Eastern Europe in the 90 's . Your assertion that everyone who is currently under the yoke of the Islamic state knowingly chose to be under that yoke is just wrong . The majority of them probably just ended up living there because of pure dumb luck when ISIS chopped up Iraq and Syria - these people just happened to be living in areas that fell into their control . The argument I was making is that ISIS and al Qaeda were both non existent in Iraq until Saddam was deposed . Now , Saddam Hussein was probably the worst dictator the world has seen since Hitler - but he was just as brutal towards Islamic extremists as he was with any other perceived threat to his power . Toppling Saddam 's regime without replacing it with a strong ( and preferably non sectarian ) government ( and also disbanding the Iraqi military ) is what allowed ISIS and al Qaeda to establish their footholds in Iraq .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; Quick question , but does the reverse also apply to Sinn Fein ? As in if they formed a coalition in the republic that they would then breach the GFA because both the Irish and UK governments need to be neutral guarantors and honest brokers ? It 's similar but not the same . The UK government are sovereign in Northern Ireland and therefore already have a bigger say in Northern Irish affairs than the government of the Republic . The DUP being in government in the UK could have direct implications for power sharing in the North because the UK government then has a clear conflict of interest - Sinn Fein being in government in the Republic would n't .

There is far more going on at one time in that game than this one , I understand that last gen consoles were not the priority but the state that this game is in just makes it look like they really did n't give a shit and wanted to release it as a cash cow .

Sinn Fein 's increasing popularity means FF 's status as `` the Republican Party '' is being challenged . This seems to be them lashing out in an attempt to hold on to that title and make them at least seem to be a tiny bit different from FG . I personally think it 's poor form for Fianna Fail of all parties to be making jabs at Sinn Fein over the Troubles . Fianna Fail were in power long enough to make a difference during that time period but they ( and successive Irish governments ) turned their backs on the Nationalist/Republican communities in the North when their help was needed more than ever - at least until Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach . If the Catholic minority were getting a bit more backing from Dublin the IRA might not have gained as much support as it did .,English,Native,,Native

I think it 's more interesting that a large number of Irish people are more interested in seeing Mary Lou have her wrist slapped over this than actually seeing any accountability from their government .

"It does - that 's my point . People on jobbridge schemes ( and others ) are considered as being `` employed '' and are therefore contributing to the rising employment figures .

JobBridge was established in 2011 and unemployment 's been `` decreasing '' since around January of 2012 - jobbridge and schemes liked it have been contributing to the reduction of the unemployment rate since then . I 'm not sure what your point is . Unemployment 's been `` decreasing '' fairly steadily since the adoption of these schemes . My position on it is that they should not be considered under the same heading as actual proper jobs that pay employees a workable wage/salary - they should be considered separately from the employment figures .

They promised universal health care for everyone and this is what they 're actually giving us . Free gp care for a small minority of the population . An important minority , but a minority nonetheless . And it 's no coincidence that it 's being introduced now either with less than a year before a general election .

There is a widespread problem in the institution itself , but I 'm still of the opinion that the majority of gardai are decent people . You 'll find corrupt arseholes in every line of work . It 's disappointing that there 's been as much corruption as there is but it 's not massively surprising either - and I think that the garda siochana itself will be a better institution once this shite has all been sorted out .

"Ireland is a country that was founded by people with blood on their hands . People who ordered deaths , atrocities , bombings , assassinations - the whole lot . People we 'll be celebrating next year , as it happens . Governments kill people , the only difference is the British government ( and other governments worldwide ) are able to do it without having the term `` terrorist '' applied to them . And yes , the Paras were n't running for any public office , but on the subject of Pat Finucane , it 's claimed that some very senior politicians in Margaret Thatcher 's government knew all about the collusion with the loyalist paramilitaries . You can debate how relevant that is to the discussion if you want but there 's no shortage of politicians on the other side of the fence who have as much , if not more , blood on their hands as Sinn Fein . We never hear as much bloviating about them , do we ? Gerry Adams has been `` playing big boy politics with the grown ups '' for a very long time now - say what you like about him but he 's considered one of the most adept politicians on the island . I do n't think even people who hate the man can deny that the Peace Process was a monumental political achievement ( probably the biggest political achievement since the foundation of the state ) - and it would never have happened without Gerry Adams . We can discuss his character and his methods but I personally do n't think his political competency is up for debate .",English,Native,,Native
"Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and really an awful lot of Sinn Fein politicians are talked into making apologies for the IRA almost every time they take to the air . You 're being disingenuous when you say that the Brits have a better record when it comes to apologising for their crimes . They apologised for Bloody Sunday , but it took thirty eight years , a shambles of a report and a twelve year inquiry before they dropped their accusations that the innocent people who were killed attacked the paras first . Maybe you know more than I do , but I do n't recall the British Government ever apologising for Ballymurphy , or even acknowledging their responsibility for it for that matter . Why is n't our media focusing on getting justice for those families too ? Jean McConville 's murder was an atrocity , but why is it more important than the Ballymurphy families ? And this is the problem . There 's always another death , another atrocity and another finger pointing at the other side . The line needs to be drawn somewhere or we just keep going back and forth and the peace process will remain in an uneasy stasis forever , or break down entirely . Personally , I just think it 's deplorable that so many people on this side of the border pick and choose their atrocities because of how they feel about Gerry Adams or Sinn Fein .",English,Native,,Native

On a daily basis , I see people ( not suggesting you 're one of them ) posting things here that display a general lack of understanding for the reasons why the Troubles started , the reasons they continued for so long and the reasons why they ended - so I tend to comment fairly extensively on the subject when I see it come up .",English,Native,,Native

Daily bomb scares - both real and hoax , public shootings , army checkpoints and thousands of dead and injured victims . And that 's only dealing with the attitude behind the remark . Now I 'll deal with the subject of it . Gerry Adams , love him or hate him , played an absolutely massive role in the peace process and in the decommissioning of the PIRA . Like it or not , the Troubles probably would n't have ended without his intervention . Now , if you can seriously believe that the peace process ( in its near-permanent state of instability ) would not be endangered if Gerry Adams ( or his family ) were to be blown up by dissidents then I 'm not sure what else to say . The peace process is unstable enough that an incident like that could well be the spark that re-ignites the flame .

And yes , I 'm sure your second point rings true for certain people too , but I 'm still having trouble seeing where this relates to the `` dishonorable silence '' from the British government on charges of collusion . People on this side of the border always seem to get more riled up about what Republicans did than what the British did . How often have you heard Sinn Fein politicians being talked into making apologies for the IRA over the years ? Countless , and yet I do n't hear our government or media making a similar effort to get the British government to make their apologies . EDIT : I mean , it took 38 years , one sham report and one twelve-year inquiry to even get them to apologise for Bloody Sunday for christ sake .",English,Native,,Native
"It never ceases to amaze me how issues like these inevitably end up turning into debates on the morality and responsibility of Republicans . This was an article on the collusion between NI security forces and loyalist paramilitaries . The RUC were the police force of the Orange state , their job was to protect everyone who lived there , and instead they took a side . The responsibility for that resides with them , and them alone . Now , you could perhaps argue that Sinn Fein and Republicans are n't vocal enough on this subject , but that seems to contradict what you 've said at the end of your post . They 're trying to make political capital out of it , and yet they 're not pressing it ?",English,Native,,Native

"I am , yes . But then I 've been voting for them for the past few years . Sinn Fein have the largest political presence in my county ( Donegal ) , and they 've put a lot more effort into my area than any of the other parties . Probably not saying much but there we are . As for the leadership , I have a certain amount of sympathy for where you 're coming from OP , I admire Adams too , and at the same time , I can understand why people would be hesitant to vote for him . But I think it 's worth remembering that Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others ( including less controversial figures like Hume and the SDLP ) are largely responsible for the adoption of the single most significant political agreement in this country since probably the foundation of the state . People should remember that when they doubt their `` competance '' , as a few people here have mentioned . I think it 's also worth remembering that there was a very good reason for Adams 's repeated denial of being a member of the IRA . He needed to hold influence with fellow politicians ( who would be infinitely less willing to negotiate with him if he admitted to being a member ) but he also needed to maintain his influence with the IRA and IRA hardliners to be able to actually bring anything meaningful to the negotiation table ( which is why he has always vocally supported them too ) .

They seem to be desperately searching for a niche to fill .

"So ... the Irish government are `` others '' , in your view ? It 's not as if I 'm blaming a foreign country for our problems - I 'm blaming our government for it . And that 's more than fair , if you ask me . You 're treating the symptom as if it were the cause . There 's a bloody reason why people are n't arsed to learn their country 's language - and as far as I 'm concerned , putting it down to sheer laziness is an oversimplification . The fact is , the Irish language is pushed on everyone from a fairly young age , you 're made to learn it because that 's what 's required of you , not because you actually like speaking it . It takes away any real love for the language when you 're forced to do it incessantly , even if you do n't like learning off poems and stories by heart . EDIT : On top of that , you never really `` speak '' the language anyway . Aside from the stupid Leaving Cert oral , most of your time is spent learning the same sort of pseudo-academic shite that you learn off for English - the only difference being that most people are already fluent with English and it is n't as tedious .",English,Native,,Native
"Yeah fair point , it 's been neglected by every government in recent memory . I still think the buck stops with the government in power though . I absolutely hate the fact that I spent about thirteen years of my life learning a language that I 'm still terrible at . What I hate even more is the fact that the way it 's taught makes it extremely tedious for most students to learn , who will then lose any interest in pursuing it when they get older .

Civil rights marches were brutally and savagely put down by the RUC and , afterwards , the British Army . And that 's where a lot of this started . The protestors in those early days were n't actually campaigning for a united Ireland . They were marching for civil rights - and they were being tramped on by their own police force . Some of them turned to violence because they 'd reached the end of their tolerance - we can debate how right or wrong that is in a separate discussion but I do n't think it 's our place to judge people who felt they had no alternative either .

If Robb did legitimize him , Jon is the heir to the North . Simple as that . I just do n't see this happening , though . Even if Jon is still alive , it 's completely against his character for him to disinherit Ned 's `` legitimate '' children from their birthright . To answer your question , no . Even if he is legitimized , he ca n't be King and LC . His oathes to the Night 's Watch forbid him from becoming King in the first place , so something will have to give . As to how powerful the North is , the answer at the moment is not very . In peacetime , the North can muster ( at the very most ) 40000 men , but it very rarely does , because the North is so vast it makes mustering their full manpower extremely difficult . Robb had 18000 troops , and most of them are either dead or scattered now . The North , militarily speaking , is n't much of a threat to the Southern Kingdoms at the moment , but it 's still strong enough to destroy them in a defensive war if a Southern army is stupid enough to attack them in the Neck .",English,Native,,Native
"In fairness though , Arya would n't have known anything about Roose 's pending betrayal . It 's still odd that she would n't have said anything to him .",English,Native,,Native
"For me , Rickon represents the future of House Stark . Feudal laws say that Bran is higher than Rickon in the line of succession , but I honestly ca n't see Bran ever returning from the cave of the three-eyed crow . I believe he 'll remain there , and continue doing whatever it is that Bloodraven does . Jon Snow is a bastard , and despite the many theories kicking around that he 's been legitimised by Robb , I just ca n't see it happening . Even if he has been legitimised , even if he 's survived his caeser-ing and even if he continues to ride south , it 's completely and totally against his character for him to place himself ahead of Sansa or ( fake ) Arya ( the only siblings he knows to be still alive ) in the line of succession . He might try and fight against the Boltons , but he wo n't claim Winterfell . Sansa is a woman . Should Bran , Rickon or even a legitimised Jon Snow appear , they 're all ahead of her in the line of succession . The Northerners would never support her over one of Eddard 's sons , which is why I can not see her holding the North . At least , not permanently . Arya is the least likely of the lot to inherit the North . She 's stuck with the Faceless Men , and who knows where she 'll end up after that . For these reasons , I 'm fairly certain that Rickon will eventually inherit the North . The majority of the Northern lords would n't hesitate to offer him their fealty , especially if his wolf is with him .",English,Native,,Native
"Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister is perfect . Absolutely spot on , I 'm now picturing Tywin as he is in the show when I re-read the books , and that 's something . He 's made Tywin look like even more of a badass . Sean Bean was fantastic as Ned Stark . What can I say , the man knows how to die . Peter Dinklage needs no explanation . Michael McElhatton is cold , calculating and always carries a silent threat . Perfect for Roose Bolton . Iain Glen does a superb job as Jorah Mormont . He 's got the voice that 's delivered some of the shows more memorable quotes . Stephen Dillane is a great actor , and he plays the part of Stannis excellently . The problem is how the part itself is written . They 've all but butchered his character . Catelyn is probably one of my least favourite characters in the series . Despite this Michelle Fairley was superb . I still do n't like the character , but her performance was flawless . All in all , the quality of the cast for AGOT is excellent . I ca n't really say that any character 's main faults stem from a poor performance by their actor . The biggest problem I have with the show is how they 've messed with a few character 's story arcs . Stannis , Mance , Shae and Talisa to name a few . I did n't see these changes as being necessary .",English,Native,,Native

"It was a strategic error to seek help from Balon Greyjoy in such a fashion anyway , and it came from Robb ( and Theon , really ) having a poor understanding of Ironborn culture . His message was that he would `` give '' Balon a crown . Balon is a true Ironborn , and he does n't want to be given anything . He will pay the Iron Price for whatever he wants . As Theon observed himself , it was poor wording , and if you read that exert from ACOK , it 's obvious to see that Balon was tempted , but that he could n't bring himself to accept the fact that he would n't have made himself king .",English,Native,,Native

Also , it 's probably another reason why Tywin stayed neutral in Robert 's Rebellion , Jaime was the only member of the Kingsguard that Aerys kept close to him , essentially keeping him as a glorified hostage to ensure his father 's good behaviour . It backfired pretty badly on Aerys , though . Edit : Jaime and Cersei had been conspiring to get Jaime on the Kingsguard anyway . Tywin was Hand of the King at the time , and Cersei believed that if Jaime was named to the Kingsguard , he 'd be close to her at all times . However , when he actually joined the KG , Tywin was furious and resigned as Hand of the King , taking Cersei back to Casterly Rock with him and leaving Jaime with the King .",English,Native,,Native

"Religion was n't what started the conflict and the PIRA did n't gain their support among the nationalist community simply because they were Catholic . The conflict was a political one from the very beginning . One side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of power over the other and abused this authority for their own benefit . When the Nationalist community began to push back against this with civil rights marches , they were violently put down by Loyalist gangs , the RUC and eventually the British Army . This led to the growth of the PIRA . In the late 60 's and early 70 's , people did n't join the IRA for religious reasons - they joined for political reasons . The effort to portray this as a simple conflict of religions is , to me , an effort to oversimplify the conflict and absolve the British government and Loyalist communities of a lot of the blame that they are due because of their respective roles in starting the conflict to begin with .",English,Native,,Native

Robb was far too honourable to let his mother 's people die at the hands of the Lannisters . The unfortunate thing is that the Riverlands are very , very difficult to defend .

Barristan tries to point out to her that Ned was known by pretty much everyone to be a man of honour , and was the most prominent voice to speak up against Tywin when he had the royal children killed . I think it would be a very interesting conversation for Dany . She never seems interested in understanding how or why so many prominent Lords decided to rebel against her family , and she has a habit of viewing these people as nothing but evil enemies . This probably stems from the years she spent listening to Viserys 's rhetoric , but I think if Dany is to succeed then she needs to understand her enemies better .

The Nationalist population in the North was absolutely shafted by the treaty and continued to be shafted ( and largely ignored by successive Irish governments ) up until the 1970 's and 1980 's .

And as an Irishman myself , I find it difficult to stomach the fact that Churchill 's virtues are endlessly praised and his many , many failings ( and frequent bouts of bigotry ) are brushed under the rug .

I also happen to think that there 's a difference between moving on from the events of a conflict and actively commemorating the soldiers of the wrinkled old Empire that you were fighting against . If you think we should be commemorating them , fair enough . I do n't think we have any obligation to . Try applying your argument to a different situation . For Britain to have a healthy relationship with Germany , they should commemorate the soldiers who died fighting for the Nazis along with their own ? America should commemorate dead Japanese servicemen ? Serbia should commemorate soldiers who died fighting for the Austro-Hungarian Empire ? Come on .

"I think we 're talking about two different things here . The British military was always going to reply no matter where or when the conflict began - that still does n't mean that we have any obligation to commemorate soldiers who fought for an empire that has a history of oppressing our country .

I think that their city mayors also laid wreaths to commemorate British soldiers who died fighting in the world wars .

"I know , and I think that 's regrettable - because it 's such a narrow and simplistic explanation for the conflict . In the early days , the civil rights marches that would lead to the IRA gaining support had absolutely nothing to do with a united Ireland . That did n't stop the RUC from beating their peaceful protests off the streets and it did n't stop loyalist gangs from burning catholics and nationalists out of their homes . Which , incidentally , is why the British army was sent in to begin with . To protect Catholic communities . You 'd be amazed how many people do n't know that - they assume that the British army was sent in to fight the IRA .",English,Native,,Native
"I ca n't give a solid answer regarding the war of independence but internment was used after the 1916 rising . There was a pretty interesting documentary on TG4 about it a while back actually , over a thousand Irishmen who fought in the rising were interned in a detention camp in Wales . Apparently that 's where Michael Collins began to gain more and more influence in the IRB . It supposedly became a training ground for would be Irish revolutionaries who would then fight in the war of independence . So , fairly safe to say that it did n't work out too well there either .",English,Native,,Native
"Internment was a complete and utter disaster in the North . The H Blocks became a symbol of state oppression and only helped to further the IRA 's propaganda campaign against the Orange State . It got even worse in the 80 's when prisoners had their special category status removed - that 's what led to the hunger strikes . The problem with internment is that it represents an erosion of civil liberties . In the North , thousands of people were imprisoned throughout internment and you only needed to be suspected of being associated with the IRA to end up in the maze . I do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say that a huge percentage of people who ended up in the maze were not criminals , and were not members of the IRA . As you point out , that may well have changed by the time they were released . Ireland is n't the only country in the world that has a problem with gangland crime . We do n't need to lower ourselves to removing citizen 's rights in order to deal with this problem .",English,Native,,Native
"Yes ... because internment worked so brilliantly in the North and elsewhere . What an absolutely moronic suggestion . Can anyone think of another western nation that has decided to bring in imprisonment without trial to deal with gangland crime ? It 's completely absurd . Why do n't we start by upping the Garda numbers , making sure they 're properly equipped and then attempting to deal with the massive income inequality that plagues Dublin 's north inner city ? Or , do what Portugal did and decriminalise drugs for those possessing up to a ten day 's supply . Seems to be working alright for them .",English,Native,,Native

"True , but I 'm not convinced that their gain in seats is solely down to their ability to manoeuvre their way out of tight spots . FG were not popular in government and they owed their success to a lot of voters who abandoned FF after the crash - a lot of those voters have more than likely simply switched back to FF . As much as I dislike the two big parties I almost hope that FF will accept this deal , just so we can get a government that 's stable enough to last longer than a few months . I do n't think I could stomach another election .",English,Native,,Native
"Yeah I 'm not even sure if dabs have any support staff in Ireland or not . I 've ordered from them in the past without a problem but when I tried to submit a recent order I had a similar experience to yours . The items were stuck at processing for dispatch for days and support tickets that I submitted went unanswered . I cancelled my order and went with amazon instead .

They 'll also have SF and the other parties beating them with the same stick too - it 's really a very clever move by Enda .,English,Native,,Native

You also still seem to think that they 're still the same entity , even post GFA - which is ridiculous . You 're judging modern-day SF by the actions of the PIRA 20 , 30 and 40 years ago . Why do n't we just take this a step further and judge FF , FG and Labour by the actions of the old IRB ? Or the Blueshirts ? You 're trying to say that modern day SF supporters do n't want to talk about it - that 's not the problem . That 's all I ever seem to talk about here - the problem is that that 's all the other political parties ever want to talk about . Where was that concern when it was actually happening ? Where 's the concern for the Ballymurphy families or other victims of British state violence ? This is what happens when you pick a side - you force everyone else to pick a side too and whataboutery is what you get . I really wish you 'd stop trying to portray people who voted for SF as being in some way supportive of atrocities that happened 40 years ago . If you 're trying to get me to say that I agree with how the PIRA disappeared people then you 're wasting your time - because it 's indefensible and I 'm not trying to defend it . But to try to imply that the entire SF political party and those who support it are in some way responsible for that is disgusting . And it needs to stop . To answer your question a bit more directly , no . I still think that people and media outlets who consistently use this as a political football do n't actually give a shit about the Disappeared - or any of the other victims of the IRA .

People were always trying to get them to turn to politics , and if they did n't have a political wing then it would have been immeasurably more difficult to turn them away from violence through political means . As for giving a fuck about the IRA 's victims , do people who use them as an excuse to attack SF really give a fuck about them either ? They 're being used as a political football , kicked about from one side to the other over and over and over again .

"The actions ( or inactions ) of the British Government in the North are the reasons why the PIRA existed to begin with . They 're certainly the reasons why the PIRA gained so much support from previously moderate nationalists and catholics . The British response to peaceful civil rights marches , in which catholics were looking for equal voting rights among other things , was to beat them off the streets . When the unionists began to commit increasingly violent crimes against catholic minority communities ( Bombay Street ) , the British sent the army in to protect the catholics ( amazing how many people do n't know that ) . The army soon became worse than the RUC and we had Bloody Sunday and other atrocities as a result . I think the growth of the PIRA was a regrettable , but absolutely inevitable and predictable event given the circumstances that some catholic communities found themselves in . Violence begets violence and all that . The IRA are obviously responsible for the violent acts that they 've committed , of course they are . And the IRA committed some unspeakable acts - but they were a response to an existing situation . Instead of ceding a few basic human rights to the catholic communities , the British responded with violence , sometimes extreme violence . They also fed into the growing popularity of the IRA among nationalists by bringing in things like internment - which made them appear like monsters and gave the IRA even more of a reason to market themselves as freedom fighters . I do n't think the actions of the two groups can be viewed through the same lens because the circumstances surrounding these actions are completely different .",English,Native,,Native

I never said that Hume did n't deserve his Nobel Peace Prize , all I 'm saying is that it 's ridiculous for people to suggest that Hume does n't receive enough recognition for his role . I 'm not saying you suggested that , but I 've seen others state that before here . And no , I do n't think I 'm contradicting myself when I say that Hume had a huge role and also when I say that their main contribution was involving SF and enabling them to turn the IRA away from violence - because that 's exactly what the SDLP did . The point I was making is that I do n't see how these perceived risks that the SDLP took to involve SF are any more serious than the risks SF took to turn the IRA away from violence .",English,Native,,Native

"I 'm well aware of the Hume-Adams dialogue and the role of the SDLP . But to pretend that a peace process could have been in any way possible without the involvement of Sinn Fein and the PIRA is nothing short of wilful ignorance . Hume played a huge role in the peace process , but the peace process could never have happened if you did n't have people within SF and the PIRA willing to take huge risks in order to turn the PIRA away from violence . Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake . The problem is that people seem to think that it was down to Hume and the SDLP alone - when their whole contribution to the peace process centered almost entirely around involving and in many cases depending on SF and the moderate elements of the IRA to bring an end to the violence being orchestrated by the IRA .",English,Native,,Native

"There 's more to it than just Catholic vs Protestant yes , of course there is . My point was that the conflict arose because one side had a disproportionate amount of authority over the other side and frequently abused the authority that they had . The Troubles did n't start until the catholic/nationalist minority began to march for civil rights and found themselves getting beaten off the streets by the RUC and burned out of their houses by loyalist gangs ( bombay street etc . ) The PIRA gained more and more support from previously moderate nationalists as this continued and we know how it went from there . Obviously this is a very simplistic account , but it 's the jist of what happened . Honestly I 'm more worried about how the Troubles is understood among our own people here than I am about how foreigners understand it - there 's such a lack of knowledge on the subject it 's unbelievable . For example , most Irish people do n't know that the British Army was actually sent into the North to protect the catholics/nationalists from further attacks from loyalist gangs . That 's the reason the army was there , to **protect** those communities . Amazing how many people seem to assume that they were brought in to fight the PIRA .",English,Native,,Native
"I 'm very well aware of the history and origin of the IRA - the IRA did not cause the Troubles . The IRA were a response to a pre-existing condition in Northern Ireland .

The IRA gained more and more support from these people as this continued . Again , a simplistic account of what happened , but still close to the mark .",English,Native,,Native

They were n't hunger striking for `` the cause '' , they were hunger striking for the return of their special category status - which would mean they 'd be treated the same way in prison as prisoners of war , because the majority of people who were interned were imprisoned without a trial and often without any evidence . That 's why they were hunger striking ... they were n't dying for a united Ireland if that 's what you 're trying to imply . I think it 's absolutely ridiculous that you 're even comparing the 1981 hunger strikers with Islamic State suicide bombers .",English,Native,,Native
"You 're making it seem as if it 's the same thing , it is n't . Dying means nothing to a radical Islamic terrorist - in fact , they want to die . They are literally willing to die themselves in order to take as many `` infidels '' as they can with them . I get what you 're saying about the car bombs but it 's just not the same thing - the IRA even gave phone warnings before most of their bombings .

"ISIS and Islamic radicals are a completely different beast , though . Nationalist/Loyalist paramilitaries did n't strap bombs to themselves , walk into public places and blow themselves up - nor did they carry out city-wide shooting sprees that resulted in scores of innocent people getting killed . My point is , this is a different type of violence and it 's being carried out in a way that Ireland , and many other countries , will not have had to deal with before . I have no idea what we could do to prevent an attack like that , though . Maybe there 's very little we can do - but I do n't think we can rely on our experience with the Troubles to suffice here .",English,Native,,Native

SF 's economic policies ( which we 've never seen implemented ) are considered a joke but FG and FF 's are acceptable despite the fact that we have actually seen them make a mess of the country 's finances in the past .

"& gt ; No merely I do n't think you can go around saying your community was being persecuted by the other community , when your community is doing the same things . You ca n't complain about how it feels to see loyalist killers idolised and then pretend that nationalists do n't do the same . What would you suggest , then ? Each time a victim from one side of the conflict voices their perspective , they should then preface it with a comprehensive account of how the conflict impacted both communities ? You seriously do n't see that as being even a slight bit ridiculous ? Additionally , atrocities and attacks carried out by the IRA and other Nationalist paramilitaries are hardly under-represented or under-discussed in the Republic . It suddenly becomes a massive burning issue of national importance every time a Sinn Fein representative takes to the airwaves - are these broadcasts ( which are heard by a lot more people than this article will have been read by ) prefaced with a discussion on the attacks and atrocities carried out by loyalist and British state forces ? Of course they 're not . In fact if anything I 'd say the role of Orange state forces and later British state forces in bringing about and escalating the Troubles is understated in the Republic . By an awful lot of people and media outlets .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; Well this same person dismissed most Southerners as uncaring Free Staters who abandoned Northerners . I do n't see how that qualifies as SF propaganda though .

They would n't do very well if they adopted that stance . & gt ; Also what makes you say I 'm incessantly criticising them ? I hardly every discuss SF .

No , it is n't a bad thing to have a different opinion - but I 'm having a hard time believing that you 're being sincere here because you 've just dismissed the majority of this man 's opinion as `` Sinn Fein propaganda '' , as so many people in the republic tend to do . I also wish that you 'd stop pretending that SF supporters are somehow in the majority and that you 're part of a vocal minority with a drastically different opinion when you incessantly criticise them - SF have n't got a majority in either the North or the Republic .

"What are you talking about ? Mountbatten and the bishopsgate bombings both happened during the Troubles , they had nothing to do with what brought the Troubles about in the first place . The IRA as an organisation did predate the Troubles but they were largely inactive until 1969 - after a civil rights campaign orchestrated by nationalists was met with violence by the loyalists the year before . This led to a split in the IRA and the formation of the PIRA , who then began their campaign . The PIRA did n't even start their offensive campaign until 1971/1972 ... 3 years after the Troubles began .",English,Native,,Native
"It 's a moot point either way - the fact that there was no legal argument preventing catholics/nationalists from having the same voting rights as protestants does n't change the fact that , for all intents and purposes , they did n't have the same ability to vote .

EDIT : Since you changed your post to call me mealy mouthed , I 'll reply . The fact that explicitly discriminatory legislation was n't enacted is n't the point ( I 'd disagree with that too , let 's not forget internment ) , the point is that a situation existed where one side was still being discriminated against by the other side who held all the cards . The British government did n't intervene with direct rule until the situation had already gotten well out of hand .

I 'm very well aware of that fact - but I do n't see how it helps your argument - most soldiers are . That 's hardly unique to the IRA .

Started justifying a war , drew up all my plans and recruited heavily for the initial offensive . The day arrived but there was a problem - the UK had since guaranteed Yugoslavia as well . By now I 'd joined the Axis and so I decided to declare the war anyway and drag Germany in on my side . So now I 'm at war with the UK , Australia , New Zealand , The Raj , and a few others .

They 're not appeasable but they certainly know how to take advantage of the media .

I did n't say anything about wanting the media to not report on further developments on a story - in fact I 'd be quite happy if that was all they did . But it is n't . And you know it is n't . At best , they spend hours repeating the same headline again and again until they get a new development and at worst they speculate over the details that remain unclear . That 's not what I want , I only want to know the facts . If it 's what you want , fair enough . We 'll agree to disagree .",English,Native,,Native
But that 's a completely different argument altogether ... this has nothing to do with censorship . There 's a difference between being informed and having the same story shoved down your throat for three or four days straight - or having a story being instantly framed in one context ( a terrorist attack carried out by Islamic militants ) when it has nothing to do with it .

"Not sure . A quick look at the wiki page for the Iraq War puts the number of deaths due to violent actions at over 600,000 ( estimated by the Lancet survey ) - I 'd imagine Vincent 's probably including the period of violence that the Iraq war has also led to in that region . I really do n't know if that would bring the figure above 1 million , though . EDIT : Actual confirmed and documented deaths seem to be around 110,000 , so yeah , no idea where 1 million is coming from . The estimates do seem to vary by a lot though . Just googling `` casualties of the Iraq War '' brings up an ORB survey that attributes over 1 million deaths to the war .",English,Native,,Native

It 's ridiculous . EDIT : And back to the original question a bit ... news reports really should n't focus so much on the attackers . That 's what the problem is in my opinion . There 's always long , detailed reports about who the attacker was , who they owe their allegiance to , why they do what they do , where they go for breakfast , what their favourite colour is ... the focus should be both on the victims of the attack , and on the attack itself . It should n't become an autobiography of the killer .",English,Native,,Native

Hume ( deservedly ) won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work - but I seriously think the role of Adams and McGuinness is incredibly overlooked by some people . Who could 've brought the IRA to a ceasefire without them ? Hume ? Not a chance .

Power is equally shared between Loyalists ( people who want to remain in the UK ) and Nationalists ( people who want to join the Republic of Ireland ) . & gt ; Is there a risk of groups like the IRA kicking back up ? I 'm not sure I 'd go quite as far as that but it 's really difficult to say . The situation in Northern Ireland is peaceful , but it 's also always volatile .

"True enough . Jon did take charge for the final battles though in fairness .

Granted , he still would 've lost an awful lot less if he stuck to his original battle plan and let Ramsay come at him instead of charging at them after Rickon died .",English,Native,,Native
"To be fair , Jon has n't commanded a battle like this before and Ramsay 's already commanded quite a few of them . Jon has commanded against wildings when he had a massive wall of ice between them and his forces - that 's a world away from fighting in an open field against a ruthless and cunning commander who has well seasoned troops under his command . Jon 's forces might have been more effective had he not forced them to charge after Rickon 's death but Jon being Jon , he was always going to charge .

"I 'm not sure it 's as cut and dry as that though . Say , for the sake of argument , Adams was in the IRA .

At the same time , he could n't cut the IRA loose because he needed enough influence with them to bring them to the table . I know what you 're going to say , that was 30 years ago - but honestly the situation has n't changed all that much . If he admits **now** that he was in the IRA all along , what will that do to the already severely fragile peace-process in the North ? I think there would be a real chance that the DUP and other loyalist parties would refuse to have dialogue with Sinn Fein at all if that were the case . The current crises up there would be a fairly minor footnote compared to the catastrophy that would cause in my opinion , and I think political stability and people 's lives are more important than Adams 's political opponents being able to prove themselves right .

"Resentment will never lead to lasting peace , and I think you might be overlooking the fact that SF and the PIRA were not the only obstacle . For years , the British government refused to even speak with leading nationalist politicans and they were banned from having their voices heard on public broadcasts - even in the Republic , with Section 31 . I just can not agree with the assertion that a lasting peace could 've been achieved without SF being there to bring the PIRA to the table . As far as justifying the IRA goes , I 'm not sure I 'd go that far - I would n't try to justify what they ended up as , at least . I do n't think it 's as easy to say that they were n't justified in the beginning . But I would also add that I do n't think it 's fair to judge those who decided to join them either - I personally do n't know how I 'd react to living under an oppressive government who viewed me as a second class citizen . They did despicable things , but they were a response to a pre-existing condition - and the British Army did things that were equally as bad . The US army and other armies continue to do the same in other parts of the world now , the only difference is that they are government-sanctioned actions .",English,Native,,Native
"I 'm not saying the SDLP did n't have a large part to play but I do think you 're overestimating it too . How could the peace process have succeeded without involving the PIRA ? How do you politically involve the PIRA without reaching out to SF ? And if you 're Adams or someone else , how do you convince the PIRA to stop the violence and come to the table ? These were some of the biggest issues faced by the peace process and most of them were overcome to some degree . But you definitely would not have had any kind of lasting peace without involving SF . The Hume-Adams dialogue did a lot more for the peace process than people seem to know .",English,Native,,Native
"I 'm a huge fan of John Hume - he achieved remarkable things but he had no influence over the PIRA and realistically , people who held some level of influence over them were needed to bring them to the negotiating table . Otherwise , you 'd have one side at the table without the other . I really do think it 's unrealistic to believe that the peace process could 've went ahead without involving the PIRA or at the very least , SF . Incidentally , that was Hume 's position too . He was largely responsible for bringing SF into the fold after all . I do n't think anyone can deny the huge part Adams played in making the peace process as relatively successful as it is - whatever else you might think of the man .",English,Native,,Native
"I do n't think I ever said the PIRA were anything other than a violent organisation , of course they were . They committed atrocities just like the RUC , British army and loyalists did . That 's the problem with constantly looking back in the North - everybody 's hands were dirty . I do agree that things may well have worked out better if everyone had stuck to politics , but that 's an ideal that was never going to happen - there 's no point in dwelling on it now , the reality was violent and brutal . Something had to change and eventually it did , we got the peace process . That would simply not have happened without SF and the influence some of its members had with the PIRA .",English,Native,,Native
"Oh for fuck 's sake . Go and read a history book , I 'm fed up explaining Northern Irish politics and history to people in /r/Ireland - so much willful ignorance . The PIRA were a symptom of a much greater problem in the North . They formed because Nationalists/Catholics were second class citizens in an Orange state during the late 60's/early 70 's . They had little to no voting powers , housing authorities routinely passed them over to favour the Protestant majority and they faced huge discrimination from the RUC - culminating in things like the Battle of the Bogside and what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was then that the British Army was sent in - to protect the Catholics . That 's why they were sent over and not many people seem to be willing to remember that now . Instead of protecting the people they were told to protect , they became the biggest problem of the lot . Bloody Sunday was n't the only failure on their list . And so , more and more people ( rightly or wrongly ) joined the PIRA . Sinn Fein emerged as the political wing of the organisation , not the other way around - as some logheads seem to be implying here . Like it or not , you would n't have a peace process without Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others . What amuses me the most about all of this is that for years , people were encouraging and pleading with the PIRA to turn to politics instead - and now that they have ( by and large ) , people are still bitching . You ca n't have your cake and eat it .",English,Native,,Native

Allowing Japan to retain the Emperor as a surrender condition is one , another one is allowing the Soviet Union to deliver the death blow to the Empire . Just because it is n't an ideal alternative does n't mean it is n't an alternative . But if you do n't think that dropping the atomic bombs was about geopolitics - even a little bit - then I do n't know what to say to you . It was about getting one up on the Soviet Union as much as it was about ending a war that was already over .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; I think I know which one is the best for Japan . Oh , so **that's** what the USA was concerned with was it ? Now that 's the only load of tripe on display here my friend . But , since you asked , I think it 's also worth mentioning that the Potsdam Proclamation did n't address in any way , one of the central surrender conditions for the Japenese - the retention of the emperor . There are more than a few historians who think the Japanese might 've surrendered if that assurance was given . However , that 's still only another item on the list . There are plenty of historians , critics and writers who have assessed the options available to the Allies at that point in the war - and surprisingly enough not all of them deem the atomic bomb to have been necessary . Hell , even people like Eisenhower and McArthur thought it was n't necessary . But I wo n't sit here and do your research for you , so perhaps you should head off to google .",English,Native,,Native
"It was n't a necessity . Things are never that black and white . Revisionist history tells us it was a necessity , but it 'd be refreshing for people here to actually research it more themselves . The USA had planned to invade Japan in November but the US leadership then felt that something should be done before the Soviet Union entered that theatre of war . And so , you have the atomic bombs . The Soviet Union brought forward its plans and invaded after the bomb on Hiroshima , but the Japanese then surrendered after the second one on Nagasaki . The bombs were about geopolitics , not `` ending the war '' . The war was already over . EDIT : Obviously that 's not the whole story , but it 's a part of it . And a part that nobody seems to remember in these discussions .",English,Native,,Native
So hold on ... it was the Japenese civilians who carried out the Rape of Nanking ? And civilians who were behind Unit 731 too was it ? Is that why those civilians `` reaped '' what they sowed ?

"The alternative was that Japan surrenders anyway to the Soviet Union , who began their planned invasion between the dropping of the two bombs . Dropping the nukes was as much about showing Stalin what the USA had than ending the war - the war was already over . It was really about geopolitics in the end , and we got the cold war as a result .",English,Native,,Native

"& gt ; Then you ought to be critical of the robot-like devotion to protecting Sinn Féin 's honour through dogpiling and en masse downvoting - a phenomenon that occurs with no other political party here .

I would n't vote for them for a variety of reasons , but they do n't bother me enough to dislike them . I do fucking hate their supporters ( as a group , not you personally ) because they make political discourse impossible as well as being so , so fucking annoying in general . Regarding your first point here , I 'm certainly not a fan of it but it really does n't happen to the degree that you 're implying . Do SF have die-hard supporters who 'll refuse to respond rationally to any criticism directed their way ? Yes , they do . Some of them do frequent /r/Ireland - but it 's hardly an issue of epidemic proportions , as is constantly implied . But , just so there 's no ambiguity here , I do n't agree with the approach those people take . If your only response to ( often valid ) criticism is to put your fingers in your ears and yell `` Lalalalala ! `` , then you probably do n't have a clue what you 're talking about .

I have my reasons for voting the way I do and I 've outlined them clearly before on /r/Ireland , and I really do get tired of constantly having to repeat myself on this topic .

As for knowing better than to rise to the bait , I try to only make a post when I see someone posting something patently untrue or willfully ignorant .

SF are far ( very far ) from perfect , but so is every other political party .

"What you 're describing are the reasons for the prolonged continuation of violence during the Troubles , but those are n't the reasons why they started to begin with . You 're not wrong in what you 're saying but I think we 're describing two separate things . The Troubles lasted so long because of the reasons you 're describing - the PIRA took advantage of their swell in numbers to promote their agenda , which in turn led to loyalist paramilitaries doing the same . This led to the back and forth attacks carried out by these paramilitaries as you 've described . But I still believe that the biggest reason why the Troubles started to begin with was the poor treatment of Catholics in NI .",English,Native,,Native
"I 'm not saying they were that simple I 'm telling you how they came about . If Catholics had the same rights as Protestants in Northern Ireland there would have been no public support for the PIRA . If you 're trying to get me to justify everything the PIRA has done then you wo n't succeed . Incidentally , the protests in the late 60 's and early 70 's had absolutely fuck all to do with a united Ireland . That 's not what gave the PIRA their support . Large numbers of people flocked to join their ranks because of how they were treated by the orange state . The IRA always stated their goal as being a united Ireland . Always . That was n't going to change simply because they had more people in the organisation or because they had more public support . Most of your questions were rhetorical , or at least the answers to them are obvious to anyone who knows anything about the Troubles . They do n't actually take away from anything I 've said .",English,Native,,Native
"& gt ; In part by people who felt that their community was being targeted and so murdered some random other people and called it legitimate retaliation They did n't just **feel** that their communities were being targeted , they **were** targeted . Life as a Catholic in Northern Ireland in the 60 's and 70 's was the life of a second-class citizen . You did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant , you could n't get housing from local authorities who systematically favoured Protestants over you , you found it tougher to get a job because most business owners were Protestant and would never hire a Catholic and you could n't air your grievances in public because the RUC would come down on your protests like a ton of bricks . The British Army was sent in to protect the Catholic community in Northern Ireland after what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was the treatment of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland that fuelled the whole conflict .",English,Native,,Native

"Seems right enough , most estimates I 've read put the PIRA 's civilian murders between 600 and 700 ( I actually think it 's slightly over 700 . 720 or there abouts ) .

Also , it 's very easy to hold the view that all violence is wrong and we should never hurt another person . An admirable sentiment , but life does n't always work like that . You ca n't tell me that if you were living as a catholic in West Belfast or Derry in the early 70 's , seeing your people treated as second class citizens and getting beaten off the streets ( by the `` innocent '' RUC ) for holding civil rights marches so that you can have the vote and be allocated housing like the loyalist majority , that you would n't under any circumstances join an organisation that promised to change that . EDIT : And even if you will still say that you definitely would n't , I do n't think you 're in any sort of position to judge people who would .",English,Native,,Native
"Yes , the PIRA killed a lot of people ... please show me where I said that they did n't ? If you 're talking about civilian casualties , you 're incorrect . Loyalist paramilitaries are responsible for more civilian deaths than the PIRA . The majority of the people killed by the PIRA were members of the British Security forces . You can argue about how right or wrong that is but they did n't target civilians to the same extent as Loyalist paramilitaries .",English,Native,,Native
"Ugh , you people are exhausting . Fine , let 's consider it your way then . Say he was a member of the IRA and say there was enough proof to show that he was - what do you think should be done ?

What I 'm not fine with is having your standpoint lorded over me as if that is the only morally correct view to have . I do n't think membership of the PIRA is a crime in and of itself - mostly because I know , and can understand , why the PIRA came about in the first place and what life was like for catholics and nationalists in the `` orange state '' . I do n't think it 's fair to judge people who were victims of state oppression , abused by the police force who were supposed to be protecting them ( RUC ) , backed into a corner and felt they had no other option . That 's wrongly assigned blame . Maybe you see things differently but that 's how I see it .",English,Native,,Native
"There 's the testimony of former IRA members like Dolores Price who were against the Peace Process - and therefore had a vested interest in discrediting Gerry Adams , SF and other leaders of the Peace Process . And when I say I do n't care , I mean I do n't care if he was a member of the IRA or not . There 's nothing to gain from finding out for certain that he was n't a member , and there 's potentially a lot at stake if we find out for certain that he was . Finding out he was a member is n't exactly going to strengthen the already weakened Peace Process . The DUP were almost willing to tear it up over something we already knew was the case ( the PIRA still existing ) - there 's a pretty real chance they 'd walk out completely if Adams came out and said he was in the IRA . In short , I do n't see any advantage in finding out for sure either way . Politicians in the Republic who keep throwing accusations at Adams are doing so to further their own political agendas and not out of any sort of concern for NI or the peace process - they ignore these problems until there 's political capital to be had in paying attention to it .",English,Native,,Native
"I do n't care if he was and I could write yet another long post explaining exactly why I do n't care . That being said , I do have a problem with people saying things like he ordered the murders of innocent people when they have absolutely no proof showing that he did . There 's as much evidence showing that he did as there is showing that he did n't , ie . None .",English,Native,,Native
"So ... people who lead countries have never ordered the deaths of innocent people and Gerry Adams ( if what you 're saying is even true ) will be the first one ever ? Incidentally , I 'm pretty sure you 've no proof that he 's ordered the deaths of anyone and yet you 're apparently certain that he did .

So you 're suggesting his comment was along the lines of `` I wish other people would pay more for this thing ! It 's ridiculous how little other people are spending on this thing ! '' Did I get that right ? Because to me that sounds like a great way to look outraged about something without actually having to personally do anything .,English,Native,,Native
"So 29 billion is ridiculous , and we should force other people to pay more for this research ? How much more money should be spent ? Who should decide how the money is spent ? How will they ensure the money is effectively spent ? Would you personally force other people to pay for this ? Because I am assuming you are talking about using the force of government to take money from some people and give it to researchers . If you would n't personally force people to pay for this , why does it become okay for others to do it on your behalf ? Perhaps things like funding this research ( which some of us consider important , and some of us do not consider important ) should be achieved in a non-coercive way . I 'm sure many people would chip in money to support this , and we would n't have to worry about the resentment and politics of people who do n't want to pay . Personally I would donate to this . But from what I can see , the vast majority of replies to my comment are suggesting funding this through taxation . And taxation removes choice from the equation . And I really resent being forced to pay for things . I 'm sure you do too . Do you like having to fund the trillion-dollar military-industrial complex ? Let 's work towards achieving important things without forcing each other to foot the bill . Perhaps then we would n't have to worry so much about who 's vying for the Whitehouse every four years .",English,Native,,Native
"I 'd be happier with a system where we personally get to decide where our tax dollars go . I think it would definitely be a step in the right direction . Personally I would n't allocate a quarter of my spending to the military-industrial complex ! I like science , so having the choice to spend money on projects like fusion research would be very cool . The choice is important . Without choice we have no freedom .",English,Native,,Native
"How do you know ? I mean , I 'd love for fusion to be viable , and it certainly looks like it could be , but how much of other people 's money are you willing to risk on this ? How much research pans out , and how much is a dead-end ? Are you personally willing to force other people to pay for this ? And if you 're not , what makes it okay to have others enforce this in your behalf ? Perhaps we could find ways of achieving important things without resorting to coercion ? And maybe the very act of having to convince rather than coerce will lead to better outcomes ?",English,Native,,Native
"Is fusion research a guaranteed win ? Is it a problem that can be solved by pouring more money and resources into it ? How much money will it take ? Are you willing to find that amount by forcing others to keep paying for it until we achieve success ? What about people who are too old to reap the benefits ? Should they be forced to pay ? What about people who do n't want to pay ? Will you force them ? What about those of us who do not wish to be forced to pay ? Will you make them submit , with violence if necessary ? What about the man who will not submit , even when violence is brought to bear ? Will you advocate for his death ? Because that is how violent situations ultimately end , is n't it ? Is n't it really `` submit or die '' ? I do n't have answers , but I am very concerned when I hear people demanding that other people should pay for something , especially when they start talking about forcing them to pay . It is always better to achieve things without coercion .",English,Native,,Native

"Incredible dreams . I am truly sorry for what you experienced as a child . Two themes strike me : One : deep injustice is occurring , and it is not entirely hidden . In fact , many times it is out in the open , with witnesses who do nothing . The signs are very clear , and yet no one asks if you need help , or how things are going . It is not just the abusers who have mistreated you . Many others are complicit and turned a blind eye . I 'm really really sorry about that . Realizing this as you mature into an adult can give you new insight , and it becomes enraging as you realize how little others cared . Which leads to ... Two : as you mature into an adult , you are now able to fight back . Your body and your mind now knows your capacity to fight and to win . These motherfuckers can not get away with it anymore . When we are young and abused it is much safer to suppress our anger . It is too dangerous to act upon our rage and to fight back , so we squash our anger to protect ourselves . But now that you are literally able to smash these cunts to a pulp , your mind is letting go of some of the suppression of anger . You are feeling this anger now , and a deep part of you wants to act on your anger to protect yourself and those you care about . You want justice , and you can now fight for it . You 've already been to years of counseling , well done . I would definitely recommend continuing that and talking to a therapist . In university they offer it for free , usually . Working through this ( justified ) lethal rage will help you immensely . Again , I 'm really sorry . I will try to do my part to stop these things from happening to kids . Good luck , friend .",English,Native,,Native

"There are 115 reliable sources cited in the paper . You would know that if you even skimmed it . Try to keep an open mind when it comes to important issues . & gt ; The realities of national health insurance documented in this paper—waiting lines , rationing , lack of cutting-edge medical tech- nology , restricted access to the latest pre- scription drugs , inequitable distribution of care—are not accidental . Such problems flow inexorably from the fact that politicians and bureaucrats—not patients and doctors—are given the authority to allocate limited health care resources . Yet proponents of socialized medicine insist that a single-payer health care system is the only way to solve the structural problems of the U.S. health care system . They conve- niently ignore or explain away the flaws of sin- gle-payer systems , arguing that we could design a better system and spend more money than Britain and Canada , thus getting better results . But the failures of socialized medicine are evident in every country that implements it , and there is no reason to believe that a sin- gle-payer system in the United States would be any different . Advocates of national health insurance would do well to look at how coun- tries like Germany , Sweden , and Australia are choosing free-market reforms to alleviate the problems of their national health systems . Through painful experience , many of the countries that once heralded the benefits of government control have learned that the best remedy for their countries ’ health care crises is not increasing government power , but increas- ing patient power instead .",English,Native,,Native

"Stefan Molyneux also wrote a book about this titled Practical Anarchy . [ The book is free here . ] ( http : //m.freedomainradio.com/ ) & gt ; Imagine a world without government – this thought exercise seems impossible for many , because the power and reach of state monopolies is so omnipresent in our lives . However , there is no rational , economic or moral reason to assume that governments are necessary for the provision of roads , healthcare , charity , dispute resolution , courts , policing , national defense , jails – or any of the other services currently monopolized by the state . & gt ; Governments are extremely dangerous , responsible for over 250 million deaths in the 20th century alone – if it is possible to run a society without a government , surely this is something that we must strive towards as a species . & gt ; Practical Anarchy makes strong case for the private – that is to say voluntary – provision for public services .

"Decrease all taxes so the consumers have more money to spend . But your professor probably does n't want to hear that . Your professor probably wants to hear this : - increase taxes on wheat submarket for biofuel , which will disincentivize usage of wheat for biofuel , thus increasing supply of wheat for wheat submarkets that deal in wheat food products and cattle feed . This increased supply will decrease prices for consumers . - allocate revenue from biofuel taxes to spend on wheat farmer subsidies , which encourages the growth of supply of wheat , which decreases price of wheat . But this is short-sighted thinking ( even though it is probably what your prof wants to hear ) . Here are some negative effects : - local biofuel businesses now have less money , and may have to lay off employees and forgo spending on capital investment . - businesses reliant on biofuel will have to absorb price increases ( possibly laying off workers or forgoing capital investment as well ) or use a biofuel alternative to remain competitive , further hurting the biofuel market . - wheat farmers are now receiving subsidies to increase production of wheat , which messes up market signals . ( Do consumers actually want more wheat ? No . Or else they 'd have started buying more wheat . ) This injection of money encourages malinvestment across the wheat farming sector ( farmers buying tractors they did n't need in free market conditions , farmers purchasing more land to plant more wheat , things like that ) . - Because consumers did n't actually want more wheat , this oversupply of wheat will displace other products ( quite literally if it 's going in silos that would have housed other grain ) . It may be used in the production of new products in other markets , displacing existing products e.g . wheat-derived sugar becomes cheap enough to compete with cane sugar , putting the squeeze on the sugar cane industry . - Fortunately wheat can be stored indefinitely . But meat can not . The lower cost of wheat-based cattle-feed will encourage the overproduction of meat . Some of this meat will spoil . Taking from some people so that you can give to others always has negative consequences . There are alternate methods for solving this problem that do not wreak havoc on the markets , and on people 's lives . Off the top of my head , the government could reduce taxes on futures trading to encourage speculation on the future price of wheat . This will smooth out price fluctuations , preventing nasty surprises to poor people who subsist on bread .",English,Native,,Native

Feeling entitled to the scything job will make it a lot harder for you to get into the frame of mind to satisfy consumer demand . And if you then make a big fuss saying `` they derk our jerbs ! '' it 's gon na be even harder for you to find a job . When you get to the point that you have the balls to say `` they took our jobs so someone else has to give me money '' , and you start acting on that mindset , you are going to be taking from more productive people to give to less productive people .

The Luxembourg agreement reduced the butter quota by roughly 17 % and the cheese quota by roughly 68 % over 5 years . Quantities were reduced further after 1977 , to about half the 1973 levels . New Zealand continued to have butter quotas in the 1980s and 1990s – although at much reduced levels . & gt ; Britain had long been New Zealand ’ s main supplier of imports , but this was slowly declining – from 48 % in the late 1930s , to 43 % in 1960 , and down to 30 % in 1970 .

The situation is kinda similar to what happened with Bernie . Ron Paul had massive popular support but got screwed by the party insiders . So now we have our chance to rebuild the party , and Trump has a wider appeal than Ron Paul while not being as ideologically consistent . So we 're taking our chances and clawing the power away from the insiders . Not enough people will get behind the Libertarian party because they see it as a wasted vote . One last thing : the disdain for `` cucks '' is a powerful sea-change in the political landscape . Conservatives are sick of having to support ineffectual politicians .

Edit : libertarian commies ? ? ? ? & gt ; The actual nature of the global economy is aptly described by this passage from “ Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital , ” by Thomas Hodgskin — an English writer of the 1820s and 1830s who was second to none in his support for genuine free trade . & gt ; Betwixt him who produces food and him who produces clothing , betwixt him who makes instruments and him who uses them , in steps the capitalist , who neither makes nor uses them , and appropriates to himself the produce of both . With as niggard a hand as possible he transfers to each a part of the produce of the other , keeping to himself the large share . Gradually and successively has he insinuated himself betwixt them , expanding in bulk as he has been nourished by their increasingly productive labours , and separating them so widely from each other that neither can see whence that supply is drawn which each receives through the capitalist . While he despoils both , so completely does he exclude one from the view of the other that both believe they are indebted him for subsistence .",English,Native,,Native

"The idea is that taxes are enforced through violence , so we should eliminate as much violence as possible ( preferably with a utopia of no violence , but it might be impossible so we just work towards that ) . We should never use violence against people unless we absolutely have to . You would n't shoot someone unless you absolutely had to . You would n't steal from them unless you absolutely had to . You would n't send them a letter demanding payment for something they never asked for , with the threat of imprisonment if they did n't pay up . Even if you did send that threatening letter , you would n't follow through by kidnapping them and locking them in your basement . Because that would be messed up . Violence is the absolutely last resort to solving problems . How about we do n't force others to pay for things against their will ? **Worst case scenarios : ** The infrastructure becomes unmantained and unsafe ? People need to get from place to place , so they will pay organisations to fix and maintain it . The schools only serve the wealthy ? Parents will always want their kids to be educated , so entrepreneurs will start private schools catering to the customer . Really poor people may get charitable scholarships , or access to video content instead of in-person tutoring . We can come up with many many solutions to the problem of funding things without taxation , we just have to realise that government is violence , and should only be deployed when absolutely necessary .

"A legal framework , as I 'm sure you 're aware , means the codification and enforcement of laws . This legal framework can either be provided by : - the state , which will necessarily have a monoply , and all the problems that entails , as well as being bogged down by bureaucracy - or by private institutions and individuals , who will operate in a competitive environment attempting to satisfy customer needs . One of these situations is a free market . The other is not . An enforced monopoly is not a free market . To be clear , our current system is supposed to protect property rights , and usually does so . But it has many problems , and is certainly not free . It is freeish .",English,Native,,Native
"America probably has the freest markets around ( or some other western country , I think the Heritage foundation indexes this yearly ) . Pointing to China as an example of the evils of the free market is pretty ridiculous , considering their government is literally the communist party . I 'm simply addressing the image , which states that a government monopoly on justice is required for a free market . The very definition of free market disproves the statement itself .

"The guy who wrote what im copying and pasting here knows his shit : If you want to know about rampant pedophilia by elites in Dominican Republic you need to look at 2 investigate reporters that are not too swampy ... One is Alicia Ortega and the other is Nuria Piera , Nuria is Dominican Republic 's Alex Jones.. She 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate José Francisco Peña Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly Peña Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press Peña Gomez vudú ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... . Menendez and Melgen were accused in Dominican Republic of fraud by selling x-ray machines to the government and the corrupt DR supreme Court let them go ... FUCK THE ELITES ! ! ! !

Engaging the body in this kind of `` physical meme '' puts the mind in a semi-hypnotic state . It 's theorized by Francis , Walker , et al . that the evolutionary purpose of this was for tribal cohesion when engaging in combat and wartime customs , e.g . intimidating war-dances such as the haka performed by Polynesian peoples . So what you described as seeing `` the intelligence and willpower drain from their eyes '' is a real neuro-physiological phenomenon . Creepy stuff !

The only point I 'd make is that while homosexuals are vastly over represented in child sex abuse , the pedos are still a small minority of the homosexual population .

"A right is something we would consider enforceable with violence , E.g . I have the right to my property , and if you steal it , I can enforce my right to my property with violence ( taking it back or forcing you to give it back ) . This example is a negative right , or the right to be free from coercion . The problem with rights is the conception of positive rights , aka obligations to someone else 's property or labor . A right to someone else 's property or labor should only exist when both parties have agreed to it . The one exception being raising kids , since kids ca n't agree to being raised , so the creation of a child must put a positive obligation on the parent . Any other positive obligation must necessitate a violation of someone 's negative rights , E.g . your right to healthcare violates my property rights , since taxation is theft and I have n't agreed to it . So positive rights violate negative rights , which logically negates them . We are left with negative rights as being the only legitimate kind of rights . But honestly , if someone is drowning I doubt no one would help . That would be a total dick move . If it was my kid that drowned and someone could have helped , I would be so enraged . I do n't see how this creates a positive obligation on the part of a bystander , but it should be a rule in any civilized society . If you do n't help people when you easily could have , then we wo n't have anything to do with you . This does n't give anyone the right to attack or steal from the cowardly bystander , but we do n't have to interact with him or help him . We never had that obligation to begin with . This is how a real `` social contract '' should work . Not with forced obligations , but with the understanding that you can be ostracized at any time , so do n't be a dick .",English,Native,,Native

"I think this is mostly it . But the majority of families still have a subtext of emotional manipulation and physical threats lurking in their relationships , with these patterns having formed deep in early childhood . The majority of parents still spank their children . Children grow up funneled into the public school system , and see bullying with mostly empty rhetoric opposing it . Politicians and the media lie repetitively . So most people are programmed by milder forms of manipulation than an outright narcissist would inflict , but still , they are programmed . To highlight this , imagine the response you ( or any child ) would get if you protested going to school . Not many parents would take you seriously , and even good parents would listen to your complaints , but then convince you that you must go , eventually turning you against your own feelings . It is an extremely rare parent that truly cares what their child thinks and feels . So when these programmed people -- and lets not kid ourselves , most people are programmed unless they have gone through a journey of rigorous self-knowledge -- when these people encounter a master manipulator at the height of their skills , their response is an unconscious allegiance to power rather than to virtue or principle or love . A peacefully raised person on the other hand , will immediately see through the strange display that a narcissist puts on . This is because the peacefully raised individual is in tune with their natural thoughts and emotions . Also , consider the world of politics today . All of these politicians are master manipulators , and yet the majority of people will go out and support one or the other candidate .

"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude . Tl ; dr there have always been political movements advocating `` freedom to '' and `` freedom from '' , or equality vs liberty .",English,Native,,Native

"You yourself said more property tax would `` put people like Patel out of business . '' And then you linked to a supply and demand graph . Where do you think the market price point would move to when the supply falls ? Hint : it would move to the left on the curve , meaning higher prices . Taxation never lowers the cost of anything . If liberation could come from higher taxation , then the USSR would have been a paradise of freedom .",English,Native,,Native
"The lower class rents more because they can not afford to be home owners . Your extra land tax would decrease the supply of renters , increasing the price of rent , and it would increase the supply of land for other uses , thus lowering the price for home building and home owners . But there are a lot of poor people that still will not be able to afford to own their own home . The entire burden of this is now placed on that group of poor people . This also ignores the effect of increasing the demand for mortgages , meaning interest rates will increase . There are many hidden costs to what you propose , and as usual , wealthier people will weather those costs with less ill-effect than the poor .",English,Native,,Native
"Landlords have economies of scale , which owner-occupiers do not . Why would owner-occupiers be more economically efficient ? Rental property tends to have denser populations than owner-occupier property , which makes it more economically efficient . You 'd require quite high rental-property taxes to get renters to decide to switch to buying a home . But there will always be people who can not afford to be owner-operators , so they are stuck with increased rents . And would n't there be now be an incentive for lower value property to be used for rentals , since lower value means lower property taxes ? So now the poor people stuck renting have to live in industrial slums . I do n't see this tax being a win for anyone , except those who own low value property -- and that 's only compared to everyone else who has to bear the costs by either changing their living situation , or by paying more rent . Edit : also , as I said in another comment , mortgage rates will increase as the demand for home loans increases with more people flooding the home-owner market . This does n't help anyone . And the Reserve bank would probably respond to those higher rates by lowering the OCR to bring bank interest rates back down , which will artificially stimulate the rest of the economy by encouraging businesses to invest more , when in reality the economic environment does not ( can not ) support more investment . This will lead to riskier investment projects getting green lit , and contribute further to economic instability . We can not continue to advocate for economic knobs being fiddled with when the consequences are so incredibly unknown .",English,Native,,Native

As for advice ... are you in immediate harm ? Your dad threatened to beat you , but do you think he would go through with it ? If you do n't think he would , my advice would be to try to fly under the radar , disconnect from your parents as much as you can , and do n't let them mess with your head too much . Hanging out with friends as much as you can . Time away from the house . Go to the library . Try to keep decent grades , though I know it 's tough when you 're dealing with this shit . Definitely try to get a job . Having your own money really helps foster your independence . If you are certain that violence will occur , I 'd tell as many trusted adults as you can . Some adults may be secret narc enablers , so try to get as many different opinions as you can . You might get to a point where you want to test your parents . Like if you 're in a heated argument .

"& gt ; Forgiving unrepentant people is perhaps the most critical portion . I 've heard this usage of the word `` forgive '' before , but it is not the common usage . When people think of forgiveness , they imagine getting back together , hugging , and saying `` I forgive you ! '' The word is also used in another context : to forgive a debt . We know what this means . It is an allowance of previously unallowable behavior . & gt ; Consider this : If a person is unrepentant , do you really think they have a single care about whether or not you forgive them ? Do you really think that by refusing to forgive them , it somehow does you any good ? I know they care . Everyone cares about how they are viewed . If bad people were called out and shunned , rather than having their shitty behavior swept under the rug , we would be living in a much better world : a world where even narcissists tried to be good people because they would suffer the consequences otherwise . A world where people do n't turn away and look embarrassed when a child is being mistreated . I am angry when I see these bad things happen . If only more of us were , perhaps we could end the cycle . It seems to me that the people eager to preach forgiveness are the ones that would gain most from it . It validates their decisions to forgive bad people , and it validates bad behavior from bad people . When I think back on how my dad treated me , I feel angry . I was not treated respectfully . I can not will the anger away , that would be a self manipulation and a denial of my true feelings . But I am free from him now . The wounded child within me has regained trust in the world , and most importantly : the wounded child trusts me to keep him safe . And I will . That means no abusers . That means no `` letting it slide '' . That means hearing his pains and concerns , and taking them seriously . That is healing . I think we are talking about the same thing , but you are using the language of enablement when you call this process `` forgiveness '' . I would urge you to find a better word , mainly to aid in clarifying the problem to those of us who are less versed in the subject . Perhaps `` coming to terms with it '' . What are your thoughts ?",English,Native,,Native
"Happy to help . If you do have to continue to see your dad , try to engage in `` safe '' activities and conversations . I remember my dad and I used to go to the movies a lot together . It was a great way to kill time without having to deal with him that much . Or sitting on the couch watching TV with him . At least then he thinks he 's getting time with you , and you get to remain somewhat distant . It would be best if you were n't forced to see him , though ... It is hard having to fake it , especially when you 've snapped out of the daze of illusion . The inside of my head used to physically hurt when I was around my parents . It was hard to think clearly . Something you might need to be more aware of is your relationship with your mom . You seem to have already figured her out pretty well , but I can imagine it would be easy to see her as the good parent when compared to your dad . Remember : she chose your dad . Again , I 'm really sorry that this has fallen on your young shoulders . It should n't be this way . Edit : Some advice for you regarding your mom . You feel controlled by her and want some freedom . Practical stuff here : do you own a bike ? Can you bike into the city , or visit friends that way ? That way you will be less reliant on her to get to places . How about friends ? Can they pick you up and take you places ? Is money a concern ? Can you get a job anyplace ? Maybe even mowing lawns ? If she wo n't let you do stuff , perhaps arrange things with other people first , then tell your mom she has to cancel on them over the phone . Her having to show her control over you with a third party watching might make her think twice . That 's all I got for now . Take care bud .",English,Native,,Native

"Hi paper_sun_flowers . I 'm sorry about your situation . It seems like you are stuck , but you have a specific plan that will eventually get you out of that stuckness . I do n't know you , so I hope this does n't come off as condescending , but it sounds like you have very specific conditions that you 've decided you need to meet before you can leave . At first glance , these seem like excuses . I think you need to value your mental health as much as you would your physical health . At the moment you are inhaling cancerous smoke . A lot of it . People like your mother are terrible for your psychological well being , but we can become so accustomed to them that we do n't see the true extent of the horror . That cashier got a couple of minutes of it , and was horrified . If your house was on fire and you were inhaling smoke , would you be considering the specific things you 'd like to achieve before you leave ? Grab the laptop , that nice pair of jeans , ca n't forget that painting from 8th grade ? Or would you be frantically heading for the nearest window to smash and bail out of ? You can build the career you want and the life you want once you are in a safe stable environment . For now I would strongly suggest getting the hell out of there . The cheapest , crappiest apartment with a minimum wage job will be better than being trapped with a narcissist . That cashier does n't earn much , but the look on their face tells you a lot about the kind of people they would allow in their life .",English,Native,,Native

"The prime minister no doubt used her visit to Saudi Arabia to desperately seek trade deals that will help cobble together a plan to combat the monumental act of self-harm that is leaving the single market . What she should have done was have a moment of conscience and think about the people of Yemen . International charities say Yemen is in the grip of a perfect storm of war , economic meltdown and humanitarian crisis . Yet while British aid is helping to save lives there , the country is being being pounded by British arms , sold to our Saudi Arabia allies , exacerbating the situation . Yemeni families face a daily nightmare of falling bombs , a critical lack of clean water and food which leaves the country teetering on the edge of famine and outbreaks of preventable conditions such as cholera and measles which are killing a child every ten minutes . This nightmare is deepened by “ widespread and systematic ” international humanitarian law violations by the Saudi coalition that have the “ potential to meet the criteria for a crime against humanity ” , according to a panel of experts set up by the United Nations . The figures are almost impossible to comprehend : 18 million people , including ten million children , need humanitarian assistance . That ’ s eight in ten people in Yemen who need humanitarian aid to survive . Britain can take credit for its leadership in providing humanitarian aid to Yemen — but ministers must also take responsibility for failing to use British influence to ensure that aid is not blocked . They have also failed to hold to account those responsible for the unrelenting attacks on civilians . Save the Children has said that the warring parties , including the Saudi-led coalition , are blocking aid as a “ weapon of war ” : detaining aid workers , bombing ports and holding up desperately needed food and medicines . Plans to attack the port of Hodeida , already damaged by Saudi bombs , risk causing a humanitarian catastrophe if steps are not taken to divert aid to other ports . Hodeida receives nearly three quarters of all imports and humanitarian assistance shipments . For a country which Britain counts as an ally to be deliberately withholding aid is bad enough but the Saudi-led coalition is also responsible for the unrelenting bombardment of Yemen ’ s towns and cities , hitting homes , destroying clinics trying to care for starving families and killing children in their classrooms . Similar crimes are undoubtedly being committed by the Houthi opposition . Deliberately withholding lifesaving aid and attacking civilians are war crimes yet in Yemen these reports are not being properly investigated and those responsible are not being held to account . To date , the government has said that the investigations , led by the Saudis themselves , are sufficient . It could not be clearer that the Saudis investigating themselves is woefully inadequate and deeply inappropriate . The case for a fully independent , international investigation into alleged war crimes , on all sides of the conflict in Yemen , is irrefutable . Yemen faces a humanitarian catastrophe . The government must stand up for international humanitarian law , halt arms sales , demand that our allies immediately allow humanitarian access and support calls for a ceasefire and a full , impartial investigation into what appear to be horrific war crimes . To leave Saudi Arabia with more credibility than her predecessors , our prime minister had to stop the flow of arms . By failing to do so , her government chose shamefully to side with Saudi Arabia , rather than hold the Saudi authorities to account on their alleged human rights abuses in Yemen . Ours is a government which has abetted a humanitarian disaster and brought further bloodshed and poverty to civilians in an already stricken land . The continued failure of the government to take action in Yemen leaves Britain ’ s reputation in the world permanently damaged .",English,Native,,Native

As one of those angry fans at the stadium . It is because it is a derby game that we have n't one in ages and recent games have had events that make it worse . Personally I hate Chelsea more than Spurs which helps make it worse as it is the match I look forward to the most when seeing the fixture list at the start of the season .,English,Native,,Native
"Similar to last year for arsenal fans . Spurs and Chelsea were in the final , I ended up wanting Chelsea to win because a win for Spurs in the league cup would 've meant more to them .",English,Native,,Native

"Although it was announced about a week ago , I 'm wondering what people think of it here . Personally I 'm not happy at all because I live very close to Kneller Hall ( I can see part of it from my bedroom ) . That along with the rugby stadia , makes the area much more interesting imo , so I 'm livid that they want to sell off the grade 2 listed building .",English,Native,,Native
"Whilst that probably is the case , I just think it makes the area better and more interesting , e.g . just appreciating it whenever I walk past it . However I 'm not fully clued up on how much of a grade 2 listed building can be changed . So if the exterior is n't to be changed at all with little changes to the surrounding areas , then I guess it would be a decent compromise .",English,Native,,Native

"And it is for that reason why I do n't think vac bans should be permanent , but rather last 2/3 years . This is because I think a ban should be long enough to ruin someone 's career but give them a second chance .",English,Native,,Native
That does seem a bit shit .,English,Native,,Native
"If you play the game properly , e.g . not trolling , holding angles correctly , decent aim , playing around your team ( e.g . not over stacking a site ) . You can have someone that communicates , but also plays like an idiot , which personally annoys me a lot more . If someone who does n't communicate , but knows there place on the team because of it ( e.g . following strats instead of creating their own without telling anyone ) they can still be very helpful . Also if you ca n't communicate with your team mates it does n't mean you ca n't listen to what they say , although that does n't remove the language barrier .",English,Native,,Native
"Your second point seems a bit arbitrary . Anyway I have 1.5k hrs on the game , most of them with mates . However I have played a few albeit not many games by myself with little communication ( I usually give up communicating after a few rounds if no one else is ) , which we have won because we all played smart and knew what we were doing . I have also won games where I was in a group of 3/4 and the randoms did n't communicate , yet we won partly because he knew what he was doing , did n't interrupt us and held his own . Do you know that matchmaking ( which is what we are talking about right now ) is n't the highest level of cs and that not everyone needs to act like they are a professional playing the game in optimal conditions . What is hard to grasp around that .",English,Native,,Native
"Bloody hell , we are talking about matchmaking not bloody professional games . Do pro players search for a game with randoms and that is their team for the tournament , no you mong . Matchmaking is a completely different level , where you can play your best and not communicate . Do you expect 5 randoms on matchmaking to have pre set strats and anti strats like pros do , of course you bloody do n't . Your delusional if you believe you can use professional teams as an example for how matchmaking should be set out .",English,Native,,Native
"I usually play with mates , however on the off chance I do n't , I always use my microphone , unless as stated no one else does in like 4/5 rounds then I give up . My view is that not its not as black and white as everyone seems to think . And I can understand why some might not be able to/not want to talk in game .",English,Native,,Native
"Part of the reason why commercial TV in the UK is n't as bad as the US is because the BBC holds the other providers to a higher standard . ITV and other commercial TV providers have to compete with BBC , so if the BBC were to go the standard will be lowered drastically .",English,Native,,Native
"BBC definitely provides more than netflix , if you include things like their news service , education , radio and more .",English,Native,,Native
"Fair enough , it was a pretty big assumption . Maybe I was over exaggerating , however I believe were the BBC to go the quality of other channels would decrease , but not as much as originally stated ( i.e . not to US levels , maybe somewhere inbetween ) . Also whilst I would like the BBC to continue , even as a media tax or something , for some reason I do n't see it happening , especially not in its current form . I do n't think it will disappear completely , however I can see certain parts of the BBC being cut , if the licence were to go .

"With talking about the UK , whilst there has n't been any official research on it to my knowledge either , I still think it is quite effective . Part of that is anecdotally as I support arsenal , and I go to nearly every home game , but I also support AFC Wimbledon as a second team , and I do often go to see them play when Arsenal have a small away game . So personally it does encourage me to go see a lower league team . Also I have no source for this but I think I have read somewhere before that many lower league teams do generally experience lower attendances when there is a big game at 12:45 ( a football game should n't start before 2/3 pm , but that 's another topic ) . Again I have no source on this , but it does seem believable and I have heard it said a few times before .",English,Native,,Native

Often times you are forced to sit down ( the only area where you can stand is the lower tier north bank ) .

Everyday seems to be a sad day for uk csgo .,English,Native,,Native
Fair enough on the first point . Second point we kind of agree with . Finally I am wondering when you started playing csgo if you say I 'm basically going back into the beta . http : //blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2012/10/5256/ this is the update that introduced matchmaking ( after the games release ) and here https : //twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/279060714516258818 is when the map selection was introduced . This means that for at least the first 2 months of matchmaking you could n't have a map selection . Your point might be true for the first 6-8 months you started playing csgo ( although that is still very subjective ) but definitely not the first 6-8 months of the games release .,English,Native,,Native
"I was arguing one of your points , I could probably think of some others if I can be arsed to . But to continue arguing your point about maps . You said you only play inferno and cache now , well one of those was n't even in matchmaking then . Also if you decided you wanted to play another map that was n't inferno but was still decent you would have to search for all the defuse maps . And oh bollocks I 'm now playing a match on Aztec .

"For me the one of my concerns after watching it was him mentioning some kind of play-off system . To my understanding ( I could be very wrong on this ) it is very popular with American sports to have a play-off system to win the title , and that Thorin mentioned something similar . This is something that would ruin the league for me , because what is the point of a league , where you can win every game but have an off game in the final to the 4th placed team or something ( although writing that as an arsenal fan is tempting : - ) . It takes the point of having a league away especially if all the league games are played on lan . For online leagues it makes sense to have the online finals on lan in a play-off system , however for a league on lan there is no point of having a play-off system to decide who wins .",English,Native,,Native
"In football the only league that does to my knowledge is the Championship , and below in English football . And these are n't for the title , they are only for promotion spots , and there are nearly always at least 2 automatic promotion spots as well .",English,Native,,Native
"But there is a much higher chance that the best team wo n't win . For example you can easily win every single game , but have a slight dip in form to a team that played well in the final , but nowhere near as well . I know it is like this for basically every csgo event right now , but that is because they basically have to be like that . This is because the leagues are either online , which is not a way to see who wins a large event , or that they do n't have time for a proper league system and have to use group stages instead . Just because it minimises pointless games , or is more exciting to to watch the final , does n't mean it is as fair . If a team wins it in week 8 out of 10 then chances are they deserve to win it . There is no point calling it a league when the winner is decided in a knock out competition , call it something else at the very least .",English,Native,,Native
"Its the banter that makes the game more competitive for me and more lively , as it feels a lot better beating someone that was shitting on you or annoying you before .

Because I am very bad at bhop , I only ever use autohop for prespeeding on trying to get past levels I ca n't do , however I ca n't use autohop normally as I find my strafes and jumps to be a lot less accurate . That being said I respect both types of users , with a slight preference for scrollers .

"I 'm not sure if it would be possible or not , as I have little to no knowledge on modding and the game engine .

"I 'm talking more about the first 6-12 months . Anyway what about the fact they used the foggy maps when the _se maps where used basically everywhere else . It also did n't have as many competitive maps as mirage and cache were n't official maps then ( they also used the old very , very shite version of nuke for some time ) . Also matchmaking is not about the challenge of getting a rank , it is about how good the games are as well as how challenging the games are . I am a bit biased , as I still think the matchmaking ranks are pretty worthless and do n't represent much . Also at the start of matchmaking you could n't even have a map selection .

So then why should it be limited to csgo , as 1.6 and source were both played at competitive levels as well .",English,Native,,Native
"How so ? I would strongly disagree with that statement , albeit that is largely based off my memory . However when the csgo devs tweeted this https : //twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/291681838047559680 you can kind of see the state it was in , as there were no skilled players in mm ( because 64 tick and mm did n't use the _se maps ) , and this influx where actually just cheaters .",English,Native,,Native

It 's bloody matchmaking for crying out loud .",English,Native,,Native
"Look I nearly always play in a 5man , never by myself . My point is that not being able to communicate should n't mean you are not allowed to play mm . Your reason is bollocks as well , what if some random bloke from Spain or somewhere who does n't speak English and has an hour spare , wants to have a quick csgo mix . None of his friends are online or want to play at that moment in time , so he has to search by himself . Why should the person in that situation not be allowed to play csgo .",English,Native,,Native

"Well top level play is more important than mm , and I personally feel that mm should have the same settings as the pro scene , to help develop new players .",English,Native,,Native
Compromise between what ? What does the pro scene have to compromise for in this regard ?,English,Native,,Native
"Csgo is a competitive game not a casual one . Therefore it should be revolved around higher level play . The pro scene is also largely the reason the game is as popular as it is now there is a lot of money involved ( less so now , due to the skins being in the game ) .",English,Native,,Native

"Most of the corporate tickets are in the club level to my knowledge , so that is n't really an issue .

I have n't got a source for this but I have heard that when there is a big early kick off match the attendance for many lower league teams is less . If the more casual fans could watch their premiership team on the telly or any old match at 3 o'clock I think it would lead to reduced attendances for many clubs .",English,Native,,Native

"I agree that team modes takes the pressure off each player in general , but not in 2v2s and to a lesser extent 3v3s , where I believe the pressure is greater . This is because in 2v2s you are not only playing for yourself but for your team mate . And if your are not playing with someone you know , there is extra pressure not to screw over your team mates experience as well , as how you play is a much bigger contribution to the team modes in other games like csgo or overwatch . I 'm not one to complain about toxicity , but I can see it being the biggest issue in small teams , where your contribution is a big factor to the team 's success of that match .",English,Native,,Native
"Its probably a personal thing then because I feel less pressure when I am only playing for myself , compared to a 2v2 with a random , where I feel like I have to perform more , with a mate I am usually just playing for fun so I would feel less pressure then .",English,Native,,Native

I might be biased because I enjoy playing combo decks but I also enjoy playing against them as well . Especially freeze mage which I have never played myself . The reason for this is because you have to think completely differently to nearly every other match up on how you space your threats and pressure your opponent enough into forcing them to use combo pieces early enough .

"The match wo n't sell out , most of the upper tier will be closed as well ( assuming similar sales to last year ) . However I proper respect you for not wanting to take a spot from an actual supporter , which is an issue with tourist fans at bigger matches . I think the lower tier behind the goal will have a better atmosphere but those tickets will sell faster as they are released first ( I assume for a match like this they will only open the upper tier when the lower tier gets close to selling out ) , the ones left will probably be for the very front where the view might not be as good . This is mainly speculation , I went last year ( AFC Wimbledon fan ) so it is based off my patchy memory and general experience at football matches , I just thought it might be helpful because you mentioned in another comment you want the 'full experience ' , any seat you get will still be good though , just some slight differences .",English,Native,,Native

Just keep it as it is , if the station is n't busy enough to have barrier do n't but have inspectors going through the train now and then or have inspectors waiting at a station exit now and then , which should be able to catch most repeat offenders .

"Because his results mattered to his progression , so there was no incentive for him to purposely lose . However in some of the HGG games teams have been bringing shit decks when they have already been eliminated from the tournament , and other teams are relying on the results from those teams , so the matches still matter . Its like when in football , when a team finishes mid table and has nothing to play for at the end of the season , they do usually play worse , as there is no incentive for them to play well .

"Thanks to this subreddit I have recently built the following pc . http : //uk.pcpartpicker.com/p/MwCct6 Whilst I am very pleased with how it went in general , I am occasionally getting headaches from how loud the stock cpu cooler is . I was under the assumption that if I was n't going to overclock ( which I am not ) I would n't need to upgrade the cpu cooler . According to the cpu temperature this is correct however I can not stand the noise it makes . After looking around for after market cpu coolers I of course came across the cm 212 evo . And whilst it seems very good for the price it seems like I would have to take my motherboard out to install it . So I am looking for a cheap ( under £25 ) cpu cooler for my fx 6300 that has the same instillation method as the stock cooler and is a lot quieter than it .",English,Native,,Native

So if they forced me to play a certain game mode such as 2v2 I would just uninstall the game and go play something else . When I search the only options I put on now are comp 1v1 and instagib ( I had a few more when I was learning the game ) and I would say 60 % of the matches are 1v1 . The matchmaking is the only reason for me playing the game as when I first got the game I would n't want to just randomly go into 1v1 servers and ask for a match . To be honest quick play should be renamed into matchmaking . Sorry if this is just an incoherent rant , but I just got a bit annoyed with the idea of taking away the duel matchmaking , which is what I think arena shooters main game mode should be .",English,Native,,Native

"Why not allow both , like I would play on 1.6 graphics if I had the option , but I also think those that want to play on max settings should be allowed to .

Third keepers are usually u19/u21s players or are coming very close to retirement and are good people to keep around the club ( e.g . good personality/possibly future coach ) so I would say having an out and out third keeper does n't really exist .

"Well football manager ( it says it in the name for crying out loud ) is incredibly addicting so a lot of people will naturally have a lot of hours in it . Also a lot of people , myself included often leave the game open whilst they do other things but plan on playing it later on . Also some people think it is worse/less realistic as previous versions or not enough improvements have been made , and people like to pick out small issues in the game as major flaws . Saying that I would still give it a high rating because I love playing it , I am just writing this from the perspective of others .",English,Native,,Native

I would also argue your point that they deserve the tickets more because they are prepared to pay more . Whilst this is probably true in a business standpoint , in theory they deserve the ticket just as much as any one else or some ( myself included ) will argue that the true fans that support the team week in , week out ( not saying you have to go to every game ) deserve the tickets more than someone who is prepared to pay more for a one of trip to the stadium .",English,Native,,Native

For example this weekend when Arsenal are away to Newcastle , a game I wo n't be able to go to and it 's a 3 o'clock game so it 's not on Sky , I am going to go to the Wimbledon V Pompey game .

Finally it is something to do on the weekend if arsenal are n't playing at home at 3pm . Edit : I forgot to mention one of the main reasons why I like them is that I hate MK passionately , so I like them because I hate their rivals .

"What 's the point of spoiling the ballot paper , as it does literally nothing , they do n't bother looking at them nor counting them , so why should you bother wasting your time . Of course everyone cares about their future but many simply do n't care who is in power as it does n't affect them , they ca n't be arsed to look into the parties polices or they believe the only parties that can get in are the same or do n't affect . They also might not have a strong preference as they may agree with both the main parties or not care about them so they do n't want a vote of someone who does n't care to be counted .

"Thanks for that cause it slightly changes my view on spoiling the paper . However I do believe it is possible not to care . I do care , but I will use my dad as an example who I am sure will not be voting or if he does it is will be to annoy my mum . He does n't care as he thinks the main three parties are all the same and none of their policies will affect him in any major way , he just likes to get on with his life and not bother looking into politics because it is unlikely to affect his life drastically . If it looked like an extremist party was able to get into power then yes he probably would vote to stop that .",English,Native,,Native
"Put it this way , I see your point and I understand it , but I disagree as I know nothing could persuade him to think differently , his vote counts but he does n't care about it/does n't want his lack of an opinion to count .

"Your second point is why I disagree with video technology in most situations , like if the ref did n't call the penalty , the game carries on and anything can happen , and what if the call is made that it was n't a penalty . What do you do there , give the ball to the other team ? Well chances are they just missed the chance for a good counter attack .",English,Native,,Native
"Often times teams try to take a quick set piece and are not stopped , so that line of thought is wrong . However I do agree with some of your other points on if the game has already stopped then use it , however it would have to be implemented correctly in that case as I see a lot of room for error , by making things drag out much longer and needed . And there is another issue of teams possibly forcing the video decision to be made by deliberately stopping the play . This does already happen to some extent and it is not always bad however in many cases I think it can be , although that 's a complicated one .",English,Native,,Native
"I see your point , however the ref would be more inclined to call a penalty knowing that it can be reviewed after . Then what happens if it turns out not to be a penalty . Like a said in me previous comment there is a high chance that the other team could 've had a counter attack when instead they will just have a free kick which is a much slower build up than a possible quick counter . Or what if the team the penalty was called for but in the end disallowed , what if they were still in possession of the ball and ended up getting a corner or something . As it stands now refs do n't play advantage in the box , so if that does n't change then we could have an issue of the attacking team losing possession due to the ref incorrectly calling a penalty .",English,Native,,Native
"I sort of agree with you . Especially for checking if a goal was offside or not , however as the other person who replied to you said it would n't work for checking penalty calls . I am not against using technology to make calls , however I believe it has to be done correct and not affect the games flow in anyway what so ever . Goal line technology is a good example of this .",English,Native,,Native
"I agree with your reasoning , however if that is the case , I can easily see refs being more harsh with penalty calls as they know it can be reviewed . Then if that 's the case more issues are caused , I explained in more detail why in another of my comments if you are interested in seeing why .",English,Native,,Native
"I have to agree with everything you said there , especially the bit about many calls being subjective .",English,Native,,Native
"I agree with there being less diving . So it becomes a debate of would you rather have more stoppages and disrupt the flow in some situations or less diving and more correct decisions ( sometimes there is never a correct decision ) .

"I think your analogy is valid and creates a good point . However I still think the context is a bit different as what you are suggesting sounds a bit more personal , and I do n't think the reddit admins really care about what one bloke who does n't know what he is talking about opinion on the situation is . Maybe I got my other comment wrong and he was chatting bollocks , I do n't know . But I just think his point was n't too outrageous and did n't need a snarky comment in return . Although I do agree from a constructive point for the reddit admins his comment was a bit useless .",English,Native,,Native
"Sounds like you have never watched a match before and you just believe what non football fans say about controversial decisions in football . If you do n't mind so I do n't have to copy something out again go onto my profile , control f penalty and read what I have said , maybe read the context for a better idea what I was referring to . Also many penalty calls are subjective so a video ref wo n't work , my other arguements are in other comments I have recently posted .",English,Native,,Native
I liked it before when there was an option to mute the other team . Why should normal people have to adept to those that whinge and ca n't type a command in ? I also liked it because it made the games more interesting if you know what the other team are like personally . For example if the team acted like complete arses I would be more motivated to play well against them and form a temporary rivalry . On the other hand if the other team are quite nice and we had a good conversation then I find the game more enjoyable and you respect the opponent more . Either way I see a benefit . I just think the game is a bit more bland now . PS you may find this a bit cuntish bit I did enjoy playing the following in warm up now and then .

Also many of these drugs can affect your productivity so if your not well off how do you pay the addictions ? This can lead to crime such as burglary . This does n't even factor the effects caused by drugs which can cause people to be more aggressive and violent . This is what I have been told in the past anyway , so I 'm not the most educated on the subject . I believe most not to powerful/addictive drugs should be legalised and the others decriminalised for those in possession for personal use so they can get rehabilitated rather than a criminal record .",English,Native,,Native

"I do n't think the question you should necessarily be wrestling with is whether or not you should have carried that night , the question you should be asking yourself is , given appropriate justification , are you will to end the life of another person in defense of your own ? Simple enough question , but probably not so simple to answer . If you are , then carry as you see fit . If you are n't , do n't . I would n't worry about the consequences of what happens after , either . If you end up having to take another person 's life in self defense , whatever legal troubles come afterward are a far sight better than being dead , I 'd say . You can think about all the what-ifs you like , but you ca n't ever reasonably know that the person on the other end of the barrel is n't going to pull the trigger . Even if he had calmly stated , `` I 'm carrying a concealed weapon and I 'm about to draw it and aim it at you , menacingly , but I do n't intend to shoot you , '' you still could n't be reasonably sure he did n't intend to shoot you anyway . Regardless of your answer to the question I posed , you 'd be better served learning how to deescalate situations like that in the future . Your intuition lead you to believe this man was going to be a threat based on his demeanor , so getting defensive and telling him to get off of the property was n't the best way to handle that situation . Apologizing for upsetting him ( regardless of whether you were at fault ) and asking how you could help in a calm and courteous manner would have been better . If he is n't capable of being reasoned with , then you 'd just end up in the same situation anyway , but at the very least you gave him the opportunity to calm down . Deescalation is your best defense in these situations , whether the aggressor is armed or not . The firearm is always the last resort .",English,Native,,Native

"For a point of reference , take a look at the last stat on the before/after . Notice how before it 's 100/100 and a stat that Expert/Ace has no bearing on ? ( no green +30 like others ) . Right now , that stat is maxed out . Now on the after , the star converted amount is 5 stars +3 . Ace gives additional +2 . So the max for any stat is now 10/10 ( vs. 100/100 or 50/50 , etc. ) . So what was a max stat , is now only 80 % ( 5+3/10 ) . In order to get the last 20 % ( which was already earned ) a player is going to need to pay for it , or spend an incredible amount of time earning it .

"As frustrating as bombers are to take down , proper interception tactics would ease a lot of it . What I witness in SB matches , and what I admittedly do myself , is not take the necessary time to setup proper intercepts . So you get these lazy attacks where you 're relative speed is hardly any faster , or you 're just coming right up behind them , and just sitting in their gun sights . Getting shot down this way is proper . You fly poorly , you perform poorly . That said , there should be a couple of changes that could be made to SB bombers to make them less gamey . One is to require manual inputs to the bomb sight for altitude and speed , no more automatic computing . You should n't be able to jink in your B-17 to dodge a fighter , then level off and 5 seconds later drop bombs with pinpoint precision . Bombers should need to commit more wholly to the bomb run . I get that the bomber and pilot are two separate people , and conceivably they could do these things simultaneously IRL , but this is a reasonable balancing move . The other , and probably harder to code , change should be that AI does not shoot while within clouds . I understand why bombers choose to fly in clouds , but you should n't get to take advantage of not being seen , while simultaneously reaping the benefits of being able to `` see '' the enemy on account of your AI . Especially when it only take a few well places bullets to set a fighter alight and end their mission .",English,Native,,Native
"That 's a fair point . I mostly play in Tier IV where a spaded German fighter has the ability to get up and intercept in time . I imagine this is a harder thing to accomplish in Tier III or below . I do n't think there 's going to be any magic bullet with the way the game is setup right now . You can increase HP of targets to force bombers to loiter longer , but then that puts nations like Germany and the Soviet Union at a disadvantage with their lower bomb loads . You could make the maps bigger , to provide more time for intercept , but then it becomes impossible to patrol the whole front line . I honestly wish there was side-wide voice chat in SB . Coordinated attacks on bombers would do wonders ...",English,Native,,Native

"The Horton , and most flying wings , suffer from a severe lack of elevator ( or elevon ) authority .

"There 's the old saying , `` Speed is life and altitude is life insurance . '' This applies to the SB game mode most of all . On maps where it 's not low overcast , you 'll want to climb up to at least 3km , preferably 4km . That way you can dive in on people and have enough speed to break away and you also reduce the chances of getting bounced , yourself . Another piece of advice I have is to not over commit to an enemy . You may get so excited chasing someone down who you have the advantage on that you spend too much time trying to finish the job . Gunnery is much more difficult locked inside a cockpit , so until you 're more proficient , just make one pass and then break away . If it 's 3 on 1 or something , though , then go hog wild . Finally , check your six and check it often . Really , until you 're fully engaged , there 's no such thing as checking your six too often .",English,Native,,Native

"Trim - The others have answered most of it . I would add that you 'll mostly be using trim in climb or while landing . Once you 're engaged in combat , you 'll want to neutralize everything . The exception to that is during diving attacks where having negative elevator trim is very helpful in relieving stick pressure as you make a pass . Zoom - I just set this to a button with min and max values , not on axis . I tried binding it to a slider axis ( X45 ) and it never behaved the way I wanted it to . I 've never been in a situation where I 've thought an intermediate level of zoom would have been preferential to either being zoomed fully in or out , so I 'd just use buttons for the min/max . Throttle inversion - There should be an option within the settings of the axis to invert the input . That said , I want to say that the axis binds its direction based on the initial input . So you could always try re-mapping the axis going from Idle to Full . If that does n't work , the inversion option will .",English,Native,,Native

"[ AB ] I thoroughly enjoy using the D-13 in Arcade . It climbs like it 's never heard of gravity , has plenty of maneuverability , and the 3 mg151/20s make for a decent firepower package whether you 're up against fighters or bombers . It gets sluggish in turn speed at lower speeds ( as with most late war German birds ) , but the roll rate helps give you options . Acceleration is good and it has enough dive performance to keep up with most of what you come against . [ SB ] Absolutely my favorite plane to use so far , no question . I have n't unlocked the D-9 or D-12 , which I 'm betting will be similar , but as compared to everything leading up to it in the German tree , just fantastic . That giant Jumo 213 engine really lets you dictate the terms your fights . Its firepower in SB is more than adequate . My favorite quality , shared among all the FW series , is the visibility . I have n't flown other nations ' aircraft of similar tier to compare , but it 's a stark contrast to the very limited FOV one gets in a 109 cockpit . The only thing I do n't trust it for in SB is energy fighting on the deck . It can hold its own against most enemies for a few turns , but it quickly sheds its energy and you have to be very conscious of your maneuvers to not get taken down . I also echo Maxrdt 's concerns over its quickness to overheat . You tend to get enough time to WEP climb to target and engage for a few passes before the Orange temps arrive . I find myself having to disengage in extended fights to cool the engine as you really need to be running throttle at 100 % when you 're in the fight . You definitely have to be careful when in extended fights to keep your engine temps low enough so you 've time to cut and run if you find yourself at a disadvantage . Overall I 'm very pleased with the Fw-190 D-13 and feel my money was well spent .",English,Native,,Native

A first person perspective is honestly what 's needed , even if it 's just a little hash mark in the center of the screen . Bombers need an air start . A delayed spawn is a good idea ( from another comment ) and so is spawning further behind the lines . The maps are just too small and even the super props ca n't get to altitude in time to stop the B-29 horde that is anything vs. America . If the defenders had enough time to climb and get a modest altitude advantage before the bombers could get to the first targets , I feel like that alone would improve the gameplay significantly .",English,Native,,Native
"It can be when flying late Tier IV or early Tier V when America is in the rotation . Some days it 's not so bad , but last night was particularly rife with bomber spam . The maps are generally too small to allow whoever is defending against the Americans to get altitude and defend before the bases are all destroyed . B-17s and B-24s are n't so bad , but 2 B-29s with the default bomb load can completely bomb out the bases and airfield in one run . On the flip side , when you 're flying American , you 're usually at a 2-1 or worse Fighter v. Fighter disadvantage , so if your bombers ca n't get the job done taking out the targets you 're going to lose by virtue of being outnumbered . I do n't know of any other team that suffers from this at those tiers .

If you were the one who joined and it added you in one at a time , or added as many enemy aircraft as allies , you 'd have a situation where you 're taking off into a 2 to 1 disadvantage or worse and that would be even more frustrating . What I do n't like is doing all the work to bring a match to a close , only to have it underdone by JiP .

Yeah.. I do n't think so . I 'm a libertarian and I 'm still going to vote for Rand Paul or a libertarian candidate .

That logic is ridiculous and the only reason why anyone upvoted you is because they were already opposed to fiscal libertarian policies and some social libertarian policies . And you know what I say is true . Do n't succumb to propaganda garbage .,English,Native,,Native
"The argument holds some legitimacy in the sense that some states already have consent ages set at 16 . Lowering the consent age would also lower the amount of prosecutable crimes in society , resulting in more freedom and less resources spent on a judicial level . The dilemma is : How low is too low when it comes to changing the age of consent ? The second dilemma is one that lawmakers face . How can a representative propose such legislation without appearing like a weirdo ?",English,Native,,Native
"In simple terms , a true libertarian is one who believes in individual liberty and fiscal conservatism . The goal is to keep the government out of people 's lives as much as possible . Example : you should be able to own firearms since ownership does n't harm anybody , but you should be charged with a crime if you use them unjustly . Example : you should be able to abuse your body with harmful drugs without being charged with a crime . Example : if a tax on income shall exist , then it should be at one single rate which applies to everyone equally .",English,Native,,Native

"The program ca n't afford to pay them min wage each , and it 's illegal to pay them $ .50c/hr due to labor regulations . It 's a voluntary opportunity and it 's clear what the program offers . You are being offered free food and board for your labor and you get nothing else . You understand that it will never change . I think it 's better than nothing for some homeless people . You 're also forgetting that the program has to deal with all of the problems that comes with dealing with vagrants , their mental issues , unpredictability , etc . There are no debts placed on the homeless by the program and no one is being held against their will . Thus , it is not slavery . & gt ; Technically you can but if you have no money , where else can you go ? Especially if you are doing this in a foreign country , you are basically stuck with no means to escape Again you are missing the point , the homeless come into the program with absolutely nothing , but at least they can come out with a better spirit and certified work experience . You claim the program to be sinister , yet that 's impossible with a voluntary system . The only thing negative here are wage regulations which prevent the program from paying the homeless anything at all . Your logic makes me angry to be honest . You 'd rather the homeless starve and sleep on the streets instead of having an opportunity to work for a full stomach and a warm bed . There exists no magical job that will pay vagrants $ 20/hr , plus room and board.. That 's not how economies work . & gt ; if you have no money , where else can you go ?
