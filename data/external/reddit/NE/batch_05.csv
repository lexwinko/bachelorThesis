ANYWAY the racial tension you speak of is predominantly from one single demographic : blacks . And their unwillingness to integrate into the ( successful ) American system . Instead attempting to alter it ... .. sound familiar ... ... Islam in Europe ? So I would argue there are different levels of diversity . Level 1 is Poles accepting Ukrainians . Then you have Asians in Australia/Canada and `` Westernized '' religious folks from Turkey & amp ; Israel . But below that is the Africans and Arabs . Look , think and/or act just too different .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"If I can add anything about the song - this is n't a - so to say - 'killer ' song , or single , but maybe it should n't be ? It feels to me as this is the song that describes a moment when The Robot With Human Hair was born . The series always focused on problems - Robot always had it hard fitting with people due to his various problems . In part 2 he does n't gratuate high school . In par 2 1/2 he discovers and becomes addicted to sex . In parts 3-4 he struggles with drugs . This song , in my opinion shows how young and naive young people can be , thinking they do n't want the boring life , they want to have it all and wo n't miss anything . He 's talking how he is some kind of leader , as if he found the better way to live and he 's on the 'outside ' when they are on the 'inside ' - he is living the life of pleasures while they 're living boring , normal lives and he 's sure that his way is the better one and others will follow him . The song starts with the main protagonist reassuring himself that he should n't feel bad because it was in a way 'destined ' for him to live this life . The second Tilian verse feels like he 's breaking ties with those who would advise him to not do the things he wants to do . ( Like parents ) About the Mess first verse : Brain = Robot wang , he makes choices and thinks with his craving , no rational thinking involved . The onther line says that the protagonist wants to just fulfill his craving for sex . About I-8764 - when searched online , I-8764 will give you photos of particular wedding dress model , but it may be completely wrong . But these line mean that the protagonist does n't look at his girl/girls as a life companion , just rather as a person he has sex with and does n't have any feelings for her . Tilian 's second verse talks about how he devalues love as not something that the protagonist shares with one particular person , because he looks `` pathetic '' this way . Instead , he just feels addicted to feeling love , through sex f.e . The protagonist starts `` drinking the love '' , getting it no matter from whom or how . He feels like a savage , going from girl to girl and obtaining their 'love ' from them . He 's addicted , he wants all these thing and the WILL have these things . Jon Mess ' lyrics end it all with showing that protagonist knows how people think about him , how they say that his life is hedonistic , and he just does n't care about that and wants to corrupt those people instead by `` making them kiss their sistas '' . All in all , I think it 's a song about young people who get the wrong take on life and fall into their vices , thinking that that 's the way the life should be experienced . In whole , I think this song should n't be treated as some radio single , but rather as a fan-service for the fans that explains a little bit , gives context to the whole series of the songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"My thoughts exactly , I was pumped for the rest of the episode because I totally was n't expecting that ( I support Gen X'rs , dunno , I think they are underdogs so maybe that 's why ) and definitely made the episode better for me . Then I thought that the slide in fact was n't a red herring , because in the scene the pic was reffering to Chris was talking about who 's porbably will be voted out next , so in a way he was prepering for the next tribal council , the whole caption was just a stretch . Intentional or not , it felt great to think that you have been spoiled some information only to find out it was a total misdirection",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"What if in a situation when the whole tribe plays their idols the votes begin a new cicle where the idols stay used but votes proceed as normal . It would be either way the biggest idol flush or a hectic strategy of who out of the alliance stays vulnerable , who trusts that he is n't going home , who may be tricked into not playing idol and getting blindsided .

He may know that he sounds stupid but he has a much bigger crowd to cater to their likings than some hardcore fans on the internet . tl ; dr Jeff pushes the theme hard because he knows the Gen X will love it , and like it or not ratings are way more importent for him than some super fans being annoyed for a while .

1Sopel6,survivor,The difference is that Yul played the game in a style that I think was n't recreated - like a politician . Also he used his idol better then Tony ( manipulator Penner to flip just on the basis of having an idol ),Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Probably the big factor in the whole excitement of Legacy Advantage ( or lack of ) comes from the way the whole fact of possesion is played . I think that the production wanted for someone to spill the beans about the advantage with hopes of paranoia to ensue - `` what is it ? Is it dangerous ? Will it screw my game ? Will it help my game ? Can I manipulate the votes / the person to will this to me ? '' But the Legacy Advantage was only in possesion of two players who were nowhere near spilling any beans . On the other hand - I understand them , if I would have something like this I would n't talk about it at all , just wait till day 36 . Maybe that 's the advantage 's flaw ( from TV interest standpoint ) - it was n't advantageous to even mention the advantage . But also - imagine if the advantage was in the hands of someone other than not targeted Ken , someone who needed an unexpected safety gained from making bonds .

Colton went to the Final Tribal with the other two with thought that his leadership game style will give him a win , only to be crushed by a more under the radar , immunity winning and relationship based gameplay . Kind of a situation similiar to the Samoa FTC , but imo more understandable . EDIT : Also , I think if it was n't for the Immunity , Anne-Marie could have gone at F4 . Colton was left with two goats - Douglas and Joyce and decided to vote out Joyce in fear of her getting the Zhan Hu votes .

That 's why I was happy she 's gone because it lefts even the Edgic fans quite blindsided . With Ken I think it will be another blindside for Edgic community , when he 'll be booted around F5 and imo he 's getting a `` too perfect to win '' edit . ( and I suspect a heartbreaking betrayal from David ) Frankly , I do n't understand why I get downvoted here for stating that I like to be blindsided by the editors and unable to predict who goes next or to know who the winner is based on some confessional from episode 2 .

1Sopel6,survivor,"This is my first survivor season and I do n't understand one thing - why they do n't pick up on the hints that Jeff is giving them on TC ? Have n't they noticed that they 're specific and they sometimes are n't even subtle ( like asking Jason if he 's confident about the council while stressing the `` if everyone sticks to the plan '' part ) I know that editing gives us a much shorter look at everything that happens on the TC but do n't they know that Jeff is like an `` always watching big brother '' of the game and if he asks you about something , there needs to be something behind it ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Get a look at EnviroMine mod , it adds body temperature , hydration and sanity , pretty helpful if you want to make it as realistic as possible . Also to stimulate the exhaustion factor f.e . Mindcrack serie had it 's players play the whole season in one sitting which was around 22 hours I 've been thinking about similiar project and I 've got a few ideas how to translate some tv show aspects into the game so if you want to I can share them with you and maybe help you out on some of them .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"You should definitely check out Cordova , the only band I could truly call `` ambient post-hardcore '' , they have a nice variety of sounds on their first album `` If Only I Could Focus '' Songs : Most popular : [ She 's Broke Not Broken ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Ara3JHkuevc ) Heaviest : [ Bastards ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=XRdXmlC06SU ) Catchiest : [ When We Touch ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KUdvQCj8YiE ) Most ambient/dreamy sounding : [ Memory Tree ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6aQz4oFncSA ) The last song is from their new album they 're releasing soon .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I always looked on this band as one of those bands that had one or two likeable songs , then someone posted `` Mr. Owl ... '' in the nominations and I 've got reminded that this album is really nice .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Ca n't say I 'm not a little disappointed ... but I hope Matt has a decent voice and decent writing because that 's the aspect I love ALLB for . So does it mean Kurt will be a solo artist now ? If so that would be also a little disappointing because he really fits better as a vocalist in a band , imo ( do n't get me wrong , I adore his solo works ) Well , I hope that at least that project with Thomas Erak will come to frutition ...",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,GameDeals,"If someone was interested - Pixel Survivors is a small game , for price of $ 1 is good to grab , it 's a little time game you play from time to time , dev is active and regularly adds new content . For this price I would recommend it on it 's own .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Name catched my attention , will check out later !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"On the other note ( disclaimer : it 's a pure speculation ) do you think `` Happiness II '' would be possible ? I like all of the singers and all of the eras of DGD but lately I 've came to the conclusion that sooner or later Tilian is going to leave DGD , imo he seems to feel and be doing better as a solo artist rather than a DGD singer . Also , his solo career seems to be doing well . Now that Kurt has left ALLB he 's a free agent ( I 'd be really surprised if he decided to continue as a solo artists with so many connections and musicians ready to collaborate with him ) and added the fact that through the anniversary tour he got closer to DGD once again ( you can see on the videos that he enjoyed playing his songs , on the first dates he wanted to sing the biggest part of `` Uneasy Hearts ... '' ) would you think that the return of Kurt Travis ( or at least a guest appearance on the album ) could be possible ? As I said , it 's just me speculating , curious about what do you think .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Sorry , was just joking as this project has been in the makings for years now and probably wo n't ever see the daylight",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,What ? They 've changed their label ?,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Also , they 're touring with likes of Touche Amore or letlive . so I think they kind of recognize themselves as a pseudo-posthardcore band",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Also , wishing all the best for Brandon , he has a great voice , I 'm curious what he 'll come up with next",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,dancegavindance,I 'm not getting why DGD is staying as a 5 piece when all of their music needs a second guitarist to play them . I 've been hoping for Bianchini to join them since Josh left,Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I loved those guys , sucks they broke up",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"Sadly , no . Will confirmed that the names and parts are based only on the fact that the song sounds like a continuity or has a similiar vibe as the other song , no real story to it . The most consistend are the first two parts of of Strawberry Swisher songs as both are talking about girls/relationships ( so it kinda fits ? ) The Robot series I would say are loosely tight only by the interpretation by the fans as they usually focus on varying topics and only `` share '' the main protagonist , if you even can find a one in those songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Angus may have deserved the win , at the F5 he was in alliance with everyone and was in a safe position so his win can be justified . I like Rodgers immunity path to the final . Gisele looked like Angus ' coat-rider to me so I 'm surprised she got two jury votes . Jeremy was the most strategic and if not for the tie breaker challange could have won the whole thing , so he 's one of the people who should come back in the future . I also like Dion 's game and I think he should get another chance in the future .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I also was very pleased with how the whole season played out , especially with the fact that how Jack could ride his game until the end even with him coming from the minor tribe ! Maurice and Ami were one of my favorites this season and chances are high that we may see them in the future . Also , check out [ AlterEnglish Survivor : Australia ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/4nsv2p/s_alterEnglish_survivor_the_australian_outback/ ) , it has just been uploaded !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yes , first season might have been slightly better but I blame it one the format of the two first seasons - there are no twists and the game is simple , but soon we will get more action going !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Thanks for the kind words ! Also , I support giving Dave and Dylan a come back in the future but could you explain why Simone ? I 'll be glad to know why do you think she should come back for All Star : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I rooted for Aisana and Big Bill and would love to see them getting a second chance . Jordan is a must in an All-Stars , that 's for sure .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"No problem , you make great music so you definitely had your spot on this playlist ! : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"To be honest , Tracy was set up as a cool , very friendly guy , a social butterfly that also could excel in the challenges . I can say that I expected to him to go a little bit deeper than he did and I think his story has n't been completed yet so he 's one of my favorites to get a chance another time . Also , I loved how at the merge the tribe immediately got rid of two great competitors - Tracy and Kevin . I was also shocked how easily Thomas had made bonds with outher like how you he made bonds with Tracy as you pointed out . I 'm glad you liked the season and I 'm happy that the castaways I create show some personality just from their looks , that 's the aspect I spend the most time on , because I want my series to present good quality .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,You meant Elias or Ellie ? : P,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , what an ending ! The last vote out was a great strategic move and , definitely one of the greatest possible ways the Borneo season could have turned out ! I like your season much more then mine : D I liked Samantha , Jason and Tom , they are greatly suited for and All-Stars season . IMO for second chancers , only Mercy ( and maybe Joseph ) could use a second shot at the game . Nice first season , first few seasons are a bit simple and thus boring but keep going , I like it !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yes , I was surprised how well she has been doing , and with a little bit more luck she could achieve something fantastic . How would you rate this season ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"That 's what I 'm planning on doing ; ) Dave had a nice game but I think that tribal council would be his last anyways . He simply found himself on the wrong team , otherwise he would have a shot . Add to this his medevac and you get a great cast for some future returnees/evacs seasons : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Ha ! My favorite won the season . The merge was great , especailly that double idol play . I 'm only surprised that second runner up got no votes and got less votes than the first runner up who was pretty much a goat .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I do n't know why you think that it is a awful winner . If you look at the statistic you notice that the winner was one of the most strategic players , had most immunity wins and was only one vote on the finale away from a perfect game . He also was in the alliance that run the game and if not for the idols - would be a final three . A pretty decent winner , imo",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"In the pre-merge I thought she would be one of the top contenders , she was good , she could definitely achieve more",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Jeff Probst and Santa Claus,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yeah , I think my set alliances a little screwed the way how the simulator was creating alliances in the starting tribes , which made Hana the odd man out , without any allies so her game was a little bit bland . I have regrets because of this but on the other hand , this worked in a way I would like it to work - a group from Borneo was voted out early to ensure that they wo n't have power once they come together ( at least I believe it was meant this way lol ) Cynthia played a really good game but at the same time it painted a gigantic target at her back and once the tribe got the chance to take her out , they took it . What 's your opinion on the winner ? I liked the fact that it was somebody I was betting to not even make the pre-merge .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Tracy & amp ; Adam need to be in HvV , their hot-and-cold relationship was the best thing this season , I imagine Tracy as a Villain with her mutiny , convincing her new tribe to vote out it 's members , idoling and purple rocking people out , throwing them under the bus . She 's a villian . Adam on the other hand was a hero , being so many times on the exile but yet not switching tribes , even when they were loosing , founding an idol which he never played and being loyal to his alliances . I was rooting for one of them to win , I liked the winner but I 'd rather see him as the runner-up . Tristan and Bruce were interesting characters , poor Jordan L did n't even get a chance to play : (",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Nana was considered for All-Stars but was cut in order to make room for Yolanda,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , the winner brought a perfect goat into the final . I liked the winner , Landon , Tasmin and Tamar could return for the all stars , I 'd love to see Sun again , someday",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The Dear Hunter ' song has now been changed from `` Wait '' to `` Whisper '' La Dispute 's song has been changed from `` King Park '' to `` St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues '' Many times I chose the most popular or the most played tracks , when in doubt I compared them . Also , I wanted to keep this as post-hardcore as I could so I did n't include more popular songs of bands that later on changed their style , hence `` Devil In Jersey City '' by C & amp ; C is on the playlist . With Underoath , you may be reffering to the fact that their later albums stray from this sound and are often considered to be metalcore . But `` A Boy Brushed ... '' is a good representation of the sound from this album so it fits imo . `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' is a staple of this sound of post-hc spectrum so it fits . Also , Glassjaw 's sound on their albums can change pretty often so it 's not easy to pin-point the best representative . Letlive 's `` Muther '' is the song they 're most known for , and `` The Blackest Beautiful '' production is polarizing even Letlive 's so I did n't want to include a song from this album . Sadly , `` What Is It To Burn '' by Finch is n't available where I am , I 'll think on some solution to that",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,I 'm glad you like it !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"All of them have been added to the playlist , thank you for posting !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh man , Solidarity and The Jester",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'd recommend `` Constant Push '' and `` Dark Souls '' . ( Dark Souls would be definitely the best song if not for the chorus ) `` Discovery '' is also a worthy contender . Songs 9 - 14 are from theirs previous material `` If Only I Could Focus '' released in 2013 and from these songs I would recommend `` She 's Broke not Broken '' This band is unusual , because it has many influances but is executed in a style that is rather not seen in the scene . The record flows with mellow guitars tones and drumming only to transition to loud , noisy sounds in a minute . Also , the vocals at places remind me of Chino Moreno of Deftones , the vocalist wails , whispers , shouts , screams and sings lightly . I would say this is how Chino Moreno fronted post-hc band would sound like .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I guess this album will be better then `` In the Unlikely Event '' and eventually be slightly better then Manipulator , and that 's fine to me for me , I 'm just happy that they 're playing shows and making music again",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Pretty decent track , you can see the progress these guys make",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,Russian band Fail Emotions is pretty decent in terms of electronic post-hardcore,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BeMeApp,"From my experience the bemes are the best when I hold the phone next to my forehead or chin because it captures your POV and in 99 % of times it 's angled in a way you imagined it to be . I do n't recommend shooting a beme from the chest level because nearly most of the time it 's totally out of frame if you want to record anything specific , it works out when you 're walking down the street , etc .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,I think `` Get Got '' would be interesting,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Well , there is no place for singing on DG tracks , I imagined it in a way that Tilian would sing in the mumbled verses and Jon would do screaming/rapping ( Secret Band style ) on choruses and the last verse of the song . Just imagine Jon furiously yapping `` Getgetgetget gotgotgotGot ''",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"EP rocks , ca n't wait for both albums !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The list is obviously still incomplete , you can help me by writing post-hardcore bands that I 've missed ( you can sort the playlist by the artist naem and just type the name of the band , if nothing shows up it means the band is missing ) Every band matters , no matter how big ! The playlist contains a one song from every artist , I tried to pick those song that are the most representative or/and are best to catch the attention of new listeners .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Bottom right is `` Instant Gratification '' by Dance Gavin Dance Yes , there is Glassjaw in there but sadly no Hopesfall - they do n't have any of their albums on Spotify , as of now , there is only a cover of `` Eye '' by The Smashing Pumpkins from some tribute album but I had a rule of no cover songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'm glad you like it : ) I only wanted to note that on your playlist there is `` Imagine Violet As A Farmer '' by The Personalized Kid Music Band , supposedly in the place were `` ... As Children '' by Violet should be ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few borderline bands that can be loosely associated with post-hardcore genre so I decided to include them f.e . Foxing 's first album is mainly emo but could pull riffs and shouts in vain of DGD or Circa Survive BMTH 's `` Sempiternal '' is taken as post-hc release , similarly to Underoath 's `` They 're Only Chasing Safety '' even though they 're a metalcore band . Also , songs from `` Sempiternal '' are n't forbidden to post here , so there 's that . I do n't listen to blessthefall but only saw an opinion on the internet and last.fm that they 're a post-hardcore band but , I 'll give it a closer look Sadly , there is no Ling Tosite Sigure on Spotify , trust me If they were there I would be included . But I can recommend you Sokokinaru , they are on the playlist and you may like them ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Turns out you were right , when I searched for them it did n't show me anything . `` Missing ling '' has been added to the playlist , thanks !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"That 's strange , nothing shows up for me . Maybe their music has a regional lock on it or something ... ( I 'm from Europe ) so as of now I ca n't do much about it , but I 'll try",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Well the main purpose of the playlist is to document as much existing bands as possible , it definitely is n't a good starting point for new listeners but can be used by the fans of the genre to discover something new",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh this is not how it works Network Ten is paying Endemol to create the show for them , so acquiring Ten by CBS may result in things like AUS being available in All Access , but they did not acquire the creative force , sadly . Also , I think that the US version would benefit sooo much only from extending it for another 20 minutes . I ca n't just understand why it 's the shortest of any Survivor version . When the series are starting ( Australia , recently one in Poland ) they always make the episodes long ( Australian is around one hour , polish one is an hour and a half ) so they can pay off . But US Survivor , the biggest of them all , with dedicated fanbase is the shortest and as of late needs to cut corners ( f.e . staying in Fiji , reusing challenges every season to save on creating new props ) while just by making episodes longer would give benefits to nearly everybody .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

In Fiji there were 3 black man ( Earl , Dreamz and Anthony ) and two black females . Same went for all the other ethnicities .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"It 's a change , for sure , but the more I think of it , it 's not completely out of nowhere , there were hints of this sound in their past discography ( Microscope , Supercharged , even Zzzonked to an extent ) It was strange at first but now I just imagine how fun it will be to bounce around in that heavy bass in the first part of the song . Their message is here , the guitars might have been more prominent but it 's ok and I think it will be better when we get the context of it on the album . `` Live Outside '' was a single but also a satire , this is bouncy with more power to it . Let 's also remember that this band released `` Hoodwinker '' not so long ago , so I 'd say that we 'll be fine ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,There are dozens of us ! Dozens !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,I do n't think there was anything portraing her as a real threat or an mastermind that the edit did n't show - Annelise for the whole season did n't stick strong to anyone so she was kind of there . tbh if she did n't stumble upon that immunity idol or did n't give an iformation about having it she would be riding the wave like Tara is doing right now . On an island where 9 people are fighting with fists she was on of those who found a knife . She was a threat that needed to be simply disarmed .,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"For the whole episode I was looking forward a move and it never came , I do n't know if my logic if flawed but ... Why not blindside Ziggy at this point ? The plan literally was just writing itself - they knew for sure that Ana is using her idol , you somehow get Ziggy to play her Super Idol . So you 're getting rid of two idols in one go . But here 's the plan - you know right then the 3 votes are going for Locky , one is going fo Annaliese . You take the remaining 7 and Ziggy gets clipped . And that would have worked even if Ziggy did n't screw Annaliese ! In one swoop you get rid of : two hidden immunity idols , one super idol , one flipper , original Samatau member and a challenge beast . Yeah , the Samatu are sitting together as a 3 , not as a 2 , and you 're exposing yourself by getting rid of one of your shields . But who 's going to win the challenges anyway . As we saw it 's really left between Jericho , Locky and Henry at this point . I just do n't know , this was so obvious to me , but is there something I 'm missing out that ? I know we see an end-product , but even Henry and Locky had all the info that I 've pointed out .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh , after my practices in hospital he has a typical mentality of an seasoned doctor - both weird and cringy in jokes / interests and with a feeling of superiority . I do n't think that he will last for long , especially with people who usually work under people like him . I have nothing against the guy but I can bet that he will be a flame out , I only hope this will be a hilarious one",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"What I love about the cast is that it 's a very diverse bunch , almost to the point when it looks like some fanmade fanfiction . Just look at the bunch that is left in the game I mean , you have whacky Luke , a sweet cookie-monster Jericho , an silent and seemingly always scared Peter , an hilarious alpha male Locky to the point that he looks like a caraicature of an archetype , an elusive shadow that is Sarah , a complete gossip girl and chatterbox that is Michelle , the underdog scrappy fighter Tessa , the smarter-than-he-thinks but still lovable dude that is Henry , the kickass chellange beast Ziggy and the one everyone loves to hate - Tara . And the best part is that all of them have that fire to fight for the immunity or to scramble and be strategic , and everyobody does it in their own style - Michelle can create a drama out of the tiniest information , Locky with his subtle as a punch strategies , Henry 's constant running and gunning , etc . Not to mention some good characters that we had in the pre-merge were also good .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Australian one proved that Survivor US got too meta , too full of itself . Sadly , US one probably wo n't learn a thing from that as it 's not threatening for their market .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes ! I also think that the boot order is ideal . The only ones I miss from pre-merge is Mark W ( I would have him in the place of Annelise anyday ) and as I understand that AK may have been getting on some people 's nerves I think his eventual downfall in the merge would be more satisfying then a pre-merge boot because of the swap . Other then that - yeah , everyone else left in the ideal place , just enough to show their characters , or would n't deliver anything exciting and were gone fast ( Kate , Aimee )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh sweet summerchild Welcome to the world of messism . In overall , Craig 's lyrics are mostly constant blabbing about girls , Travis ' are about relationships and are the ones that are filled most with emotions , Pearson 's are overly sexual . But Jon Mess ? That 's a whole other bag . He has a style in which he is both very blunt about the delivery but also very very cryptic about the meaning . If you want some insane lyrics from him check out `` Need Money '' . As to connections to video games , on `` Jesus H. Macy '' the lyrics '' Set it up , cover the plans , record everyone , make demands Positional strategy , split was disastrous , flanking the siege '' is in fact about Starcraft . I do n't think there 's more in terms of video games , but these lyrics are a total treat . Give them a look , in no time you 'll be on the back of the potato , making french fries in the snow .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"* Lead Vocals : Christopher deCinque ( of Closure in Moscow ) * Harsh Vocals : Cory Lockwood ( of A Lot Like Birds ) [ also clean and spoken verses ] * Lead Guitar : Alexis Pareja ( of The Number Twelve Looks Like You ) * Rhythm Guitar : Salvatore Bossio ( of Envy on the Coast ) * Bass Guitar : Ryan Jay Johnson ( of letlive . ) * Electronics/Backing Vocals : Rou Reynolds ( of Enter Shikari ) * Drums : Cory Eaves ( of Artifex Pereo ) I wanted to create a supergroup that was n't all `` big '' names , with restriciton to one member from each band , that could actually gel together and create a rather interesting sound and would complement eachother musically .

1Sopel6,survivor,"Tell that to all the UTR winners ; ) Calling the shots in benefitial for your game when the plan follows as you intend them but when the pyramid gets flipped upside down - you 're the first head of the chopping block . Just look at AK - went from bottom to top and I smell that he can be in another turmoil caused by Locky and Henry . Why is that ? Because from being the target of the majority he rose up and now is the target of the minority . And the thing in Survivor is - you never know when that minority becomes a majority . Revolution eats their own children . That 's what riding the middle is - playing enough to not be the last in the alliances pecking order but not playing too much to be the one calling the shots . And yes , I 'll agree that it 's result based as it will determine if we will remember it as a great move or as a stupid move . But Henry made his choices , gambled and the payoff may be massive . But well , if you 're getting `` JT flashbacks '' you probably are one of the crowd that disregard the whole idea of the move and only repeat the same opinion - in this case `` JT was a dumbass , he should n't give that idol to Russel '' . BUT , if the JT 's perception of Russell / what is going on in Villains tribe proved to be right , this gifted idol would be praised as the most brilliant thing in the whole series . It 's the gamble . JT gambled , Henry is gambling right now . As for Henry - guy saw an opportunity , took it , he has some connections back at his old tribe , he knows he will be valuable at his new tribe . Again - big gamble , big payoff . Thinking about that - yeah , JT and Henry seem to be the same kind of a player . I 'd like to call them `` the experimentator '' , they do crazy things if that little stroke of brilliance . Sometimes they play the perfect game , sometimes they come down in history as `` the stupidiest move in the history , hurr hurr '' . But still , JT is in the realm of legends , and Henry is 9 episodes in , a major character od this season ( at least for now ) I think that 's the way of percieving of good players . I would argue who 's thinking is really flawed here .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm sensing a Wentworth , but it 's the 1.0 version ...",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"* we definitely are getting some shade on Ziggy in the preview , that 's the downside of things - everyone know who has it . She may use it but everyone knows she 's dangerous with it * it has been 25 out of 55 days out there , it 's nearly the middle of season for them , so a good motivation for another half is a good idea . Besides , in US version they get the letters around the same day . It also helped to give some background to the characters , sympathise with them while fillin the filler . * well , it 's pretty naive to think that production would let that happen ... * also , a good timing given that the majorities on both tribes are getting to comfortable with their powers",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Same for me , `` Caught Up In a Lie '' is a decent track , not ground breaking , but decent . But `` Broke '' did n't grip me in any way : / What 's worse , the lyrical content is really good , and would be good if the instrumentation was n't that loud , the vocals drown in them . Also , I think that it could be a little bit less stripped out , bit quieter . Something in the liking of the passage in `` Tetra Hydro Cannonball '' from their EP ( [ this ] ( https : //youtu.be/6KYc9HwB_9g ? t=95 ) ) , I just think it lacks a bit of intimacy . I still have hope for this album , it 's their debut after all . I just hope that they wo n't make the same mistakes that their label mates Oranges made on their album , that songs were definitely `` swancore '' but lacked their own dashes of identity As to `` Galaxy God '' - this will be a re-recorded version so it 's not completely the same thing",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Bob is possible only in theory , given his physical build and advanced age I 'd say even Rudy Boesh has bigger chances of returning . Also , Chris was in the early mix for BvW with his wife but was cut rather early due to him being ( allegedly ) overweight . Just my notes that I think are worth mentioning and taking into the equation",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,Family visit ?,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"No , it has been there in previous episodes - although not so over-the-top like in this one ( it 's also present in Luke 's confessionals ) . This is also not so uncommon in the US version - it was quite noticeable in S33 , especially in Zeke 's confessionals . Possibly it 's a matter of lightning , lense like Ben 's wild hair and their color may not look so good on the background with morning sunlight , hence they need to create a contrast . Also , if he was to be inserted in post-production his crazy noodly hair would be a dead giveaway if the greenscreen was used ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"IMO twists are fine at this point , still better then Advantage Fest that was GC . And I 'm glad that the `` dumb stuff the American version has n't seen '' is there , because it makes the series unique , not another carbon copy of the format . 24 people was overbearing at the start , and the edit of some early boots left something to desire , but given the people who went out first - they were n't that interesting anyway , and them going home was always against our [ ed/lo ] gic and we were truly blindsided that way . I 'm not really that mad that I have n't known Kate or Aimee very much . That time was spent on some people that are main characters of the season ( atm ) And I think that at this point I can say at least something about the characters , everybody left got at least a little of their personality shown , but some are given to us in a more subtle way ( like Peter ) . ALSO , I do n't think the alliances are that hard to follow , especially since in both tribes people split into two groups and paired up in them , which imo makes things only easier to follow ( like you know that Jericho is always with Luke , AK with Tessa , Locky with Tara , Henry with Jacqui and later her with Kent , etc . ) and every voteout is based on the fight of the two opposing forces for the people who are more or less in the middle , and they are presented to us so we know who is the deciding force .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

I would also really love to know what ( and how many ) teams are playing in Tonga Major League as of lately . These informations will be used in the process of creating a modification that would add Tongan football league into the game Football Manager 2017 .

1Sopel6,CK2GameOfthrones,"Situation is - Arya has been rescued from Harrenhall , I 'm Robb , King InDaNorf . I 've invited over a certain Harry from the Vale to my court , which I 've later gave Moat Cailin . I 've betrohed him to Arya and the time has come - Arya 's 14 , she can marry the Harry . A `` regular '' marriage is an option but I wanted to push a matrilineal marriage but there 's a problem - Harry does n't want it only because Arya is `` unlikely to have children '' . That was a bit confusing for me so I checked her out with charinfo - she has a `` fertility '' of -99950 % ! We 're for sure not getting any babies from that ! What 's worse , Bran and Rickon suffer from the same deal . What should I do ? Wait 2 years more until Arya is 16 , her portrait updates and maybe something refreshes ? I 've searched around the web , I 've come to this that the fertility is to assure she wo n't be having children too fast ( same goes f.e . for Asha Greyjoy ) But seeing that it affects the `` missing '' Stark children ( Sansa i a-ok ) I 'm wondering if everything is alright with this situation . Also , I 've checked Arya 's fertility before , after finding her when she was around 10 - it has n't changed / updated since then . I also tried to force the marriage by neg_diplo commands and accepting with Harry but game crashed . So ... is there a solution ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"wow , nice way to be a douche It 's a decent tune but defenitely not belonging in post-hardcore , as the whole genre is veeery broad this song does n't really have any elements typical to post-hardcore , not even the core structure . It 's probably inspired by some older post-hardcore acts , but the end product rather fits the progressive , post-rock , ambient and noise characteristics - but not post-hardcore ones .

I have won the league and now I am at the start of Ligue 1 and I ca n't loan players like this ! My wage budget is very tight so I ca n't pay high wages .

I was looking forward to loaning out some players to help me stay in the league but it seems that i could only get somewhat decent reserves for my first team . Why clubs do n't want to loan me some players so they can play in a good league but when I 'm playing in the lower league - they loan me them without trouble and do n't even want me to pay any percent of their wages ( even when they 're transfer listed and are unwanted in the club , and earn 500k a year )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , that was a really fascinating season ! I really liked how you could see the storylines forming . Also , very strangely I could see some parallels to real life Survivor Fiji players ! Kendra being first out to weaken the alliance of younger ones , Gigi voted out because of being annoying just after her , I especially liked how the younger alliance at the first tribal voted Gigi as a obvious vote out to strenghten the team and were basically blindsided . Hunter got very unlucky , but the fact that he was n't very promient to the story really fits well with that Armando was really robbed of playing the game , Sylvia Kwan style I liked how Izumi was voted out because of her feud with Manuel who was more valuable at the time Ferris voted out because of his Rocky-like character Whitney being the one to strat picking the new tribe at the twist and essentailly chhosing her poison by being voted 5-1 Lee got a little BrantSteelle logic - fucked because he should reconnect with his old tribemates or the opposing ones but sadly there are some flaws in the simulation Manuel was a fun pre-merge villain , not a great player but if there was some drama he was always included Meili is the ideal boot for the merge , as she did n't do anything to that point , and was booted at the right time for the story , leaving us with a very interesting group Monty Dickinson was a real dick and I loved every little moment of it , he gave me some Randy vibes , would like to see him again maybe ? Libby was a good player , sadly go picked off because she was quite savvy Autumn was a typical `` the leader won immunity so vote out his ally '' Chris was a great character , great villain and quite a challenge beast , would like to see him return Joshua was an ally of Ji-Tae and Ashley , he seemed to trust them but got blindsided when Ji-Tae started to build his resume . Being a comedian I suppose he could be a social threat Ashley would probably be another victim of Ji-Tae 's flip . But on the bright side - you have a great candidate for a team captain when you get to the Phillipines ! Leah was such a drama queen , kind of like Abi Maria , most votes received yet still dragged to the end as a total goat , just like Cassandra in Fiji Ji-Tae was a great character and my pick going into this season , I liked how he stuck with the older alliance at the start , survived at Ravu with Joshua and Ashley , later jumping into Moto camp . He had a good plan going forward but I feel people may have felt betrayed at the end . He seemed to me to be a good strategist but lacking in skill to pull that all off . Regardless , I still loved him , would definitely be a pick for a Second Chance season - because his storyline needs a second chance And last but not least - Von . Member of the younger alliance at Ravu . Started off as a villain but later evolved into a more mature person . He survived everything that fate tossed him and somewhat fought till the end and without a single vote casted for him ! He had strategy , he had immunity wins and he had respect of the jury for what he achieved . Truly a fantastic winner , he reminded me of Jay from MvGX as he would be probably regarded in the same way if he won his season . Overall , fantastic season , this lengthy comment and the fact that I could remember thing about every single contestant just proves that this is a quality rarely achieved on this subreddit .

1Sopel6,survivor,"In the first episode , when they 're stranded on the beach for a day you see the castaways splitting up - one half ( the younger one ) went exploring the island and the second half ( the older one ) stayed behind and started building the shelter . What we were n't shown is that those two groups formed alliances , because no one had a clue what 's this seasons theme , etc . Also , it happend naturally as older ones were scared that if they do n't stick together the younger ones will boot them . The same went for the younger group . This is how two , big alliances of ~10 were formed - Explorers and Builders . Later , when the crew finally decided how to continue the season with 19 castaways , one person would divide the tribes and would join the losing one . That person was Sylvia - a member of the builders . Calculating her chances she decided to split the two alliances as evenly as she could so she would n't end up in a position with no allies , regardless of which tribe went to the Tribal Council . After that we have pretty much seen what happened next , although it 's quite a crucial plot point that was left out of the final edit , that would explain why some people bonded so easily ( like younger guys on new Ravu )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm not an english English speaker but I find the music behind the conversations much much more bearable than in the american one . I 'll give you that the splicing is quite obvious , with additional one second scenes that do n't really add any much power to the words or anything , but only show us the contestant in different place , setting , wearing different clothes which adds another level to this . I think that by not revealing the AK 's idol the episode only got better . With that reveal we would n't have gotten the Chicken Idol scene . Also , plot wise - without the reveal we kind of understood the situation of the rest of the tribe - `` does AK have an idol ? I guess he has . Or maybe Adam is playing us ? '' . Lastly , after all - the idol itself did n't amount to anything , it did n't negate any votes . The format includes many people , their thoughts and stories , all at the same time , but I 'm not worrying that much about it , I 'm sure we will get into those characters when they will start to matter . This is n't quite te American standard , where the winner is hamfisted and forshadeowed since the first episode . Hell , the previous winner of AUS Survivor for the most part was for the most part a supporting character , people did n't see her chances even after the merge hit . So I would n't worry that much about it all - afterall , what do you even want to hear from someone who is in the middle of the pecking order in the main alliance and is n't targeted ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes , someone went and rewatched the scene when Adam finds it , it was non-transferable",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Hmm , so aligning with Sasha saves you from the boot at F5 ? In that case I have a new theory , spend every round talking once to the person that is going to be eliminated and once to Sasha . It seems that an alliance with him is crucial to the game but does n't bring anything new after the alliance is formed . I only know that talking to Margo is pointless because she 's just depressed and you ca n't help her ( unless you can somehow save her through the conversations ) -- wait , is Margo voting too if the vote is 7-1 ? Also , what would happen if you allied with Vinni ? We know Sasha guarantees us F3 and finale with an idol . But what if Vinni 's `` storyline '' gives us something else . tbh I 've never talked to her Also , this is less a `` game '' and rather a digital art form for an expo . I bet this is n't about being on the right side etc because you ca n't be on the first run , only with outside knowledge . Also , every character is pretty one-dimensional - Karo is a superfan , Jo works hard , Sasha is nice but naive , Margo is a depressed pile of mess and so on . There is - some - massage there , not quite sure what , I 've watched a short interview with the creator ( and host ) of the game . It was n't very explaining but the basis is that like in game of Survivor you need to interact , think and in overall move forward in the dog eat dog world . Or so I think that was the intent . So there is no our - the real-life Survivor fans - way of winning as you do n't talk strategy and ca n't possibly be in control . You 're never in the control of the game . But through trial and error you can solve what path the game wants you to take . Also , I 'm curious if there is some theme of going against the rules , like if you would have stick to the path all of the players take you would have never found the HII . I wonder if there is something else hidden somewhere , mainly in the lodge by the entrence ( I purely base it on the fact that HII are n't just hidden in regular rooms , but like the library in some specific ones ) . Also , waht I 've noticed is the second dialog with Jo is always written as if you were talking to her after her second immunity win , as if we were meant to talk to her in an order ( but that may be just an oversight from the developer 's part ) . Also , the last thing is the 4th wall breaking host that in The Stanley Parable 's comments on you dicking around the place , I wonder how far can you push her limits . Ok , main takeaways * it 's possible that the way to win is allying with Sasha to not get booted at F5 and talking everyday to the contestant that is going to be elliminated to maybe get their sympathy and get votes from them * Maybe there is a way to save Margo ( after all , the host points out that you did n't do anything after her death , maybe it has some role , like keeping Margo in game changes the outcome ? ) * there may be some room to screw around with the came with the big space that is the museum and with the narrator that breaks the 4th wall . There may be something left to uncover , because as the narrator says - there is no way for us to win the game , no scenario like that . But on the other hand - by the game logic we were n't supposed to be in the game after F5 . So this game might be about outsmarting the game . * it 's unknown what happens when you ally with the finalist - Vinni",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"I found a hidden immunity idol , on the 5th floor , instead of going through the stairs go to the library , somewhere after that there should be stairs leading you to a piece like this from `` fire making '' challange Pick it up , continue , put it in the pedestal in the voting room . The vote should be Jo . I do n't know if this is the solution , first time I played it I also got voted out at F5 , later by running around I found the HI , played it , and Jo went out in a 5-1 vote out Then I continued , Nikola has been voted out , I 've got left with Vinni and Sasha , the only person I talked to for the whole game . I do n't know how to continue past that , Vinni wins immunity so it 's me or Sasha and Vinni votes me . I do n't know what should be done , I have a few ideas * talk to Sasha till you make an alliance with him , later switch to Vinni * talk to Sasha and when asked , advise him to quit * I 've noticed that after the tribal I 've found the HII the floor that I 've found it on - 5th - started to burn down . Later , on the day that I 've been voted out the 4th floor started to burn down . I do n't know if a HII is hidden there ? When I tried to look for it the host said she 's tired of it and reused the `` break the wall '' challange , but it was impossible to beat * Normally it seems that you go out if you do not play the idol after the fourth challange , but when I played no votes were cancelled and Jo went 5-1 . Probably it 's how it 's supposed to be but maybe you can keep the idol and play it on the FTC and single handedly vote out Sasha I 'm probably somewhere close to beating this game but I do n't think I want to go through the creepiness of it If someone is interested in the `` boot list '' , here it is ( it 's always the same thing but maybe it 's helpful to be on the good side of the votes ) Ellis Asla Dana Margo Karo ( pick up the HII ) Jo Nikola My tactic was to stick with Sasha and Jo , but she is n't the late gamer . Talk to Sasha from the start , when he talks about Solidarity do n't tell him that the ship is sinking , on the next convo he will become your ally . Two or three conversations later he will consider quitting . I do n't know , anymore , game is very creepy and artsy-fartsy but on the other end , it definitely creates some interest and being against the game itself is also interesting . ( the game outright tells you after the vote out you are normally meant to be going but you played your idol that you was n't going to get that far and there is nothing left for you ) Whew , that became a longer post then I intended but if someone wants to try and solve this game I 'd be more than happy to know how it ends .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Thanks for your insights but : 1 . I think in a normal Survivor enviroment the villains would rather break the main alliances ( pecking order etc ) and reorganize with them and getting the additional votes from the last heroes who would n't have any other better option - this is how blindsides are made 2 . The quotes would make it more obvious but there are limitations .

Funny situation how they were swap-fucked when on paper they should be safe among their own Later on , on double elimination , Kelli and Naomi greatly baited the rest of Kotas and blindsided Rico , who was on of the physical pawns of Alice , good move on their part On Fang Scott just could n't escape - he was a quite fun , grumpy pre-merge villain imo , could get a shot at SC down the line , maybe ? After the next vote Fang alliances could n't work together and the tribe imploded , with Kelli once again surviving Nadia being the merge boot seems kinda fitting , she seamed to me to be a strong competitor and a scrappy player , could be dangerous Alice was such a diva , wrapping guys around her finger , while using them as pawns and eventually wanting to get rid off one of her meat shields , but Vincent turned on her and Colby went rogue , leaving her behind Vince 's blindside more significatn for the btrayal of Anne-Marie , she sensed the danger and protected herself from the boot The next episode was about rallying the troops between Anne Marie and Eric , two big characters thus far Anne Marie was a big breakout character , one to return , thats for sure - she was a great villainous schemer at the same time , very rootable , she caused some drama , manouvered strategically . The finale 5 was a quite enjoyable bunch - Colby , thus far a pawn in other 's games , Sarah , an old kickass lady , Naomi and Kelli , a duo with trust issues and Eric , ( for me at least ) a Todd-like player Colby was booted , quite unceremoniously , I think that was done to not ruin the alliances that were going on - Eric with Naomi both keeping Sarah and Kelli on their sides , I think that everyone thought they had a plan and this just was n't the time to make the final move , as Colby was basically a free agent At Final 4 , Naomi finally woke up and wanted to make the last move that counts , recruited by Sarah she saw Kelli as an underdog story that could win the jury . On the other end Eric and Kelli , while being more strategic knew that it was going to be either of them so they teamed up and voted for a big jury threat - old Sarah . At this point I think only Naomi was out of the running for the title . Kelli got beaten in the firemaking and surprisingly that was the best outcome for Eric As to the votes at FTC - i loved the bitter throwaway Anne Marie 's vote for Naomi , because she was bittter to both of their blindsiders xD Roy has voted for Sarah as she was his tribemate ( also , I do n't think he was very inept in the game so I 'd guess that would be a good explanation ) Vincent was a close ally of Sarah , so it 's no wonder taht he stayed loyal and voted for her And , as to the winner - Eric . He had put on the jury Alice , who liked him more than other ( no wonder as for the whole season , she was sticking with the guys , it 's also a funny characteristic for her character ) Kelli admired Eric because he was the best strategist , after her . He also smooth talked his way to the win at the jury questions and swayed two lone guns - Nadia and Colby - to his side . I enjoyed that win , it was a very Todd-like As for returnee posibilities FvF - Alice and Scott Second Chances - Kelli , Sarah HvV - Anne Marie , Eric ( both villains , but Eric is more like an anti-hero - Todd , Sandra and Natalie A style )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , well , here 's a legend to your series ; ) I 'm dissapointed with the winner , at least Edmund was looking quite reasonable and was a character ( Kristen , Tanesha and Blake voted for him and they were the best jurors ) but oh well , you can say he was blindsided at the finale ! ( I think that he got too comfortable , looked upon himself as the leader of such successful tribe , but probably lost Sofia 's vote , as she thought he would n't ever betray her ) Kristen was a good villain with epic blindside , maybe you can fix her a spot somewhere Tanesha is simply a villain legend , I understand that as a creator you were rooting for her to win it all , just as Probst was rooting for Stephenie but her boot was inevitable Doreen is in fact a good SC candidate , but I do n't know what rules do you follow but she may be `` too old '' for SC - maybe a spot on Heroes tribe ? She had a very strange story I liked Edmund , maybe a little too confident but maybe he could return as a Favorite ? Blake was also good but nothing that really stood out imo he was good character for the season but I do n't see too much sense in him returning .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I think it works because it references to overall people 's traits so the theme is n't forces on the players as they practically do n't change their playstyle or personality - Kyle Jason , Scott Pollard and Cliff Robinson would always play like jocks , Spencer Garrett and David would always play like smartasses , etc . Also , characteristics like these make people on the tribes really gel together . WA is n't exactly the same . It 's similiar in the way but BvBvB theme bases on the overall characteristics - from personalities ( Alecia is feisty hence is a Brawn , Tai has amazing positivness and joy of life hence is a ( n inner ) Beauty ) to their jobs ( Sarah is a cop and brawn is the characteristic of the job , Peter is a doctor so he clearly must be an intelectual ) ending with simply their looks ( Anna , Lindsey , Aubry ) WA takes only one characteristic into consideration - the job . It 's just one link to the other format but it gives slightly different group HvHvH seems to be taking into consideration the personality and life motivation but I do n't know if it is n't too wide of a characteristic to create groups that would gel together . IMO they should try again with the collar themes to see if with better cast it can produce a better season . The cast of HvHvH would be pretty much set to the theme , maybe with a few changes in the cast",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Yeah , I would say we do , more and more every year as the generation that was born after the fall of communism is growing bigger . That generation also learns english .

Electronic music also is quite popular , mostly the british ones . ( But check our polish band [ The Dumplings ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Me_AJzcqOcg ) as they 're called `` the voice of the young polish generation '' ) Also , you know , pop and rap music . `` Core '' music is pretty much niche , but from them metalcore is the most popular here for sure ( mostly british band as they 're closer so they tour more often ) . But post-hc bands like Enter Shikari , Dance Gavin Dance , A Day To Remember , Bring Me The Horizon or Chiodos have some ( bigger or smaller ) recognition around here . And everyone is learning english because it is world 's most communicative language right now . Just as in past , in Europe it was latin or french .

Other great story involved a player that I got mid season that got really butthurt about a player that was loaned a season before and later sold . He was 21 yo defender , so okay , you may say that i sold a youngster , I 'll take that , but the player who was angry about it ( and nearly turned the whole team against me ) have n't even spend a day in the same club with the sold player , they did n't even know eachother and were n't even from the same continent !

Also , unclean vocals are present on this track too ( around 3:30 , followed with breakdown ) . They also use harsher vocals , not necessarily pure scream , but a shout/yell .

To be honest this is so far a friends label ( Oranges played shows with Stolas since 2012 ) with only Eidola and Adventurer being out of the DGD friends circle . I dig this song and I believe that Oranges are talented so I 'm okay with that , but BSR really needs to branch out in genres IMHO Someone suggested thath they should sign some hip-hop artists and I messaged them about Hyro Da Hero , who 's living in CA , made music with members of At The Drive-In and The Blood Brothers and is looking for label . Sadly , my message has never been even opened . I would love to see bands like VIS , Visitors , Microwave , Wayne Szalinski or Makari being picked up by some label but probably not by BSR .

F.e . Jon Mess sings about Starcraft II in `` Jesus H. Macy '' , graphical programming in `` Demo Team '' , `` pink and purple t-shirts '' mentioned in `` Need Money '' are only worn by `` real man '' , personal life , thoughts and himself in overall So as you can see , maybe there is some meaning behind his babbling .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"'Plan B ' was a colaborative work of Sacramento arstists to make something big and epic . But do you imagine how would they stick around with so many band members ? It 's just hard to operate with so many different people - get them in one place at given time just to practice . You need to remember that artists are also people with their own lives and problems . They 're crafting their own style as they want it , there are still some of the sounds that resemble these present on the Plan B in their later albums . If they would stay in the same formula , you could 've called them `` repetetive '' . What they 're doing is progression , doing something new . Michael Franzino did n't had to record solo because band did n't let him utilize his ideas in ALLB songs , he just wanted to make a solo album because the whole idea behind alone . originated from his breakup and he wanted to express his emotions and feelings through the music . But it 's HIS story , he is just a guitarist , not a singer , he just wanted to make this his own , personal stuff . He wanted to make this alone .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few methods 1 . I pick a tag I like and if the tag is big enough there will be four `` Hyped artists '' , by that you can find new and coming bands and also bands that released f.e . albums recently ( not to mention the section of `` Top Artists '' ) 2 . Recommended artists , you can find this on the main site , if you click to see more you will be presented with six pages of artist that you may like , also , last.fm will compare them to the artists that you have in your library so you can judge if you may like something by their similarities to the bands you already like ( If you go to the bands page and click on `` add to library '' or a plus icon on the right side of the page you will add them to your library so you can remember about them and check them out later . These bands are also counted while presenting you recommended music so you can dig deeper and deeper into the sound that you like and might build up a long list of bands to check out later ) 3 . Looking at similiar artists you like but it 's based for every user individually so it kinda works the same as the recommended music . Also , explore new tags of music that you 're unknown to you but you dig a band from that genre . 4 . Checking out the bands our favorite bands are playing shows with , by looking at who Rise Against toured in the past I 've found out about Architects and Touche Amore 5 . Stalk your friends . If I find someone that is listening to a lot of new music I visit their profiles often and look at what they 're listening lately ( in a month , in a week ) that is also a great source of new music If you want to you can dig through [ mine ] ( http : //www.last.fm/user/Sopel_1/library ) last.fm library and look for some cool sounding or looking band , maybe you 'll find something new ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

But I still dig it The Bank Of England and There Is A Price On Your Head were something new from the band 's sound IMO and it eventually rooted on me .

1010x,hoi4,"I just saw last week 's developer 's stream of Kaiserreich where they are playing Russia and was disappointed on how uneventful it was . When I chose Russia during my first game of Kaiserreich , I decided to restore a rightful monarchy and made all the according choices , however , I got really screwed mid-way . Obviously , I had a 'Disaster ' stability and almost zero national unity , as well as huge shortage of infantry equipment . First , Soviet Union spawned in the western part of Russia . A Civil War , great ! I was completely unprepared for that so I had to consolidate all my troops throughout the territory and wait for them to unite along the front which took a lot of time and cost me in a lot of territories . My unarmed infantry was practically useless in offensive so I just held the line and hoped for the best , waiting for the planning bonuses and more infantry equipment . After a few months , I started an offensive and it was going great , Soviets were losing and I felt victorious . However , that did not last long as I got a telegram from Siberia , stating that they are seceding , permanently . I could not allow more divided Russia , so I had to declare war on them . I could n't actually start conquering Siberia right away , so I took 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive and put them in Ural mountains , hoping that they would hold until they can get reinforcements from the west after I 've dealt with Soviets . Soviets were still losing , but not as fast as I wanted them to , so the offensive was going really slowly but fortunately , the Siberian AI was indecisive and did n't push into my undermanned border which they could easily do . I slowly moved into Soviet territories , the victory was not near but it was almost assured , but then I got a telegram from the south : Don - Kuban union declared a war on me , damned cossacks wanted more land to pillage ! I had to take another 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive just to protect the Southern borders from the barbarians . Same as in Siberia , I also could n't launch a direct assault , so they just had to hold the line until I dealt with the Red Menace . My Soviet Offensive was becoming more and more undermanned , but it was still going strong : after all , people believed in their tsar and his Divine Authority . Russian armies were fighting on three fronts , severely underpowered and underarmed , so it could n't get much worse , could it ? Well , it could and it did . Right as I was pushing into Petrograd 's territories , the Tsar received another telegram : the King of Finland was asking for their `` rightful '' territories : pretty much all the land East of Finland . ( i.e . majority of Novgorod territories in EU4 ) . Obviously , I could not bow to these Finnish pretenders ; I politely refused and got a war declared on me . Now I have a war in the north with Finland , a war in the west with Soviet Union , a war in the south with Don - Kubans and a war in the east with Siberia and it 's not even 1937 . My armies are overstretched , hungry and out of supply , but it ca n't get any worse , right ? The submission got pretty long , tell me if you want me to continue . I just wanted to tell on how crazy Russian games in Kaiserreich can get and why I was kinda underwhelmed by what events ( or lack of them ) developers got during their stream . I mean , good for them for playing it right , but my completely screwed up game turned out to be far more interesting than a 'perfect ' playthrough : )",Balto-Slavic,Russian

As an EU4 player , I thought I had this in the bag with my navy . . . Then I learn THERE IS N'T NAVAL BATTLE IN CK2 ! So Byzantine gets past my big ass navy , lands in Venice , and his 20k stack WIPES my army off the face of Italy . Had to surrender , lost the republic . Decided to revoke some titles from my mayors and get some land to start over ( as the King of Venice ! ) Then I notice that doing this makes me the Doge again ! ( Somehow ) So I got the republic back , but lost all my trade routes , and my palace was pretty much gone . Next thing I know , pissed off Italy comes out of nowhere , rekts me in my weakend state . . . . And there goes my weekend . TLDR : Spent my weekend playing Venice as my first game in CK2 , got fucked up by Byzantium as I learnt that there is n't naval combat like in EU4 .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Wheezing his last few words with difficulty , Yeltsin tells Vladimir , `` Komrade , the reins of the country are now in your hands . But before I go , I want to give you some advice . '' `` Yes , yes , Great Leader , what is it ? '' says Putin . Reaching under his desk , Yeltsin produces two envelopes marked 1 and 2 . `` Take these letters , '' he tells Putin . `` Keep them safely -- do n't open them . Only if the country is in turmoil and things start going badly , open the first one . That 'll give you some advice on what to do . And , even after that , if things start going REALLY badly , open the second one . '' And with a sigh , Yeltsin leaves the office . Well , Putin succeeded him , and sure enough , within a few years things started going badly -- unemployment increased , hotels crumbled during Sochi , people became restless . Vladimir decided it was time to open the first letter . All it said was : `` Blame everything on me ! '' So Putin launched a massive de-Yeltsin-Western campaign , and blamed the west and Yeltsin for all the excesses and faults and ills of the present system , and bought himself some time that way . But things continued on the downslide -- Viktor Yanukovych was removed in Ukraine , Crimea was taken , tensions increased , the EU was unhappy with Putin 's leadership and upstarts like Nemtsov were threatening his credibility .

The Roman military became diluted and had a lower quality as many of their soldiers were mercenaries from other regions , and they only fought for Rome for the money , not for the pride , as they did n't have any Roman pride . This caused less volunteers as once they gained their citizenship for fighting in the military , why would they fight anymore for someone else who is n't their own ? **Also** , Germans began to integrate more and more into their society , but still retained who they are . They were able to learn about Roman tactics , then they had the *quality* , and the *quantity* to beat the Romans down . Additionally , immigrants such as the Germans began to gain positions of power in the politics of Rome , as one German became the advisor of a boy-emperor , and of course , he would work for the benefit of the Germans , not the Romans .

13lack_Baron,wow,"Well , let 's say you 're on a PvP server and everyone is flying , it prevents you from doing PvP since you ca n't reach them in the sky . ( To an extent ) And if you 're on a PvE server or just doing a quest you could bump into someone who is ALSO doing those quests and group up together and do it as a group , and while doing the quests you could have some things in common , you may like the person and become friends . When I was in Westfall I met some friends who were killing those pesky hunting machines and we teamed up , became friends , and years later we are still friends . Another example of how I met one of my best friends on WoW is when I was in the TBC zone for Blood Elves and met him in the Ghostlands trying to kill an elite and he needed some help , I helped him out as I could see him waiting outside of the keep and we became friends , formed a guild , and we still play WoW together ; however , the guild does n't exist anymore : (",Balto-Slavic,Russian

3dom,EliteDangerous,I got similar feeling . After reading this thread I 've got an idea - what if devs have artificially lowered payouts/profitability for everything until release ? 3 reasons to do this : 1 ) give us reason to play after release instead of burning out during gamma ; 2 ) not to give us huge advantage against new players and 3 ) slower progression of players can be tracked and analyzed easier .,Balto-Slavic,Russian

Right now project cost more to maintain than it bring back - because it does n't have enough attention due to low funds : it literally can be interesting only as a form of fund with big sum in it . Project in question is http : //moredoge.com/ It is a `` dice '' / casino site which work for ~1.5 months already . I did n't advertise the site anywhere but in couple niche sub-reddits , site got handful of players , replies were mostly positive : http : //www.reddit.com/r/dogebetting/comments/2ftmhe/moredogecom_shibefriendly_dice_site_with/ Advertisement was so humble because I wanted to see reaction and behavior of players , real level of profitability compared to investments and advertisement expenses + there is n't enough prize funds for `` full-scale '' advertisement campaign in dedicated gambling communities . However during this period site was tested and developed further ( jackpot , partial jackpot , chat , affiliate program ) , and now it is stable , protected from DDoS attacks ( there were couple already ) and use HTTPS protocol ( premium CloudFlare account ) . Site is somewhat pleasurable to use and there were some really interesting visitors / players who bet up to 50k doges per single bet on other sites - for example J_Roc - but they left since bankroll was only 500k ( +1M in jackpot ) and bank could n't afford bets above ~500 doges ( I 've artificially lowered maximum income per bet by x2 factor to protect investment of my only present investor ) . So income from the site is only around 10k doges , but that 's approximately 50 % of all deposits players made during this month so you can get a clue - how profitable it could be ? Site has transparent statistic and investment information ( links are on interface ) + top losses and winning series and bets ( I 'll add weekly/monthly statistic - besides hourly stats - when more data will be available ) . As you probably know similar sites have hundreds of millions and billions doges in prize funds - but for this project it could be nice to offer to players at least $ 1-2 income per bet so I 'm looking for ~5 millions dogecoins ( 4M to go ) in bankroll before starting advertisement in dedicated gambling communities and on bigger cryptocurrency forums such as bitcointalk.org . Income shares planned as 60/30/10 between investors/jackpot/developer . Unlike on sites with huge bankrolls on MoreDoge.com you can get substantial part of income with relatively small sums ( for example 4M would yield ~50 % of total income - compared to ~1.5 % for a site with 250M bankroll ) .

Realistically to keep the territory government will have to turn country into bigger North Korea or start working on new amazing concept ( like `` American dream '' ) - which is too difficult to them because it requires liberalization which may end up with them sitting in jail cells for corruption . And at the same time country 's elite is not ready to lose their capitals due to sanctions and degradation of the country 's financial system and economy . All variants are loss for Kremlin and they are simply following old scheme because they do n't really know what to do ?

Few days ago , when i went to watch the Warcraft movie i had no idea that they were giving away free game codes at entrance and it kinda caught me by surprise , but i when got home i decided to make a new battlenet acc and check out what has changed . Some things i like , some i hate , but this is n't about that . I am kinda asking myself ( and you i guess ) , is it worth playing now ? I feel that with the release of Legion so near , i wo n't ever get to experience the Raids of WoD , or any from Cata and Pandaria . I do n't care much for PvP , but when it comes to PvE i am kind of completionist and i like the cheevos . That 's really the biggest issue for me , because from what i saw till now , raiding guilds are either taking themselves way too serious or are too casual , not even organized . So my question to you is , should i stick with it now or not ? And also , what 's up with people not defending cities anymore ? There were 2 Horde raids on IF and people were just standing at AH till they killed the auctioneers , and then just jumped around the attacking players while they cleaned the rest of the city .

She was talking to some guy telling him how she 's sick from all those migrants in the last few days , saying how in the begging she felt sorry but is now getting increasingly frustrated with them and the media for not showing the true picture . She said how they processed around 3000something of them yesterday and how there was less that 200 women and children among them . Those women and children where the first ones to be put onto the train , but as soon as the men got in , they started hitting the women that were sitting down and kicking them out into the hallway . She also said that they threw all the clothes and food out of the windows and even had some of them say how they do n't need our old clothes , the things they threw away were picked up by the locals and the gypsies . She also mentioned that they had some 50 year old guy that got heart attack , and that when the medics came and took his shirt off , they found thousands of euros tapped onto his body . In conclusion she noted that the only normal ones that behave like humans were Syrians , which ironically are the ones they encounter the least .

12084182,relationships,"This is so true . The weirdest thing in this whole situation , when the first big conversation happened , we discussed a lot of things , like me not really wanting kids but liking the idea of adoption . I think that bothered him in the end more than anything because he still brings it up and asks me to consider having my own kids . Anyway , my sister went for a job interview in a neighboring country , took her kids ( 7,8 ) and fell in love with a guy working for the company , they plan on getting married . My dad was so shocked . My other sister is dating a guy 10 years younger and he 's all tattooed up and in piercings . So he goes to me 'you know my friend Brian ? He got divorced , found himself a young girl and got two kids now he 's running around after them . He looks 10 years younger , says he has a purpose for life now , something to fight for . Maybe I should find myself a young girl and get a little kiddo ' ( although my parents are married , their marriage is really weird and strained and they almost divorced a dozen times but ended up just not doing it , they do n't really do anything together much anymore except family meals and him occasionally visiting to see how she is or staying at the house , but in a different bedroom . They both claim the other snores too much ) That hurt , on such a huge level . You were n't there for me , but want a kid to be there for and fight for ? It honestly was n't the first thing that popped into my head since dad told me that my sister 's getting married and I Was like , what ? Since when ? and to whom ? And then I was like , well , you 're 70 , so if that kids in high school when you die , what then ? or the age factor , you 're 70 'well at least he had a dad that loved him , that 'll always stay with him , kids love their parents no matter who they are or how old they are , I probably ca n't have kids , but if I did , I 'm sure it would n't judge me for my age ' . And then I felt shit because he was n't there for me and said that but I kept quiet cause he was like 'well if your sister gets to get married on a whim , the other one dates a guy 10 years younger with tattoos , and you do n't want kids , just to adopt and might marry a girl , then I think it 's fair I can want to have kids of my own , it 's been 10 years since I had any sexual relations ( note the viagra I spotted on his bedside table in a bag full of meds , possibly telling me otherwise , did he find someone already ? and just wants approval ? ) and it would be nice if I could have someone ... How unfair would that be on mom who 's sick and suffering ? Every time she knows he 's coming over , she insists on some blue ring he got her and does little things she normally would n't . To me it 's clear she still cares and wants something . I do n't think he does . Also , my oldest sister might be a half-sister . Wow . Interesting news from my middle sister , who says that 's why dads so panicked about neither of us wanting kids of our own cause those might not be his real grandkids . Sorry for the long ass rant . my mom started yelling at me earlier for forcing her to go get something rather than me get it for her ( we 're trying to get her to be active and not become a statue , her left hand has lost mobility because she refuses to use it , and she just watches tv all day , so I told her to get the item herself , it 's short , and she has n't been on her nightly walks in 2 days anyway because of rain so it 'll be exercise even though I would n't call it that as it 's 5 steps to the item and then 20 to bed ) . Anyway , she started yelling I 'm an idiot , over and over and I just lost it . I asked was I an idiot for trying to help her get back into shape ? Yes , apparently . Then I said I should just kill myself since I 'm that much of an idiot . she agreed and I said I was heading to the balcony and did , and when she said 'go for it ' I just lost it and almost jumped . Sorry for dumping this here but I had nowhere to put all this and I 've had the worst past 2 years of my life and all this shit piling on just makes it so hard to keep going . After not being able to do it , I sat and cried on the balcony and she came 10 minutes later crying herself , asking for an apology . Saying I do n't know how hard it is for her . A year ago I had a car wreck and spinal fusion . I could n't move my arms even an inch in any direction at first . Could n't move my head . It was painful and all the physiotherapy was a nightmare . I hated it , I wanted to yell at them and tell them to stop and that I could n't do it . But had I let that happen , I would almost be a statue right now . It 's the only reason I make her do things on her own sometimes so she can get back into shape .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"That post itself might very well not be real ( as most things on the internet are n't , and we should all be cautious ) . But things like that do exist out there . You 'd be amazed at what is real and people think it 's just there to be gore for us . That movie , where the girls go on a trip and take a random ride in a bus to their hotel thinking it 's an airport bus and one of them ends up on a shipping container with a cat litter box and stuff . That movie is actually pretty spot on with what happens . When I was younger I was approached by someone late at night ( I was like 14 coming home from a night out ) and I later found out that they were a convicted sex trafficker trying to get me to go with them . It fueled my anger towards how little is done to help sex trafficking victims . As a college student I did a research paper on sex-trafficking and slaves because it bothered me so much how little people knew about it and I wanted to shock my class with the facts . Girls as young as under 10 get kidnapped . They are promised jobs like working in a carpet factory . Family agrees because they do n't have money or is n't aware it 's happening as the children just walk off with strangers claiming to know their family . Sometimes girls just get kidnapped as I almost did ( guy tried to bribe me with his private plane and mansion , I did n't buy it , he then tried proposing to me and telling me he loved me ) and are sent off . Girls are forced to have sex ( in some cases ) with at least 30 men a day . Does n't matter if you 're on your period , do n't feel well , are in too much pain from the last client or anything for that matter , you do it . If you do n't have sex with at least 30 men you get punished . All girls are drugged so they are numb and keep needing more drugs so they do what they are told and are too fucked up to try and escape . You want to escape ? You get punished if you get found out . One girl had her teeth knocked out . another got pregnant at 12 and when she managed to escape and get home , her family ostracized her and did n't believe her and said she put it on herself , then her 'uncle ' said he 'd offer her a better life and a job and ended up sending her right back into the sex industry she just barely got out of . If you 've been in there long enough , and are not useful to them anymore Stockholm syndrome kinda happens . They offer you money and all the latest fashion and a nice car and place , in exchange you recruit new girls ( and yes , girls do this , it 's either getting a new life with nice things or fucking 30 guys a day , so of course you 'd rather recruit new girls . You 're so numb and drugged at this point that you do n't care , anything that takes you away from the day in day out of fucking is better ) . So these women , go out there , act as role models for girls from shitty countries in Eastern Europe or some Asian place or anywhere this is rampant and these girls think 'ooh , I could be like her , I can get a job and have nice things and look how confident she is , she 's happy with her life , I can get away from this shitty life where my family sucks and is poor ' . Then they get sold off to the highest bidder . You could end up in someone 's basement as a slave , or go work in a brothel . Making friends with a brothel worker ? Nope , boss does n't like that , he 's selling you off to another brothel . He does n't want to see you possibly happy or making friends with a worker . New boss finds out that you were being sneaky at last brothel and insists your new sex limit is at least 50 guys a day or punishment . Why do people encourage this ? It 's cheap . Taxi workers can take an hour off of work and not lose much because it 's so cheap to get sex . Some people like that they get young girls , too young to get anywhere else . Others like the fact that they might not speak their language . Or that they can do what they please because they have the money . Or because it 's risky and illegal . It 's disgusting is what that is and I really hope that something gets done about it . I 'm apparently from ( well , grew up in ) the country with one of the highest sex trafficking rates in Europe . It disgusts me how this is capable of happening . And my class was flabbergasted when I brought up the statistics and directly quoted our country as one with a high problem . People turn a blind eye too easily to problems around us and refuse to believe that things are real and happening .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,CasualConversation,"Yeah , when I moved , I looked into relocating him at one point because my dad travels for work a ton and my mom is old herself and has a hard time caring for herself , let alone a dog that needs medicine fed to him and regular visits to the doctors which he does n't like and needs lifting into the car . He ended up in a care facility and bringing him to live with me would have cost me around 2k and since he 's old , not a lot of companies are willing to do it and on top of that , the place I lived in charged 'pet rent ' . Which I had never heard of before , but I guess it 's a thing in the States . So it would n't have been cost effective and he 'd probably be even more stressed in a new environment . We have a huge house back home where he 's free to go out and wander as he pleases and comes home when he wants , whereas I lived in an apartment and would be walking him at set times .

12084182,AskReddit,"Not the OP but just some points of view to consider . My parents are pretty controlling , they constantly badger us about everything . Even when I still lived with them and my older sisters would come visit , mom would be like 'where are you going ? Who with ? When will you be home ? ' Apparently they were a lot worse before I was born . My oldest sister wanted to be a makeup artist , she got accepted into a top make-up school in England , and dad wanted her to live her dream , and she wrote to them I guess because she was away from home , in a new environment and was n't used to this lifestyle and confided in them that some students were using drugs like cocaine and she was n't sure how to handle it . Instead of just telling her to avoid that crowd and stick to her guns , they freaked out , pulled her out and killed her dream . She went into I hate you mode and started doing things to piss them off ( I think she even got into heavy drugs after that ) because they were n't being the support she needed but just ruining things . I was raised partly like an only child as my sisters are both well over 10 years my senior . My middle sister did spend some time around me , but not a whole lot as she lived abroad for most of it . They raised me like an audiobook on repeat , I was an annoying parrot around people 'you should n't smoke ' 'you should n't swear ' you should n't this or that , I criticized my older sister all the time for smoking pot and pretty much gave her an ultimatum at one point because I thought she did n't care for me if she chose drugs over what we had . Yeah ... .. I started hanging around a different crowd , who pretty much made me realize that I need to be more open minded , more accepting , less of a bigot and I also started not believing in religion as much as I did before . I was never overly religious but I was raised with a God and suddenly started seeing things differently . I also hated how strict my mom was . I 'd have to be in bed by a certain hour , the computer got moved downstairs so I ca n't be on it when it 's 'bed ' time . I couldnt ' stay out late , no matter how late my friends parents let them stay out , moms rules were different and I had to abide by them . I started resenting them . I could never tell them anything without worrying they would freak out . I rebelled the way I did ( although not to the extreme of OP 's child ) because I could , because I was angry . Because I hated being caged . And because curiosity . I realized I wanted to try everything and anything even if it did n't seem like I 'd like it , just to know what it 's like and how I feel about it . I know several people who had strict parents who tried to smother them and were over protective and did n't want to lose their kid , so they 'd monitor everything they did and the kids hated it and would act out because of that . And some people just go off for no reason . Knew a girl that was really bright and a really nice , quiet , good girl . Started doing modeling . Started dating a guy , started doing drugs to keep her body right or whatever . She was best friends with a friend of mine and I had met her on a few occasions . One day my friend told me that she got an ultimatum from her that she could n't hang with her unless she was n't a virgin anymore , and offered a friend of her boyfriends to have sex with her . What the fuck ? It was so unlike her , she had changed and turned into this whole other person and if you were n't into sex and drugs , you were n't welcome . So just someone else 's perspective from what I 've seen , or experienced . I 'd like to see myself ( if I ever have kids ) as an open parent . Growing up I 've seen parents that were very open with their kids and the kids treated them like best friends . I want to have that with my kid . Even if it means he 'll do things I might not agree with , at least I 'll know what they 're doing and where so I can act accordingly if something goes wrong and know how to help them out , and if there are parents that are strict or kids feel they ca n't reach out to them , I can be the parent they can talk to and then I wont feel like they are suffering or I can help talk to their parents if they feel they ca n't do it themselves . Although I 'm not sure if going in the exact opposite direction of my parents will be the solution to not having these problems .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,TrueAskReddit,"I never said it was a source , just that it was discussed .

So although the two words do n't necessarily have a legitimate scientific meaning behind them , there are two distinct forms of being anti-social even if your 'symptoms ' or 'traits ' are the same .

Mom bought a Jaguar at one point so that they could feel good about their accomplishments , their company went a long way and started earning good money .

12084182,sociopath,"1 . None of that , just people that are either fucked emotionally or some other way damaged and drugs help them get by or abuse them for the fun they bring . 2 . ASPD is characterized by lack of empathy , whereas killing for drugs , does n't mean you lack empathy , it just means the hold the drugs have on you is so strong you 'd consider going to extreme measures . These people before the drugs were otherwise normal people for the most part , whereas the drug changed them into completely different people . Not everyone can change with sobriety but some people do . 3 . They become substance abusers because it 's a change from the norm , it 's fun , it 's a way to kill the boredom which we suffer . 4 . Boredom , living on the edge , all of that basically describes me . I do n't know if I 'd be immune , I do feel the addiction and I feel the withdrawal symptoms but I 'm fairly strong willed and I just tolerate it . Like if I do some h and then start to feel the nauseous , and get the shivers or whatever , I just plow through if I do n't feel like doing more or do n't have any . I do n't necessarily do one drug over another , it all depends on my mood and I tend to abuse whatever I can get a hold of . New Year 's for example , hung out with some people , we did coke , ritalin oxy , dilaudid , various benzos , DMT and weed . Just went at it all night , alternating lines or whatever and ended the night ( or rather morning ) with DMT at sunrise and tripped out .

12084182,sociopath,"Ritalin , various bezons ( xanax , valium , etc . ) , had dilaudid and oxy for a while . Ritalin is pretty simple , as with any other ADD medication . Benzos , just need a good trauma story and stress . One way to do it is fake social anxiety , make it extreme , like you ca n't even order pizza on the phone without panicking , and then add on a trauma that amplifies the need for meds like that . Example , death in family , discovering long lost relatives , etc , have to deal with people because of it , and you ca n't deal with people . Oxy/dilaudid , had an actual injury and surgery , but after that just maintained how painful it all was , and convinced them to prescribe more . Also helps if you have a good family doctor that knows you , and then out of the blue , without abusing them and going to them for only legitimate reasons , you show up , they recognize you , and then trust you to prescribe something with minimal backstory because they know you and you do n't come off as the abusive type . Also easy if for example , you fake an injury , ( buy plaster of paris online and make a fake cast or any other injury item such as neck brace ) , and then tell them that the pain is bad and you owe the hospital lots of money ( if you do n't have insurance ) and that they would n't see you because of that and need meds . Or that they are your family doctor and you 'd rather see them from thereon out , you trusted the surgeon to do the important stuff when it happened but would now rather see your doctor , etc .

Yes , crime is worse there , but I 've also traveled a lot and just was n't sure why it was the safest . Not saying Cyprus is n't safer compared to other countries , I just found it weird that it got to the third place globally . But everyone has their own experiences , and maybe mine are different . That stabbing happened while I was out in the area , and suddenly there 's police everywhere and they 're questioning everyone . My parents house got robbed 5 years ago , and another time a neighbor intercepted some people trying to scope our house . My dog ( who was calm and usually scared of guests ) attacked them and when neighbor apologized for his sudden change in temperament , a car emerged from bushes and the guy ran off so she knew something was up . And in Nicosia where I lived , a gang decided to take over our neighborhood and every night you 'd hear their motorbikes loudly and if you walked where they were hanging out , they 'd be all weird , and it was n't pleasant walking around there . These are just a few examples of what I 've experienced here .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Oh he is arrogant as fuck ! ! ! Sadly , my hometown , is pretty dead in terms of people to hang with . Most foreigners like myself who went to high school here , tend to leave for college elsewhere after as it 's a small place and the only good schools are private schools . They also usually do n't come back . The friends I do have here are in a different city as I went to college there . And it 's 2 hours away , and even some of those left for masters abroad . My best friend and our mutual best friend who 's family friends with Rick , who were in the city I studied in , suggested I hang with him for lack of things to do since he 's from my city so that 's how I ended up hanging with him . I decided before coming home this summer after studying abroad that I would eliminate all the people I know here as they are n't really good friends , just people to kill time with , and I hang with them for lack of options . I thought , better having no friends than friends that do n't help you grow as a person . ( I also have social phobia due to depression and just cling to whoever I can because I do n't have skills to meet new people or do something about my life ) So I ended up hanging with Rick and was not expecting that to happen . He 's arrogant but at least we do fun things and I can usually look past it . So without him , I do n't have a lot of people to hang with . I like some of his friends , they 're actually nice for a change , but I do n't want to make it weird if I ask them to hang out but then not include him . I think they 're tired of him too , like Dave who hangs with us , I can tell he 's always irritated with his arrogance . Case in point , the other night we were at this tabletop/board game bar , and we hung out there , played some new game , and as it was nearing the end Rick was n't bothered to put effort since clearly he was losing , and started playing a guitar laying around . Then when the game ended , and we were gon na tally up who won , he just got up and started picking out what game we should play next . He always acts like he 's in charge and it pisses me off . We all got annoyed and I called him out on it and said how we are here as a team and to have fun , not to compete and get pissy if we lose . And that he should sit and find out who won . Finally he sat down grudgingly and his other friend at one point said he was glad that for once he was n't the only one calling him out on his actions . I straight up tell him how I feel , just being honest . Even though I 've only hung out with Dave 5-6 times , I 'm thinking of messaging him since he stood up for me , or rather my point of view , and saw Rick being an asshole , and tell him that I 'm considering cutting ties with Rick or giving it some time and waiting for an apology . I feel he 'd understand ( in case he wonders why I 'm not coming out anymore ) and that maybe he 'd offer to hang without Rick . But even though I know he 's tired of him too , they go to the gym together with another friend and hang often so maybe he 'd feel weird about it . I think he 's a cool person , but I do n't want to make things weird between Rick and him since they 've been friends for years vs. me just meeting him . I hate being depressed and having social anxiety . Makes having friends so much harder . I cling to people even if they 're bad for me because I have no one else . Tried changing that and found out the one friend I did have turned out to be an ass . So now I 'm stuck with either repairing that or being friendless until I figure out a way to make new friends . He also acts like he knows it all half the time and just has this pompous thing about him , I hate people like that . Ahh .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I hated it there , but at least I was able to go to classes and come home without much hassle .

Like if I had to talk to someone in an office , I dreaded that , so I 'd have her go with me to make it easier . I ended up switching degrees a year later , and although I never finished that one , I got closer to doing something I liked . I met some awesome people and they made socializing a lot easier and the anxieties started to fade . A year before graduation , I transferred yet again , but to a different country and a better university , and I can safely say most of my anxiety is gone .

12084182,AskReddit,"Haha , back home where my parents are from , everything 's really shitty , especially in rural areas , you have bathrooms that are charged for , and then they give you like a few squares of toilet paper that you have to deal with . So this one bathroom at a rest stop had stalls with holes , like you kneel down , not a toilet with a seat and cover . But I realized that the end stall was kinda closed up with a chair , and I knew it was either a storage room or their toilet .

12084182,relationships,"It 's not like it was all convenience . But I ca n't say for certain that I loved him . I might have been clouded by the way I felt at that point in time . When I met him there was someone else I was n't over , and we met under the pretense that I was kinda in a relationship ( despite not being in one , it was easier to say that I was since the feelings ) , and then he asked me about it one day and said that he 'd like me to be his gf . Meanwhile I went out with some other guy ( who I thought understood I was looking for friends and acted like he was too ) and the whole time I wondered what my ex was up to and started thinking about all the fun we could be having , and then it became clear I was on a date , and I did n't like it at all , but I realized that I liked my ex since he was on my mind and not the guy I was trying to get over . I do n't know if I ever saw a future together , like us starting a family and marriage . I remember the first time I saw his house , my brain instantly tried to picture us there because we 're in a relationship so naturally down the line , stuff might happen . It was weird , I realized he was n't my usual type , but I guess a part of me kinda saw something . But not a whole lot I guess , cause we had different ideas about future stuff . I guess it was convenient because it was a distraction from other things , but that feels so bad to say . I do remember feeling genuinely happy around him , being at home and waiting for him to come over so we could hang and being impatient over it ...",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Pressure I guess . My mom had surgery and I wanted cheaper rent . As an international student it 's really hard to get an apartment without income or credit history . My roommate decided she was moving in with other people last minute and honestly , it would have been hard to land a place on time before we had to move out . He offered cheaper rent , and made me feel bad for not wanting to move in with him . 'Do you not love me enough ? Is that it ? Your mom is suffering , your dad has to pay for her surgery and recovery and you want to move into an apartment when you can stay with me for a lot less than any place around here offers ' etc ... he said I could get a car instead of paying for rent and just make monthly payments , which seemed like a good idea at the time I suppose . I 'm weak and he made me feel bad and I did n't know how to face him . I know that 's my fault , no one else ' .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,CRedit,"Awesome , I read some bad reviews but now I 'm seriously considering it haha . Gon na apply as soon as my credit goes up a little this month so I know I have a better shot at getting it .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Close to the start . We were hanging out every day , and it was cool and I had fun , and then it started being weird . I 'd go to hang with my friends and he 'd seem like it 's weird that I do n't include him . I did some of the time , but like if it 's a study group right after class , then we 're just gon na chill , go over homework and test work and I do n't see why he needs to be there . He got all weird that day , but my friends hinted at liking him so I called him to come and bring us pizza , and he was over in a flash , despite being with his friends . Ever since it 's like I never had any time to myself , he 'd just feel weird why I need time to myself , why I need to browse the internet without him behind me watching . It 's not that I need to or have something to hide it 's just that it felt weird , he felt possessive with all of that . He wanted to get me a car not even two months in , like maybe not even a month in , my sister came down to visit for a day , and I spent it with her , get home to my apartment to find a gift on the bed , a watch he knew I had wanted . Okay , it 's cool , you got me something I wanted and paid attention to me . But wanting to get me a car that 's like 4-5k and then have me move in with you so fast is weird . I was going home to the summer and looking forward to spending it with my friends , then one night my friend drunkenly messages me for a threesome and he flips out . The next day he wanted to leave and never come back , leave his whole life behind , house and education included . I prove to him through my previous conversations with said friend that there 's no history between us , nothing . And the message was something out of the blue too , like 'oh btw , do you mind if a girl joins us in our whatever ' so it was hinting to something already arranged . He did n't trust me going home and surprised me with a ticket to see me and I had planned on breaking up with him when I was gone as I thought it would be easier . Him wasting more money on me made it harder . I had to tell my parents that I had a boyfriend and he was coming over , huge shock . I kept trying to make it work , to want it to work but it was just hard with everything he was doing . I lost my friend cause he would n't hear of him , even when the guy added him and sent him a message and said 'sorry man , it was my honest mistake , we 're good friends I do n't want to loser her , I 'm glad she 's found someone finally and I 'd like to get t know you and we can all be friends ' That just angered him more and he threatened to be violent if he saw him . We went to spend Christmas with his family and unbeknownst to me he planned on proposing to me in front of his family but for once he thought about how that would make me feel and realized that I would n't be into that . He only told me after the break-up when he had a breakdown and hoped that knowing that would make me change my mind about the situation . I 'm not the kind of person to get married 6 months into the relationship . Or move in 5 months later . It was all too rushed and stuff . We did n't have much in common either , he was happy to do anything I wanted to but I knew he would n't be into it entirely , he 'd just be doing it because he 'll do anything to make me happy . I do n't want that , I want to meet someone that actually has stuff in common with me and enjoys it in full . I liked all the same things he did , but as I 'm a diverse person whereas he 's narrow minded with interests , that became a problem over time .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll definitely do that . Once I move out I 'll stop answering to his parents or anyone , I 've been on his computer , removed my facebook messages or history so he ca n't link to my account , and will block him once I move out ( right now have his sister added so do n't want to stir something up by blocking him early ) then hope he does n't ask her for my link though I will block her too . and then not talk to them and his parents . they 'll hate me but hopefully understand over time . I have to do this once I 'm out already so that they do n't come looking for me . I 'll definitely write out the amount and stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Not going to talk to his parents , his mom is just like him and is trying to get me to stick around and be with him . Though she says that if I 'm doing it just to make him happy , I should n't , she hints that she could use help with the payments and it would be cheap and that maybe one day things will be different when we both take some time away and we 'll be back together in no time . I 'll just put it in an envelope under his door .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll pay him back somehow . I know that if I request him to not talk to me again , he 'd ( grudgingly ) do it because it 's what I want .

Then I got a car and went to college and that kinda changed . Had less time for it , but when I moved to Orlando , without a car I got into biking again .

12084182,sociopath,"First rule of the sub : No asking if you are a socio-path , psychopath , or have ASPD . It takes a detailed patient history , psych evaluation , evidence , and in the end , you do n't truly want this despite popular culture . With that being said , I have to kinda agree with other posters , you might have some ASPD traits , but you 're not necessarily a sociopath . and there might be a bit of narcissism in there too , but I do n't think that 's the main issue at hand .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"I assume that with me it was trauma , although I ca n't be sure . My mom has bi-polar and narcissism . Two really annoying traits . Supposedly she also used to steal regularly , like a kleptomaniac , but I do n't think she 's a sociopath so I would n't say it 's inherited . When I was a kid , my parents were never around much , I had a lot of other people taking care of me . Kids always picked on me for being different and I guess that 's why I take pleasure now in seeing people suffer , it 's like payback , now I have the power they had over me . I hate my parents with a passion sometimes , I remember being the last kid to be picked up in school cause mom was at work still , and later on I had someone else pick me up every day . My parents raised me to be self sufficient , from age 10 I flew by myself on most flights if I knew where I was going ( to meet up with my parents ) . I lived with my cousins for a year once when I was 7 . Yeah , they were n't really there much ... I was alone a lot . They were also fairly materialistic , and possibly treating everything like an object is something I 've taken from them . And I think all this hate for all of that made me who I am today . My mom tells stories of me as a kid which to her are 'cute ' but to me sound creepy now knowing what I am . 'what will you do if I die ? ' ( who asks their kid that anyway ? ) 'I 'll just go travel the world with daddy ... or the maid will take care of me ' nonchalantly like I wont be bothered that my moms gon na die . Yeah , I never cared much . Supposedly I never cried as a kid until I saw my cousins getting all the attention in the world when they cried so I did it too for the attention . I also was never too fond of physical affection , like where my family 's from , it 's very common to greet someone and cheek kiss them or hug them , and I was always kinda cold in that regard ( why is that necessary ? ) and I remember my dad asking my mom if something was wrong with me cause I do n't like being around people that much ... . Meh ... I feel like the signs were there when I was really little but nothing concrete materialized until later . I remember when I was picked on , I was so tired of it that one day I told my sister that this girl that picks on me picked up a desk and tried to throw it at me . Boy did she get into trouble cause no one believed her when she said she did n't do that . I was like 6 then .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"Define stealing though . If you think about it , I can go into a store , say Walmart , grab a gaming keyboard , say a 250 $ deathstalker , switch the price tag , or print a custom bar code for a 10 $ keyboard , stick it on it , go to self check-out or an older cashier that probably does n't know a thing about that , not at the electronics isle . Since it weighs about the same , it wont register that something 's wrong . Walmart just got robbed of 240 $ . That 's 1/4 of 1k and they never said bag .

Now how can one have sushi in common if they ca n't stand it ?

She stupidly decides to let the captain know about what 's going on and as she opens the door , the cat runs into the cockpit , and right under the captains feet . He 's scared of cats .

12084182,ipod,"I 've always had a Zune , I do n't know why but they always worked for me . Recently my Zune died and I figured since I want more space anyway and somehow possibly iPod 's are better ( and the Zune was discontinued ) I 'm better off with an iPod . I 'm getting pretty frustrated with it . For starters , Zune knows how to organize a library , it can detect the same artists from similar files whereas the iPod ca n't . For example , The Band and The Band , are according to the iPod a different band , even though they have the same name . Or The Band vs The band or the band or just band . It ca n't seem to tell that it 's the same thing . Also , Zune categorizes things by album artist , so if there 's a song The Band Feat . The The , it knows that the main artist due to the album artist field is The Band and sorts it accordingly , that way I do n't have a ton of compilation songs all under separate names . Another thing , I recently added a lot of random music from an old HDD , now the iPod sorted it into the library but gives me no option of seeing what was recently added . With the Zune however , I can see recently added artists and add them accordingly . With iTunes , I have to go through all my files to find the new ones and add them ( and I have over 200GB of music ) . I decided to double check all the name fields so it sorts it under one , make all mixed files sorted by genre so I do n't have to look for a ton of files at once but add by genre , but iTunes did not decide to update all this ( I did it externally ) and even when I reloaded it , it refused to update the files . What can I do ? EDIT : My library is not set to auto sync as I have two computers and originally used one to add music , but then found songs on the other one and added them manually , and that 's where this problem comes in . I ca n't sync automatically on this computer without erasing all music .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,askcarsales,"Florida . Nissan Dealership . Financing the car . Went to a dealership the other day with my boyfriend ( I got a thing in the mail saying I won something if I go to their `` new '' location . ) I won a gift card and the salesperson started to talk about cars . I am in need of a car as I am moving in with my boyfriend to save costs , and we decided to see what they would offer ( never thinking I 'd end up with a new car ) . The place was offering LIFETIME WARRANTY ! ! ! Can you believe that ? As long as they 're in business and I have a problem with my car , they will fix it . Amazing ! ( Heh ... ) The sales person gave us some really great deals on a truck ( 400 $ /mo . with 3,000/dn we really wanted and we decided to go for it . Lifetime warranty ! ! ! Once that sale was done , he offered to give us a trade-in value of my boyfriends car , and told him that if he traded it in , his current car would be paid off ( a 2012 model ) and that , that would increase his credit score , and help me ( with no credit score since I 'll be on his card , making payments ) , and that he would be paying about the same each month as he is now . The facts added up and it was a really good deal , he 'd get a car he likes for no down payment and it would help us out . We were thinking hard cause we really did n't want to spend more money , it 's already tough with the way it is , we 'd just have enough for basic spending . His car is alright , but this one was amazing and I guess in the heat of the moment ... Oh and to mention that when you buy a car , you get to spin a wheel for a prize , the first time we spun it , we got 50 $ and he said the second time , we would n't spin , but they 'd give us a cruise trip off the bat . We go to pay with the finance manager for the second car , and it turns out to be more than we expected , about 100 $ more , and we were quite irritated . We even picked the minimum for the protection plan . We go home and he starts to calculate everything , we need to come up with 2,000 in a week . We paid 1,000 , but were told we can pay the 2,000 in no later than a week . That 's what started to screw us over . We then call his parents who currently pay for his insurance , and who are in South Carolina , they say that they ca n't pay anymore , it 's too much now with 2 more cars to be added , and complicates things . We ca n't find insurance under 300 $ per month , that 's too much for us . We go back to the dealership the next day , tell them we ca n't afford the insurance , and we got screwed over by a 100 $ ( not to mention that I spent 7+ hours at the dealership the previous day ) and they say they 'll work something out for us . We said we 'd like to return the one car , cause we really ca n't afford to struggle with the payments . They give us some papers to sign for insurance , and stupidly we did n't read them through , just assumed they were paying for us , but nope , they got us insurance for a few days . The catch : We never expected his credit score to be high enough to even get the car , neither did the salesperson . My boyfriend makes car and house payments each month ( owns a house and car ) and other things . And they never asked to see proof of income , they mentioned needing it , but I guess his credit score covered it since he mentioned paying for those things . They asked what he does ( freelance work , sells stuff in his own time , not employed , full time student , as am I ) and that 's where they 're flawed , oh and not to mention that they let us out of there without us having insurance based in Florida . They said our only other option since they do n't have a return policy is to trade the car in as soon as the other payment gets cleared and get a cheaper car .

I scratched a guys car at my old campus due to having no way to park out without doing so , I did not know it was going to happen , but it did and I had to pay him 600 $ or get my insurance to pay in which case my parents would find out and get angry and take my car away from me . I got really lucky as a friend of mine found out by chance ( after me being harassed over the phone by this guy constantly , and my friend assumed he was an ex or something and told him to fuck off . He then found out I owed him and paid off my debt and I paid him back ) This month has been literally upside down for me with everything that could possibly go wrong , doing so . and also needing to spend money on things I did not account for and ending up broke . I started to panic as I could n't afford to buy credit for my phone . Verizon is stupid and I ca n't receive calls or texts without having credit , so no way for this girl to reach me , I emailed her and told her my phone was broken , as I did n't want her to find out I 'm broke because of her ( no idea why ) I got no response and found that odd . I searched online and everything led to going to court and it wont pay off and I 'll never get my money back , if I do n't , I 'll have no food for next month and there 's no way I 'm telling my parents I gave their money to a random stranger . What are my options if she does n't contact me by the time she 's supposed to ? tl ; dr Lent a girl money to not get evicted , ended up broke myself . She signed a contract , what are my options if I do n't get my money ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Though I 'm not sure of that either , like I 'd never seen myself dating a girl before , but I did find some girls cute in a way or attractive , so I do n't know what that makes me . On to my point , this girlfriend of mine is really into me , like really , really into me , and she said she hopes I do n't mind if she kisses me , ( she 'd never been with a girl either ) and I suppose I 'm interested , I like her as a friend , and I 'm curious where it could go and I told her sure . Tonight we 're gon na hang at a bar and I have no idea ... but either way , I 'm nervous as I feel it 's gon na be weird . Like , I kinda like her , but I feel that in that moment when it happens , I 'll feel weird as I 'm not sure I 'm bi at all . So maybe I 'll feel weird that she 's trying to kiss me ? Well I hope not , I hope it goes well ! I guess I 'm just curious if there 's any other bi people here and how their first time was .

12084182,socialanxiety,"I hate dealing with people , facing them or anything of the sort . I never ask for help from teachers , always do things on my own . Which has become somewhat of a problem . My SA has improved somewhat over the years , but I still have big issues that I ca n't seem to overcome . I had problems with one of my projects but failed to talk to the teacher , I did n't show up for the final class where we discussed stuff as I had not much to show , I ended up doing it last minute and showed up for the presentation ( sort of like an exam day ) and something was n't right with the program , then I got home only to find out that I did n't do something right . I kept telling myself I 'd do it fast , then other stuff started piling on as it was my last exam so my parents decided to drop the bomb on their divorce as they thought my school stuff was over . And I do n't even know what happened , time flew so fast and it 's been 2-3 weeks since my exam , and I still have n't emailed the teacher and I hate myself for it cause I do n't know what to say to him . He saw me on the exam day and I told him I had issues and I 'd email him later and I never got round to it . My friend said to tell him the divorce had a huge effect on me and I could n't study or do anything , but I do n't wan na lie , I could find the time to work even though my mom is depressed as fuck lately and taking it out on me . I want to ask if there 's any way to resubmit for a regrading or something of the sort but I need to get it done asap and do that before it 's too late . I feel time is ticking so fast but I keep not having the motivation to do it . Maybe it 's cause I 'm all stressed and stuff in general all the time , my friend says I 'm clinically depressed with the way I go about things . I just think it 's my SA ruining my life as I ca n't do any normal things . I do n't think he realizes how bad it is . I could n't even call delivery before or walk into a store cause of this issue . Basic things ... Mess everything up ! tl ; dr I did n't submit a project and I ca n't face my teacher now to tell him about it and ask for regrading",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,editors,"Okay , so I was n't sure how to phrase this but for my video production class we were making movies . ( [ here 's ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=nW6837VxQxc ) the last one I did , if you 're curious ) My new project is kind of a zombie movie . And when I was done filming , I noticed a feature on the camera that adds a really cool effect while filming , it seems as though it removes a few frames ( or maybe adds , though I think the previous ) and it gives this feeling of slowness , but also choppy , and it 's hard to describe , but I really liked the effect and I was wondering if anyone knew how to replicate it ? Just picture the camera jumping a few frames each time . We use Avid at school though I could n't get it to work at home ( starts up fine , and then while loading decides to crash on me ) , I downloaded Sony Vegas and I can download anything else as long as it gets the job done . Also has to be free if possible ! ! I 'll even try and get Avid working if needed . Any help would be greatly appreciated ! Or any ideas for effects .

12084182,Health,"Ok , so I 'm partially deaf . Ca n't hear 80 % on my left ear . I have what is known as glue ear , the hammer , anvil and stirrup in my ear are glued together and therefore ca n't produce any vibrations which make sound . I went for surgery about 3 years ago when I was 19 , it was horrible , I had bad doctors , and turns out they did n't do anything . They were supposed to find out what kind of brace I need put in , but then they said they still did n't know and needed to do another surgery for that and then the final one . I told my parents I did n't want to do that again . They also just were unprofessional overall , being unprepared . Now we 're gon na see different doctors , I 'm actually gon na travel out of the country to get the surgery done . I do n't trust doctors here . So I 've got some questions . What 's it like being able to hear normally ? I 've got this fear that everything will sound so loud and it 'll be scary hahaha . Also I am really into music , like I 'm gon na go study audio production hopefully , but now I ca n't cause of my ears , I need to be able to hear perfectly . So I 'm waiting to sort that first . But I 'm wondering how it 's gon na affect things . Is it weird when you hear music and hear it differently than before ? Like does it sound weird ? I know that I have to have my headphones in the right way round , otherwise music sounds weird and I hate it , cause I was used to hearing it one way . And my biggest question is about balance , since my ear has no fluids going , I have terrible balance . And I hate it , cause I love sports , but I 'm always limited . Like snowboarding . Do you think it just becomes normal , because I suddenly have fluid or it takes time to adjust and I have to work on it ? Also I get car sick cause of balance , does that go away as well ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"I made a status on Facebook and this guy commented and at first I thought he was pissed at me , but then I went to his profile and well he pretty much does all the things he complained about in his comment . So now I 'm confused . This was my status , a quote from somewhere : We live in the matrix . A chaotic reality which we try to understand and master so as to be able to control it , as well as ourselves . It is a hard job , but each and every one of us has to do it . We live in and live out the pattern that is laid down before us . Comment : We live in facebook . a social networking site where we try to understand what people are talking about when they post dumbass shit . its a hard job ignorin all these idiots that are on here especially when you cant control what they post , but to live in a world where we want to keep in touch with our loved ones we have to wade throught the sea of farmvillers , taggers and idiots that post t hings they think we care about . We do n't . you think you live in the Matrix , but the Matrix was full of robots and cool cyborg people . This is Facebook . Umm he plays games on there , tags people , and makes comments . I do n't play games , yeah I 've been doing a little too much Facebook lately , but it 's summer and I 'm bored staying over with cousins so I put statues up and song links . This was going to be my response , but I do n't want to make an enemy out of it , what do you think ? On your homepage you can remove who you see updates from . So you do n't have to see crap from me again ! : P And well when I post stuff , usually people comment on it , or like it or something so I get the impression people are interested in reading my shit . If they did n't do that then I 'd be stupid for adding more shit that no one likes or is interested in . Btw , from your profile , I can tell you 're worse than me , you tag people , same way I do , make status updates , and you play Facebook games that ( I do n't play ) that probably forces people to join something , or do something to help you out . Those personally annoy me , so I do n't do it . I do n't mind the status updates . So why complain on me when you 're no better ? Btw , if you 're bothered to go back a bit on my Facebook , you 'll see I barely use it , just now I 'm on much more cause it 's summer and I 'm bored at my cousins place and so this is where I end up at . - I hate Facebook ! I actually deleted my account a few times how annoyed and bored I got of it . But then I realized I had a few people I had no other way of staying in touch with , as sad as it is . But this really annoyed me . Why be so hypocritical ? -- -- I replied saying how he 's not any better , and asked what he meant by it , and he said he did n't direct it at me , that he was just making it as a remark in general , and we sorted things out . `` wasnt directed at u love , i liked it but i was makin a point that the world is run thru social network sites now , its sad really . just a joke tho : D an like i sed wasnt aimed at u x ''",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Paranormal,"I wanted to get some advice on this , I feel kinda weird about it but a couple of situations happened where beforehand I felt like something would happen . A premonition if you will . First time this happened was last summer , I was with my boyfriend at the time in some botanical garden , he saw a flower just randomly on it 's own by some mound and decided to go photograph it cause it was unique , anw , the point is that as he got on the soil ( which is not a firm surface and it was downhill ) I thought of offering him my hand back up as he might fall , I just pictured him slipping and falling . But then I thought , I know he wont take my hand , would I his in that situation ? He lost his grip and slipped . I was kinda shocked but did n't say a thing . About a month later , I was at a gas station pumping some air into my tires and suddenly it felt so weird like something bad was gon na happen , something felt so wrong and I pumped the tires just fine and thought , hmm , nothing wrong . Well just as I left the gas station , suddenly I hear a bang and my car broke down , some metal pipe that 's between the front tires broke . : O Again it was weird but I did n't think much about it and maybe a few weeks later I was driving down a road and noticed an odd taxi next to me and somehow I just pictured it looking through the side mirror and not seeing me due to the blind spot and just trying to switch to my lane and low and behold it happened , the driver tried to go to my lane and then suddenly saw me there and swerved back . That 's when I told people how odd it was that I felt something each time that happened . I forgot about that , and about a week ago I was up late chatting with my friend and at one point the light flickered , nothing out of the ordinary , lights do flicker right ? And it happened again later and I heard the a/c go off for a split second and thought to myself , tomorrow there will be no electricity , I bet it 's gon na run out . a little later my net went off completely , and it happened to my friend a bit earlier and I told him , somethings off , I 'm sure of it . I slept around 4am I think and I woke up to the lack of electricity , my room was boiling hot . But what I did n't know was how severe the issue was . I live in an island in Europe , and at a army base , well a naval base , some idiot decided that it 's ok to put containers full of ammunition in the sun , and those containers blew up from the pressure , and he just told army boys to spray them with water so they cool down . Of course they did n't and they were situated right next to a power generator which when they blew up , blew up as well . And now because of the lack of power , half the island ( it 's kinda small ) has only a few hours of electricity a day ( including me ) Anw , that really freaked me out and I reminded my friend of last years incidents and he thought it was a bit odd too cause I told him , there 's gon na be no electricity tomorrow . Anw , is this odd or just chance ? I just feel like I need to get in touch with a part of me that will help me channel what I 'm seeing/feeling and work on it . I first thought , well ok , I saw a taxi , I could have easily thought he might not see me cause it is possible , and it 's possible that my ex would fall cause he 's on unstable ground , and the light flickered , so maybe it 's a sign , but all the same I feel like there was a reason I felt something so strong . It just stood out . Anw , I 'm not sure if I believe in premonitions , since I 've watched far too much Charmed and I think that kinda got to me and I 'm just combining things in my environment , but I 'm open to things . I do believe in a lot of paranormal things , I 'm just not sure if I 'm really seeing things or it 's my mind putting two and two together . TLDR ; I predicted a couple of things to happen and am wondering what people think about it . Did I really have a premonition or is my mind just putting information from my surroundings together to form a vision .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AdviceAnimals,"Yeah . Another issue I see is on the opposite end of the spectrum . I had a professor who studied in the States in a top university , even worked at one and had great experience/resume . She then had family reasons to move back home and wanted a job locally . She did n't care if it paid well or was an exact fit of her previous job , she just wanted to keep teaching and be able to be near her family . Our university originally turned her down because she was 'overqualified ' . They could n't hire someone like that even if she was content with the low salary because it would look bad on their part why they would pay so little for someone who is that good at what they do . She ended up modifying her resume , cutting half of her qualifying traits out , and applying to another branch of it in a different city . They accepted her and she asked for a transfer .

12084182,TrueAskReddit,"It comes with experience in most of those cases . But also if you think about it , sometimes you try to accomplish something for hours with no luck and then take a break and within 5 minutes you managed to figure out what you were stuck with . I used to work as a lyricist for a label briefly , and I found that when I put effort and wrote songs I thought would be big , never got far - the ones that caught my managers eye were the ones that I threw together last minute . Sometimes I had unfinished lyrics where I was n't sure how to fill in some blanks so last second I threw in random words/phrases where I was lacking and did n't feel they made sense , but to him the songs sounded magical !

They ended up crowdfunding an album since the label dropped them and have a [ website ] ( http : //music.sinch.net/album/clearing-the-channel ) where you can hear all their music since YouTube for the most part wo n't let their stuff stay up . Shame though , as they had quite a few tours with big nu-metal among other bands and could have had much bigger success but they did n't want to give into labels demands and put themselves into a formula or box , which although great , means they lost the potential for a bigger fan base without the traditional means of promotion . /endofrant",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
