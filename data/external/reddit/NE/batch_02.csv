12341,ukpolitics,"The prime minister no doubt used her visit to Saudi Arabia to desperately seek trade deals that will help cobble together a plan to combat the monumental act of self-harm that is leaving the single market . What she should have done was have a moment of conscience and think about the people of Yemen . International charities say Yemen is in the grip of a perfect storm of war , economic meltdown and humanitarian crisis . Yet while British aid is helping to save lives there , the country is being being pounded by British arms , sold to our Saudi Arabia allies , exacerbating the situation . Yemeni families face a daily nightmare of falling bombs , a critical lack of clean water and food which leaves the country teetering on the edge of famine and outbreaks of preventable conditions such as cholera and measles which are killing a child every ten minutes . This nightmare is deepened by “ widespread and systematic ” international humanitarian law violations by the Saudi coalition that have the “ potential to meet the criteria for a crime against humanity ” , according to a panel of experts set up by the United Nations . The figures are almost impossible to comprehend : 18 million people , including ten million children , need humanitarian assistance . That ’ s eight in ten people in Yemen who need humanitarian aid to survive . Britain can take credit for its leadership in providing humanitarian aid to Yemen — but ministers must also take responsibility for failing to use British influence to ensure that aid is not blocked . They have also failed to hold to account those responsible for the unrelenting attacks on civilians . Save the Children has said that the warring parties , including the Saudi-led coalition , are blocking aid as a “ weapon of war ” : detaining aid workers , bombing ports and holding up desperately needed food and medicines . Plans to attack the port of Hodeida , already damaged by Saudi bombs , risk causing a humanitarian catastrophe if steps are not taken to divert aid to other ports . Hodeida receives nearly three quarters of all imports and humanitarian assistance shipments . For a country which Britain counts as an ally to be deliberately withholding aid is bad enough but the Saudi-led coalition is also responsible for the unrelenting bombardment of Yemen ’ s towns and cities , hitting homes , destroying clinics trying to care for starving families and killing children in their classrooms . Similar crimes are undoubtedly being committed by the Houthi opposition . Deliberately withholding lifesaving aid and attacking civilians are war crimes yet in Yemen these reports are not being properly investigated and those responsible are not being held to account . To date , the government has said that the investigations , led by the Saudis themselves , are sufficient . It could not be clearer that the Saudis investigating themselves is woefully inadequate and deeply inappropriate . The case for a fully independent , international investigation into alleged war crimes , on all sides of the conflict in Yemen , is irrefutable . Yemen faces a humanitarian catastrophe . The government must stand up for international humanitarian law , halt arms sales , demand that our allies immediately allow humanitarian access and support calls for a ceasefire and a full , impartial investigation into what appear to be horrific war crimes . To leave Saudi Arabia with more credibility than her predecessors , our prime minister had to stop the flow of arms . By failing to do so , her government chose shamefully to side with Saudi Arabia , rather than hold the Saudi authorities to account on their alleged human rights abuses in Yemen . Ours is a government which has abetted a humanitarian disaster and brought further bloodshed and poverty to civilians in an already stricken land . The continued failure of the government to take action in Yemen leaves Britain ’ s reputation in the world permanently damaged .",Germanic,English

30503,GlobalOffensive,"And it is for that reason why I do n't think vac bans should be permanent , but rather last 2/3 years . This is because I think a ban should be long enough to ruin someone 's career but give them a second chance .",Germanic,English
30503,todayilearned,That does seem a bit shit .,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"If you play the game properly , e.g . not trolling , holding angles correctly , decent aim , playing around your team ( e.g . not over stacking a site ) . You can have someone that communicates , but also plays like an idiot , which personally annoys me a lot more . If someone who does n't communicate , but knows there place on the team because of it ( e.g . following strats instead of creating their own without telling anyone ) they can still be very helpful . Also if you ca n't communicate with your team mates it does n't mean you ca n't listen to what they say , although that does n't remove the language barrier .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Your second point seems a bit arbitrary . Anyway I have 1.5k hrs on the game , most of them with mates . However I have played a few albeit not many games by myself with little communication ( I usually give up communicating after a few rounds if no one else is ) , which we have won because we all played smart and knew what we were doing . I have also won games where I was in a group of 3/4 and the randoms did n't communicate , yet we won partly because he knew what he was doing , did n't interrupt us and held his own . Do you know that matchmaking ( which is what we are talking about right now ) is n't the highest level of cs and that not everyone needs to act like they are a professional playing the game in optimal conditions . What is hard to grasp around that .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Bloody hell , we are talking about matchmaking not bloody professional games . Do pro players search for a game with randoms and that is their team for the tournament , no you mong . Matchmaking is a completely different level , where you can play your best and not communicate . Do you expect 5 randoms on matchmaking to have pre set strats and anti strats like pros do , of course you bloody do n't . Your delusional if you believe you can use professional teams as an example for how matchmaking should be set out .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I usually play with mates , however on the off chance I do n't , I always use my microphone , unless as stated no one else does in like 4/5 rounds then I give up . My view is that not its not as black and white as everyone seems to think . And I can understand why some might not be able to/not want to talk in game .",Germanic,English
30503,unitedkingdom,"Part of the reason why commercial TV in the UK is n't as bad as the US is because the BBC holds the other providers to a higher standard .

30503,unitedkingdom,"BBC definitely provides more than netflix , if you include things like their news service , education , radio and more .",Germanic,English
30503,unitedkingdom,"Fair enough , it was a pretty big assumption . Maybe I was over exaggerating , however I believe were the BBC to go the quality of other channels would decrease , but not as much as originally stated ( i.e . not to US levels , maybe somewhere inbetween ) . Also whilst I would like the BBC to continue , even as a media tax or something , for some reason I do n't see it happening , especially not in its current form . I do n't think it will disappear completely , however I can see certain parts of the BBC being cut , if the licence were to go . I know my comment seems a bit like a ramble , I did just quickly write it up as I have to leave soon , so somethings I wrote might contradict slightly or not make much sense .",Germanic,English

30503,unitedkingdom,"As you said it is a personal thing , however I would n't say that the news has been replaced by other sites online , as BBC news is the go to website for news for many .

30503,todayilearned,"With talking about the UK , whilst there has n't been any official research on it to my knowledge either , I still think it is quite effective . Part of that is anecdotally as I support arsenal , and I go to nearly every home game , but I also support AFC Wimbledon as a second team , and I do often go to see them play when Arsenal have a small away game . So personally it does encourage me to go see a lower league team . Also I have no source for this but I think I have read somewhere before that many lower league teams do generally experience lower attendances when there is a big game at 12:45 ( a football game should n't start before 2/3 pm , but that 's another topic ) . Again I have no source on this , but it does seem believable and I have heard it said a few times before .",Germanic,English

Often times you are forced to sit down ( the only area where you can stand is the lower tier north bank ) .

30503,csgouk,Everyday seems to be a sad day for uk csgo .,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,Fair enough on the first point . Second point we kind of agree with . Finally I am wondering when you started playing csgo if you say I 'm basically going back into the beta . http : //blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2012/10/5256/ this is the update that introduced matchmaking ( after the games release ) and here https : //twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/279060714516258818 is when the map selection was introduced . This means that for at least the first 2 months of matchmaking you could n't have a map selection . Your point might be true for the first 6-8 months you started playing csgo ( although that is still very subjective ) but definitely not the first 6-8 months of the games release .,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I was arguing one of your points , I could probably think of some others if I can be arsed to . But to continue arguing your point about maps . You said you only play inferno and cache now , well one of those was n't even in matchmaking then . Also if you decided you wanted to play another map that was n't inferno but was still decent you would have to search for all the defuse maps . And oh bollocks I 'm now playing a match on Aztec . Also I do n't think everyone knew smokes , flashes strats etc in 2012 matchmaking either , especially with new updates every few weeks changing the grenades .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Some people do n't have an option . I have to play on WiFi based on the layout of the house , however I do n't think I have ever got banned for my internet dropping for more than 3 min , I have had a few very laggy matches though due to a bad connexion .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,http : //www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/connection ? q=connexion I had to go check the way I spelt it was correct .,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I did look into them at one point , and as they seem rather good , they do n't work for everyone depending how the house wires are laid out . Anyway they are the solution to some peoples issues , but not everyone . And in my case I have no need for them , as I very , very rarely have issues with my internet and some of those are n't down to being on wireless .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"40-60 on valve servers . I often get less on better West EU servers . I do live in London where the infrastructure is quite good . Most of my mates on wireless in the same area have a similar experience , however I ca n't speak for what it is like elsewhere .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Selfishly I hope not , as oddshot always loads fast enough for me and all I have to do is hover over the link to watch it , whilst with youtube I actually have to click a button . So personally I watch youtube links less than oddshot ones .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,I 'm pretty sure I remember seeing a few NIP comebacks on Nuke T side ( like 8-10 rounds or something ) .,Germanic,English
30503,AskReddit,"Definitely not in my opinion as I find them very annoying ( a lot of the time I would rather listen to a scouser , at least they are funny ) , although I know a few that do like them . However the majority either find them annoying or have no opinion . This is from my past conversations . I 'm from and live in London , btw .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"For me the one of my concerns after watching it was him mentioning some kind of play-off system . To my understanding ( I could be very wrong on this ) it is very popular with American sports to have a play-off system to win the title , and that Thorin mentioned something similar . This is something that would ruin the league for me , because what is the point of a league , where you can win every game but have an off game in the final to the 4th placed team or something ( although writing that as an arsenal fan is tempting : - ) . It takes the point of having a league away especially if all the league games are played on lan . For online leagues it makes sense to have the online finals on lan in a play-off system , however for a league on lan there is no point of having a play-off system to decide who wins .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"In football the only league that does to my knowledge is the Championship , and below in English football . And these are n't for the title , they are only for promotion spots , and there are nearly always at least 2 automatic promotion spots as well .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"But there is a much higher chance that the best team wo n't win . For example you can easily win every single game , but have a slight dip in form to a team that played well in the final , but nowhere near as well . I know it is like this for basically every csgo event right now , but that is because they basically have to be like that . This is because the leagues are either online , which is not a way to see who wins a large event , or that they do n't have time for a proper league system and have to use group stages instead . Just because it minimises pointless games , or is more exciting to to watch the final , does n't mean it is as fair . If a team wins it in week 8 out of 10 then chances are they deserve to win it . There is no point calling it a league when the winner is decided in a knock out competition , call it something else at the very least .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Its the banter that makes the game more competitive for me and more lively , as it feels a lot better beating someone that was shitting on you or annoying you before . No the game feels lifeless and no one ever talks in warmup . It feels like your just playing characterless bots who happen to be a bit better at the game than actual bots .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,How many times do you ha have to be kicked to get a ban ?,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I know your being sarcastic , and that I did over exaggerate a little bit , however it does make the game feel a bit lifeless and like your playing the exact same characterless people again .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"In csgo competitive play I think the engine should be improved to allow for more skilful movement , and only scrolling should be allowed . However in source bhop , I respect both types , however because I did n't know about autohop when I started , I used scrolling and have done ever since . Because I am very bad at bhop , I only ever use autohop for prespeeding on trying to get past levels I ca n't do , however I ca n't use autohop normally as I find my strafes and jumps to be a lot less accurate . That being said I respect both types of users , with a slight preference for scrollers . And that if someone else plays a different type of bhop , let them , just do n't watch their runs .",Germanic,English

30503,Gunners,Not sure what to think right now . Especially with United and Chelsea winning .,Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I 'm not sure if it would be possible or not , as I have little to no knowledge on modding and the game engine . However I was more of talking about competitive play for that , as I believe that having good movement should be rewarded , and bhopping is one way to reward good movement . However in competitive play it should n't be easy but it should be consistant and worth trying . But your point stands for source bhop , however I believe if it was possible it would 've already been done .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I 'm talking more about the first 6-12 months . Anyway what about the fact they used the foggy maps when the _se maps where used basically everywhere else . It also did n't have as many competitive maps as mirage and cache were n't official maps then ( they also used the old very , very shite version of nuke for some time ) . Also matchmaking is not about the challenge of getting a rank , it is about how good the games are as well as how challenging the games are . I am a bit biased , as I still think the matchmaking ranks are pretty worthless and do n't represent much . Also at the start of matchmaking you could n't even have a map selection . You would have to choose all defuse/hostage maps or just one map in specific .",Germanic,English

I probably played about 2 games in casual then went right into it , granted what got me into cs was watching ESWC 2012 and then Dreamhack winter 2012 , so I had a basic idea of how competitive play worked . Also casual and valve deathmatch do n't teach you anything about playing competitively . All the rank system does it help prevent cheaters just buying the game again .",Germanic,English

30503,GlobalOffensive,"Have n't a lot of pros cheated in the past though , especially to get their name out there . And in the majority of sports cheating only resolves in a ban for a few years . Also you say you are talking about csgo vac bans only yet your post says that people that cheat at a competitive level are compulsive liars ( which I would n't strictly agree with ) . So then why should it be limited to csgo , as 1.6 and source were both played at competitive levels as well .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"How so ? I would strongly disagree with that statement , albeit that is largely based off my memory . However when the csgo devs tweeted this https : //twitter.com/csgo_dev/status/291681838047559680 you can kind of see the state it was in , as there were no skilled players in mm ( because 64 tick and mm did n't use the _se maps ) , and this influx where actually just cheaters .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Well it definitely sounds like you take it seriously if you expect everyone to use a microphone if they are playing matchmaking .

30503,GlobalOffensive,"The point of matchmaking is that 5 randoms can play and mix how they want . If you want to play properly with teamwork and shit play in a 5 man like I do . You ca n't expect 5 random people , all to have a working microphone , be able to speak , speak the same language and get on well with each other to have proper teamwork . It 's bloody matchmaking for crying out loud .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Look I nearly always play in a 5man , never by myself . My point is that not being able to communicate should n't mean you are not allowed to play mm . Your reason is bollocks as well , what if some random bloke from Spain or somewhere who does n't speak English and has an hour spare , wants to have a quick csgo mix . None of his friends are online or want to play at that moment in time , so he has to search by himself . Why should the person in that situation not be allowed to play csgo .",Germanic,English

30503,ArenaFPS,"I agree that team modes takes the pressure off each player in general , but not in 2v2s and to a lesser extent 3v3s , where I believe the pressure is greater . This is because in 2v2s you are not only playing for yourself but for your team mate . And if your are not playing with someone you know , there is extra pressure not to screw over your team mates experience as well , as how you play is a much bigger contribution to the team modes in other games like csgo or overwatch . I 'm not one to complain about toxicity , but I can see it being the biggest issue in small teams , where your contribution is a big factor to the team 's success of that match .",Germanic,English
30503,ArenaFPS,"Its probably a personal thing then because I feel less pressure when I am only playing for myself , compared to a 2v2 with a random , where I feel like I have to perform more , with a mate I am usually just playing for fun so I would feel less pressure then .",Germanic,English

However I proper respect you for not wanting to take a spot from an actual supporter , which is an issue with tourist fans at bigger matches . I think the lower tier behind the goal will have a better atmosphere but those tickets will sell faster as they are released first ( I assume for a match like this they will only open the upper tier when the lower tier gets close to selling out ) , the ones left will probably be for the very front where the view might not be as good . This is mainly speculation , I went last year ( AFC Wimbledon fan ) so it is based off my patchy memory and general experience at football matches , I just thought it might be helpful because you mentioned in another comment you want the 'full experience ' , any seat you get will still be good though , just some slight differences .",Germanic,English

Just keep it as it is , if the station is n't busy enough to have barrier do n't but have inspectors going through the train now and then or have inspectors waiting at a station exit now and then , which should be able to catch most repeat offenders .

Its like when in football , when a team finishes mid table and has nothing to play for at the end of the season , they do usually play worse , as there is no incentive for them to play well . However the manager ca n't go and put their full reserve or u18s team out , they still have to be perceived to be trying their best , especially if their result matters for the other team .",Germanic,English

I personally do n't get frustrated playing against them unless I could 've done something to counter it , definitely less frustrating than some mad RNG because at least the OTK was planned . Although you did n't say this , but I feel like a lot of people want every kind of deck and class to have a counter to everything , which I disagree with . Finally , personally I do enjoy watching people play combo decks in tournaments , I find it fun seeing them try to set up the combo whilst dealing with the threats on board . I 'm not very good at hearthstone , and have only been playing it for a few months .

So if they forced me to play a certain game mode such as 2v2 I would just uninstall the game and go play something else . When I search the only options I put on now are comp 1v1 and instagib ( I had a few more when I was learning the game ) and I would say 60 % of the matches are 1v1 . The matchmaking is the only reason for me playing the game as when I first got the game I would n't want to just randomly go into 1v1 servers and ask for a match . To be honest quick play should be renamed into matchmaking .

What Arsenal did 100 years ago is not something I can be proud of yet it is in many ways different to what MK did . I support Arsenal because I grew up as a fan , my dad took be to my first game when I was 6 years old , I can never support another team as much no matter what they do or did in the past , although if I did n't grow up as a fan I do n't believe I would support Arsenal .

30503,soccer,"Cup competitions and leagues are two totally different formats .

Obviously there is a line that should n't be crossed but a lot of people on this site seem to think it is a lot lower than what it should be , especially when it is not directed at someone if it is them I would totally agree .

I only got the game because I got into watching ESWC 2012 and I wanted to experience competitive myself . Granted I was put into gold nova 1 straight away presumably because I played some other pc fps games and it was before they adjusted the rank system .

If I want to play deathmatch I 'll find a community server that is better ( eg 128 tick , more players , ffa ) and if I want to play gun game I 'll find a community server because the update to the official gun game made it awful to play . And demolition can be fun to play the odd game I guess but it gets boring very fast . This is just my opinion , however you ca n't deny the fact that 90 % of players play this game for competitive . Also I still have n't made my mind up on whether I like the recent update or not , I am for the time being at least playing devils advocate .",Germanic,English

30503,GlobalOffensive,"I was thinking more of the 2v2 and said the comment tongue in cheek . Although an official with ranks and shit 1v1 would be nice , I do know about the arena servers , which I do go on occasionally . The arena servers are more for practise whilst an official matchmaking system would be for more competitive 1v1 games as you are only playing against 1 person not a bunch of different people each round .",Germanic,English

30503,Gunners,Third keepers are usually u19/u21s players or are coming very close to retirement and are good people to keep around the club ( e.g . good personality/possibly future coach ) so I would say having an out and out third keeper does n't really exist .

I would also argue your point that they deserve the tickets more because they are prepared to pay more . Whilst this is probably true in a business standpoint , in theory they deserve the ticket just as much as any one else or some ( myself included ) will argue that the true fans that support the team week in , week out ( not saying you have to go to every game ) deserve the tickets more than someone who is prepared to pay more for a one of trip to the stadium .",Germanic,English

30503,Gunners,"For me it is definitely Chelsea . As I am quite young , and South West London is full of Chelsea fans ( many of which I tend to believe are just glory hunters/started supporting them as they grew up with them doing well ) . That along with many other reason , mainly being how they are anti football in many ways . I just wish , we had more anti Chelsea chants .",Germanic,English

However I do it all the time if I have nothing better to do . As I am a big arsenal fan I try to watch as much of their games as possible , but sometimes I would rather go to a game instead due to the game not being on sky ( I do n't have sky but my point still stands as I find getting reliable streams for 3pm games harder ) . For example this weekend when Arsenal are away to Newcastle , a game I wo n't be able to go to and it 's a 3 o'clock game so it 's not on Sky , I am going to go to the Wimbledon V Pompey game . As I am casual fan of them and go to them when I ca n't watch Arsenal play .",Germanic,English

30503,Gunners,"Yes they obviously do n't hate football , but wth a game as big as this 1/3 of the ground should n't be filled with neutrals . In my opinion at least 95 % of the tickets should be going to fans as this is definitely Reading 's biggest game of the season and it 's one of our biggest games of the season . None of this bollocks where a large chunk of the tickets go to rich people who have a bit of money and think of it a day out , and do n't care passionately about either team .",Germanic,English

30503,soccer,"I disagree I say keep replays , although its good that they got rid of them for the finals . The reason I say this is because it makes the competition more unique in my opinion . You say it 's an outdated system , well it 's the oldest football competition in the world . The traditions and format of the cup should be kept as it makes it more interesting , even if it is arguebly archaic .",Germanic,English

Finally it is something to do on the weekend if arsenal are n't playing at home at 3pm . Edit : I forgot to mention one of the main reasons why I like them is that I hate MK passionately , so I like them because I hate their rivals . What MK did has no place in English football or football in general so thats why I hate them so much ( I hate Chelsea more though ) ,",Germanic,English

30503,AskReddit,"What 's the point of spoiling the ballot paper , as it does literally nothing , they do n't bother looking at them nor counting them , so why should you bother wasting your time . Of course everyone cares about their future but many simply do n't care who is in power as it does n't affect them , they ca n't be arsed to look into the parties polices or they believe the only parties that can get in are the same or do n't affect . They also might not have a strong preference as they may agree with both the main parties or not care about them so they do n't want a vote of someone who does n't care to be counted .

By any chance do you know where I can find out how many papers were spoilt ?",Germanic,English
30503,AskReddit,"Thanks for that cause it slightly changes my view on spoiling the paper . However I do believe it is possible not to care . I do care , but I will use my dad as an example who I am sure will not be voting or if he does it is will be to annoy my mum . He does n't care as he thinks the main three parties are all the same and none of their policies will affect him in any major way , he just likes to get on with his life and not bother looking into politics because it is unlikely to affect his life drastically . If it looked like an extremist party was able to get into power then yes he probably would vote to stop that .",Germanic,English
30503,AskReddit,"Put it this way , I see your point and I understand it , but I disagree as I know nothing could persuade him to think differently , his vote counts but he does n't care about it/does n't want his lack of an opinion to count .

30503,soccer,"Your second point is why I disagree with video technology in most situations , like if the ref did n't call the penalty , the game carries on and anything can happen , and what if the call is made that it was n't a penalty . What do you do there , give the ball to the other team ? Well chances are they just missed the chance for a good counter attack .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"Often times teams try to take a quick set piece and are not stopped , so that line of thought is wrong . However I do agree with some of your other points on if the game has already stopped then use it , however it would have to be implemented correctly in that case as I see a lot of room for error , by making things drag out much longer and needed . And there is another issue of teams possibly forcing the video decision to be made by deliberately stopping the play . This does already happen to some extent and it is not always bad however in many cases I think it can be , although that 's a complicated one .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"I see your point , however the ref would be more inclined to call a penalty knowing that it can be reviewed after . Then what happens if it turns out not to be a penalty . Like a said in me previous comment there is a high chance that the other team could 've had a counter attack when instead they will just have a free kick which is a much slower build up than a possible quick counter . Or what if the team the penalty was called for but in the end disallowed , what if they were still in possession of the ball and ended up getting a corner or something . As it stands now refs do n't play advantage in the box , so if that does n't change then we could have an issue of the attacking team losing possession due to the ref incorrectly calling a penalty .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"I sort of agree with you . Especially for checking if a goal was offside or not , however as the other person who replied to you said it would n't work for checking penalty calls . I am not against using technology to make calls , however I believe it has to be done correct and not affect the games flow in anyway what so ever . Goal line technology is a good example of this .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"I agree with your reasoning , however if that is the case , I can easily see refs being more harsh with penalty calls as they know it can be reviewed . Then if that 's the case more issues are caused , I explained in more detail why in another of my comments if you are interested in seeing why .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"I have to agree with everything you said there , especially the bit about many calls being subjective .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"I agree with there being less diving . So it becomes a debate of would you rather have more stoppages and disrupt the flow in some situations or less diving and more correct decisions ( sometimes there is never a correct decision ) . Anyway I do n't really feel like debating that right now But I think your other point is interesting as a trial would be needed , but would lower league clubs be able to afford it ?",Germanic,English

30503,technology,"I think your analogy is valid and creates a good point . However I still think the context is a bit different as what you are suggesting sounds a bit more personal , and I do n't think the reddit admins really care about what one bloke who does n't know what he is talking about opinion on the situation is . Maybe I got my other comment wrong and he was chatting bollocks , I do n't know . But I just think his point was n't too outrageous and did n't need a snarky comment in return . Although I do agree from a constructive point for the reddit admins his comment was a bit useless .",Germanic,English
30503,soccer,"Sounds like you have never watched a match before and you just believe what non football fans say about controversial decisions in football . If you do n't mind so I do n't have to copy something out again go onto my profile , control f penalty and read what I have said , maybe read the context for a better idea what I was referring to . Also many penalty calls are subjective so a video ref wo n't work , my other arguements are in other comments I have recently posted .",Germanic,English
30503,GlobalOffensive,I liked it before when there was an option to mute the other team . Why should normal people have to adept to those that whinge and ca n't type a command in ? I also liked it because it made the games more interesting if you know what the other team are like personally . For example if the team acted like complete arses I would be more motivated to play well against them and form a temporary rivalry . On the other hand if the other team are quite nice and we had a good conversation then I find the game more enjoyable and you respect the opponent more . Either way I see a benefit . I just think the game is a bit more bland now . PS you may find this a bit cuntish bit I did enjoy playing the following in warm up now and then .

6007,guns,"I do n't think the question you should necessarily be wrestling with is whether or not you should have carried that night , the question you should be asking yourself is , given appropriate justification , are you will to end the life of another person in defense of your own ? Simple enough question , but probably not so simple to answer . If you are , then carry as you see fit . If you are n't , do n't . I would n't worry about the consequences of what happens after , either . If you end up having to take another person 's life in self defense , whatever legal troubles come afterward are a far sight better than being dead , I 'd say . You can think about all the what-ifs you like , but you ca n't ever reasonably know that the person on the other end of the barrel is n't going to pull the trigger . Even if he had calmly stated , `` I 'm carrying a concealed weapon and I 'm about to draw it and aim it at you , menacingly , but I do n't intend to shoot you , '' you still could n't be reasonably sure he did n't intend to shoot you anyway . Regardless of your answer to the question I posed , you 'd be better served learning how to deescalate situations like that in the future . Your intuition lead you to believe this man was going to be a threat based on his demeanor , so getting defensive and telling him to get off of the property was n't the best way to handle that situation . Apologizing for upsetting him ( regardless of whether you were at fault ) and asking how you could help in a calm and courteous manner would have been better . If he is n't capable of being reasoned with , then you 'd just end up in the same situation anyway , but at the very least you gave him the opportunity to calm down . Deescalation is your best defense in these situations , whether the aggressor is armed or not . The firearm is always the last resort .",Germanic,English

The former is nice because they ca n't run , but then their gunner is fine and it typically results in a OHK on me for my troubles .

6007,Warthunder,"For a point of reference , take a look at the last stat on the before/after . Notice how before it 's 100/100 and a stat that Expert/Ace has no bearing on ? ( no green +30 like others ) . Right now , that stat is maxed out . Now on the after , the star converted amount is 5 stars +3 . Ace gives additional +2 . So the max for any stat is now 10/10 ( vs. 100/100 or 50/50 , etc. ) . So what was a max stat , is now only 80 % ( 5+3/10 ) . In order to get the last 20 % ( which was already earned ) a player is going to need to pay for it , or spend an incredible amount of time earning it . So best case scenario , Gaijin is devaluing the time users have spent maxing out stats by forcing you to spend even MORE time grinding them back to where they were .

6007,Warthunder,"As frustrating as bombers are to take down , proper interception tactics would ease a lot of it . What I witness in SB matches , and what I admittedly do myself , is not take the necessary time to setup proper intercepts . So you get these lazy attacks where you 're relative speed is hardly any faster , or you 're just coming right up behind them , and just sitting in their gun sights . Getting shot down this way is proper . You fly poorly , you perform poorly . That said , there should be a couple of changes that could be made to SB bombers to make them less gamey . One is to require manual inputs to the bomb sight for altitude and speed , no more automatic computing . You should n't be able to jink in your B-17 to dodge a fighter , then level off and 5 seconds later drop bombs with pinpoint precision . Bombers should need to commit more wholly to the bomb run . I get that the bomber and pilot are two separate people , and conceivably they could do these things simultaneously IRL , but this is a reasonable balancing move . The other , and probably harder to code , change should be that AI does not shoot while within clouds . I understand why bombers choose to fly in clouds , but you should n't get to take advantage of not being seen , while simultaneously reaping the benefits of being able to `` see '' the enemy on account of your AI . Especially when it only take a few well places bullets to set a fighter alight and end their mission .",Germanic,English
6007,Warthunder,"That 's a fair point . I mostly play in Tier IV where a spaded German fighter has the ability to get up and intercept in time . I imagine this is a harder thing to accomplish in Tier III or below . I do n't think there 's going to be any magic bullet with the way the game is setup right now . You can increase HP of targets to force bombers to loiter longer , but then that puts nations like Germany and the Soviet Union at a disadvantage with their lower bomb loads . You could make the maps bigger , to provide more time for intercept , but then it becomes impossible to patrol the whole front line . I honestly wish there was side-wide voice chat in SB . Coordinated attacks on bombers would do wonders ...",Germanic,English

6007,AskReddit,Did you dab ?,Germanic,English
6007,Warthunder,"There 's the old saying , `` Speed is life and altitude is life insurance . '' This applies to the SB game mode most of all . On maps where it 's not low overcast , you 'll want to climb up to at least 3km , preferably 4km . That way you can dive in on people and have enough speed to break away and you also reduce the chances of getting bounced , yourself . Another piece of advice I have is to not over commit to an enemy . You may get so excited chasing someone down who you have the advantage on that you spend too much time trying to finish the job . Gunnery is much more difficult locked inside a cockpit , so until you 're more proficient , just make one pass and then break away . If it 's 3 on 1 or something , though , then go hog wild . Finally , check your six and check it often . Really , until you 're fully engaged , there 's no such thing as checking your six too often .",Germanic,English

Once you 're engaged in combat , you 'll want to neutralize everything . The exception to that is during diving attacks where having negative elevator trim is very helpful in relieving stick pressure as you make a pass . Zoom - I just set this to a button with min and max values , not on axis . I tried binding it to a slider axis ( X45 ) and it never behaved the way I wanted it to . I 've never been in a situation where I 've thought an intermediate level of zoom would have been preferential to either being zoomed fully in or out , so I 'd just use buttons for the min/max . Throttle inversion - There should be an option within the settings of the axis to invert the input . That said , I want to say that the axis binds its direction based on the initial input .

6007,Warthunder,"[ AB ] I thoroughly enjoy using the D-13 in Arcade . It climbs like it 's never heard of gravity , has plenty of maneuverability , and the 3 mg151/20s make for a decent firepower package whether you 're up against fighters or bombers . It gets sluggish in turn speed at lower speeds ( as with most late war German birds ) , but the roll rate helps give you options . Acceleration is good and it has enough dive performance to keep up with most of what you come against . [ SB ] Absolutely my favorite plane to use so far , no question . I have n't unlocked the D-9 or D-12 , which I 'm betting will be similar , but as compared to everything leading up to it in the German tree , just fantastic . That giant Jumo 213 engine really lets you dictate the terms your fights . Its firepower in SB is more than adequate . My favorite quality , shared among all the FW series , is the visibility . I have n't flown other nations ' aircraft of similar tier to compare , but it 's a stark contrast to the very limited FOV one gets in a 109 cockpit . The only thing I do n't trust it for in SB is energy fighting on the deck . It can hold its own against most enemies for a few turns , but it quickly sheds its energy and you have to be very conscious of your maneuvers to not get taken down . I also echo Maxrdt 's concerns over its quickness to overheat . You tend to get enough time to WEP climb to target and engage for a few passes before the Orange temps arrive . I find myself having to disengage in extended fights to cool the engine as you really need to be running throttle at 100 % when you 're in the fight . You definitely have to be careful when in extended fights to keep your engine temps low enough so you 've time to cut and run if you find yourself at a disadvantage . Overall I 'm very pleased with the Fw-190 D-13 and feel my money was well spent .",Germanic,English

A first person perspective is honestly what 's needed , even if it 's just a little hash mark in the center of the screen . Bombers need an air start . A delayed spawn is a good idea ( from another comment ) and so is spawning further behind the lines . The maps are just too small and even the super props ca n't get to altitude in time to stop the B-29 horde that is anything vs. America . If the defenders had enough time to climb and get a modest altitude advantage before the bombers could get to the first targets , I feel like that alone would improve the gameplay significantly .",Germanic,English

B-17s and B-24s are n't so bad , but 2 B-29s with the default bomb load can completely bomb out the bases and airfield in one run . On the flip side , when you 're flying American , you 're usually at a 2-1 or worse Fighter v. Fighter disadvantage , so if your bombers ca n't get the job done taking out the targets you 're going to lose by virtue of being outnumbered .
