Alithinos,AskHistorians,"I think it is important to have in mind that in the few records we have for the war , most of them are describing it in a more philosophical or religious way , as a kind of a parable . Instead of presenting one side as good and the other as evil , both parties are presented as equally human , driven by their passions , and merely pawns of Gods and Goddesses on a grand chess board .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pagan,"Depends on its manufacture date . People started associating all symbols that even barely resemble Swastikas as symbols of Nationalism . The fact that some neonazis often use such symbols because of their resemblance to the nazi ones , since the nazi symbols are banned or just generally offensive in most places of the world , makes even more symbols tainted . But in most cases the original meanings of such symbols does n't have to do anything with racism and nationalism . And pagans or people who like tradition , often get blamed for being fascists by ignorant people .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,religion,"If you do some research in ancient myths of the people of the Mediterranean Sea , you will discover that they share common stories about large flood ( s ) . It is generally believed that myths are stories that trying to explain some true facts , that get distorted as people try to explain the facts with various imagiEnglish theories . The Greeks for example believed that there was not just one , but 3 huge floods . The Egyptians believed on even more floods . Scientists have tried to find the truth if any behind these ancient stories of destruction by ancient people of the Mediterranean Sea , and came up with quite interesting results . They essentially acknowledged that some huge floods indeed happened in the area . But it 's not that simple . One of the huge floods happened when the natural wall that existed where today is Gibraltar that separated the Mediterranean with the Atlantic Ocean was destroyed possibly by an earthquake , that lead to a HUGE mass of water from the Atlantic instantly flow on the Mediterranean , that raised the Mediterranean Sea 's surface level several meters or yards above what it had been , probably drowning a huge percentage of the ancient Mediterranean People . What today is known as the Mediterranean Sea , was n't always a Sea.It became a Sea violently in a huge event of cataclysmic proportions.The problem with this event however , is that according to science it happened in an age so old that according to history humans were too primeval and uncivilized to record it . The second huge event of cataclysmic proportions was the eruption of the Thera mountain - volcano , the most powerful volcano eruption recorded in human history . Its blast was so hard and huge that its ashes traveled all around Earth , with scientist recovering ash samples from places like Iceland and the Americas , that are dated at the age the volcano erupted . The event was in orders of magnitude more powerful than the earthquakes that caused the tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia in 2011 and 2004 . The tsunami of Thera would have been gigantic , and ancient accounts say that it was responsible for the extinction of various Mediterranean civilizations , including the Minoans . This event took place somewhere between 1700 and 1600 B.C . It is probable that the story of the Bible regarding a huge flood is based on real events . Perhaps the real event was mixed with elements modern science calls 'supernatural ' , which are part of the religion , and there is also that theory that not everything the Bible says has a literal meaning , but instead that some stories are allegories / parables .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,Archaeology,"Well I 'm Greek and this inscription is some ancient form of the Greek language , so I can understand the meaning of SOME of these words .

Here is the rough literal translation of what I make of the text , with each line corresponding to each line in the original inscription , with the words inside quotes being my comments .

Alithinos,religion,"If you are interested in learning more about it , please hear my advice : Do not trust random people on the internet about it . Because many distort things and present them in a different and wrong way . The best thing you could do to learn what Platonism is about , is go directly to the source , Plato , and read some of the books he wrote . But because Plato speaks with allegories / parables , you could read some of the Commentaries written by Proclus on Plato 's theology , to help you understand some things that are hard to understand the first time you read Plato 's book.My personal recommendation is to start with Plato 's book that has the title 'Timaeus ' . Plato wrote about many different things , not only theology and religious stuff . If you are interested in learning more , then I think this book will get you hooked and wanting to learn more ! It is a book that you could say is somehow equivalent to the Christian and Jewish 'Genesis ' , in the sense that it is about explaining how the Universe came to be , the spirits , souls , humans etc . Even if you do n't end up believing what it says , you will certainly learn and have evidence for some quite interesting truths like these : # There was the belief that the world originated from a single superior entity in the 'wester world ' and Greece in specific , at least 5 centuries before the birth of Jesus . # The ancient Greeks / Romans did n't worshipped statues or other idols as for some reason documentaries and even some school books say . # Plato writes that the matter of the Universe was originallly and in the beggining all concentrated in a single 'place ' and consisted of a full piece , and that later on , with the intervention of the Creator this piece of matter was split to smaller pieces and was stretched on Space creating the Universe with its galaxies , solar systems , planets etc . If you think about it , that is exactly what modern science says , except they drop of the `` Creator intervention '' part . Science says that in the beggining the matter of our Universe was united and consisted of a single piece , and that the 'Big Bang ' happened at some point that split the matter of the whole piece to many pieces , forming our Universe . Quite an interesting parallel , do n't you think ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,tellusofyourgods,"Answer me two things if you are in the mood 1 : since a spirit is in everything , and since a spirit is not a person and has no body , how can a spirit be male and another female ? Is n't it wrong to ascribe traits of physical mortal beings in non-physical , non-mortal ones ? 2 : Is the evil spirit the cause of evil in the human world , and if so , then how exactly ? Does it try to make people do evil with its intention , or does evil somehow emanates from this spirit and thus the emanation affects some people who become evil , meaning that the dark spirit is n't really trying to make people do evil but does so because of its nature ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I myself am a `` Hellenist '' following the theology of Plato and his successors such as Proclus , Plotinus etc . There are lots of this unfortunately misrepresented and misunderstood , and thus I ca n't write everything and with enough details , but I can give a short description about a few of the most important and popular misconceptions . # 1 We do not worship statues , or think that a god resides in them . The story of the statues is that at some point these magnificent beings called 'gods ' incarnated on the physical world , and we build 3d representations of them in order to remember how they looked like . The statues in the Grecoroman world act as reminders of how the entities looked like when they showed themselves to us , and not as objects to be worshipped . # 2 We do not sacrifice humans , neither it was done in the past , as the Christian Church lies about our religion . Truth is that if you kill someone , no matter the context , then you are commiting Hubris , and Hubris is something the gods punish humans for doing it . # 3 The beings called 'gods ' are not supposed to literaly live in Palaces in the actual mountain Olympus . They are spiritual beings and they do n't `` live '' somewhere , they instead `` exist '' everywhere . # 4 We believe that in the beggining there was only One , single deity , that was responsible for the creation of the world . We call this deity `` The One '' , and is superior to all the 'Olympian ' gods and other deities and beings . # 5 As a Platonist I do n't think that the world of matter is bad and evil as some say , confusing Platonism with Gnosticism . I believe that the One decided to build the Universe because of love and benevolance , and thus made Universe being Good , and Beautiful . The misconception comes from the fact that we believe that the 'world ' or 'realm ' where the One , the gods , and the human Souls go after death is Superior than the world of matter . But that does n't mean that the world of matter is evil on its own . # 6 We do n't think that 'Evil ' exists on its own and is its own thing , or that there is a primordial 'Evil ' entity that causes evil to the world of humans . We instead believe that Good and Evil is like Light and Darkness , literaly . That means that as Darkness itself is n't a THING , but a state , which is the state of Light not being present , thus Evil is n't its own thing , but the state of Good not being present . # 7 We do n't take all the myths as literal stories . But they have meanings to be interpreted , like allegories or parables . For example Orpheus said that the Universe was born out of the 'Cosmic Egg ' . That 'egg ' is n't to be thought as an ordinary chicken 's egg , but as a sphere that out of it the Universe came out . With modern scientific knowledge , we could say ( Personally I 'm convinced ) that this 'Egg ' was the single body that all of the matter of the Universe was part of , before the Big Bang . Science tells us that in the beggining all the matter of the Universe consisted of a single object , and that because of an explosion that single object broke to several pieces , and its pieces became stars , planets , comets etc.So the metaphorical 'egg ' Orpheus wrote about , was the initial single piece of matter that exist in our universe , that birthed the Universe . That was just a single interpretation of one part of the myths . By doing the same thing , one can find many parallels with science , and thus the myths , if interpreted correctly , do make sense .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"It does , because in the end no matter what is the content of the beliefs , a religion is a set of beliefs . A number of ideas sticked together . And if we were to force people to not be free to think and believe what they want , then that would be fascism . And if a fascist state started by doing that , and discriminated thoughts , who is to say what other thoughts would get discriminated and banned later on ? In a world of equality , freedom and democracy , citizens are allowed to believe whatever they want - what they are not allowed is to do actions that harm other people or the state . Now if people have some need , or many needs , which are expressed through a religion and its practice , then yes , religions still have a place in our society .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,I mean the first being that existed . There are more than one Deities involved in this beilief . To be more specific I refer to what is commonly known as `` The One '' .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Hm . Perhaps . From what I know the belief is that in the begining there was `` The One '' , that spun a lesser child . The `` One '' addressed the child to build a world , but for bad reasons . So supposedly the One made this world to be an evil prison , but then the 'child ' went against `` The One '' , and promised humans to build a better world than the one it made as instructed by the One , so from the few things I know , they think that the 'child ' of One is good , and that the One is evil . That 's what Plotinus says they believe , and I 'd like to hear a Gnostic 's own comment on that . Plotinus was against this belief , because he said that what Gnostics understand as `` child '' of the One , is n't really a seperate entity than the One , but a part of the One , and that the One built the world we live in , because He is good and benevolant and loves us .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"From what I understand , Gnosticism takes beliefs and concepts of both Judaism and the ancient Greek pagan religion , and mixes them , telling its own story that is neither Greek paganism or Judaism . I do n't know if they accept Jesus in some fashion or not .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,I do n't really know . There might be .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"First let me tell you about the Greek word that in English is translated as 'Gods ' . It is the word `` θεοί '' ( theoi ) , and it derives from a verb that means `` I move fast '' . Thus literally the word that in English is translated as `` God '' , in Greek means `` fast mover '' . The One was the first being that created everything , and the most perfect . The 'Gods ' are different entities from the One , that the One created , with their own free choice and intellect . They are spiritual in their original form , but have the power to 'appear ' in the world of matter . The 'Fastmovers ' or 'Gods ' were given by the One the mission , to build the body of humans , and then the One gave their bodies Souls . Each 'God ' is responsible for something in our Universe , and controls some force , or way , or natural phenomenon , and as a whole 'Gods ' are to make sure that the Universe works the way the One wants it to work . They are not 'avatars ' of the One , like Krishna is an avatar and incarnation of Vishnu in Hinduism . Neither they fully resemble the 'Angels ' ( Malakim ) of Judaism , but one could draw some parallels between them and the ( Elohim ) , the way they are portrayed in the Book of Enoch . According to Enoch `` Elohim '' is not a way to call the One God in plural form , but they are many , and are seperate from God . Enoch writes that these where 'Servants of God ' with fiery bodies , that took material form at some point . Our 'Gods ' also are said to have done things like these . So you could see Zeus , Hera and the rest more as a parallel to 'Elohim ' , being entities made by God , who have missions and also free will , than trying to parallelize them , with God.Of course , at least the Christians as far as I know , do n't believe that what Enoch writes on his book is true , and believe that Elohim does n't exist as seperate beings from God , and that the word is plural out of respect .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I did n't chose the font myself , reddit picked it automatically , or I did it by accident . 1 ) As for the accusations , I have n't read that on a historical account of old , but I 'll you what . It is quite usual in Greek TV , for shows to have debates between people from different religions . Christians , Pagans , Muslims , Gnostics , whatever . It is a usual thing Christians say on TV against 'pagans ' that `` you sacrificed people ! `` , perhaps forgetting the crusades , inquisition etc . But the wild accusations are not a modern thing . They started some time after the Roman Empire announced Chirstianity as its official religion . Being the official religion of Rome , meant that the religion would be formed as a public service , and would be controlled by the State , and would be part of the State , and the priests would be public servants , paid large salaries from the State , and take part in politics . Since Constantine Rome turned to a Christian theocracy . Many priests got corrupted by the wealth and power , and started seeing believers as cash machines , instead of people to be served . As a result they saw non-Christians as dangerous people , who were bad for business , and they first started discriminating and preaching against non-Christian people , and at some point they decided to act a 'Final Solution ' against non-Christians . Especially during the reign of Emperor Theodosius , the priests fanatized their believers with lies , to drive them in a pogrom against non-Christians , and thousands of non-Christians were murdered , and is also the point of history where most of the ancient temples of Greece and Italy got ruined . The majority of the ruined pagan temples in these countries were n't ruined by natural disasters or so , but by religiously fanatic riots . 2 ) I mean the 'spiritual realm ' . It is a state of existence and being that we ca n't grasp with our body 's senses . Something like the 'Paradise'.But note that as Paradise is mostly portrayed , its a place where humans will be with physical bodies . We do n't believe that there will be bodies . But that there , will be our souls , and that a soul can be split from the physical body .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,ELINT,"While today I believe on something , there had been a time that I was n't a believer . I was born and raised a Christian . Unlike most Christians , who just say they are Christians and perhaps follow some festivals , I decided to read the bible . What I discovered was that the bible has so many contradictions that it could n't been taken seriously . The Old Testament contradicts the New Testament , the gospels of the New Testament contradict each other , and what I 've been promised from Christianity was n't happening . I was promised the power to move mountains if I believed in it , and I could n't . I was promised that if I prayed God would do me the favor I 'd ask , and God did n't did anything . Another thing I disliked was that I realised that among many 'priests ' there were people who secretly did n't even believed the religion , and just became priests because priests are paid good salaries . Religion has been hijacked by wealth lovers . People are doing and preaching things without believing on them , but for money and fame . That disgusted me and sent me away from the Church . While I have sympathy for Jesus , and I 'm sorry for what happened to him , and I consider him a good person , those who after his death claimed to be the teachers of his word , were corrupted and distorted things for their personal interests . So I stopped going to the church and considering myself a 'Christian ' , because if I called myself with that name , I would place myself along with all the others who have been doing such and such things , and I would be embarassed for that . On my journey to the truth , I read a few things about Islam , your religion . Please excuse me for what I am about to say , but to me it seems that Mohamed was just a man with thirst for power who presented himself as a prophet , only to convince other people join his battle , so he can win the wars , and gain personal wealth and fame . I 've read about Buddism , and while many of the things it says seem nice to me and good , I think it lacks many things , and leaves many things ananswered . I 've took a look on Hinduism , and I was alienated and scared by the images of some deities they have . Then I started reading about the ancient religions with the many gods . Greek , Persian , Arabic , Chaldean , Egyptian ... And I felt that they had more to tell me . Particularly the Chaldean and Greek . Today most books in schools and even documentaries on TV give a rather simplistic view on these religions and often lie about them , to make them look bad . But if one starts read about them from ancient sources , I believe he will get a better and more clear view that will surprise him . It is as if you always believed something inside you , you always had an idea or feeling or concept of how something is , but it was n't what the religion you 've been grown with was . And that made you feel that you are somehow 'wrong ' , and deviate , that you are not a good human because you have something inside you telling you what is good , and what the people around you tell you is that this is your mistake . And perhaps you might believe you are mistaken . You might believe what they tell you , that even if you follow the strictest code of the religion , you are still bad because something inside you does n't fit what the religion you are grown up with says , so that makes you personally feel bad , as if you are a bad person . But what happens if by chance or out of curiosity you pick one of the ancient books , that modern people say are myths and lies , and you discover in them that they talk about the exact same thing that you somehow knew and believed secretly with your thoughts , the same thing the others told you that is a mistake you done ? Then you start seeing why they 've been telling what they are telling , and how our world became what it is . Because lets speak the truth : Both Christianity and Islam were spread with the sword . Christianity had Constantine , and Theodosius and others doing wars , killing people , and forcing christianity , through the Roman Empires . Islam had Mohammed and Mehmed 2 ' spreading Islam with swords through the Arabic and Ottoman Empires . Call me however you want , but in my opinion I think that a God who is trying to get worshipped by killing whoever is not worshipping him , and starts wars , and tells his children to kill each other is n't a good and just God . The God I believe in is a God that if you worship him it will make him happy , but if you do n't , then he wo n't care . Not because he does n't care for humans , but because he has too many and far more serious and important things to care for . Have a nice day .",Greek,Greek

If for the Big Bang to happen there where like 1 in a billion chances , and out of it for our solar system to shape the way it is , with a Sun no having more mass so as to absorb all the planets or not so small to let all the other planets fly away , there was again 1 in a billionth chances , and for the Earth to have the right mass to not let the atmosphere leave , but not so much to not allow the birth of humans and other species , and being in the right distance from the Sun , so its not so close and hot to not allow life , or so far and cold , there where another 1 chance in a billion , then the collective instances where `` it just randomly happened '' for everything to happen the way it happened , are way to many , to the point that if these chances where true in a lottery game , you would call it fixed .

They see that their governments are corrupted and favor the banks instead of their people , and instead of blaming their governments and Bankers , they blame Jews .

Perhaps a certain number of big banks belong to Jewish people , but that does n't mean that the average Jew is an owner of a bank , or that the banks that are ran by Jews are giving away money for free to Jewish people . I know Jewish people who are poor , and none of them gets any 'payment ' from some bank just because he is a Jew . Banks are not social services that take money from the rest to hand them over to agerave Jewish people . Banks are private businesses that only care to grow and does n't take in to account things such as nationalities , or religions etc , they just want to make more money . Yet the foolish man attributes the doings of a few elite ultra-rich men to a whole nation , instead of condemning the rich men themselves . As if to say that because Germans once had Hitler , all Germans ever are nazis . That is n't true . And the exact same way it is n't true that all Jews are bankers . But there are stupid people in our world who ca n't understand that because a single person of a nation or religion is bad , does n't mean that the whole nation or religion is bad . As Einstein said `` The Universe has its boundaries , but human stupidity does n't '' . I think Jews should speak up .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Ahh ... I often take a look at some sites that have lists of ancient celebrations , and if one is close to the day I look , I write it a note about it . Mostly , these are celebrations of ancient Athens . I myself live in modern day Athens . If there is a special day about a deity , perhaps I might do something . For example , at the 7th of Boedromion ( 15th of September ) ancient Athenians celebrated Artemis.At that day I visited the area where the ancient temple of Artemis Agrotera is located . Unfortunately I could n't get at the temple itself because the area is barred . ( the government is not willing to pay security guards for it , but neither it wants people to get near because they fear of antiquity stealers , so they just block the way to everybody ) But that also meant that there would n't be tourists or other visitors . So I went close , and some ancient sculpted rocks where approachable . It would be more ideal if I were sacrifing some animal , but I only had some fruits . So I went there and placed them upon the rocks . Then I took out of my pocket a notepad that I had written the Orphic hymn to Artemis there . So I sung the hymn . Some guy was passing by at that time and looked at me with a strange look.Then I made a libation with some water . I felt something inside me . My mind got some images out of nowhere . I saw that the archeologists in Amphipolis discovered a treasure with gold artifacts and others . That what archeologists are digging in Amphipolis is n't a tomb - grave to a dead person , but rather another temple to Artemis . Since that day I 've been curious to see what they will find as they keep digging deeper into the hill . I 've been following the news with anxiety .

The first thing that seemed to me closer to how I felt inside me about God , was closer to the believes of Quakers , than that of the Orthodox Christianity , which I grown with .

The reason I started believing in this theology is because several years after I had envisioned a very 'weird ' dream , I read about the Neoplatonic beliefs , and I had this weird feeling of surprize one feels , when he reads in a book a very detailed analysis of things and concepts he saw in his own dream . Perhaps if I knew what the theology of Plato and his successors before seeing what I thought was a 'dream ' , I would believe that it was just my own imagination , my brain playing me tricks . But seeing what I saw before even knowing that Neo-platonism existed , and discovering about 10 years later that what I had seen was supposedly a beafitic vision that many other people had seen too in the antiquity and wrote books about it , made me invest time in studying the theology started by Plato , and much to my surprize , it seems to make sense . In the believes of Platonic & amp ; Neoplatonic theology , the Universe and everything in it derived from the One . The One is not a 'god ' like the 'gods ' that go by the names Zeus or Hera , and the One is n't even a 'God ' like that of Christianity , who is depicted as an old guy with a white beard . According to Platonism , the Creator of the Universe was a single being called `` The One '' , that consisted of three parts : Aither ( Divine Essence ) Nous ( Intelligence ) World Soul ( A fiery spiritual substance that is included on everything in the Universe ) According to Platonism , the Soul of a human originates from the World of Souls , also known as `` The Realm of Ideas '' , which is said that The One , and the gods such as Zeus etc , exist on . The Soul falls from Heaven if it wills the pleasures of the material world , and thus it materializes on Earth . Since that , the Soul gets trapped in a long circle of reincarnating in the material world , and to escape the material world and live forever in the Heavens , one would have to live his life ignoring material wealth and pleasures , and excercizing and perfecting the attributes of his or her divine part , the Soul . The Soul is said to appear on visions as a fiery , pulsing energy that carries the Intelligence of an individual person and is what makes the human body 'alive ' . When a human dies and he could n't avoid being dragged on by the material pleasures , then his or her Soul drinks the water of Oblivion , forgets everything , and joins the material world in a new body . If a human dies , and he followed the way of life suggested by the belief system , then his Soul wo n't drink the water of Oblivion , but the water of Memory instead , and will come back to a new body , but will keep all the memories from the last time it lived , and if a human manages to live rightfully for 3 lives , he releases his soul from the trap , and gets to live on Heaven , along with the gods , and the One .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"My first build was with a cheap & amp ; small budget case . It was back before my ascencion when I still had an xbox360 that as a peasant I bought in its first year of release . 3 RRODs later , I was out of warranty and Microsoft would n't fix it for free , and I could n't eat that I would have to buy another one only 2 years after I handed out 400 $ for it . Instead I bought a 150 $ graphics card ( Ati HD 4850 ) for my PC , that was considerably more powerful than an xbox360 . Unfortunately though , the case was so tight it could n't fit the card inside . So I had to buy a new case , and I decided to not cheap out this time . I bought a Coolermaster 690 , that costed 3 times the money of the old case . As I tried to unscrew the components from my old budget case to install them later on the new Coolermaster , guess what happened ? The screws supplied with the case were so soft , that the screwdriver instead of turning them cut its metal , and they were destroyed as they could n't be turned anymore , with my hard drive and optical drives trapped inside ! : O I had to violate the chassis with extremely violent force to break the HDD/optical drive cages , I even cut myself doing it , just to free my components from the budget low-end case . I 'm lucky my components did n't break that day . From that time and on an idea was solidified on my brain : I would never buy a 'budget ' PC case again . Thank God there is Coolermaster . Except from build quality though , there more things one benefits from , from a more expensive / better case . CM690 can take any graphics card I have been interested at , it also had space for the 212 EVO cpu cooler , its tool-free design makes it easier ... It have been supporting of most of the upgrades and new needs I have had since I bought it . The only two things that old ( 2007 ) case do n't have is support for for internal water cooling radiators , and a hole behind the motherboard for easy cpu cooler placement . For 75 $ it was a bargain I think .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"I 've been burnt up by people saying `` games dont use so many cores so buy a cheaper cpu '' . In 2009 everybody would say `` most games dont use more than 2 cores so dont buy a 4core '' and one or two years later it was the standard for games to use 4 cores , so I had to upgrade for a quad core cpu . Before doing so , since I was on AMD 's AM3 motherboard I could have bought the 6-core Phenom II cpu . But I once more made the mistake and followed the instructions from some dudes in the internet saying `` games wo n't use more than 4 cores , do n't buy the 6core '' . Here we are,3 years after they told me to not get a 6core , and Crysis 3 , along with Far Cry and the new Battlefield already can use more cores than that . The point is : Take the beefier and most powerful CPU your money can buy , at any given moment and do n't worry if the games the moment you buy the CPU are not using all of it . They will probably do in 1 to 3 years later .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I believe in the ancient Greek religion , where the world Δαίμων that transliterated makes the English 'Demon ' comes from .

In the center is the God who created the Universe , the First that existed ever . Next to the circle where the One God is , are smaller weaker 'gods ' like Zeus and Hera . At a ring even further from the circle and next to the gods are the Archangels . Further away are the Angels . Even further are Demons.Further are Archons . And in the end , at the most outter ring , are the Souls of Humans . The Soul of a human might 'fall ' from heaven , and come to a child that is to be born , and thus is born on this world . But the Demons are from this Heaven already . That does n't mean they are 'good ' or 'evil ' . It is said that some of them are good , and others are evil . A demon might indirectly makes his presence sensible and communicate with humans in the mortal and material world , but they do n't fully come in their full form or power . They ca n't have a body of their own , so they get in the mind of someone else who has a body . Thats how some people get 'demonized ' . But it is said that the demons do n't get to any person . A virtuous person that is doing good and respects the One and his servant gods , wo n't get touched by demons .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,Archeology,"What makes me wonder is that none of the `` specialists '' who make statements about what this `` tomb '' is , have talked about a clue , as if they are all oblivious to its existence . The book `` Anthologia Graeca '' contains a poem from `` Antipatrus Thessalniceus '' who lived in the 1st century A.D. written for Amphipolis . In this poem he states that during his time Amphipolis is deserted and that nothing has been left standing , other than `` the temple of the Lady of Braurona and Ethopia '' . Meaning that if this poet is to be taken seriously , then what archeologists have found has to be a temple to a goddess . Of course subterranean temples are very unusuall in the Greek world . The only few that are known were the Necromanteia where necromancy took place , and the temple where the Eleusinian Mysteries took place in Eleusina . I just find it weird that there is a perhaps legit historical account about what the building found on Amphipolis might be , and none of the experts seem to know of or consider .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,religion,"What is obvious is that the writter of this article have n't studied enough .

Kronos is said to be a 'child of the Earth ' , meaning a being with a body consisting of matter . Hronos on the other hand is Time itself , said to have existed long before Kronos , or Kronos 's mother Earth , before our Solar System even . Hronos is an abstract personified force of nature , while Kronos is said to have been an actual physical being with intelligence . Aside from that , trying to unite Judaism and the Greek / Roman religion in one , is just ... not right , I believe .

Alithinos,greece,"Pontus eh ? Hmm Pontus is a region situated in what today is Turkey . Greeks of the Ionian tribe colonized the area way back in time , before Alexander the Great . Perhaps you 'd like to hear some Pontic music , or go to a Pontic festival and take part in a traditional feast and dance . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8RaLfQAkzMc https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Myc-5q6edp4 Now modern Greeks are rather 'usual ' people , in that there is n't much uniqueness in our day to day lives , we too take selfies , listen to ridiculous songs that trend etc . And the general economic shape of our country have made us change our habits to an extent , which affects culture . I remember before the crisis , most people would spend their free time outside with friends . Like going to a cafe daily . Going every saturday night a night club and staying outside , getting drunk , until dawn next morning . Now we do n't go outside that much . In general , we 've been focusing on enjoying the simple , little good things in life . Now you may discover , that the Greek people are a complex people . Because at some things I 'd judge us as rather open-minded , while at the same time at some other subjects we are rather conservative . A thing that comes to my mind , comparing USA culture ( at least what I know of it from the media ) and Greek culture , is that in general we do n't get offended as easily as the Americans . From the internet I kind of get the impression that Americans get offended too easily with stuff like jokes for example ( body features related jokes , nationality jokes , religious jokes etc ) . In Greece we do n't take jokes that seriously . Another thing is that I know many people who do n't believe in God , but take part in religious related stuff like baptizing a child , or getting married in a church . For tradition 's shake . And some , agnostic , decide to do so having the mindset of 'just in case ... ' . But generally we are not of those people that go to the church every Sunday . But we celebrate the big festivals like Christmass , Easter , and Holy Mary 's day . Another thing many Greeks do is learning about conspiracy theories . Oh , our people love them . Perhaps you might have heard of Alex Jones or David Icke . Well we got like 5 or so people like them , appearing on small TV channels and making related shows or selling and writing related books . A 'bad ' habit of modern Greeks is to use the names of important people of our history , mostly our ancient ancestors for the shake of bragging about it , while being ignorant about what these ancient people did and said , which made them great in the first place . You might hear somebody saying stuff like `` We have Socrates , we have Pericles , we have Alexander ! We did so many things for the world ! `` , and if you ask him about Socrates , he will know nothing about his life and work . A common viewpoint between Greeks is that all politicians are liers , corrupted , and thieves , and the word 'politician ' has negative energy here , sometimes it can be used as a slur . The Greek does n't vote the party that agrees with , or the party he thinks is the best among the political parties , but the party he believes is the least bad , and will do the least damage of all the others .",Greek,Greek

I 've did some my own research and I discovered that there is n't a single thing such as the one and only `` Ancient Greek Religion '' , but that there is actually a number of religions believed by ancient Greeks , with some of them believing quite different stuff . And if someone does n't know that , that person might get easily confused as it reads incompatible stories and believes that happen to belong to a different ancient Greek religion . It seems most people who are in to Hellenic polytheism today are following the Iliad and the Oddyssey as canon . But there is also another path , like for example Orphism . And Plato takes clues from Orphism and comes up with a heresy , that includes a single `` Creator '' Yahweh style , stating that gods such as Zeus , Hera etc are inferior to the Creator and serve him . And at an ancient Greek book that I read , I found out that the people that the ancient Greeks considered ancients , had yet another religion , in which they only worshipped the Sun - Father , the Earth - Mother , and the Moon . So my question is , do you follow one of those paths specifically , or are you still in the process of learning more ? And why do you think most people that become Hellenists tend to stick to what is the popular of all the different paths , and there are n't as much Orphicists for example , today ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"If you still have beliefs from Christianity that you ca n't let go as you say , because you find that there is some truth in Christianity , but also that it leaves quite many questions unanswered , and you do n't like the church and clerics in particular , and at the same time you have something telling you that there is some truth in Hellenism too , then I believe I can direct you to a number of sources , that will answer some basic questions you may have . Here is what : You probably never knew it , but there is a religion that not only acknowledges that the universe was created by a single all-powerful , ever living , kind , good , God , but also that the gods such as Apollo , Dionysus , Zeus etc also exist . You probably think I 'm kidding you . But I 'm not . The spiritual path I 'm talking about is called Platonism , because well , the first who wrote about this was Plato . A good starter for the spiritual and mystical side of Plato 's works is the book 'Timeaus ' . There is also a series of book written by a later philosopher called 'Proclus ' , which is called `` The theology of Plato '' , and Proclus writes down everything in an extremely detailed fashion . The work of Proclus speaks about the nature of the Creator , the Gods , the Archangels , the Angels , the Demons , the Heroes , and Humans ... For some reason even the existence of that path is being kept secret . Even on theology classes they do n't talk about it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I 'm more inclined to the Orphic viewpoint of death . Orphicism was a less popular religion shared by some Greeks and the Thracians , that went side by side of what I could call `` Popular Hellenism '' . According to Orphicism , there is no such a thing as Tartarus and Elysian fields . Instead , there is only Earth and Heaven . And when you die , your soul transcends to the Heaven , and there it is judged . If you lived life as a good person ( Orphics had some particular ethics ) , you would earn the right to stay on Heaven and exist there . If you were n't a good person , you 'd be sent down on Earth again to live another life in another body , after your intellect was formatted so the memories of the previous life are removed . So basically Orphics believed in reincarnation , and specifically that living a life on the material world is a consequence of the Soul making mistakes . Whenever a child was born , the Orphics would wear black , gather above it and lament , because yet another Soul dropped out of Heaven , and would have to endure the hardships of the material world . And when somebody died , the Orphics would celebrate , because they would hope that the person would go to Heaven and stay there , and thus its punishment on Earth would stop . Way extraordinary views , do n't you think ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Thing is Greeks who believe in Hellenism has a certain kind of viewpoint as ... You have to visit Greece to feel it . Every mountain , river , lake , and sea has its legend / myth . The country is like a big mythology ( Hellenic actually ) theme park . So you go at Acropolis in Athens and you think `` thats were Athena competed with Poseidon for the city '' , you get like 1000 meters away and you pass by Artemis 's temple , which according to legend it was built on the hunting ground of Artemis . The connection to the past comes off as something these people want to do , because they think that today 's world is worse than it used to be . Now Hellenism as a religion is perhaps the most inclusive religion of all . Yes you are welcome if you are Briton . Also if you are African or Asian . And you are also welcome if you are homosexual . Regarding homosexuality specifically Hellenism is the only one that touches it and considers it normal . ( After all its Eros who decides who you will fall in love with , and that explains love for the other sex . ) Here is an example regarding inclusivity of Hellenism : if you read the New Testament of the Christians , and in particular the gospel of Mark , in the original ancient Greek text , then you will find this line : `` Ελληνίδα εξ Συρίας γυνή '' . At english versions it is either translated as `` Greek woman from Syria '' , or `` Gentile Syrian woman '' . The word translated as Greek or Gentile is 'Ελληνίδα ' , and it means female Hellenist . There is a confusion because the name Hellene was used in the same way the name Jew is being used today , both for describing the name of a nation , and also for describing the name of a religion . So , even the Christian gospel proves that Hellenism is inclusive , and you are welcome . Actually , if you think about it , the people that we call 'Greeks ' were different people . I mean they werent initially a nation , but different tribes of people , with different body features and characteristics , and what made them all 'Greeks ' or 'Hellenes ' as Greeks call ourselves , was a ) The Hellenic religion , and B ) The Greek language . I 'm far out of topic now and I 'm sorry , but as the name creates confusion I feel the need to explain what 's in a name , to help people understand better . The word `` Greek '' which with the West calls the people who call each other 'Hellenes ' , originally was the name of only a single tribe of the Hellenic people . In the same fashion , the people of the East calls us 'Yonan , Yunan , Yawan , etc ' which comes out from 'Ionian ' which was yet just a single tribe out of the many . But we do n't still live in tribes ... Anyway , TL : DR ; You are welcome !

Alithinos,Neoplatonism,"While I was teen I had an experience that I would describe back then as a rather alive , awkward , weird dream . So strange I even felt shy of sharing it with others . What I saw in that dream was Henosis . That I died , and I got out of my body as a rumbling light / energy , and I started heading upwards with too fast speed , until I reached a Huge Light , and I became One with it . Since then I 've been reading about religions to find ANYTHING coming even close to describing such an experience . But even though I researched ( did n't had internet when I was teen ) I did n't even met the term Neoplatonism , as it was hidden from everything I read regarding such stuff . Eventually I got over it , and thought that it was just a strange dream with no purpose ... And I continued living life . But at some point I felt an urge to start reading about ancient Greek philosophy . I got a book of Proclus on my hands and ... Well there I was , reading on an ancient book a rather detailed explanation of what I until then thought it was a unique personal experience , and very awkward at that . Yet there was a man that not only had lived the same experience and knew it , but he had also wrote a book about the things 'seen ' in the experience . When I made that realization I felt a unique , never before felt strong feeling . For me Neoplatonism is n't something interesting that I imagine about or wonder if it could be true . For me it is giving a name to what I myself experienced . What I have to say is that it would be better to stick with Plotinus 's suggestion to not deal with rituals and magic . I 've made a mistake . You see as a 'reasonable ' man that I am , I still had doubts , and I thought of clearing them out by experimenting , and to experiment by doing rituals such as invocation .

So to avoid misunderstandings out of people 's ignorance , some pieces of knowledge is better to be passed on on few individuals , who are ready for it . That of course has a negative side , that people again because of their ignorance might assume a variety of things about what 's going on , and often assume negative theories . Now , there isnt a single 'occult ' out there , its a general characteristic term applied to many traditions , of many groups , with different viewpoints , different pieces of information , different ways , etc ... For example where I come from , there is n't some Divine limit in every person to only do a certain thing , get in a certain profession . The Lord may have a mission for a person , but extremely rarely a random person will be given a mission , and even if the Lord gives that person a mission , the person still has the free will to deny . And when the Lord gives a mission , he is pretty clear on what it is to be done . But such missions are n't given easily . And when you are given such a mission , you also get a unique name , by Him , because every single entity that exists has its unique name , which is secret . So if He decides to give you a mission , you will know it .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,FemdomCommunity,"The thing is that as wikipedia and most other websites will tell you , femdom is something that came out of , and is part of , BDSM . And BDSM is about well ... Bondage , Discipline , SadoMasochism . But it 's important to realize that there are men and women out there willing to take on submissive / dominant roles with the woman being the top , without that involving ropes , and pain and other 'harsh ' stuff like that . A thing that I do n't understand is when some websites take it too seriously and say that they want to empower women , and on the other hand they have stuff like dressing men with women 's clothes , and having men penetrated with dildos . I mean if the couple likes such activities , sure go on and have fun ! But how is it empowering women to fuck a man with a plastic penis ? That is attributing power to the penis , something that the woman lacks , so subconsciously that would n't empower a woman , but make her feel less powerful because she does n't have a real one . See ? My love / respect for women goes beyond sexual related activities . So I think things . And I find that many things that are often presented as empowering women , are actually degrading women .",Greek,Greek

More light that gets in the eyes and fatigues them . Second , there are special protective glasses for computer monitor radiation . These are not glasses that make people see if they ca n't see , but glasses that filter an amount of the radiation emmited from monitors , so a less amount reaches the eyes . If someone already wears glasses for myopia or something , he or she can ask the shop who made them to add the computer screen protection layer on them , so the person does n't have to wear two sets of glasses one over the other .

Alithinos,hardware,"Intel has an architecture that makes it so a Intel cpu with the same amount of frequency as an AMD cpu , is faster than the AMD cpu . But AMD added more cores to its cpus . So basically if you have a program that runs on one core , it will run much faster on an Intel Cpu than an AMD cpu with the same frequency . But if a program can use up to 8 cores and you have an 8 core AMD cpu , and on the other hand a 4 core Intel cpu , you might see the AMD cpu being faster . Because while each intel core is slower than an AMD core , if you add up the processing power of 8 slower cores , they might be faster than 4 faster cores , because the performance of all 8 cores pile up .",Greek,Greek

Instead of adding more cores , they only added more integer units . So an 8core FX CPU has 8 integer units , but only 4 float units , and other parts like the decoder etc were left to be as if the processors were 4core , bottlenecking the integer units . 2 ) Intel came up with 3gate , a technology the FX cpus completely missed , and AMD will be going to FinFet at 2016 .

It is from the second world war , and was written when the Greeks were winning against the Axis invader , Italy . The song satirizes the Duce of Italy ( Benito Mussolini ) , who dared to start a war with Greece . The youtube video shows related Greek comics from the same time period . Lyrics literal translation ( by me ) : Duce puts on his uniform and his tall hat with all those wings and in a night with a fullmoon he tries to capture Greece , poor man ! Ohhh ! ! He meets our Tsolias strongmen on the mountains , and his boss the spaggeti-man gets shocked . `` Oh Ciano* , I 'll be driven mad Ciano , who told me to fight against Tsoliases ? '' Ohhh ! He starts the next day , but again he hears 'Aera'* from Tsolias , he runs away through dirt paths and jumps above rivers , he knows how to do it . Ohhh ! He gets bullets like hail , and changes his generals to get the job done , '' Oh Ciano , I 'll be driven mad Ciano , quickly send me black clothes to wear ! '' Ohhh ! The new Napoleon sends divisions of hungry men high up on the mountain . To meet their hell , and our army carries lots of prisoners . Ohhh ! And these poor Centaurs , how terrible , hungry , weakened , they fall in the water . `` Oh Greek , do n't let me see you Greek ! 'cause I 'm on burning coals* . '' Ohhh ! They run like crazy to the rocks , and get kicked out from us and our allies . And without many words , Greek strongmen got on Korytsa* . Ohhh ! Hacki* color got in the SilverCastle* , and a Greek flag is waving now . `` Oh Ciano , I 'll die Ciano ! In a while I will loose Tirana* too ! '' And these poor guys had a big calamity , as Rome now is waiting for its turn* . 1 . Ciano = Another name for Mussolini . 2 . Aera = Greek war cry . 3 .

Italians were retreating back to Albania , and Greeks kept advancing , to free Albania from Italians . 5 . Hacki = the color of the Greek soldier 's uniform . 6 . SilverCastle = Another Albanian town freed by Greeks . 7 . Tirana = Capital city of Albania . Greeks were going to drive Italian soldiers off Albania in general . 8 . Rome is waiting for its turn = After the successes of the Greek army against Italians in Greece and Albania , the Greek morale got high up , and the new plan was for the Greeks to go to Italy and beat the dictator Mussolini to restore democracy in Italy . But before that , Hitler sent backup to defend his allie Mussolini , and thus Germany invaded Greece too . But Germany was too much for Greece , so Greece lost . : (",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"It seems that the oldest sources are oblivious to Medusa having even sex with Poseidon . The oldest source , Hesiod , just says that they were born 'monsters ' . But later on others added details to the story and it is Ovid who explicitly writes of a rape . And it seems that Apollonius who is writing in a 'serious ' style , notices that 'some people say that ... and some other people say that ... ' . So in his writing he makes it clear that at his time there had been conflicting versions of the story . Now was Medusa born a 'monster ' or was she turned to one later on ? If she was turned into a monster and were n't born , was she really a priestess of Athena ? And if she had sex with Poseidon , did she wanted it or not ? I guess these questions ca n't be answered . There are so many conflicts . But if she initially had human looks , then how and why the other Gorgons had monster looks too ? Were they cursed by someone for something too ?

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I had read about these but I do n't remember the answers now . It 's 03:55 at the morning local time and my mind has almost stopped , yet sleep does n't get me . And I have in my library primary sources that answer some of your questions , but I 'm too sleepy to open the books , look for the pages , and translate them ( from original Greek ) to you now . I will probably write you a proper answer tommorow , so I answer to this thread to be able to find it more easily . So I will skip that part , but I can tell you some things now . There is n't a 'Hellenism 101 ' book that I know of . What I personally know , I got to know it through personal research and reading lots of primary sources , ancient books . I have like 20 ancient books in my collection of actual physical books , and I 've read about as much other books online . Regarding a mentor , well there was this practiced thing , at least in the ancient times . More specifically , there were rituals of initiation . Some things were told by a priest-ess and could be talked casualy , other things were only unveiled at mysteries , that the initiates had to pass through long preperations to take part in . Nowdays though because we are too rare , its not unusual for people to go on and do things on their own . Thing is that at least according to my own personal opinion , its really harsh to know all there is to know and fully understand . Even though I 've read as many books as I 've told you , still I feel that there are things I 'm missing , and that I could know lots more . But it would be so much easier and faster for someone to understand by having someone who knows all that stuff and conversating with that person , than reading through thousands of pages . Because its like a large puzzle image , and with each book you kind of get yet another piece of the puzzle . Note that I do n't talk about simple stuff like 'Here is how to make a libation ' or 'Here is how two of you can get married ' . But about stuff like understanding the meaning of various stories that are hidden behind allegories and metaphors , and high metaphysics , etc . So that 's for now . I 'm going to write a comment with some holidays , crystals , invocations etc at some other time , when I will have the time and mind to open books and search for pages and write down to you the details . So goodnight .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"As I said in the previous post , it depends on what you call 'magic ' . What personally I call 'magick ' is the actions a human can do to have a specified effect / result on this world , by means not acceptable through official science , or should I say with the aid of supermundane entity/ies . Yet still its not just 'saying ' as a prayer . There is a number of ways that can work , and usually you invoke some entity following a ritual with an etiquette that besides speaking also includes other actions such as offering something perhaps to the one you invoke and ask something from . But as with every religion , there is a way in Hellenism too to ask things from the superior entity/s . As for a distinction , well the traditional distinction that I know of is between faith and practice . Doing something , like a prayer , an invocation , a libation etc , is different from having a faith and believing it as one is a mental process and the other a physical . There had been one philosoper , Plotinus , who said that believing is enough and there is no need for rituals , but that was just a path of the number of paths . My guess is that modern Hellenists does n't like the word 'magic ' and do n't want to be associated with it , because of the energy it has in our modern world . Because the first thing that comes to someone 's mind when he or she listens 'magic ' is perhaps Harry Potter , or something similar , and well , actual 'magic ' the way I mean it , is nothing like that . Aside from that , Hellenism is very sensitive when it comes to things the Christians consider 'bad ' . I mean there had been pogroms and genocides during the Roman times of Hellenists , and Hellenists were persecuted by Christians kind of how Islamic State persecutes non-Islamists today in the Middle East . But modern Hellenism is n't about bunch of people who just want to rebel against Christians and compete with them . So you said about Wicca in another post , what 's Wicca ? Its members call themselves 'witches ' and 'wizards ' and they say the worship some unfaced goddess and a generalized 'horned god ' , and lets be honest : Its just a made up thing to troll Christians . But we are no willing to troll them or compete with them , we just want to do what we feel and know of doing , and we try to not be controversial or offend them , because first of all we do n't care what they do , and secondly , we have been persecuted by them and its not a small thing . We just want to be seen as serious fellas that are harmless , to keep our calmness and sanity . So you might hear someone say `` no we do n't do magic ' , and there can be lots of reasons behind that statement . The word has so much negativity , and we do n't want to be associated either with what the average person considers to be 'magic ' and 'magic users ' . Let alone the fact that one has to be carefull when it comes to such practices , so even if we were doing 'magic ' , we would n't just say 'yes we do it , go ahead and do some you too ' , because that would be an irresponsible thing to do .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Depends on what you call 'magic ' . If invoking higher entities and asking them things , or letting one get in you and talk through you , or necromancy are part of what you call 'magic ' , then Hellenism has all of that . The Oracle of Delphi , a priestess with the title Pythia ( google it ) was letting herself become a medium for Apollo to talk through her , according to Plutarch . Plus , in Greece there had been Necromanteia . Temples of necromancy . Plus the word -mancy comes from manteia , which is a newer version of the word mania , and mania in ancient Greek was uniting yourself with the Divine , ie divination . And if you read Orphica , which are 'holy texts ' of a certain Hellenic tradition , that of Orphicism , that was seen as fringe by 'orthodox ' Hellenists , then you will discover that they are like parts of a grimoire . In Orphica you will find written things like what are the stones that have powers and how to make gem talismans , how to invoke certain Gods or Spirits etc . But magic according to Hellenism is nothing about willpower . The human has no super powers , but it 's the Gods or Daemons who may or may not do things a human did a ritual to ask them for . And one has to be ultra careful before attempting such a thing . When you do a ritual you open a gate , and who knows what might come out of it . And there is punishment if you do something 'bad ' here too . Remind yourself of the Iliad . Agamemnon did a spell to win the Trojan war , and he sacrificed his daughter for that . But murder is a a sin , ( sorry , I mean Hubris : P ) so he might have got what he asked for , as he won the war , but he did n't had the time to get pleasure from it , as he was immidately killed by his wife when he returned , and that was an act of divine retribution ( Nemesis ) . But all this is just one side of the coin , there is also another . You see , ancient Greece was a place and a time were there had been people believing different things , and preaching different things . For example if you read the 'Golden Verses of Pythagoras ' , he gives a teaching that says no to magic , and that one will reach the maximum he or she can , through a lifestyle more akin to Buddist monks or Hermits . He says that being a pacifist peacemaker is more divinating than any hocus pocus and incense . There are really lots of paths one can take .",Greek,Greek

Have a watch : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UQfRdl3GTw4 Its natural to want to share , and its natural to get negative reactions by the `` prisoners '' . Warning , its easy to get depressed once you have learnt so many things and thus realised the true potential of humanity , and noticed that humanity does n't even want to know what 's better for it , because in the end people are to lazy to think . To help them understand and realise , they will have to think , and mainstream people tend to spend their time with activities that require as less thinking as possible , like watching a football match . I 've passed through the state were you boldly and simply talk to people about things that they are not ready to accept because of their disbelief and / or even enviness . And I changed my way of approach so as to not directly speak about the 'hot ' stuff , but reach to that through conversation that is about more mundane , material things . Yet when people realise that even when you are to talk to them about things absolutely plausible according to their own limited understanding of existence that yet require from their part to put their brain in use , they usually avoid getting into such discussions . Because there is a mental illness that is so widespread and common that people do n't even recognize it as an illness and consider it a healthy natural state . And that illness I write about is to attribute way much more importance to unimportant things than they deserve , and focusing on such unimportant things , while ignoring and avoiding the really important .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"I love games made from Bethesda game studios , both the 3d Fallouts , and the Elder Scrolls series . I 've also spent some time learning how to mod , and made 2-3 mods for Skyrim , even though they never became popular . I 'm an introvert person and I do n't have many friends , so I have a lot of time that I stay alone , and that brings depression . Because if you have nothing to do , your mind thinks of a number of issues that make you sad . And I love playing large immersive games because getting immersed in their worlds I kind of forget my issues , it helps me feel better by occupying my mind with thoughts about the game 's world etc , instead of the misery of my life . I used to play games a lot , and I always bought original copies because I do n't feel right to pirate . And unfortunately , my country ( Greece ) has had to apply a series of austerity measures that shrunk the income of people . So these days I can only spend up to 20 euros to buy a game , and unfortunately all good new games , like Fallout 4 cost 60 euros . That 's 3 days worth of work where I am currently . Too much . : ( So for like a year and maybe another half I 'm limited to be buying and playing either small indie games , or very old AAA games , from the 90s and early 2000s , because new games rarely get a significant discount during Steam sales that would allow me to buy them . So I feel like I 'm left behind when it comes to gaming , I am missing so many good games that come out these days , and I have no idea when I will get to play them . : ( Does my psychological issues and bad economic position make me deserve the giveaway ? I do n't really know . Only thing I know is that I 'm as excited for this game as every Bethesda fan is , and that if I do n't get it that way , I 'll probably have to wait many years until I will get to play it . Now as for my gaming history ... I started out gaming as a Nintendo peasant , with a NES . Then I took a SNES , then a N64 , a Dreamcast , an original XBOX , a Gamecube , and my last console was an xbox360 that died 3 times to me with RROD , and the last time was out of warranty , and that made me so furious I decided to end console gaming . I felt like if I had thrown 400 euros that I spent for the console and another 600 for games in these two years in a trashbin . I felt a sucker and I was angered because of that . I was already disatisfied by Nintendo for staying back in the graphics department with the Wii , focusing more on casual gamers , and lacking innovative ideas and thus rehashing the same old shit , and I never really liked the Playstations . Some time after I had took my decision to stop playing video games , as I was disappointed that much from the console realm , and my immature mind had no idea about PC gaming , I decided to take a look out of curiosity on the system requirements of PC games back then , in 2008 . And much to my surprize , I found out that the only thing the computer I had was missing to be able to play games that were modern at that era , was a graphics card . So I saved some money and took one , and thus I started getting myself familiar with the world of PC gaming ! What a revealation . My first games on PC were STALKER : Clear Sky , Crysis , and Oblivion . Not only games looked better on PC , but I could also buy them for less money , and they also had more customization options , and many of them had mods which were awesome and allowed me to do many more interesting things , and there was a community ready to help me ! PC gaming won me after I tasted it , and since then I realised that PC gaming is better than console gaming , and that PC would be my first and primary gaming platform from then and on ! The only thing I missed is some exclusive Nintendo games out of nostalgia , but overall PC is superior than any console . I wish I 'd earn Fallout 4 , but even if I do n't , thank you for doing the good deed and giving away a copy . Also thank you for reading this comment . It included some things I wanted to get out of my chest . Have a nice day .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,greece,"Here are some cultural differencies : 1 . The average Greek knows every latest detail when it comes to what politicians say and do . My impression is that Americans , at least most of them , do n't really care that much about politics . 2 . Believe me , Greeks judge people based on their looks way more than Americans do . More often than not your looks are going to be a major factor when you are looking for a job , and do n't expect a sexual relationship if you are not a frequent gym goer . 3 . There is a widespread belief among Greek women that the only possible reason for a man to talk to them is to have sex with them . With that in mind its too hard to make friends people of the other sex , often its hard to even start a conversation in many cases . 4 . The concept of freedom of speech here goes as far as to allow a communist and an obviously racist party to exist .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Greece had a long running PC gaming magazine that existed almost 30 years . It 's name was 'PC Master ' long before Yatzee made the 'PC Master Race ' meme . The magazine had a cult following with the people writing it speaking to the hearts of local PC gamers . Unfortunately what the internet could n't do to harm gaming press in Greece , the austerity measures did , and all gaming related magazines died one by one in just 5 years . PC Master , a gaming magazine exclusively for PC , outlasted all other local gaming magazines , but unfortunately it died 2 months ago . When news were spread that this historic magazine that existed from the late 80s died , people that worked on it decided to start their own online magazine as a spiritual successor to PC Master . Local PC gamers are just too romantic to live without a magazine of some shorts exclusively for PC gaming , existing . So basically , the magazine is free as anybody can download it through the internet . The reasons to download and read it ? To learn opinions . About specific PC games , technologies , or industry wide matters .",Greek,Greek

The successors of Alexander built gymnastics stadiums , theaters , philosophy schools etc , across the 3 Hellenistic kingdoms , that spanned from modern day Greece to Pakistan . Judaea in particular had a 'problem ' with that , in that many Jews were even adopting Greek names , way of life and customes , and were losing their connection to their past . The Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the survival and victory of the Jewish tradition over the foreign Greek lifestyle and culture , but even after the revolt , a number of Jews kept adopting the lifestyle because they wanted so . Note that it was n't just the Judaeans that were adopting Greek lifestyle and language and names , but also Syrians , Egyptians , etc . By the time Jesus was born the area was ruled by Romans , and the Greek language had became 'lingua franca ' across the Roman Empire , meaning the standard language that was used when people foreign to each other were speaking , kind of how English is quite a popular language today .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,Shenmue 2 came out like 14 years ago . Shenmue 3 had been canceled because of the financials of SEGA . It 's no surprize to me that they went for a kickstarter . What seems strange is that they are only asking for 2 millions . I 'd expect this game to require a lot more budget .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"a heavily story driven , single player , action / sandbox series with rpg elements . the series that introduced QTEs ( and the only one who did them the right way IMO , as I hated QTEs in all other games except Shenmue ) and save transfers between sequels for the first time , 15 or so years ago .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Shenmue has been the only franchise I 've been interested from SEGA , for the last 10 years . The 2 first games were awesome , but unfortunately the third was canceled because of bad SEGA financials .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Shenmue had been an innovative series , with strong narrative . It was the first 3d sandbox game , where you were given a world in which you could do side-activities whenever you wanted to , like later you would also be able to do in the Grand Theft Auto series . It was the first game that when you were talking with NPCs it had cinematic camera movement , like later Mass Effect and Witcher did . It was the first game that brought QTEs . ( and the only one that did them right IMO . QTEs in Shenmue were n't a substitute for combat , the game 's combat was very much like that of fighting games , a key that punches , a key that kicks , a key for blocking , combos , special moves ... in Shenmue QTEs were mostly used in cutscenes as a way to test player 's responsiveness ) So a very innovative series if you think about it . Story-wise it follows the story of a Japanese young man in the decade of the 80s if I remember correct . His father was a Kung Fu master , that was having in his possesion a sacred artifact , that when combined with another one , the one who holds both gets power or a wish , I do n't really remember , but its like Dragonball in some way , were there are these mythical objects scattered in the world , and people want to find them and collect them . So an evil guy steals the artifact that the protagonist 's dad had , and kills the dad . Ryo the protagonist then beggins a journey to avenge his father , and discovers that there is a lot of shit going on , involving gangs , mafia , supernatural stuff , etc .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,greece,"That 's an over-sensational article with lots of bias , and even gray propaganda . First of all , the guy says that the reforms are few , and that those few have been averted , which is pure bullcrap . Not only some public workers were fired , but also the wages of all public workers fell down from 30 % to 50 % , pensions fell down about as much too , VAT went from 19 % to 23 % , tobbacco products special tax increase increased the prices of tobbacco products by 50 % , alcohol tax increased alcohol prices 30 % , a yearly tax on pieces of lands and houses was introduced , with which land owners have to pay a rent to the government for lands they already bought , electricity price was raised 30 % on top of the increased tax , the minimum wage fell from about 700 euros to 500 euros , the 8-hours work system that is what the whole world celebrates at May 1st no longer is supported and many Greeks now work 14 and 16 hours a day , a change made it so if a business fires somebody it does n't have to pay him the money for the hours he worked since the last payment leading to businesses 'hiring ' people for only a single month , then firing them without paying them anything to 'hire ' new people , meaning there are businesses in Greece that does n't ever pay workers but always having people working for them for free , and then IGNORANT and BIASED guys from all around EUROPE wonder why Greece 's economy has a depression . Troika 's reforms shaped Greece to be a place were a business can legaly have people always working for them without paying any worker ever , practically legalising tax-evasion , and then Troika hypocritically wonders why unemployment rates are high and how tax evasion happens . I wonder if that is what this guy means when he writes 'modernization ' . Is modernization the abolition of all worker rights and market regulation ? Is it modernization to have companies to have people working 16 hours a day on the promise that SOME DAY they will get paid , but never being paid ? That 's like slavery . It 's not modernization , its going society hundreds if not thousands of years back . All the aformentioned measures are still in effect and running . And they are not the only ones , I 'm sure I 'm forgetting some . The only thing this SYRIZA government averted , was that the ministry of finances hired back few cleaning ladies , and giving the public tevelision station the name of the old one , which were both a publicity stands .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,greece,"No . Before the Euro Greeks had jobs . Because people would invest their savings on openning small family bussinesses . And small family bussinesses were going well before the euro . When the euro came , the market became globalized . Suddenly the small local family bussiness of a Greek had to not only compete against other local small businesses , but against mega-corporations from all over Europe . Small families businesses could n't compete . They started closing . Greeks started loosing jobs . The market that was based on many but small traditional family bussinesses was broken because large whale-sized foreign corporations could now compete with them . So with all these small bussinesses closing , taxes were also reduced from GDP , and debt to GDP went higher . Euro is being killing us .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,greece,"The problem with pronounciation of Greek names is that usually when they are written with Latin alphabet , the letters of the Latin alphabet that are used are not those that would make the Latin word sound like the Greek word , but the letters that would make the Latin word look more like the Greek word .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hellenism is kind of a broad term I think . In ancient Greece , there had been a number of different 'schools ' or 'traditions ' , or perhaps you could even say 'religions ' . And while most of them if not all of them agreed that there are gods , and called them with the same names , beliefs about things differed between some different groups . Homer and Hesiod wrote about afterlife concepts more popular in the west , that there is Hades , and there the mortal is judged , and then goes to either Tartarus ( were the wicked go ) or the Elysium Fields ( where the righteous go ) . The Orphic religion though , which was kind of 'underground ' and unwanted by many Lords and politicians , had rather different beliefs . Orphics believed that the Soul of a human is a different thing than the body , and that after the soul left the body ( Death ) it would `` Drink the water of Lethe & lt ; oblivion & gt ; ) `` and be sent to another body . They believed that through ascetic life , one would earn the privellege of not drinking the water of Lethe after his or her death , so the next time the soul is incarnated , it keeps the memories of its past life-ves . Thirdly , you also have Plato and the Platonists - Neoplatonists , who believed that the old stories were allegoric and had esoteric meanings to be interpreted . Platonists believed that there are 2 realms , the realm of matter and the realm of Aether ( Heaven ) were the spirits are , and that humans originate from Heaven , and 'fell ' to Earth because they wished to taste the goods and pleasures of matter . According to this theology , if the human manages to become good and stop caring about matterial pleasures , his soul after death will stay for ever at Heaven , but if the human does n't , then he wall fall off Heaven again , and be reincarnated . Note that there might were even more different set of believes . I just write down about the 3 I know most . These three though differ in even more subjects than just afterlife . Hesiod says that Prometheus first made made man out of dirt and water , and then the Olympians made together woman ( Pandora ) . Orpheus says that Prometheus made men and women using the ashes of the Titans that Zeus zapped with a thunderbolt , giving them life with aether . Plato says that the Olympians following the orders of the One ( Super Creator of the Universe and Gods ) made humans that were neither male or female , and that because the humans once rebeled against the Olympians , Zeus punished them by splitting them to males and females , which made each one weaker . There are many paths lying ahead . Choose your prefered , or make your own ! : )",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"What I wonder is where do the Kemetics , the modern ones , draw inspiration and info about the ancient religion . I 've learnt a few things about ancient Egyptian religion , mostly by reading the book of Iamlbichus `` On the Egyptian Mysteries '' . I also know that the books of Hermes Trismegistus ( Thoth / Djehuty ) are originally Egyptian , but I have n't read them . From most of the books I 've read , I draw the conclusion that the same entities ( or at least some of them ) were known and worshipped at both Egypt and Greece , even though with different names and traditions .",Greek,Greek

Being unemployed is really bad . : ( I do n't have money to go outside for clubbing or cinemas or whatever , I skip meals , and I have LOTS of free time that I have nothing to spend it on . And on that free time since I have nothing to do , I end up overthinking things , and that makes me stressful and depressed . I could be spending some of the free time playing games , but unfortunately nowdays games come with elevated requirements , and my PC falls below of even the minimum requirements of some recent games , like GTA5 , Witcher 3 , etc ... : ( Which I 'd really like to experience . But even if I had a computer able to run them , still , I 'd have to wait until they are on a very low price on Steam sale , but I would at least have a chance of playing them .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I tend to prefer reading books written by ancient people , who wrote them when the religion was still alive and popular . Because modern historians and archeologists , base their own knowledge in part on those books , and I prefer getting information straight from the source . But Hellenism does n't have a single 'holy book ' , but there are lots of different books regarding Gods , metaphysics , etc . And even what we call 'Hellenic Polytheism ' is n't really one thing . Because there had be a number of different 'religions ' or 'denominations ' of Hellenic Polytheism , and while each one accepted and acknowledged the existence of the same 'Gods ' , the explanations about them , and other subjects like afterlife for example differ . Personally I 'm more leaning towards the more esoteric and occult-ish path of Plato and Proclus . This path is more close to the old teachings of Orphicism than the one that had been more popular at the classic era , that venerated the epics of Homer and Hesiod . So these are my primary resources : Books by Plato , Proclus , Orpheus , and Plutarch . These authors wrote lots of works though , and a list with all their works would be very big . Orpheus was a king and poet , said to have taken part in the campaign of the Argonauts , along with Hercules and other heroes . To him are attributed a number of different texts , including his own telling of the Argonaut campaign , liturgic hymns to Gods and Goddesses , and a guide on how to make holy talismans . Plato was a philosopher , that wrote on a variety of different subjects , injecting in each of his books a piece of theology . Most of his books are centered each on a single timeless subject like eg Love , Morals , Justice etc , and he analyzes each so deep , so as the dialogue ( Plato 's books are in a dialogue form ) dives in to the Divine , as there is this belief in Platonism , that the source of everything is the Divine . This gives a rather interesting / important viewpoint regarding the nature of the world , and how the Divine affects humans and everyday life / nature , etc . Plutarch was a priest of the temple of Apollo at Delphi , and wrote two kinds of books , one kind is biographies of historical persons , and the second is called 'moralia ' and are mostly explanatory and catechism texts on things like Virtue , Fasting etc . In some of his books I remember reading about the temple 's oracle , the priestess 'Pythia ' , and the way a woman could become Pythia , and what were the preparations she had to pass , how she was receiving the oracles , etc . Finally , Proclus was a rather interesting fellow . He lived at a time that Christianity had already become a recognized religion in the Roman Empire , and is one of the last thinkers and theologians of Hellenism . Most of his works are commentaries on various Hellenic religious books that predated him , like Hesiod 's Works and Days , and Plato 's Timeaus . According to Proclus and the other `` Neoplatonists '' of the late antiquity , the old books of Hellenism were not to be taken 100 % literaly , but had allegories , and were to be interpreted . So his works are mostly focused on interpreting and explaining older texts . Except from ancient books , I also respect and try to a degree to follow the Delphic Maxims - about 140+ short sayings that were found carved in the temple of Apollo at Delphi , such as `` Know thyself '' and `` Nothing Excess '' ...",Greek,Greek

The Koine Greek ( Common Tongue ) which was used as Lingua Franca from the times of Alexander the Great , and was officially used by the Byzantines too , is relatively easy to understand and translate . But the further back you go in time , the harder it becomes . I guess an average Greek person would recognize and understand 90 % to 100 % of the words he reads of this form of Greek . The hardest texts to read are Homer 's , that are from the 8th century BC . These texts contain unique words not found in any other piece of literature , and some of them are translated in books etc upon assumption regarding on the context where they are used at . I guess the average person would only understand 5 % to 20 % of the words written in these texts .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,AskHistorians,"Well Greek mythology has been popular to the media , and has many derivatives , as it keeps inspiring artists to create new stories . It is popular as a fantasy setting these days , as also Tolkien 's universe . But the actual Greek mythology was n't supposed to be a fantasy setting . Most of it was about giving explanations to various matters that could n't be answered somehow else , and as a form of early 'science ' . I say that , because most of what is included in the divinities of ancient Greek folklore , are personified natural forces or objects . For example Hesiod 's creation story says that first Gaia ( Earth ) appeared , and that she gave birth to Uranus ( Sky ) , and that then they got married and gave birth to Potamos ( River ) , Oceanos ( Ocean ) , Oros ( Mountain ) ... Interesting to know is that the Greek language is such , that most of each words will either be masculine or feminine . So Sky is masculine , and Earth is feminine , and that way its easy to come up with the rest of the details for attributing personalities to them . For me , the part of Hesiod I wrote about , is about is seen as a form of primative natural history : It basically tells that the Sky came to existence by Earth ( I assume Sky is the Atmosphere , as you know , without Earth 's mass for there to be substantial gravity there would be no atmosphere ) , and that then the Earth and Atmosphere had intercourse ( meaning the ingredients of these two were mixed and reacted with each other , ) resulting to the creation of the Oceans , Rivers , etc .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,politics,"The alterEnglish to austerity is growth . Austerity is being promoted and applied as a way to reduce the debt to GDP ratio , and balance the income with the expenses . One way to get balance is to cut expenses , and the other is to start making more money . And the way to start making more money is to start having more businesses , and more efficient tax collection . The austerity policies that Greece has been following the past 5 years include ovetaxing the existing businesses to the point they will leave the country to migrate to countries with smaller tax rates , leaving your people behind without jobs . And in the end the reduced number of businesses and working people , reduces GDP , and in the case of Greece the reduction of its GDP was way more severe than the reduction of its government 's expenses , which means that the austerity plan had the exact opposite result than the expected , rising Greece 's debt to GDP ratio instead of reducing it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,greece,"The average modern Greek has a delusional half-knowledge about his and her ancient past , and feels entitled to earn respect because of what his ancestors did , without ever buying a book and reading what those ancestors actually did and wrote to be considered important or great by the world .

Unfortunately the past acts for the most people as an amount of reasons that offer bragging rights , but Greeks are too lazy to actually buy some books written by their ancestors and learn stuff about them , beyond very basic descriptions . For example everyone knows that Socrates drunk the hemlock . If you pick up people randomly and ask them what was Socrates doing that lead him to be judged and receive the capital punishment by the jury , less than 1/10 of the people will know the answer .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,greece,"Given that most of the Greek government 's debt is made because the government took loans to give away the money free to local banks for 'recapitalization ' , it was always a bank related problem . The banks spent and used the deposits of the Greek people , and have had no money to give back to people who wanted the money , for years now . What our Greek government has been doing is to take loans from foreign countries , indebting our state , to give the money to our local banks , so the banks do n't go bankrupt and we can still be getting our money from them if we want so . In essence what basically happens is that banks stole and used our deposits , and to be able to take our money back , we have to pay the government more taxes , so the government gives the money back to the banks , so we can have the delusion that our money were never stolen . That 's why when ECB stopped the 'support ' to the Greek banks , capital controls came . Because plain and simply , the money you , me , and others deposited to the banks do n't exist . They do n't have them . They spent them while we had the delusion that they would keep our money safe , and now that people ask for their money in ordrer for the bank fraud to not become clear , the ECB has to give it new money , money that wo n't be our deposits , but money that our country will get as a new loan , and we will have to pay back through our taxes . So we have to pay huge money through our taxes to recapitalize the banks with our taxes , so the banks keep giving away money to people who deposited to them , so people wo n't realise that their deposits are long stolen and that through their taxes they pay the money that they will hypocritically get back as their deposits money .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,greece,"The Greek governments have been indebting Greece for the shake of the banks since 2008 , when Costas Karamanlis took a loan from foreigners of 70bn euros and gave them to the Greek banks . And that very loan was what took Greece 's debt beyond Eurozone 's Debt to GDP standard , which is what lead Greece to the IMF and the austerity policies . Since then Greek governments have recapitalized the banks some more times . With debt restructuring it was the reserves of the Greek pension funds that got devastated .",Greek,Greek

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskReddit,"That is not the truth , not even the simplistic truth . It is an ignorant and offensive analogy .",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskReddit,"That is not only ignorant , it is incredibly offensive . Congrats on the double whammy . Edit : If you want a car analogy , here ya go : You have a car . You need it to get to work . It needs regular service . So you take it to the auto repair shop . The auto repair shop decides your car needs some repairs , which it might , but fixes problems and non-problems alike , buys pieces of his friends ' junk yard and charges them as new . He bills your card for them . You do n't know much about cars , but you realize something is wrong . You take it to a different auto repair shop because you do n't trust the previous one , but it does the same . By now you car is not working well , but you can get to work mostly every day , and can pay your credit card bills . You switch between the two only available repair shops , but they keep promising a better end result and making everything worse . And your debt keeps piling up . And then you run into a pothole . you realize that the last guy switched your suspension for nearly broken ones , and your car needs real work this time ! But you cant borrow anymore . So one auto repair guy asks your friend , who has money and supposedly knows about cars , to lend you money . He agrees on the loan , on the condition he can have a look at the car and tell the auto repair guy what to do to fix it . He does have some good ideas - which the auto repair guy applies as worse he can , to keep his friends ' junk yard going . One of the ideas , however , is that you need a much smaller gas tank . The gas is n't enough to get you to work , so you resort to going slow , turning off the engine when going downhill , and whatever trick you can muster to get to work . But you re more and more late , and your boss pays you less . But your friend is the only choice you have to afford to service your car so you can get to work , even in these conditions . And then comes in a new auto repair shop , promising he can explain to your friend why you need a bigger gas tank , get him to donate to you some of the money to get your car working again so you can get to work on time and get payed more . So you give him your car to fix . And then he rips the parts off , yells at your friend that he is wrong on everything and to give you some money , puts the already bad car parts together in a weird way , and when the disagreement with your friend reaches a standstill , gets you in the room and asks you if you want a bigger gas tank . Which you do , it makes obvious sense . But your friend is pissed , does n't want to give you money , and insists that the only way he will help is if you have an even smaller gas tank . You are like `` wtf dude , this will never work '' , but the new auto repair guy agrees , and then ( yesterday actually ) decides that he wants a new contract with you . Meanwhile your car is ruined , you can only make it to work one day out of two , your debt is piling up and your friend is pissed at you and convinced he is right about everything . Which he is n't . And no auto repair shop seems to know what it 's doing . Edit 2 : since everyone is n't getting it , in the following story , the car s owner is the Greeks , the auto repair guys are the various greek governments , the auto repair guys friends are the ones benefitting from the greek governments ' corrupt practices ( both Greek and non Greek ) , and the friend who lends money is the EU . So i am saying its mostly our governments ' fault . So mostly Greece 's fault overall , but the creditors ' policies have n't helped the economy to recover .

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer ! My question is not so much about the term per se as about the perceived origin of the conquerors .

BTW , Ionian , Yunan , Yavan still is the term used for Greeks in Turkey , the middle east and a large portion of the globe .",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer . There have been many debates on what Alexander and Macedonians were . So far , what I have taken out of them is that Alexander and Philip saw themselves as Greek . ( some of the ) other Greeks considered them barbarians for many reasons , but the one that comes to mind the most is that they did not embrace the model of the city-state . So my question 's point is : were the armies of Alexander the Great seen as Greek by non-greeks , or as distinct ? Given that there was a fair deal of contact between the Greeks and the other populations of the area *before* Alexander 's conquest ( hell , Greek mercenaries fought against Alexander along the Persians ) , did the conquered populations understand themselves as conquered by the Macedonians or by the Greeks ? Or would they not even think in these terms ?",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thank you for your answer . Everything you have said has been argued well , even though I disagree with your conclusion . But by no means do I want to claim it is absolutely incorrect . It is a well-known fact that Macedonians being Greeks or not was already debated amongst ancient Greeks . The key word being `` debated '' . However , I have never encountered any Roman source which considers Macedonians to be non-greeks , besides in the reflection of more ancient debates . But I am not a historian . Perhaps you , or some other historian here , can show me otherwise . I apologize because I ca n't help myself but keeping going : The Macedonians participated to the Olympics since Alexander I ( although only their rulers could , which sets them apart ) . They had to use force against southern Greece `` to keep them on their side '' but it 's not like Greeks did n't use force on one another `` to keep the other on their side '' . They were militarily different but so were Thebans , Athenians and Spartans from one another , although perhaps ( ? ) to a lesser extent . You say that it is `` historically incorrect '' to call them Greeks , when it is at the very least highly debatable ( I know wikipedia is not a reliable source , but the discussion on the topic is interesting ) . After all , they claimed to be Greek and spread Greek culture to the whole known world at the time . One could say that they were - quite literally - arguably Greeks . As for the modern Greeks claiming Alexander 's accomplishments , that is , I believe , justified . Modern Greeks are in my opinion more the descendants of the Hellenistic world than of ancient Greeks . Modern Greeks are mostly the cultural descendants of the Greek-speaking people of the Hellenistic kingdoms , the Roman Empire , and later the Ottoman Empire . This means they are ( to a large extent ) the descendants of the people who became hellenized through Alexander 's accomplishments , the ones which made Greek culture so pervasive that , for example , the new testament was originally written in ( Alexandrine ) Greek , or that the Eastern Roman Empire switched its administrative language back to Greek after Justinian . Alexander is , amongst others of course , a founding figure for modern Greeks . That is why he holds such a special place in Greeks hearts , and why we ca n't help ourselves from replying to posts that question him being Greek . Of course , how much any nation can ( or should consider so important to ) `` claim '' accomplishments , especially so remote in time , is also highly debatable .",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer . It has always been my understanding that yes , Greeks were not a monolithic block , and that Macedonians ( who did participate in the Olympics since Alexander I , so before the conquest of southern Greece afaik ) were a part of that block . Once again , thank you for taking the time to answer my question . I strongly disagree with you for many reasons , but this is a political and emotional question for a lot of people .

Seeing how things are going on here first hand I assure you that Europe has n't helped us at all with that 3rd issue , I would argue that they contribuded into making it more severe . For question number 0 allow me to give you my personal insight on this topic . Here 's the problem . You elect representatives based on their ideology and their `` programme '' concerning the country 's future . Here 's 2 major problems that I know for a fact that existed since Greece entered the Euro and even before that : a ) Many people became government workers illegally in exchange for votes and b ) https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=tigaryz-1y4 around 1:30 John Green hits the nail right in the head , the whole video does a pretty good job to make us understand the economic problem . Bottom line is that a lot of lying and corruption was happening for lots and lots of years by a significant part of the greek society and ofc the greek goverments .

If the events that hire RL want him to be a bit more measured in his casting and he does n't do that , then yes blame him all you want for that one , but if the events that hire him want him to be 100 % himself , then it 's time for the community to do some research on freaking cultures and realise that he is n't really doing anything wrong .",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"& gt ; Without `` buddy teams '' , we would n't have some of the most iconic League teams ( present or past ) . TSM , CLG.EU , M5 ... all top tier teams the likes of which we will probably never see if franchising becomes a thing First of all , I do n't understand what you are trying to get at here . Ofc we would n't have those iconic teams with franchising , but the owners are calling for franchising NOW because the league is not that profitable for any org right now , Riot is giving owners very little motive to invest money due to its structure , there was literally NO reason to franchise in early league cause there was n't any real structure till season 2 . Second of all , you are still gon na have buddy teams , players impact inside the orgs is gon na get bigger and GOOD players ( not any player , which is excellent imho ) are gon na have huge leverage over who they play with cause unlike popular opinion , teams inside franchising wo n't stay shit and hold to their Goldenglues or Cris'es . Franchising might actually make LCS even more competitive and talking about teams of friends ... You know I get it , my favorite team of all time is the old C9 , I loved the idea that a team of friends managed to compete with world class teams purely due to shotcalling and persistance , but If we are heading towards a professional sports direction , then this is a thing we might have to sacrifice.I 'm ok with it and I think you should be too : )",Greek,Greek

Not only are you letting them be creative and build their own fanbase/brand , but they would give the community top tier content that could possibly get more of the league casual fanbase into esports .

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"Hey I remember your post . You bring interesting arguments to the subject but instead of people just using the post as `` food for thought '' to develop a polite discussion , a considerable amount tends to just go off topic and argue about related subjects but not the subject discussed in your thread . That 's what happened in your last post IMO . I do n't feel this one is gon na be different . I like posts like these but they get quickly ruined by a few people . P.S Do n't wan na sound like a d**k or anything , just expressing my thought in an non - douchy way . Arguments are always welcomed .",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"I ca n't think of it as a way to get mocked by people.It just does n't fit.There is no absolute reason.I 'm pretty sure about my statement since I saw some post before that which were related to Chaox potentially returnin to the pro scene.Your assumption is just ... hell i ca n't even describe it.Irrelevant I would say , ca n't think of any other word right now",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,This post has risen up because Chaox is believed to have found a team and he himself has also said that he wants to return to the pro scene this season or the next.So you have a completely wrong perspective about this post .,Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"I will not attempt to make a comment in order to expose your inferior intelligence , but that is a really stupid comment that you 've written.It is roster change for the All-Starts , not for next split or the world championship but the All-Stars , so if per say C9 did n't qualify for All-stars , no change would have been needed , so using our ****** logic here , we ca n't take this as a legit trade . Case closed",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"`` I dont think people in lower elos should emulate his playstyle . `` .With that , I can completely agree , however he is just showing to his viewers a high risk-high reward way to play the jungle.If you just farm and the enemy jungler ca n't make any plays happen with his ganks , he loses exp , you come out of the jungle like a boss , you win , if not , then you are gon na have a rough time.T2G gameplay is all about self-dependance , do n't trust anyone and win the game.People emulating his style is not T2G problem , but their own . TL ; DR Nobody disagrees with you , I just think that most of the people in this thread believe that those who emulate his style , without trying to adjust it to theirs are more to blame than T2G himself.Or at least that is my personal and I 'd like to believe objective opinion .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"Exactly.In lower elo you are helpless.AS much as you might want to depend on your team , you just can't.Being the best that you can be is priority number 1 and if your team is holding you back you just have to take matter into your own hands . Also T2G is an entertainer , not a competitive player who will teach you how to play the game.Sure there are things that you can keep in mind and which could help you improve your in-game experience , but if you are watching T2G to take him seriously , you are in the wrong place friends .",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"And then he got banned like he deserved . That 's where I feel a lot of people are missing the point . He got punished for his behaviour , but why ban the stuff he creates .

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,1 day after Naruto ends . # thefeels thnx for the update m8,Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"Yeah in lower elo there is n't much or any drive to learn from a lost game at all so I can definetely agree with you that getting shit stomped is not a learning experience for THESE kind of people.I may be wrong with what I 'm about to say , but in the end it all depends on how one views the game.Everytime I lose or win I always go back to the game and look what I could have done better.Especially when I get shit stomped is when I give myself the harshest critisism and try to fix my mistakes to perform better in my future games.That 's just my mentality , I know many people do n't see it that way but I ask myself `` why would n't they ? '' I play this videogame to have fun and improve.If you ( not referring to you in particular dear redditor : P ) are n't prepared to face unwinnable games and play against people that are higher skill using low lvl accounts then you should at least stay away from ranked 's . TL ; DR : Playing against elo boosters is not by any means a good thing , but we have to take LoL with its goods and its bads.Just try to make the best out of a bad situation , that is what I do , its not ideal , but it works .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,Just speaking the truth m8 : -P,Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"I actually somewhat agree with your responses in the comment section.I always get people in my team that say `` that guy is plat 2 we are gon na get dumpstered '' or `` he is obviously on a smurf '' or smth along those lines.I LOVE when i get higher division/skill players against me because losing to guys like you is like winning.As long as you take a step back and look at your own mistakes ingame you will eventually get better in League.If people are n't ready to face fierce competition and better players than them in ranked then they will never improve imo.Not saying that what you do is the best thing in the world or even remotely acceptable , but you personally are an ok guy in my books .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"This . Also , if I happen to play a champion that has the ability to split push , then it 's usually my `` if all else fails plan '' . Sometimes you just have to go single-player mode . You ca n't win them all , but as long as you try your best to salvage even the hardest of games , then its a win in my books .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,Naruto,"I would argue for the opposite , this might actually be the most ironic statement that we 've gotten in the whole Naruto story . I actually felt sorry for Sasuke in that one . Kid needs some help .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,Naruto,"I 'm really interested to see how naruto talk no jutsu 's sasuke out of this fight , because we can debate it all we want , but sasuke is pretty messed up mentally right now .",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"The `` Kayle : nerfed to death '' sentence was some of the biggest BS I have ever read in a reddit thread.Kayle is still viable , for crying out loud it is even played in OGN.If you do n't trust your teammates on certain champions just ban them . TL ; DR : If you have trust issues , ban against your own teammates .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"After reading posts or watching a lot of videos ( from pro players or high elo players who are respected by the community , for example Sky , who is a jungle main ) about what the jungle role is all about , I believe I have a solid response to the OP of this post . 1.A jungler is n't obligated to give his buffs to anyone.No matter how badly you need it or how politely you ask it , its his right to be a dick about it.Yes , this is n't the correct way for him to respond to your request , but almost everygame you will come across that kind of jungler.Try to win lanes without buffs.If you can master this then you will be fearless with buffs.See not having buffs as a challenge , not as a condemn . I get the massage you are trying to pass with this post , but your post has to do more with toxicity and people not having a good understanding of the jungle role rather than `` Junglers are pure dicks '' , which from the way your post is constructed , is what most people unfortunately understand . There are a lot more things to be discussed about the jungle role , but i will wait for another reddit post to unload my knownledge : P P.S No disrespecterino was intented in this post",Greek,Greek

0j0s,Dreams,"I dreamt that I was back in school ( my friend is going back to school today ) and I met one of my actual old school friends there . On the way to school she got stuck in a mud hole -not real mud , more like black dust , the kind we had in our primary school play yard , and she was really stuck in there so I stood by her while other school-goers went by . But then we started attracting a few of them and more got stuck in the hole . Turns out there was a real assembly after a while and it became the actual school . I got naked and started showering in the middle of the mud pit ( which was solid and I could n't get stuck into despite the shower water flowing from directly above ) . From a school it became a sort of housewarming party . Some girls I did n't know started telling me that guys were checking me out , and sure enough I was getting some pervy looks . I asked two of my friends to get naked and come share the shower . One of them had the exact same boobs as a girl I slept with this summer . This defused the male sexual attention on me somewhat . I was n't in the housewarming school anymore but on a shooting set . It was a remake of the Addams family where Morticia was played by Daryl Hannah . Her make up was really mild and not even very dark , so I remember not being totally convinced of her efficiency . But I had n't seen her play so far . I was there during Wednesday scenes . The little girl was having a melancholic moment when she was dreaming that she was older . As it turns out , I knew the director , and he was giving me a little part in this scene . I had to appear in a puff of smoke at the end as the representation of teenage Wednesday/teenage Morticia . I was really really excited to be doing this and was working my poses ; I was definitely going to put some of the original Morticia in there . But as I 'm quietly working on the set , one my bar friends enters the room ( he 's a quiet family man IRL ) with a couple of pervy look guys from the housewarming school . They point me to him and he starts coming on to me and even stroking my ass . I tell him off once , twice , and also have to slap him once and twice and walk away to make him leave me alone . I made sure to do this where the guys could see . I was a little unsettled to play my part after that and had to take a break . Good thing my mother lived next door ( she lives about 620miles away from me ) , so I went there and cooked for her , my grandma and one of my friends Alex . After the meal my mum left with all her bags and stuff . Then I realised Alex 's bags were still there and I called her . Turns out Alex was her son . And he 'd just disappeared . ( I do have a little brother , both him and Alex have blond hair and are younger than me ) His phone was here so he had none of his stuff . But I realised I had no time for this . I went back to set and the director told me we were ready to shoot my scene . I realised I had worked all the mimics and poses , but my clothes were all wrong . I was wearing a black satin shirt under a red and black flannel shirt with impossibly patterned leggings . I KNEW I had the right outfit at home . I still shot the scene with some of the terrible clothes , and sure enough , the director suggested I changed . The end of the dream before I woke up was me pooping in a portable toilet and thinking about the right outfit for the role , which in real life would be a huge challenge for me to wear outside , but I was totally ready to do that for the part .",Romance,French

Then when it 's stopped dripping I take a towel and rub it about the roots , shaking the hair slightly . I 've found that taking a relatively long time squeezing , brushing and shaking the water out , made the overall drying process a lot shorter .

9876543212345,CGPGrey,"& gt ; I would like to see CGP Grey address the stability problem though . This seems very relevant in a prime minister system where stability is critical ( as opposed to a Presidential system ) . In HI , he basically said that in 100 % representative parliaments , parliaments will reach a common ground , at least in important matters . I feel that does n't take into account many things . To use Italy again as an example : the parliament there can give a no-confidence vote to the prime minister , forcing him to resign , and if no replacement for the PM is found , another election is called . A coalition ( made of every major party except the communists ) was the norm in the 80s , under the first postwar , highly representative voting system , but [ it did n't work out well ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_pulite ) , eventually . This is not a specificity , it 's pretty systemic in nature , and I feel this is the kind of issue Grey just plainly ignores when he speaks about voting systems . I think it 's partly because he only ever witnessed political issues in the US and UK , which both have the issue of low representativeness , and also ( by his admission ) he has no interest in the peculiarities of each country 's party system and political situation . Voting systems do n't exist in a vacuum , and there is no `` one-kind-fits-all '' type of voting system . This does n't mean that the UK , US etc . voting systems are fine the way they are , but there are more things to consider than how well does it reflect the breakdown of the voters .",Romance,Italian
9876543212345,CGPGrey,"& gt ; It 's not the electoral system that created the problem ; it 's the fact that the PSI and PSDI would n't form a left-wing coalition with the PCI , which guaranteed that the Christian Democrats were in government forever . True . The issue here was that the party system was polarized to an extent . I feel this should be taken into account when drafting the institutional makeup of a country , but that 's another matter . My point was that there are cases where coalitions governments do n't work out as expected . & gt ; Most PR systems stabilise as a number of left-wing parties , and a number of right-wing parties and the larger coalition gets into government . Voters can choose between the two coalitions , but can also choose between parties within the coalitions and therefore push the coalition in a direction they prefer ( e.g . vote Green to increase the priority given to environmental issues within the left-coalition ) . This is pretty much how the Italian system works out these days . One thing to consider is how disciplined the coalition is . Both the 1996 and the 2008 elections in Italy were early elections due to a no-confidence vote from a party in the governing coalition . Needless to say , situations like this have a negative effect on the country as they stifle the lawmaking process .",Romance,Italian

If you want a searchable term , this is called `` C symmetry '' in particle physics . Strong force ( holds nuclei together ) has C symmetry as well ( experimentally verified ) . Weak force ( beta decay ) does not have C symmetry ( experimentally verified ) . Gravity does not have an accepted quantization , but I 'd say it has to have C symmetry as well ( an expert please fill this in for me ) . & gt ; I 'm getting way off track here , but to take that to an extreme , could an anti-matter radio pick up my regular music stations and play the music in a normal way ? Pick up , yes . Then the speaker would need to be immersed in `` anti-air '' to transmit the sound . But then **you** would have to be immersed in it to hear it .

12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"Going on , you 'll notice more and more the 'game ' aspect of this game , which will start imposing constraints on the high-level approaches you can take to solve a problem . E.g . R { A , O } Ms work in a way that forces you do do sequential read/write operations , having an efficient algorithm that requires extensive random access is n't of any use . Learning some tricks to cut on code size is very important , because later you wo n't be able to fit enough in a MC if you do n't compress your code . That said , even in the later levels you can go with a `` optimizer passes '' approach , where initially you write with `jmp`s and waste the `slx` sync value , because it 's high-level and easy , then , much like an optimizing compiler , you come back and do `jmp` pruning , global flag assignment , efficient register assignment and so on ... This is a very rewarding game , carry on optimizing !",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"So , get some tips : * The input xbus lines can do the buffering for you ! No need to read the clean/feed values in acc/dat , just sleep with them in the bus , they 'll still be there once you 've slept , ready to be retrieved . Saves 2 lines and 2 power/iteration * `slx x0 ; mov x0 null ; & lt ; instr & gt ; 0` is a transitional pattern , but once you 've done a working solution , you can optimize that `mov x0 null` away , by sending 0 ( or whatever constant you happen to use ) and using it , so it becomes `slx x0 ; & lt ; instr & gt ; x0` . Saves 1 line and 1 power/iter * The bottom MC uses a single flag , the `jmp` is unneeded . Rework the flags and remove the `jmp` . Saves 1 line and ~4 power/iter * The top MC has several issues as well , but I 'm leaving them for you to take care of . Have fun .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,researchnet,"Great work . Of all the `12345ie+` I 'm the only one . I do n't think he built a cradle on a stick , because that would give you an even cycle count , unless you waste another cycle as well . It looks more like 18/2 .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,researchnet,"`` Your solution is n't even in the same class of the top players ' '' . Yeah , I 've been trash-talked to enough .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"Then you 're getting worse gems that you 'd get if you used simple U .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; HA ! Thats too much like cheating , but since youve been playing `` forever '' , I can see how that saves a bit of time . So how does that work with unlocking skills and gems ? Dont you still have to beat the specific fields to unlock stuff ? Yes , but unlocks at WL500 are trivial . I ensure you that unlocking yellow for the 10th time at 100ish WL is n't really a great use of my time . & gt ; That is not exactly the answer I was looking for , the question still stands what recipes are used without the black/red/yellow . & gt ; The combiner tool is nice but seems to be made for power players since it only has a limited variety of recipes . If you dont have access to the black gem ( other than sticking to fields that have it , /boggle ) , what do you do until then ? You do not use any recipe , because you do n't need them . & gt ; Also , I still dont know what the k stands for inside the recipe I know its killgem but whats the sub combine to that ? 1b+1r ? Your earlier killgem , all the way down recursively to a spec 'd killgem . & gt ; I 'd say there needs a new beginner/mid guide . One worth reading . Write it ! & gt ; DTG",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,Gemcraft,"As a guide writer I feel compelled to say that I want to bring 'you ' to the end-game because I have no clue how mid-game plays out , I just skip it entirely . An example is this video of mine : https : //vimeo.com/160455365 , I go directly from WL130 ( early-game ) to WL560 ( semi-late-game ) , using an appropriate field that has the gems I need , and racking out all the exp I want .

To test a drug , you need an extremely low-level and detailed model of the inner working of a cell , maybe you can avoid simulating each atom and its QED interactions , but I do n't think you can save up more that a few orders of magnitude . What you are talking about is building a `` unit '' that `` acts like a neuron '' , then linking a trillion of them together . That 's for sure much easier , and may give you a `` human-like brain '' , but it tells you nothing about how a drug will affect real human neurons .

I guess you `` expand the pin state domain '' by using `p1` 's transitions as states ( which expands `p1` 's states to 3 : low-to-high , high-to-low and stationary ) .

12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"You lost the exponents in the copypaste , it 's 14^2 and 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^ ( 2 ) . In case you did n't notice , u/BunBun002 is trying to make an intentionally slow solution . The easiest way to make something very slow in any programming language is : for i from small_number to big_number do_long_task ( ) in Shenzehen IO a `do_long_task ( ) ` is not difficult to write , but indexes are limited to `-999 - 999` . To get a bigger index you can use something that has more 'states ' than a ShIO integer , you check for a specific state and then break the loop . An integer has 999+1+999=1999 different states . A ROM has just the 2 pointers that you can modify , which have 14 states each , for a total of 14^ ( 2 ) =144 . A RAM has 14 numbers and 2 pointers you can modify , which means there are 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^ ( 2 ) different states in which it can be . Realistically you 'll not be able to iterate through pointers in a RAM , but iterating through all the integers is not that difficult , and yields a 1999^ ( 14 ) steps loop . Sample code ( x0- & gt ; d1 , x1- & gt ; a1 ) : li : mov -999 x0 teq x1 0 - jmp li lg : mov x1 dat mov x0 acc teq acc 999 + teq dat 13 - add 1 - mov dat x1 - mov acc x0 # Put long function # here , e.g . : # mov -1 x3 - jmp lg EDIT : This code does not actually use all the states , but just 1999*14 , but it 's enough to show that a RAM has much more potential than a ROM or register .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"Duplicate the `mov 10 x2` in the lower MC6k and make both conditional , you saved 1 instruction in the `2` codepath at expense of 1 line . Also , I recommend iterating through a RAM , a ROM has just 14^2 states , a RAM has 1999^ ( 14 ) *14^2",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,shenzhenIO,"An alterEnglish approach , which sidesteps the problem , is to give people what they want , so they 'll stop bugging you .

Edit : AFAIK the best latches are the NOT-AND-OR one at 3 $ and 0 power and a variety of 2 gates latches which need a couple power from an MC to init them .",Romance,Italian

Right now i enrage nearly all waves to 300+ mobs , but i leave the shielded waves untouched . I 've ruined multiple endurance runs because of them and with banishment trait letting a few of these guys pass basically means end of story for me .
