On the unionist side there was the UDA , the UVF , the LVF and others . The UDA is a particularly interesting case . It was actually a legal group for the majority of the conflict , despite being for all intents and purposes , a terrorist group . It carried out its worst attacks ( like the Greysteel massacre ) under the guise of a fake group called the UFF - the British government outlawed the UFF but let the UDA stay as a legal group until 1992 . There 's been numerous accusations of collusion between the British state and the UDA . Most of these groups have called a ceasefire on their activities . The PIRA called a ceasfire in 1997 and had all of their weapons decommissioned under international supervision in 2001 . Some of the Unionist groups have decommissioned but the UDA has n't - it claims to be undertaking it though .

08TangoDown08,ireland,Ireland has more of a history with Britain than they do with the Chinese - and the relationship between our two countries is better than ever . If we can get over that hurdle then I do n't see why we should be avoiding China . I think it 's great . It 's pragmatic and I 'm happy to see some pragmatism on our side for once . China 's the USA 's biggest competitor in geopolitics and they might soon surpass them . Healthy relations with them can only be in our country 's best interests .,Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,gallifrey,"I 'm the opposite - I loved that scene . The whole point is that the Doctor has a dark side .

08TangoDown08,shadowofmordor,"It 's absolutely shocking how bad this game is on the 360 . I ca n't believe they can release it like this and still charge the full price for it . It 's so disappointing on so many different levels . I was n't expecting to get the same game as those playing on a next-gen console but I at least expected something decent because of the price - what I got was a buggy , barely playable mess that is n't even worth a third of the price I paid for it . I also have trouble believing anyone who says that this game simply could not have been made to a good standard on last gen consoles - just look at GTA V. There is far more going on at one time in that game than this one , I understand that last gen consoles were not the priority but the state that this game is in just makes it look like they really did n't give a shit and wanted to release it as a cash cow . I 'm not holding out much hope for any patches either .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,gallifrey,"I 'm still not sure if I liked the episode or not . I definitely did n't like the ending - it just felt like Moffat has watched inception one too many times .

08TangoDown08,gallifrey,I think the Waters of Mars deserves a mention here too - it gave us a look at how dark the Doctor 's dark side can actually be . It even let him explore it a bit as the `` Time Lord victorious '' . I thought it was really interesting to see the Doctor thinking that he 's essentially a god .,Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"You 're still making the same argument . Other people being guilty of the same thing as him does n't make him any less culpable .

There was a time when an awful lot of people thought that slavery is justified - does that mean it is ?

The fact that the `` pedophile prophet '' was n't the only person who did it does n't make him any less guilty . Or culpable .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,gallifrey,I 'm with you on this one . I think the Doctor being the last of his race gave his character a lot of depth .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"Well , are things actually working for Israel as they are now ? It 's already been pointed out that Hamas are still firing rockets , so what have Israel actually achieved so far ? Apart from filling up the morgues with dead civilians ?",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,worldnews,"There 's a difference between a warranted response and a disproportional response . I 'm not saying that Hamas are innocent in this ; far , far from it . But Israel are the ones in control . Their response so far has been massively disproportional . How many of Hamas 's rockets have even landed ? Iron dome stops a lot of them , and the rest are mostly miles off target . Israel , by comparison , have been sending in tanks and fighter jets , to fight in areas populated primarily by civilians .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,worldnews,"So ... that 's why they persisted with air strikes in heavily populated areas ? Yeah , Hamas have a lot to answer for , and they have been using civilians as human shields . But at the end of the day , it was still the bombs and rockets that killed them .",Germanic,English

His was a realistic sending off - the most realistic of all the Doctor 's regenerations if you ask me .

I personally think it 's poor form for Fianna Fail of all parties to be making jabs at Sinn Fein over the Troubles . Fianna Fail were in power long enough to make a difference during that time period but they ( and successive Irish governments ) turned their backs on the Nationalist/Republican communities in the North when their help was needed more than ever - at least until Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach .

They promised universal health care for everyone and this is what they 're actually giving us . Free gp care for a small minority of the population .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ireland is a country that was founded by people with blood on their hands . People who ordered deaths , atrocities , bombings , assassinations - the whole lot . People we 'll be celebrating next year , as it happens . Governments kill people , the only difference is the British government ( and other governments worldwide ) are able to do it without having the term `` terrorist '' applied to them . And yes , the Paras were n't running for any public office , but on the subject of Pat Finucane , it 's claimed that some very senior politicians in Margaret Thatcher 's government knew all about the collusion with the loyalist paramilitaries . You can debate how relevant that is to the discussion if you want but there 's no shortage of politicians on the other side of the fence who have as much , if not more , blood on their hands as Sinn Fein . We never hear as much bloviating about them , do we ? Gerry Adams has been `` playing big boy politics with the grown ups '' for a very long time now - say what you like about him but he 's considered one of the most adept politicians on the island . I do n't think even people who hate the man can deny that the Peace Process was a monumental political achievement ( probably the biggest political achievement since the foundation of the state ) - and it would never have happened without Gerry Adams .

You 're being disingenuous when you say that the Brits have a better record when it comes to apologising for their crimes . They apologised for Bloody Sunday , but it took thirty eight years , a shambles of a report and a twelve year inquiry before they dropped their accusations that the innocent people who were killed attacked the paras first . Maybe you know more than I do , but I do n't recall the British Government ever apologising for Ballymurphy , or even acknowledging their responsibility for it for that matter . Why is n't our media focusing on getting justice for those families too ? Jean McConville 's murder was an atrocity , but why is it more important than the Ballymurphy families ? And this is the problem . There 's always another death , another atrocity and another finger pointing at the other side . The line needs to be drawn somewhere or we just keep going back and forth and the peace process will remain in an uneasy stasis forever , or break down entirely . Personally , I just think it 's deplorable that so many people on this side of the border pick and choose their atrocities because of how they feel about Gerry Adams or Sinn Fein .",Germanic,English

On a daily basis , I see people ( not suggesting you 're one of them ) posting things here that display a general lack of understanding for the reasons why the Troubles started , the reasons they continued for so long and the reasons why they ended - so I tend to comment fairly extensively on the subject when I see it come up .",Germanic,English

Quick reminder of what the `` bad old days '' were like for the ( seemingly large ) number of southerners with short memories ? Daily bomb scares - both real and hoax , public shootings , army checkpoints and thousands of dead and injured victims . And that 's only dealing with the attitude behind the remark . Now I 'll deal with the subject of it . Gerry Adams , love him or hate him , played an absolutely massive role in the peace process and in the decommissioning of the PIRA . Like it or not , the Troubles probably would n't have ended without his intervention . Now , if you can seriously believe that the peace process ( in its near-permanent state of instability ) would not be endangered if Gerry Adams ( or his family ) were to be blown up by dissidents then I 'm not sure what else to say . The peace process is unstable enough that an incident like that could well be the spark that re-ignites the flame .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Oh , grow up . I really hate the self-serving snobbery that so many people here in the republic have when they refer to Sinn Fein and Republicans . This is old ground , but I 'll humour you . Yes , the IRA did some terrible things and yes , horrible people associated themselves with the organisation and republicanism . Do I think Adams is one of them ? No . If it were n't for people like Adams we 'd still be in the dark ol ' days of death and destruction , or there 'd still be a sizeable chunk of Nationalists/Catholics in the North living as second class citizens .

Either way , I 'm not trying to turn yet another thread on /r/Ireland into a political debate over the moralities of Sinn Fein , you 're not going to change your opinion because of an internet debate and nor am I - I was merely pointing out a hypocrisy that I 'd noted on `` Renua '' 's website .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It 's funny how their website states that they will consider going into government with any of the other political parties except for Sinn Fein , due to their lack of `` transparency '' . I 'm sorry ... have the past 2 coalitions been visions of transparency themselves ? The government who covertly brought the troica here and the government whose entire tenure has been wracked with scandals and incompetency ? They seem to be desperately searching for a niche to fill . With the pending downfall of Labour and the extinction of the PD 's and Greens , I suppose the next government party will need a new whipping boy .

And that 's more than fair , if you ask me . You 're treating the symptom as if it were the cause . There 's a bloody reason why people are n't arsed to learn their country 's language - and as far as I 'm concerned , putting it down to sheer laziness is an oversimplification . The fact is , the Irish language is pushed on everyone from a fairly young age , you 're made to learn it because that 's what 's required of you , not because you actually like speaking it . It takes away any real love for the language when you 're forced to do it incessantly , even if you do n't like learning off poems and stories by heart . EDIT : On top of that , you never really `` speak '' the language anyway . Aside from the stupid Leaving Cert oral , most of your time is spent learning the same sort of pseudo-academic shite that you learn off for English - the only difference being that most people are already fluent with English and it is n't as tedious .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yeah fair point , it 's been neglected by every government in recent memory . I still think the buck stops with the government in power though . I absolutely hate the fact that I spent about thirteen years of my life learning a language that I 'm still terrible at . What I hate even more is the fact that the way it 's taught makes it extremely tedious for most students to learn , who will then lose any interest in pursuing it when they get older . Kenny 's right about one thing , it 's our national language - but it 's to his ( and every Taoiseach and government in recent memory 's ) shame that the majority of people in Ireland are in the same position as Mick Wallace .",Germanic,English

If he was a member of the IRA then people need to remember that there was a reason he did n't come out and admit to it like McGuinness did , one that was n't just limited to saving face . He needed to be in a position to negotiate with politicians and government officials who would be a lot less willing to interact with him if he had publicly admitted to being an IRA member , and he also needed to have some influence with IRA hardliners to be able to bring anything to the negotiating table .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Your words , not mine . But perhaps you need a bit of perspective . Catholics and Nationalists were second-class citizens in the North . A Catholic did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant or a Unionist in the Orange State . Hundreds and thousands of them could n't get social housing because protestants and loyalists were favoured for it before them . Civil rights marches were brutally and savagely put down by the RUC and , afterwards , the British Army . And that 's where a lot of this started . The protestors in those early days were n't actually campaigning for a united Ireland . They were marching for civil rights - and they were being tramped on by their own police force . Some of them turned to violence because they 'd reached the end of their tolerance - we can debate how right or wrong that is in a separate discussion but I do n't think it 's our place to judge people who felt they had no alterEnglish either . While obviously not on the same scale as apartheid in South Africa , I do n't think anyone can argue that there are n't a few massive similarities .

In peacetime , the North can muster ( at the very most ) 40000 men , but it very rarely does , because the North is so vast it makes mustering their full manpower extremely difficult . Robb had 18000 troops , and most of them are either dead or scattered now . The North , militarily speaking , is n't much of a threat to the Southern Kingdoms at the moment , but it 's still strong enough to destroy them in a defensive war if a Southern army is stupid enough to attack them in the Neck .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"For me , Rickon represents the future of House Stark . Feudal laws say that Bran is higher than Rickon in the line of succession , but I honestly ca n't see Bran ever returning from the cave of the three-eyed crow . I believe he 'll remain there , and continue doing whatever it is that Bloodraven does . Jon Snow is a bastard , and despite the many theories kicking around that he 's been legitimised by Robb , I just ca n't see it happening . Even if he has been legitimised , even if he 's survived his caeser-ing and even if he continues to ride south , it 's completely and totally against his character for him to place himself ahead of Sansa or ( fake ) Arya ( the only siblings he knows to be still alive ) in the line of succession . He might try and fight against the Boltons , but he wo n't claim Winterfell . Sansa is a woman . Should Bran , Rickon or even a legitimised Jon Snow appear , they 're all ahead of her in the line of succession . The Northerners would never support her over one of Eddard 's sons , which is why I can not see her holding the North . At least , not permanently . Arya is the least likely of the lot to inherit the North . She 's stuck with the Faceless Men , and who knows where she 'll end up after that . For these reasons , I 'm fairly certain that Rickon will eventually inherit the North . The majority of the Northern lords would n't hesitate to offer him their fealty , especially if his wolf is with him .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister is perfect . Absolutely spot on , I 'm now picturing Tywin as he is in the show when I re-read the books , and that 's something . He 's made Tywin look like even more of a badass . Sean Bean was fantastic as Ned Stark . What can I say , the man knows how to die . Peter Dinklage needs no explanation . Michael McElhatton is cold , calculating and always carries a silent threat . Perfect for Roose Bolton . Iain Glen does a superb job as Jorah Mormont . He 's got the voice that 's delivered some of the shows more memorable quotes . Stephen Dillane is a great actor , and he plays the part of Stannis excellently . The problem is how the part itself is written . They 've all but butchered his character . Catelyn is probably one of my least favourite characters in the series . Despite this Michelle Fairley was superb . I still do n't like the character , but her performance was flawless . All in all , the quality of the cast for AGOT is excellent . I ca n't really say that any character 's main faults stem from a poor performance by their actor . The biggest problem I have with the show is how they 've messed with a few character 's story arcs . Stannis , Mance , Shae and Talisa to name a few . I did n't see these changes as being necessary .",Germanic,English

Also , it 's probably another reason why Tywin stayed neutral in Robert 's Rebellion , Jaime was the only member of the Kingsguard that Aerys kept close to him , essentially keeping him as a glorified hostage to ensure his father 's good behaviour . It backfired pretty badly on Aerys , though . Edit : Jaime and Cersei had been conspiring to get Jaime on the Kingsguard anyway . Tywin was Hand of the King at the time , and Cersei believed that if Jaime was named to the Kingsguard , he 'd be close to her at all times . However , when he actually joined the KG , Tywin was furious and resigned as Hand of the King , taking Cersei back to Casterly Rock with him and leaving Jaime with the King .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Religion was n't what started the conflict and the PIRA did n't gain their support among the nationalist community simply because they were Catholic . The conflict was a political one from the very beginning . One side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of power over the other and abused this authority for their own benefit . When the Nationalist community began to push back against this with civil rights marches , they were violently put down by Loyalist gangs , the RUC and eventually the British Army . This led to the growth of the PIRA . In the late 60 's and early 70 's , people did n't join the IRA for religious reasons - they joined for political reasons . The effort to portray this as a simple conflict of religions is , to me , an effort to oversimplify the conflict and absolve the British government and Loyalist communities of a lot of the blame that they are due because of their respective roles in starting the conflict to begin with .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"With respect , you do n't really seem to know what you 're talking about . There was a massive , massive division in the North during the Troubles .

I 'm not justifying all of their actions , but the IRA did n't form for no reason . They had the support of a lot of oppressed Catholic communities . Read [ this ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius ) and tell me that oppression of the Catholic population was n't a thing . It was . Members of my family experienced it , too . A lot of ( presumably southern ) people in this thread are condemning Sinn Fein because the IRA committed atrocities . They did , and that 's deplorable . But Sinn Fein were an absolutely massive part of the peace process . It would n't have happened without them , plain and simple .

The lines are blurred , there are plenty of people on both sides of the border who have an interest in what goes on across it .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"If the two governments are serious about maintaining a healthy and strong relationship then surely collusion is something that just needs to be discussed at some point ? Ireland ( North and South ) and Britain need to be able to move past these issues eventually and that 's only going to happen when both governments put all of their cards on the table and take responsibility for their respective roles in the conflict . I think the Saville report into Bloody Sunday had a positive effect on Anglo-Irish relations , for example . I agree , I do n't think any of that is likely to happen unless we get a truth and reconciliation commission that has the ability to deal with collusion . And I do n't think we will see such a commission in the near future .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,I find it disgusting that the only time an Irish government will bring these things up is when there 's an anniversary .

SF must be secretly rubbing their hands together in gleeful anticipation of a Brexit , even if they 're outwardly campaigning against it .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I think you 're being ridiculous . You 're saying that we should n't criticise the British Empire for its many , many failings because why exactly ? Other empires were doing it too ? That 's complete nonsense . It 's like saying we should n't criticise Nazi Germany for their brutal anti-Semitism because anti-Semitism was relatively common in that time period . The British Empire had no shortage of contemporary critics either - internal and external . You seem to be implying that orchestrated famines , forced relocations , concentration camps and other atrocities carried out under colonialism were so commonplace and everyday that everybody was completely fine with it until the modern era , and that all of this outrage over it is simply applied retrospectively . That 's just patently untrue and I think you know it is . The point I am making is one that falls largely in line with the point the author of the article was making . The British Empire was responsible for some good things , but also for a massive number of bad things . The good things are endlessly praised and the bad things are shoved under the rug and never talked about . I do n't think that 's how it should be .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Yes and you rarely hear about the fact that Gandhi disliked blacks or refused to give his dying wifep enicilin , instead opting to have faith in God ( but happily using the penicilin when he was ill himself ) .

I 'm not a huge fan of Gandhi 's either ... but I think you 're being a bit pedantic when you decide to focus in on me mentioning him instead of addressing the overarching point that I was trying to make . You 're right , Churchill is celebrated for his actions during WW2 - I 've said as much , and that 's exactly my point . You never hear about the rest of it . The same attitude is applied to most aspects of the British Empire . The good things are praised and the bad things are ignored .",Germanic,English

Britain just does n't talk about the damage that their empire has done throughout the world . They just do n't . People like Winston Churchill are endlessly praised for some of the good things that they 've done but the bad things are almost completely overlooked . You 'll never hear anyone talk about what Churchill 's racist view of the American Indians and Australian aborigines were for example . You 'll never hear about his hatred for Gandhi and Indian independence , or even his abysmal record in Ireland . Let 's not forget that we have Churchill to thank for the Black and Tans . You 'll only hear about how he saved Britain during WW2 and how he should be revered for it . He was even voted the greatest ever Briton by the public . Britain will take responsibility for all of the good things their Empire did and achieved , but they 'll take no responsibility for the famines , massacres , slavery , persecutions and the rest of the many evils that their Empire carried out and enabled . I think that 's the core issue .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The British Government ( and population in general ) do n't like to think that they 're in any way responsible for the shit-show that was the Troubles .

Corbyn clearly is n't someone who holds that viewpoint and he 's brave enough to make that clear . That 's a refreshing thing for a political leader to do , if you ask me - but it will not go down well with the British electorate . The media will crucify him over the IRA and it 'll probably cause him irreparable damage . Meanwhile , we 'll get to sit back and watch the British media once again rewrite history and pretend that the only reason the PIRA existed was because a bunch of bloodthirsty savages got up one morning and decided they wanted to kill for a united Ireland .",Germanic,English

The Queen visited our garden of remembrance - she did n't build her own in the grounds of Buckingham palace .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm almost 100 % certain that the British do not commemorate Irish soldiers who died fighting against them in the 1916 rising . Are you trying to say that they do ? Commemorating Irish men who fought and died fighting with the British in WW1 is not the same thing . I also happen to think that there 's a difference between moving on from the events of a conflict and actively commemorating the soldiers of the wrinkled old Empire that you were fighting against . If you think we should be commemorating them , fair enough . I do n't think we have any obligation to . Try applying your argument to a different situation . For Britain to have a healthy relationship with Germany , they should commemorate the soldiers who died fighting for the Nazis along with their own ? America should commemorate dead Japanese servicemen ? Serbia should commemorate soldiers who died fighting for the Austro-Hungarian Empire ? Come on . You know that 's nonsense .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Hardly an apples to apples comparison . Where are the commemorations for the dead of the 1916 rising happening in the UK ? Show me where the British are commemorating our soldiers who died fighting them , please . Then you might have the ghost of a point . As it stands you 're just being vitriolic for the sake of it . SF are saying something that a lot of people will be thinking . I 'm not even sure what your argument is . I do n't think SF expects the unionist community in the North to hold commemorations for dead IRA members .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I think we 're talking about two different things here . The British military was always going to reply no matter where or when the conflict began - that still does n't mean that we have any obligation to commemorate soldiers who fought for an empire that has a history of oppressing our country . I have nothing against people who do wish to commemorate them , because I understand that they 're probably doing so out of respect for the dead on both sides . That 's fine . But I also think that SF 's position on this is a very legitimate one to take .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"They 've gotten over a lot , to be fair . Last year Gerry Adams shook hands with Prince Charles . A couple of years before that , Martin McGuinness met with Queen Elizabeth and a couple of years before that he was going into power with Ian Paisley . I recognise that the British royals ( Charles in particular ) also had to overcome their own misgivings , but I think you 're being a being a bit unfair here . I think that their city mayors also laid wreaths to commemorate British soldiers who died fighting in the world wars . I 'm all for removing this outdated hostility for the British but I do think that this is a step too far . These were British soldiers who were actively killing and bombing Irish people and an Irish city . We have no obligation to commemorate them , in the slightest .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Fuck ... that 's like , the opposite of the luck of the Irish . Poor bastard . It really did n't matter who you were - anyone could be interned and there was nothing you or anyone else could do to prevent it if the police came for you .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I know , and I think that 's regrettable - because it 's such a narrow and simplistic explanation for the conflict . In the early days , the civil rights marches that would lead to the IRA gaining support had absolutely nothing to do with a united Ireland . That did n't stop the RUC from beating their peaceful protests off the streets and it did n't stop loyalist gangs from burning catholics and nationalists out of their homes . Which , incidentally , is why the British army was sent in to begin with . To protect Catholic communities . You 'd be amazed how many people do n't know that - they assume that the British army was sent in to fight the IRA .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I ca n't give a solid answer regarding the war of independence but internment was used after the 1916 rising . There was a pretty interesting documentary on TG4 about it a while back actually , over a thousand Irishmen who fought in the rising were interned in a detention camp in Wales . Apparently that 's where Michael Collins began to gain more and more influence in the IRB . It supposedly became a training ground for would be Irish revolutionaries who would then fight in the war of independence . So , fairly safe to say that it did n't work out too well there either .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Internment was a complete and utter disaster in the North . The H Blocks became a symbol of state oppression and only helped to further the IRA 's propaganda campaign against the Orange State . It got even worse in the 80 's when prisoners had their special category status removed - that 's what led to the hunger strikes . The problem with internment is that it represents an erosion of civil liberties . In the North , thousands of people were imprisoned throughout internment and you only needed to be suspected of being associated with the IRA to end up in the maze . I do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say that a huge percentage of people who ended up in the maze were not criminals , and were not members of the IRA . As you point out , that may well have changed by the time they were released . Ireland is n't the only country in the world that has a problem with gangland crime . We do n't need to lower ourselves to removing citizen 's rights in order to deal with this problem .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yes ... because internment worked so brilliantly in the North and elsewhere . What an absolutely moronic suggestion . Can anyone think of another western nation that has decided to bring in imprisonment without trial to deal with gangland crime ? It 's completely absurd . Why do n't we start by upping the Garda numbers , making sure they 're properly equipped and then attempting to deal with the massive income inequality that plagues Dublin 's north inner city ? Or , do what Portugal did and decriminalise drugs for those possessing up to a ten day 's supply . Seems to be working alright for them .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"True , but I 'm not convinced that their gain in seats is solely down to their ability to manoeuvre their way out of tight spots . FG were not popular in government and they owed their success to a lot of voters who abandoned FF after the crash - a lot of those voters have more than likely simply switched back to FF .

You also still seem to think that they 're still the same entity , even post GFA - which is ridiculous . You 're judging modern-day SF by the actions of the PIRA 20 , 30 and 40 years ago .

You 're trying to say that modern day SF supporters do n't want to talk about it - that 's not the problem . That 's all I ever seem to talk about here - the problem is that that 's all the other political parties ever want to talk about . Where was that concern when it was actually happening ? Where 's the concern for the Ballymurphy families or other victims of British state violence ? This is what happens when you pick a side - you force everyone else to pick a side too and whataboutery is what you get . I really wish you 'd stop trying to portray people who voted for SF as being in some way supportive of atrocities that happened 40 years ago . If you 're trying to get me to say that I agree with how the PIRA disappeared people then you 're wasting your time - because it 's indefensible and I 'm not trying to defend it . But to try to imply that the entire SF political party and those who support it are in some way responsible for that is disgusting . And it needs to stop . To answer your question a bit more directly , no . I still think that people and media outlets who consistently use this as a political football do n't actually give a shit about the Disappeared - or any of the other victims of the IRA .

People were always trying to get them to turn to politics , and if they did n't have a political wing then it would have been immeasurably more difficult to turn them away from violence through political means . As for giving a fuck about the IRA 's victims , do people who use them as an excuse to attack SF really give a fuck about them either ?

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Why is it that Irish people often consider it unacceptable to vote for SF because of the actions of the PIRA but at the same time , seem to think it 's acceptable to use the victims of the PIRA as a stick to beat SF with at every opportunity ? It 's pathetic .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"The actions ( or inactions ) of the British Government in the North are the reasons why the PIRA existed to begin with . They 're certainly the reasons why the PIRA gained so much support from previously moderate nationalists and catholics . The British response to peaceful civil rights marches , in which catholics were looking for equal voting rights among other things , was to beat them off the streets . When the unionists began to commit increasingly violent crimes against catholic minority communities ( Bombay Street ) , the British sent the army in to protect the catholics ( amazing how many people do n't know that ) . The army soon became worse than the RUC and we had Bloody Sunday and other atrocities as a result . I think the growth of the PIRA was a regrettable , but absolutely inevitable and predictable event given the circumstances that some catholic communities found themselves in . Violence begets violence and all that . The IRA are obviously responsible for the violent acts that they 've committed , of course they are . And the IRA committed some unspeakable acts - but they were a response to an existing situation . Instead of ceding a few basic human rights to the catholic communities , the British responded with violence , sometimes extreme violence . They also fed into the growing popularity of the IRA among nationalists by bringing in things like internment - which made them appear like monsters and gave the IRA even more of a reason to market themselves as freedom fighters . I do n't think the actions of the two groups can be viewed through the same lens because the circumstances surrounding these actions are completely different .",Germanic,English

I 'm not saying you suggested that , but I 've seen others state that before here . And no , I do n't think I 'm contradicting myself when I say that Hume had a huge role and also when I say that their main contribution was involving SF and enabling them to turn the IRA away from violence - because that 's exactly what the SDLP did . The point I was making is that I do n't see how these perceived risks that the SDLP took to involve SF are any more serious than the risks SF took to turn the IRA away from violence .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ah yes , here 's that other kind of bot that posts the same crap in every thread that mentions SF . I think I was taking suggestions on what to call you people ... Finnerbots sounds good to me .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm well aware of the Hume-Adams dialogue and the role of the SDLP . But to pretend that a peace process could have been in any way possible without the involvement of Sinn Fein and the PIRA is nothing short of wilful ignorance . Hume played a huge role in the peace process , but the peace process could never have happened if you did n't have people within SF and the PIRA willing to take huge risks in order to turn the PIRA away from violence . Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake . The problem is that people seem to think that it was down to Hume and the SDLP alone - when their whole contribution to the peace process centered almost entirely around involving and in many cases depending on SF and the moderate elements of the IRA to bring an end to the violence being orchestrated by the IRA .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I think what he and Adams have achieved regarding the IRA and the peace process is , in one word , incredible . To turn an extremely violent organisation like the PIRA away from violence and to have them willingly destroy the majority of their weaponry under international supervision is something that , as far as I 'm aware , has n't happened anywhere else in the world . I do n't think you need to be a RA head or a SF supporter to recognise just how big that achievement is .",Germanic,English

The Provisional IRA ( or just IRA as you know them ) decommissioned their weapons in 2005 and have been in a ceasefire from well before that . The groups who have been carrying out attacks since then are smaller groups that had splintered off from the PIRA .

08TangoDown08,Music,"I would n't say the atrocities arose as a result of the differences between North and South at all , they arose because of the differences between the Protestants and Catholics in the North itself and the disproportionate amount of power that one side ( Protestants ) had over the other side ( Catholics ) . Probably not the best place to get into it though ! Great song !",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,Music,"There 's more to it than just Catholic vs Protestant yes , of course there is . My point was that the conflict arose because one side had a disproportionate amount of authority over the other side and frequently abused the authority that they had . The Troubles did n't start until the catholic/nationalist minority began to march for civil rights and found themselves getting beaten off the streets by the RUC and burned out of their houses by loyalist gangs ( bombay street etc . ) The PIRA gained more and more support from previously moderate nationalists as this continued and we know how it went from there . Obviously this is a very simplistic account , but it 's the jist of what happened . Honestly I 'm more worried about how the Troubles is understood among our own people here than I am about how foreigners understand it - there 's such a lack of knowledge on the subject it 's unbelievable . For example , most Irish people do n't know that the British Army was actually sent into the North to protect the catholics/nationalists from further attacks from loyalist gangs . That 's the reason the army was there , to **protect** those communities . Amazing how many people seem to assume that they were brought in to fight the PIRA .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,Music,"I 'm very well aware of the history and origin of the IRA - the IRA did not cause the Troubles . The IRA were a response to a pre-existing condition in Northern Ireland . Catholics/Nationalists ~~did n't have the same voting rights as loyalists~~ were unable to vote in many cases because of gerrymandered elections , they could n't get social housing , they were frequently denied jobs because of the community they were from and when they tried to change this through peaceful means their civil rights marches were violently crushed by loyalist gangs and the RUC . The IRA gained more and more support from these people as this continued . Again , a simplistic account of what happened , but still close to the mark .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,Music,"It amounted to the same thing . Elections were gerrymandered so that it suited landowners and property owners , when Catholics/Nationalists were excluded from either owning or renting a property on a large scale .

He generates huge interest when he canvasses and that undoubtedly only helps the SF vote . That 's not something any political party will risk losing . But he has had an unusually frequent number of gaffes recently . As someone who 's voted SF , I found his recent tweets to just be plain bizarre ... you 'd think someone with as much political experience as Adams would know to avoid the usage of certain words when addressing the public - apparently not . It 's undoubtedly a concern for SF as they 're probably wary of what he might say or do next - but I honestly think his position 's probably safe until whatever time he decides to retire . That probably wo n't happen until the next GE , or perhaps the one after that if this new minority government does n't last .",Germanic,English

Failing of course to mention that the nationalist/catholic community did not have the same ability to vote as the protestant community . What a grotesque little statelet Northern Ireland was .

You ca n't complain about how it feels to see loyalist killers idolised and then pretend that nationalists do n't do the same . What would you suggest , then ? Each time a victim from one side of the conflict voices their perspective , they should then preface it with a comprehensive account of how the conflict impacted both communities ? You seriously do n't see that as being even a slight bit ridiculous ? Additionally , atrocities and attacks carried out by the IRA and other Nationalist paramilitaries are hardly under-represented or under-discussed in the Republic . It suddenly becomes a massive burning issue of national importance every time a Sinn Fein representative takes to the airwaves - are these broadcasts ( which are heard by a lot more people than this article will have been read by ) prefaced with a discussion on the attacks and atrocities carried out by loyalist and British state forces ?

The IRA as an organisation did predate the Troubles but they were largely inactive until 1969 - after a civil rights campaign orchestrated by nationalists was met with violence by the loyalists the year before . This led to a split in the IRA and the formation of the PIRA , who then began their campaign .

08TangoDown08,Music,"It 's a moot point either way - the fact that there was no legal argument preventing catholics/nationalists from having the same voting rights as protestants does n't change the fact that , for all intents and purposes , they did n't have the same ability to vote .

EDIT : Since you changed your post to call me mealy mouthed , I 'll reply . The fact that explicitly discriminatory legislation was n't enacted is n't the point ( I 'd disagree with that too , let 's not forget internment ) , the point is that a situation existed where one side was still being discriminated against by the other side who held all the cards . The British government did n't intervene with direct rule until the situation had already gotten well out of hand .

The party might not have taken the same positions that it has if he were not the leader . As for `` pulling numbers out their asses '' , it was FG and FF who tugged numbers out of their asses during the whole fiscal space debacle . SF were the only party to get it right .

If the government/eircom were ever properly serious about it they 'd only need to bring the fibre cables as far as a big town and then cover the surrounding area through a transmitter ( something similar to what Imagine are doing ) .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not sure it 's as cut and dry as that though . Say , for the sake of argument , Adams was in the IRA . He could n't publicly admit that during the Troubles because he still had to negotiate with the British Government and Loyalist leaders . At the same time , he could n't cut the IRA loose because he needed enough influence with them to bring them to the table . I know what you 're going to say , that was 30 years ago - but honestly the situation has n't changed all that much . If he admits **now** that he was in the IRA all along , what will that do to the already severely fragile peace-process in the North ? I think there would be a real chance that the DUP and other loyalist parties would refuse to have dialogue with Sinn Fein at all if that were the case . The current crises up there would be a fairly minor footnote compared to the catastrophy that would cause in my opinion , and I think political stability and people 's lives are more important than Adams 's political opponents being able to prove themselves right . And of course , there 's always the other side of the coin - he might never have been in the IRA at all .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Agreed .

It 's certainly not going to advance the peace process . What people like you on `` the internet '' do n't seem to understand is that the peace process could n't have happened without the assistance and participation of people who held influence with the IRA . Now , whether Adams has that influence because he was a high ranking member of it or because he was close friends with a lot of people who **were** high ranking members , is up for debate . He says he was n't , people like you say he was . Either way , it 's a debate that 's literally been happening for decades now - we 're not going to hash it out here on reddit .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Resentment will never lead to lasting peace , and I think you might be overlooking the fact that SF and the PIRA were not the only obstacle . For years , the British government refused to even speak with leading nationalist politicans and they were banned from having their voices heard on public broadcasts - even in the Republic , with Section 31 . I just can not agree with the assertion that a lasting peace could 've been achieved without SF being there to bring the PIRA to the table . As far as justifying the IRA goes , I 'm not sure I 'd go that far - I would n't try to justify what they ended up as , at least . I do n't think it 's as easy to say that they were n't justified in the beginning . But I would also add that I do n't think it 's fair to judge those who decided to join them either - I personally do n't know how I 'd react to living under an oppressive government who viewed me as a second class citizen . They did despicable things , but they were a response to a pre-existing condition - and the British Army did things that were equally as bad . The US army and other armies continue to do the same in other parts of the world now , the only difference is that they are government-sanctioned actions .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not saying the SDLP did n't have a large part to play but I do think you 're overestimating it too . How could the peace process have succeeded without involving the PIRA ? How do you politically involve the PIRA without reaching out to SF ? And if you 're Adams or someone else , how do you convince the PIRA to stop the violence and come to the table ? These were some of the biggest issues faced by the peace process and most of them were overcome to some degree . But you definitely would not have had any kind of lasting peace without involving SF . The Hume-Adams dialogue did a lot more for the peace process than people seem to know .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm a huge fan of John Hume - he achieved remarkable things but he had no influence over the PIRA and realistically , people who held some level of influence over them were needed to bring them to the negotiating table . Otherwise , you 'd have one side at the table without the other . I really do think it 's unrealistic to believe that the peace process could 've went ahead without involving the PIRA or at the very least , SF . Incidentally , that was Hume 's position too . He was largely responsible for bringing SF into the fold after all . I do n't think anyone can deny the huge part Adams played in making the peace process as relatively successful as it is - whatever else you might think of the man .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't think I ever said the PIRA were anything other than a violent organisation , of course they were . They committed atrocities just like the RUC , British army and loyalists did . That 's the problem with constantly looking back in the North - everybody 's hands were dirty . I do agree that things may well have worked out better if everyone had stuck to politics , but that 's an ideal that was never going to happen - there 's no point in dwelling on it now , the reality was violent and brutal . Something had to change and eventually it did , we got the peace process . That would simply not have happened without SF and the influence some of its members had with the PIRA .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Oh for fuck 's sake . Go and read a history book , I 'm fed up explaining Northern Irish politics and history to people in /r/Ireland - so much willful ignorance . The PIRA were a symptom of a much greater problem in the North . They formed because Nationalists/Catholics were second class citizens in an Orange state during the late 60's/early 70 's . They had little to no voting powers , housing authorities routinely passed them over to favour the Protestant majority and they faced huge discrimination from the RUC - culminating in things like the Battle of the Bogside and what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was then that the British Army was sent in - to protect the Catholics . That 's why they were sent over and not many people seem to be willing to remember that now . Instead of protecting the people they were told to protect , they became the biggest problem of the lot . Bloody Sunday was n't the only failure on their list . And so , more and more people ( rightly or wrongly ) joined the PIRA . Sinn Fein emerged as the political wing of the organisation , not the other way around - as some logheads seem to be implying here . Like it or not , you would n't have a peace process without Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others . What amuses me the most about all of this is that for years , people were encouraging and pleading with the PIRA to turn to politics instead - and now that they have ( by and large ) , people are still bitching .

Just because it is n't an ideal alterEnglish does n't mean it is n't an alterEnglish . But if you do n't think that dropping the atomic bombs was about geopolitics - even a little bit - then I do n't know what to say to you . It was about getting one up on the Soviet Union as much as it was about ending a war that was already over .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,WTF,"& gt ; I think I know which one is the best for Japan . Oh , so **that's** what the USA was concerned with was it ? Now that 's the only load of tripe on display here my friend . But , since you asked , I think it 's also worth mentioning that the Potsdam Proclamation did n't address in any way , one of the central surrender conditions for the Japenese - the retention of the emperor . There are more than a few historians who think the Japanese might 've surrendered if that assurance was given . However , that 's still only another item on the list . There are plenty of historians , critics and writers who have assessed the options available to the Allies at that point in the war - and surprisingly enough not all of them deem the atomic bomb to have been necessary . Hell , even people like Eisenhower and McArthur thought it was n't necessary . But I wo n't sit here and do your research for you , so perhaps you should head off to google .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,WTF,"It was n't a necessity . Things are never that black and white . Revisionist history tells us it was a necessity , but it 'd be refreshing for people here to actually research it more themselves . The USA had planned to invade Japan in November but the US leadership then felt that something should be done before the Soviet Union entered that theatre of war . And so , you have the atomic bombs . The Soviet Union brought forward its plans and invaded after the bomb on Hiroshima , but the Japanese then surrendered after the second one on Nagasaki . The bombs were about geopolitics , not `` ending the war '' . The war was already over . EDIT : Obviously that 's not the whole story , but it 's a part of it .

08TangoDown08,WTF,"The alterEnglish was that Japan surrenders anyway to the Soviet Union , who began their planned invasion between the dropping of the two bombs .

It was really about geopolitics in the end , and we got the cold war as a result .",Germanic,English

Incidentally , the protests in the late 60 's and early 70 's had absolutely fuck all to do with a united Ireland . That 's not what gave the PIRA their support . Large numbers of people flocked to join their ranks because of how they were treated by the orange state . The IRA always stated their goal as being a united Ireland . Always . That was n't going to change simply because they had more people in the organisation or because they had more public support .

You did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant , you could n't get housing from local authorities who systematically favoured Protestants over you , you found it tougher to get a job because most business owners were Protestant and would never hire a Catholic and you could n't air your grievances in public because the RUC would come down on your protests like a ton of bricks .

And when I say I do n't care , I mean I do n't care if he was a member of the IRA or not . There 's nothing to gain from finding out for certain that he was n't a member , and there 's potentially a lot at stake if we find out for certain that he was . Finding out he was a member is n't exactly going to strengthen the already weakened Peace Process . The DUP were almost willing to tear it up over something we already knew was the case ( the PIRA still existing ) - there 's a pretty real chance they 'd walk out completely if Adams came out and said he was in the IRA . In short , I do n't see any advantage in finding out for sure either way . Politicians in the Republic who keep throwing accusations at Adams are doing so to further their own political agendas and not out of any sort of concern for NI or the peace process - they ignore these problems until there 's political capital to be had in paying attention to it .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't care if he was and I could write yet another long post explaining exactly why I do n't care . That being said , I do have a problem with people saying things like he ordered the murders of innocent people when they have absolutely no proof showing that he did . There 's as much evidence showing that he did as there is showing that he did n't , ie . None .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"So ... people who lead countries have never ordered the deaths of innocent people and Gerry Adams ( if what you 're saying is even true ) will be the first one ever ? Incidentally , I 'm pretty sure you 've no proof that he 's ordered the deaths of anyone and yet you 're apparently certain that he did . I can already hear the cries of `` Shinnerbot '' being directed towards me because apparently it 's fine to be guilty of something with no proof if you 're a member/supporter of SF .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"She 's hardly the first person to ask Gerry Adams about paramilitarism . He 's asked about that every time he makes a radio/tv appearance , even if it has absolutely nothing to do with why he 's appearing .

You people act as if it 's a fucking crime to support SF , all I can really say is grow the hell up . Try living in a catholic/nationalist community in west Belfast , or a rural community in Donegal and see which political party shows you the most interest . The most hateful thing is people will then go on and attempt to lecture me on SF 's history - when I 'm fairly sure I know it better than they do .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yep , my brother and my recently graduated sister are in the same boat . I 'll be out of college within the next couple of weeks .

I understand that that 's got a lot to do with the course they entered in the first place , but still . There 's a few areas that could do with a lot more highly-qualified people working in them ( such as social care , as mentioned by /u/IceVest ) .

Bertie had no influence over the IRA and neither did John Hume . Adams did - either because he was a senior member of it or because he was connected with people like Martin McGuinness who were senior members , whichever you choose to believe . Somebody needed to bring the IRA to the table and that 's what Adams did . That 's why we got the ceasefire .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Water charges were in Fine Gael 's manifesto . Fair enough , they were . Correct me if I 'm wrong but I do n't think the property tax was ? And they still have yet to abolish the USC , which was supposed to be a temporary tax that was introduced by Fianna Fail . & gt ; If you think that makes them more corrupt than Fianna Fail you have a short memory . The point I 'm making is that despite the rhetoric that FG come out with about Fianna Fail 's corrupt tenure , they 're guilty of more than their fair share of it themselves . I do n't think we should start tallying up the scores to see which is worse ( I think we both know it would be FF ) but the point still stands . For what it 's worth , I 'm not naive enough to think that everything the government is doing is a cynical ploy to better their own position , but I do think that they 've definitely misled the electorate on some very important issues and I do n't think we should let them away with that just because we 've seen some economic improvements for a certain percentage of the population .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not talking about the policies they 've implemented ( some of which I like , by the way - such as the whistleblower 's legislation and legislating for the X Case ) , I 'm referring specifically to those promises that they made and that they 've since broken . Remember Frankfurt 's way or Labour 's way ? Remember Enda Kenny promising universal healthcare after three years in power ? Remember him criticising Fianna Fail 's plans for water charges - before going ahead and implementing them himself ? And that 's before we bring up Alan Shatter , Siteserv , the Garda Penalty Points fiasco , the dismal handling of the water protests and other incidents in which they 've shown either as much corruption as Fianna Fail - or worse . Enda Kenny hardly answers a single question in the Dail without either waffling about something else entirely or resorting to ad hominems . These are the reasons why people are upset with the government and they 're likely why people downvote pro-government posts - rightly or wrongly . I do n't think you can just brush all of those misgivings aside by saying `` well the economy 's doing better sure '' . Yes it is , but I seriously doubt that Fine Gael and Labour are the main reasons for that . Austerity 's reduced the deficit sure , and it 's crippled expenditure , but it has n't given people more money , nor has it encouraged them to spend the money that they do have . Fianna Fail 's austerity budgets were even considered more progressive than Fine Gael and Labour 's .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'll certainly be watching this with interest . Changed times , that 's for sure .

Confronting the past is an important part of that , but so is compromise and respect . I for one am glad to see this happening .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Very much depends on what you mean by back on track . It 's back on track for some people , but hardly for everyone . We 're paying more individual taxes now than ever before and the two government parties have successively broken almost every main promise they made - which got them elected in the first place . On top of that , Ireland 's a very attractive place for international companies because it 's the only country in the eurozone whose first language is English . I do n't think our `` recovery '' is down to Fine Gael at all - I think the same `` recovery '' would 've occurred no matter who was in power and we might even be in a better place now if we depended less on archaic austerity measures for our `` recovery '' . EDIT : And as pointed out by /u/LFCMick elsewhere in this thread , the economic recovery is localised almost entirely to Dublin and the main cities . There has n't been much of a recovery up here in Donegal where I live - the roads are shocking , small towns and villages are dead and it 's as tough as ever for young people to find jobs .

123xyz123xyz,science,So you 're suggesting his comment was along the lines of `` I wish other people would pay more for this thing ! It 's ridiculous how little other people are spending on this thing ! '' Did I get that right ? Because to me that sounds like a great way to look outraged about something without actually having to personally do anything .,Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,science,"So 29 billion is ridiculous , and we should force other people to pay more for this research ? How much more money should be spent ? Who should decide how the money is spent ? How will they ensure the money is effectively spent ? Would you personally force other people to pay for this ? Because I am assuming you are talking about using the force of government to take money from some people and give it to researchers . If you would n't personally force people to pay for this , why does it become okay for others to do it on your behalf ? Perhaps things like funding this research ( which some of us consider important , and some of us do not consider important ) should be achieved in a non-coercive way . I 'm sure many people would chip in money to support this , and we would n't have to worry about the resentment and politics of people who do n't want to pay . Personally I would donate to this . But from what I can see , the vast majority of replies to my comment are suggesting funding this through taxation . And taxation removes choice from the equation . And I really resent being forced to pay for things . I 'm sure you do too . Do you like having to fund the trillion-dollar military-industrial complex ? Let 's work towards achieving important things without forcing each other to foot the bill . Perhaps then we would n't have to worry so much about who 's vying for the Whitehouse every four years .",Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,science,"I 'd be happier with a system where we personally get to decide where our tax dollars go . I think it would definitely be a step in the right direction . Personally I would n't allocate a quarter of my spending to the military-industrial complex ! I like science , so having the choice to spend money on projects like fusion research would be very cool . The choice is important . Without choice we have no freedom .",Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,science,"How do you know ? I mean , I 'd love for fusion to be viable , and it certainly looks like it could be , but how much of other people 's money are you willing to risk on this ? How much research pans out , and how much is a dead-end ? Are you personally willing to force other people to pay for this ? And if you 're not , what makes it okay to have others enforce this in your behalf ? Perhaps we could find ways of achieving important things without resorting to coercion ? And maybe the very act of having to convince rather than coerce will lead to better outcomes ?",Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,science,"Is fusion research a guaranteed win ? Is it a problem that can be solved by pouring more money and resources into it ? How much money will it take ? Are you willing to find that amount by forcing others to keep paying for it until we achieve success ? What about people who are too old to reap the benefits ? Should they be forced to pay ? What about people who do n't want to pay ? Will you force them ? What about those of us who do not wish to be forced to pay ? Will you make them submit , with violence if necessary ? What about the man who will not submit , even when violence is brought to bear ? Will you advocate for his death ? Because that is how violent situations ultimately end , is n't it ? Is n't it really `` submit or die '' ?

123xyz123xyz,Dreams,"Incredible dreams . I am truly sorry for what you experienced as a child . Two themes strike me : One : deep injustice is occurring , and it is not entirely hidden . In fact , many times it is out in the open , with witnesses who do nothing . The signs are very clear , and yet no one asks if you need help , or how things are going . It is not just the abusers who have mistreated you . Many others are complicit and turned a blind eye . I 'm really really sorry about that . Realizing this as you mature into an adult can give you new insight , and it becomes enraging as you realize how little others cared . Which leads to ... Two : as you mature into an adult , you are now able to fight back . Your body and your mind now knows your capacity to fight and to win . These motherfuckers can not get away with it anymore . When we are young and abused it is much safer to suppress our anger . It is too dangerous to act upon our rage and to fight back , so we squash our anger to protect ourselves . But now that you are literally able to smash these cunts to a pulp , your mind is letting go of some of the suppression of anger . You are feeling this anger now , and a deep part of you wants to act on your anger to protect yourself and those you care about . You want justice , and you can now fight for it . You 've already been to years of counseling , well done . I would definitely recommend continuing that and talking to a therapist . In university they offer it for free , usually . Working through this ( justified ) lethal rage will help you immensely . Again , I 'm really sorry . I will try to do my part to stop these things from happening to kids . Good luck , friend .",Germanic,English

Such problems flow inexorably from the fact that politicians and bureaucratsânot patients and doctorsâare given the authority to allocate limited health care resources . Yet proponents of socialized medicine insist that a single-payer health care system is the only way to solve the structural problems of the U.S. health care system . They conve- niently ignore or explain away the flaws of sin- gle-payer systems , arguing that we could design a better system and spend more money than Britain and Canada , thus getting better results . But the failures of socialized medicine are evident in every country that implements it , and there is no reason to believe that a sin- gle-payer system in the United States would be any different . Advocates of national health insurance would do well to look at how coun- tries like Germany , Sweden , and Australia are choosing free-market reforms to alleviate the problems of their national health systems . Through painful experience , many of the countries that once heralded the benefits of government control have learned that the best remedy for their countries â health care crises is not increasing government power , but increas- ing patient power instead .",Germanic,English

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Stefan Molyneux also wrote a book about this titled Practical Anarchy . [ The book is free here . ] ( http : //m.freedomainradio.com/ ) & gt ; Imagine a world without government â this thought exercise seems impossible for many , because the power and reach of state monopolies is so omnipresent in our lives . However , there is no rational , economic or moral reason to assume that governments are necessary for the provision of roads , healthcare , charity , dispute resolution , courts , policing , national defense , jails â or any of the other services currently monopolized by the state . & gt ; Governments are extremely dangerous , responsible for over 250 million deaths in the 20th century alone â if it is possible to run a society without a government , surely this is something that we must strive towards as a species . & gt ; Practical Anarchy makes strong case for the private â that is to say voluntary â provision for public services . It reveals the idea of government as a dangerous and unnecessary anachronism , and points the way towards a peaceful and voluntary future for mankind .",Germanic,English

123xyz123xyz,HomeworkHelp,"Decrease all taxes so the consumers have more money to spend . But your professor probably does n't want to hear that . Your professor probably wants to hear this : - increase taxes on wheat submarket for biofuel , which will disincentivize usage of wheat for biofuel , thus increasing supply of wheat for wheat submarkets that deal in wheat food products and cattle feed . This increased supply will decrease prices for consumers . - allocate revenue from biofuel taxes to spend on wheat farmer subsidies , which encourages the growth of supply of wheat , which decreases price of wheat . But this is short-sighted thinking ( even though it is probably what your prof wants to hear ) . Here are some negative effects : - local biofuel businesses now have less money , and may have to lay off employees and forgo spending on capital investment . - businesses reliant on biofuel will have to absorb price increases ( possibly laying off workers or forgoing capital investment as well ) or use a biofuel alterEnglish to remain competitive , further hurting the biofuel market . - wheat farmers are now receiving subsidies to increase production of wheat , which messes up market signals . ( Do consumers actually want more wheat ? No . Or else they 'd have started buying more wheat . ) This injection of money encourages malinvestment across the wheat farming sector ( farmers buying tractors they did n't need in free market conditions , farmers purchasing more land to plant more wheat , things like that ) . - Because consumers did n't actually want more wheat , this oversupply of wheat will displace other products ( quite literally if it 's going in silos that would have housed other grain ) . It may be used in the production of new products in other markets , displacing existing products e.g . wheat-derived sugar becomes cheap enough to compete with cane sugar , putting the squeeze on the sugar cane industry . - Fortunately wheat can be stored indefinitely . But meat can not . The lower cost of wheat-based cattle-feed will encourage the overproduction of meat . Some of this meat will spoil . Taking from some people so that you can give to others always has negative consequences . There are alternate methods for solving this problem that do not wreak havoc on the markets , and on people 's lives . Off the top of my head , the government could reduce taxes on futures trading to encourage speculation on the future price of wheat . This will smooth out price fluctuations , preventing nasty surprises to poor people who subsist on bread .",Germanic,English

The Luxembourg agreement reduced the butter quota by roughly 17 % and the cheese quota by roughly 68 % over 5 years . Quantities were reduced further after 1977 , to about half the 1973 levels .

This was due partly to the recovery of other economies after the war , and their ability to compete on price and quality with British exporters . But it was also a by-product of Britain â s EEC membership . When Britain entered the EEC all bilateral agreements between New Zealand and Britain had to be terminated .

The situation is kinda similar to what happened with Bernie . Ron Paul had massive popular support but got screwed by the party insiders . So now we have our chance to rebuild the party , and Trump has a wider appeal than Ron Paul while not being as ideologically consistent . So we 're taking our chances and clawing the power away from the insiders . Not enough people will get behind the Libertarian party because they see it as a wasted vote . One last thing : the disdain for `` cucks '' is a powerful sea-change in the political landscape . Conservatives are sick of having to support ineffectual politicians . Having someone who will stick to their guns and get us the change we want while not taking any bullshit is a very refreshing sight .

One is Alicia Ortega and the other is Nuria Piera , Nuria is Dominican Republic 's Alex Jones.. She 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate JosÃ© Francisco PeÃ±a Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly PeÃ±a Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press PeÃ±a Gomez vudÃº ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... .

123xyz123xyz,Anarcho_Capitalism,"A right is something we would consider enforceable with violence , E.g . I have the right to my property , and if you steal it , I can enforce my right to my property with violence ( taking it back or forcing you to give it back ) . This example is a negative right , or the right to be free from coercion . The problem with rights is the conception of positive rights , aka obligations to someone else 's property or labor . A right to someone else 's property or labor should only exist when both parties have agreed to it . The one exception being raising kids , since kids ca n't agree to being raised , so the creation of a child must put a positive obligation on the parent . Any other positive obligation must necessitate a violation of someone 's negative rights , E.g . your right to healthcare violates my property rights , since taxation is theft and I have n't agreed to it . So positive rights violate negative rights , which logically negates them . We are left with negative rights as being the only legitimate kind of rights . But honestly , if someone is drowning I doubt no one would help . That would be a total dick move . If it was my kid that drowned and someone could have helped , I would be so enraged . I do n't see how this creates a positive obligation on the part of a bystander , but it should be a rule in any civilized society . If you do n't help people when you easily could have , then we wo n't have anything to do with you . This does n't give anyone the right to attack or steal from the cowardly bystander , but we do n't have to interact with him or help him . We never had that obligation to begin with . This is how a real `` social contract '' should work . Not with forced obligations , but with the understanding that you can be ostracized at any time , so do n't be a dick .",Germanic,English

But the majority of families still have a subtext of emotional manipulation and physical threats lurking in their relationships , with these patterns having formed deep in early childhood .

Politicians and the media lie repetitively . So most people are programmed by milder forms of manipulation than an outright narcissist would inflict , but still , they are programmed . To highlight this , imagine the response you ( or any child ) would get if you protested going to school . Not many parents would take you seriously , and even good parents would listen to your complaints , but then convince you that you must go , eventually turning you against your own feelings . It is an extremely rare parent that truly cares what their child thinks and feels . So when these programmed people -- and lets not kid ourselves , most people are programmed unless they have gone through a journey of rigorous self-knowledge -- when these people encounter a master manipulator at the height of their skills , their response is an unconscious allegiance to power rather than to virtue or principle or love . A peacefully raised person on the other hand , will immediately see through the strange display that a narcissist puts on . This is because the peacefully raised individual is in tune with their natural thoughts and emotions . Also , consider the world of politics today . All of these politicians are master manipulators , and yet the majority of people will go out and support one or the other candidate . It takes a fair amount of self-knowledge to act in a non-conditioned way . As a reader of this subreddit , you are likely much further along than the majority of `` normal '' people , even if you regard yourself as damaged in someway . The world of `` normal '' people still has a long way to go . Decent people would defend others against malice .",Germanic,English

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude . Tl ; dr there have always been political movements advocating `` freedom to '' and `` freedom from '' , or equality vs liberty .",Germanic,English

But there are a lot of poor people that still will not be able to afford to own their own home . The entire burden of this is now placed on that group of poor people .

123xyz123xyz,newzealand,"Landlords have economies of scale , which owner-occupiers do not . Why would owner-occupiers be more economically efficient ? Rental property tends to have denser populations than owner-occupier property , which makes it more economically efficient . You 'd require quite high rental-property taxes to get renters to decide to switch to buying a home . But there will always be people who can not afford to be owner-operators , so they are stuck with increased rents . And would n't there be now be an incentive for lower value property to be used for rentals , since lower value means lower property taxes ? So now the poor people stuck renting have to live in industrial slums . I do n't see this tax being a win for anyone , except those who own low value property -- and that 's only compared to everyone else who has to bear the costs by either changing their living situation , or by paying more rent . Edit : also , as I said in another comment , mortgage rates will increase as the demand for home loans increases with more people flooding the home-owner market . This does n't help anyone . And the Reserve bank would probably respond to those higher rates by lowering the OCR to bring bank interest rates back down , which will artificially stimulate the rest of the economy by encouraging businesses to invest more , when in reality the economic environment does not ( can not ) support more investment . This will lead to riskier investment projects getting green lit , and contribute further to economic instability .

123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"Ah jeez man , I 'm really sorry . That door slamming at the very end ... I can relate to that so much . They never stick around to finish a difficult conversation . They do n't care about how you think and feel , it 's always about them . I 'm sorry that you had to find out about this while still being stuck in it . I did n't realize it until I was 21 . As for advice ... are you in immediate harm ? Your dad threatened to beat you , but do you think he would go through with it ? If you do n't think he would , my advice would be to try to fly under the radar , disconnect from your parents as much as you can , and do n't let them mess with your head too much . Hanging out with friends as much as you can . Time away from the house . Go to the library . Try to keep decent grades , though I know it 's tough when you 're dealing with this shit . Definitely try to get a job . Having your own money really helps foster your independence . If you are certain that violence will occur , I 'd tell as many trusted adults as you can . Some adults may be secret narc enablers , so try to get as many different opinions as you can . You might get to a point where you want to test your parents . Like if you 're in a heated argument . I would avoid that at all costs . Nothing good can come from escalation . I believe that you 're brave , but when things get out of control the worst can happen . Honestly , I would just placate your parents as much as you can . You know in your heart what 's going on . I wish I could help you more dude . I 'm sorry about your parents . I hope more people can chime in and give you some solid advice .",Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,DecidingToBeBetter,"& gt ; Forgiving unrepentant people is perhaps the most critical portion . I 've heard this usage of the word `` forgive '' before , but it is not the common usage . When people think of forgiveness , they imagine getting back together , hugging , and saying `` I forgive you ! '' The word is also used in another context : to forgive a debt . We know what this means . It is an allowance of previously unallowable behavior . & gt ; Consider this : If a person is unrepentant , do you really think they have a single care about whether or not you forgive them ? Do you really think that by refusing to forgive them , it somehow does you any good ? I know they care . Everyone cares about how they are viewed . If bad people were called out and shunned , rather than having their shitty behavior swept under the rug , we would be living in a much better world : a world where even narcissists tried to be good people because they would suffer the consequences otherwise . A world where people do n't turn away and look embarrassed when a child is being mistreated . I am angry when I see these bad things happen . If only more of us were , perhaps we could end the cycle . It seems to me that the people eager to preach forgiveness are the ones that would gain most from it . It validates their decisions to forgive bad people , and it validates bad behavior from bad people . When I think back on how my dad treated me , I feel angry . I was not treated respectfully . I can not will the anger away , that would be a self manipulation and a denial of my true feelings . But I am free from him now . The wounded child within me has regained trust in the world , and most importantly : the wounded child trusts me to keep him safe . And I will . That means no abusers . That means no `` letting it slide '' . That means hearing his pains and concerns , and taking them seriously . That is healing . I think we are talking about the same thing , but you are using the language of enablement when you call this process `` forgiveness '' . I would urge you to find a better word , mainly to aid in clarifying the problem to those of us who are less versed in the subject . Perhaps `` coming to terms with it '' . What are your thoughts ?",Germanic,English
123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"Happy to help . If you do have to continue to see your dad , try to engage in `` safe '' activities and conversations . I remember my dad and I used to go to the movies a lot together . It was a great way to kill time without having to deal with him that much . Or sitting on the couch watching TV with him . At least then he thinks he 's getting time with you , and you get to remain somewhat distant . It would be best if you were n't forced to see him , though ... It is hard having to fake it , especially when you 've snapped out of the daze of illusion . The inside of my head used to physically hurt when I was around my parents . It was hard to think clearly . Something you might need to be more aware of is your relationship with your mom . You seem to have already figured her out pretty well , but I can imagine it would be easy to see her as the good parent when compared to your dad . Remember : she chose your dad . Again , I 'm really sorry that this has fallen on your young shoulders . It should n't be this way . Edit : Some advice for you regarding your mom . You feel controlled by her and want some freedom . Practical stuff here : do you own a bike ? Can you bike into the city , or visit friends that way ? That way you will be less reliant on her to get to places . How about friends ? Can they pick you up and take you places ? Is money a concern ? Can you get a job anyplace ? Maybe even mowing lawns ? If she wo n't let you do stuff , perhaps arrange things with other people first , then tell your mom she has to cancel on them over the phone . Her having to show her control over you with a third party watching might make her think twice . That 's all I got for now . Take care bud .",Germanic,English

Unfortunately she does n't deal with childhood at all , which is a shame , and may well be indicative of some lack of empathy , since children are often the greatest victims . Ayn Rand 's life was turned upside down by communists who destroyed her family 's livelihood . Her hatred of forced empathy is what drives her books .
