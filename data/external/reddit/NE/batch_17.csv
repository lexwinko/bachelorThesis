1980sumthing,answers,"1. flat , round and spherical are different independent properties of eachother from various viewpoints a table tennis ball is both flat round and spherical 2. depending on the observer , as is described in a certain writing and videos , the faster the observer is approaching earth , the more flat earth will seem , the writing speaks that each planet is seen as a plane ( disc ) as seen from a higher dimensional being . the proper word describing earth is not flat but a disc shape . 3 . Ive learned of many experiments ( like different lengths of shadows at different longtitudes ) that show it has spherical properties , but knowing that each perspective even if proven by experiments is still is bound by the mechanics of reality , giving the possibility of there being a model that still allows for the experiment 's outcome of showing that it is spherical while in reality it is much different from our prelearned set of alterEnglishs of what the options are . The flat earthers are open to researching the topic and learning alterEnglish viewpoints giving that what information given to them may be incomplete or distorted . Observe that flat earthers mostly find intellectual amusement in learning alterEnglish theories in this subject and are actually learning about and weighing the evidence either way and it is an exercise ( in which most may not be successful ) in critical thinking , if living in a simulation you didnt know what was what and the real physics was completely different from what is taught , a critical stance towards all evidence would be healthier than simply accepting what is taught , and most who do defend the current acceptable notion of reality are 99 % not people who have personal experience of experimental approach to this reality , keep in mind flying in a plane and seeing a curvature is still the limitation of what most people can assess the situation , and even in that case the observations are limited to the phenomena occurring under certain conditions of observation .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,electricvehicles,"there was a video on the design process for the first tesla models , the designers were making it so ugly , so elon found a designer from a famous carbrand , I think they are made so on purpose so that people lose interest in them because the electric motor and design of a minimal ev is so simple people can even wire their own motors with copper wire the extreme end of this evolution would be that everyone started making their own cars which brings me to the question : why are cars designed to be pretty at all ? because the car industry has created its own ecosystem , they have people that they pay money to to design the cars , and often at that , every year and have so many models and parts and all are made incompatible with most other brands and models . it is expensive and exhaustive , that is why they do it . Why are cars not made modular ? do you have to have a new rounded complicated shape of the bonnet and roof etc ? The design choices of cars today are made by very few people it seems if I had my way cars would have obligatory auto stop start feature , tomorrow , every car would have a slightly larger electric startmotor , they are already designed to assist the engine as it is ! and make the cars run on them under 10 mph make the brake and steering hydraulic pump electric so that you can turn the engine off when cruising without any problems , and add a bigger battery with these solutions you can reduce global consumption of petroleum in cars by at least 30 % . but that is not what car manufacturers have in mind . nor is it what petroleum producers want . it is the same reason decentralized offgrid PV panel systems are still not taking off . if every house shared one 250w panel with all neigbours everyone would have access to a huge grid this would eliminate most needs of batteries in daytime , and the entire distribution network , all powerplants , all maintenance people , and more . it would also reduce the tax income on electricity . the perfect world of zero expenditure and no waste , would lead to no income states and common expenditure . the countries can not live without taxes , but that world is possible . thus the problem is not the perfect system but the *system of expenditure . ~~I 'll shut up before we get too deep.~~ I actually would prefer a ugly car if it was my own design the chassis can be designed and lasercut from 1 cm steel , it can be designed in 30 minutes and cut to less than 1k usd .",Turkic,Turkish

If houses in a neighborhood shared their capacities they would lower their capacities extensively because most power usage are instantaneous peak usages at random times , therefore , you can use the local grid without worrying much as it would have little probability of every user using max power at the same time . disregarding the battery part , a 250 w panel for every 4 person family would be close or above the total needs if it was connected to a local grid of say 100 homes with 250 w panels each , making up 25 kw of total pv power available , which you would be able to use with a thick DC line connecting every house in area . 3 .

1980sumthing,worldnews,once again my questions remain unanswered rest assured Turks did not care about specifically killing Armenians . But Turks did have real problems with people cutting off supply lines and telegraph lines in Anatolia and other issues when they were fighting a war with Russia . That is why they were expelled . My questions are still not addressed 1. were the populations in aegean and istanbul left to live there ? 2. was there guerilla warfare in Anatolia by Armenian gangs when there was a war in the east ? 3. did the ottoman government order the logistical basic necessities of the Armenians during the expulsion ? 4. did the ottoman government trial and execute those deemed incompetent and responsible for people dying during the expulsion ? 5. did most survive ?,Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,answer my 5 questions,Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"& gt ; I have n't found info on that but the Ottomans had committed several massacres of the Armenian population beforehand , so I would n't be surprised . & gt ; maybe ? ? ? ? ? 518,000 muslims are documented to have been killed by armenians . Guess why ? because the wanted the populations removed from central anatolia , is that also genocide then ? Yes there was guerilla warfare and it is the reason for the shitstorm in the beginning , the armenians saw ottoman empire as weakened and wanted to take advantage of the situation , get help from russians and create a new armenian nation in eastern anatolia . So they attacked convoys cut off telegraph lines . This is the reason for the deportations '' 25,000 insurgent Armenians actively conducting military operations against the empire . '' says one source If the Turks had wanted the armenians dead , 100 % of them would have died . The intent was to remove them from a place of opportunity of causing harm here is more '' none of the Ottoman armies on the fronts in Caucasia , Mesopotamia or Palestine was self- sufficient in food , fodder , ammunition or medical supplies , and all were dependent on the roads and railroads leading west to Istanbul and Thrace for those supplies . Moreover , none of these forces had much in the way of prepositioned supplies available and all required the continuous flow of war material . The Armenian revolutionary committees began to attack and cut these lines of communications in the spring of 1915 . Ottoman army messages regarding the interdiction of the roads and lines of communications in the spring of 1915 clearly demonstrate both alarm and concern for the acute danger presented by the Armenian insurgents . The cutting of the road networks for more than a period of several days had a severe impact on the amount of material getting through to the armies on the active fronts , thereby denying them the means to fight . Thus , the Armenian insurrection was seen as a genuine security imperative requiring an immediate solution , and it was an existential threat to the survival of the empire ’ s armies.The mobilization and the concentration of the Ottoman army in 1914 brought the entire regular army to the fringes of the empire ’ s frontiers . The army stayed on the frontiers and by April 1915 was heavily engaged in the Caucasus , at Gallipoli , in Mesopotamia and in Palestine . This drained the army ’ s strength and left almost no trained regular army combat units in the interior provinces . Moreover , the Hamidiye cavalry had been disestablished previously and its successor , the light cavalry corps , likewise was dissolved in November 1914 . Even the well-trained and mobile field gendarmerie ( Jandarma ) were activated for war and deployed to the active fighting fronts to assist the regular forces . Thus , the Ottoman Empire had sent all of its available military combat strength to the frontlines and in the spring of 1915 had almost no military forces left in the interior . '' they did not have the military strength to forcibly end rebellion in anatolia so they ordered the deportations and the choice was made because of armenian rebels had they not done so they would lose their supply and communication lines to the 3 fronts that they were fighting at the same time , and armenians taking side with russians and trying to negotiate cooperation with other sides . and partially because many of the armenian gangs had caused deaths of muslims , they were also attacked by muslims during the deportations and sometimes they had few guards watching sometimes hundreds of armenians because almost all forces were in the front lines . any lack of logistics from the ottoman side is the fault of the ottoman side , they were responsible for the well being of civilian but you can not hold someone responsible for genocide when they are ordering the well being of the armenians , neither was the general population responsible . And the events of 1915 are incomparable to 1945s . terming it genocide is part of the long term plan of demanding money and eventually land from Turkey .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"Despite the fact that Yaltabaoth possesses only a single parent and was created without the consent of the Spirit of the Monad , he is powerful enough to mimic the creative processes of the superior Aeons . He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither “ light nor dark ” but is instead “ dim ” . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad ’ s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the “ waters ” that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the ‘ plenoria ’ or the ‘ Epinoia ’ , and later as the ‘ pleroma ’ , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth ’ s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth ’ s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish

Did the person drink 1 gram or 1 liter of alcohol ? too much of everything is detrimental the point is the right amounts and in society many foodstuffs already contain excess of many things which also have definable detrimental effects on the body , but they are in contrast to alcohol not controversial . though drinking on weekends is a normal thing and they do it because they experience a surge of energy , and the effect they experience is positive and they do it because their body says it is beneficial , if not they wouldnt do it . then why not have tiny amounts of it during the week ?",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,worldnews,"The park riots were a good example of people coming together , for various reasons . After that people havent come together publicly for protesting ( in large numbers ) , because unless it is a huge event , the police are prepared to oppose any gathering of people if it is not done bureaucratically correct way , and they take care to outnumber the gatherings and use excessive force , teargas and watercannons are almost standard . Especially if the topic of the gathering is someting they may have personal reasons to oppose , which is fucked up . ( the ) Park riots was one of the times the people outnumbered the police and they could not enter the park . Not the opposite . The people are by nature opposed to harming others , the police are by nature trained to cause harm , and unfortunately even turn a blind eye when unlawful methods are used . That is where the maturity of lawmakers and upholders is shown . After it became publicly known that people were opposing the police , all sorts of people came to start barricading themselves into the park area , for many various reasons , initially it was to protest the park being damaged , then to protest the excessive force . Thats why the riots began , and police could not do much . ( the ) Park riots are not a reason for people to not riot because they are afraid of something , in fact many turkish people are by now even expecting teargas and water cannons when protesting something . Also , it wasnt a revolt . The protests was against the current party , not against the state itself . Though people may have tried to hijack the topic towards revolting , most were there to protest the administration . And they were doing it becauee they think the administrations heading was detrimental to the country .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"The kiĺlings made people more adamant to making the people in power leave positions , but seeing that they made their point in making the police unable to have control over the people if they so decided , they saw that the proper way to get rid of them would be with proper methods like elections . The aftereffects of the riots are still lingering on and people work on many different fields towards his goal . It is not that they are afraid of rioting or protesting , the latter they do still for various reasons . But they see that it is pointless to force change in office because if you dont have a person who feels inclined to make *all* people happy , he will hold on to his position . They know that hurting police , who do what they do because it is their job , is not the answer and they could have if they wanted . They think that after all the police is not the enemy and would still be needed for a functioning society . Here is the difference between the riot and revolt , though i may be wrong ( in what the words mean in the dictionary ) , the park protests were against the administration not the state . And they stopped because they found it pointless to keep trying to fight people who are not your enemy and whom you are ( mostly ) trying to not hurt seriously ( police ) . And the people found other ways to channel their wants of the administration being removed . Like forums where people in many areas got together and held meetings to decide what to do to mobilize the 'wants ' . People were mostly not afraid in fact a lot of the people considered it fun and saw it like adventure . They left because they lost interest . A lot of the people had jobs and school at the same time . And came up with more realistic ways of changing the situation . Many people do care but dont know other ways of making things happen besides voting , and this has changed the results in the elections .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,worldnews,"as much as Turkey is a 'democracy ' there are not many channels for people to even make their voices heard . This is a flaw built into the system democracy it seems . If the people in charge dont want to improve the democracy and further the participation of the people , the progress slows down . At the moment there is only one official site that people can write requests and have other people vote on them , and it has no guaranteed official effect . The only alterEnglish now is ranting and yelling and protesting unfortunately . Besides this in recent elections since the park riots , there has been many NGOs formed to safeguard election ballots and the counting of them . The people put their effort and hope in organising people through facebook and twitter , but those offer only limited options in doing that . If people really would have wanted revolt they wouldnt be trying to avoid killing people who are knowingly defending the current administration . This is the difference between the actions of the park riot protesters and other terror organisations who are actually trying to kill people to accomplish this . The protesters didnt do much harm to official buildings or even try to actively harm police . They consciously and knowingly chose to do it this way because they know being a police is a job , the main problem were some idiots who stepped over laws , relaxed interpretation of them , those who turned and still turn a blind eye of the unlawful actions by police , and those who gave the orders to use exessive force . And those who even defended those actions .",Turkic,Turkish

There are other systems that are better than democracy , but we use the word democracy as chewing gum in arguments because it is all we know . Giving someone you dont know full control over a country for 4 years is not logical nor sane . Because if they see themselves as emperor and prioritize personal benefit above the people 's then you end up with a dictatorship like tendencies . Not everyone listens to otheers opinions if they dont have to . There are those who do but not everyoneis capable of this . Especially if they have hidden agendas . The warning signs are the simple signs . These people do n't stop at red lights , it is that simple . And no i dont consider the people in charge more muslim than others . The rules in the quran are more sophisticated , and more humble than most men can dare to be . If you want to be scientific , you have to see the difference between the quran and those you think are following it , because they are not always . It is either that or the problem is democracy and it being incompatible with them . The basic essence of being muslim is simple and described in bakara in one sentence only . There are many who are unable to discuss this subject and they ca n't see the essence , the basic western mind can not see the good without the controversial , and the basic muslim mind can not put aside the controversial and see the important good parts . They all choose to focus on details they see fit their own perceptions . Go beyond this please . You are not supposed to read the quran to win arguments over others . The ideal system is not parlamentary democracy , and dont presume that those in charge are in a select group who act perfectly according to the quran .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,Turkey,"If you are talking about Turkey , we are almost dictatorship *because* of this representative democracy , dont forget . It means if somone with means and intent comes , they can make democracies into dictatorships . Direct , electronic democracy is the original democracy in new form , and possible since Internet came . but not everyone wants it . And even more consume oxygen by saying it is impossible . Ideally if everyone helped everyone and was good to everyone , we would n't perhaps need democracy . Democracy is giving a man 4 years of kingship with good intentions and this because you can not put 75 million people into an arena to make decisions which is the original democracy . But now you can put them in a virtual arena orat least some part of the population can participate .",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,Turkey,"It is not difficult to find a reason that would make it not work is easy , Finding a formula for making it work is the real work . There are tons of issues that can be brought up , and tons of arguments to make it work . What is important is to have a discussion and agreement platform for the entire population , and we dont have it . Even if this was not for edemocracy , we still should have a public discussion platform to make our wants heard even if it didnt have direct legal power . That we dont have such a platform is the strange thing . In the platform experts and science people can give expert info and data on the subjects and everyone can read and discuss and vote on them , How can this be worse than 1 leader having 10 experts telling him what they know and him deciding , and all this behind closed doors ? ? And you only having 1 chance every 4 years to have any opinion ? ? E-parti.org is working on these things . Giving the people opportunity to learn , discuss and vote on subjects empowers people and encourages them to make enlightened decisions , the opposite would be to make them ignorant uncaring and uneducated in the subjects , and this is exactly whats happening today ! And possibly even on purpose . If you want your people to be caring , enlightened on the issues and capable of making educated decisions , then you must give them the tools and opportunity , and you must work to cut off those who work towards the opposite .",Turkic,Turkish

EU has banned animal import from US because they use estrogen supplements . I wonder why . http : //www.survive-and-thrive-cancer.com/Beef.aspx # .VixhDkFQY90 https : //www.newscientist.com/article/dn10517-red-meat-linked-to-breast-cancer-risk/ Women in the study who ate more than 1.5 servings of red meat per day had nearly double the risk of developing hormone-sensitive breast cancer as those who ate three or fewer servings per week , the team found . A single serving equates to a quarter-pound hamburger , for example , or 100 grams of red meat . The hormones or hormone-like compounds in red meat may promote the growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer by attaching to specific hormone receptors on the tumours , Cho suggests . She notes that hormone sensitive cancers are increasingly common in the US – particularly among middle-aged women – while the rate of hormone insensitive cancers has remained relatively stable . The chances that women between the ages of 40 and 49 years would develop oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer in 1992 was 65 in 100,000 , but it increased to 75 in 100,000 by 1998 .

I have read numbers for many years that some do come from animal rights groups , true , but then please enlighten me and provide numbers from neutral sources . I dont expect you to provide a source that proves eating of female animals does not increase the estrogen of humans eating them , because that is too much , but you may provide it if you can find it . Because if it does then it is a closed case . If estrogen in animals increases estrogen in humans , it is an end to discussion that it may cause breasts in humans , dont you agree ? if not I cant help you because this is then proof . Interesting thing is there is no such research or evidence in any direction . If there was there would be the research that would be basis for all these discussions .

It would receive from the main PC a simple image , the static page of a website for example and only send back 2 types of data , mouse clicks and keyboard clicks to the main server . This device would only output 1 single image to the connected display as long as it was on , and change only when a new image is sent , for a decent programmer this is something very doable in fpga . and this would be connected over ethernet . So in reality for showing static images on several displays , it would practically have no limit for amount of displays connected and controlled by the main server . All webpages that are static would be easily sent and shown on the terminals . The mouse clicks xy coordinates and other buttons would be sent to the server and a new instance rendered and sent to the terminal . So if one nice pc can handle maybe hundreds of webpages open at the same time , it would be able to handle hundreds of terminals and the processing power would only be required for an instance when rendering the html to a visual output , removing all animations and videos , would make the pages suitable for this .

1980sumthing,todayilearned,"https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_ ( aeon ) Buddha had not spoken about the exact length of the maha-kalpa in number of years . However , he had given several astounding analogies to understand it . 1 . Imagine a huge empty cube at the beginning of a kalpa , approximately 16 miles in each side . Once every 100 years , you insert a tiny mustard seed into the cube . According to the Buddha , the huge cube will be filled even before the kalpa ends . 2 . Imagine a gigantic rocky mountain at the beginning of kalpa , approximately 16 x 16 x 16 miles ( dwarfing Mount Everest ) . You take a small piece of silk and wipe the mountain once every 100 years . According to the Buddha , the mountain will be completely depleted even before the kalpa ends . In one situation , some monks wanted to know how many kalpas had died so far . The Buddha gave the analogy : If you count the total number of sand particles at the depths of the Ganges river , from where it begins to where it ends at the sea , even that number will be less than the number of passed kalpas . * A variation of the description of Kalpa that got me interested : Imagine the biggest mountain made of the hardest material in some place Imagine a bird with the softest feathers travels over the mountain every 100 years and each time it passes , one of its feathers touches the mountain somewhere just slightly . The time it takes for the bird to have reduced the entire mountain to nothing , is One Kalpa .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,gifs,"I thought second hand on clocks would be one use but no '' One application of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors : the film does not run continuously through the projector . Instead , the film is advanced frame by frame , each frame standing still in front of the lens for 1/24 of a second ( and being exposed twice in that time , resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz ) . This intermittent motion is achieved using a Geneva drive . ( Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or stepper motor , which allows for fast-forwarding the film . ) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul . Previous projectors , including Thomas Armat 's projector , marketed by Edison as the Vitascope , had used a `` beater mechanism '' , invented by Georges Demenÿ in 1893 , to achieve intermittent film transport . Geneva wheels having the form of the driven wheel were also used in mechanical watches , but not in a drive , rather to limit the tension of the spring , such that it would operate only in the range where its elastic force is nearly linear . If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded , the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited . In watches , the `` drive '' wheel is the one that winds up the spring , and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding ( and also complete unwinding ) of the spring . This so-called Geneva stop or `` Geneva stop work '' was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers . Other applications of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in plotters , automated sampling devices , banknote counting machines , and many forms of indexable equipment used in manufacturing ( such as the tool changers in CNC machines ; the turrets of turret lathes , screw machines , and turret drills ; some kinds of indexing heads and rotary tables ; and so on ) . The Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings . A Geneva drive was used to change filters in the Dawn mission framing camera used to image the asteroid 4 Vesta in 2011 . It was selected to ensure that should the mechanism fail at least one filter would be usable . [ 1 ] '' https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_drive",Turkic,Turkish

But that doesnt matter for you either , because you say that even if they were giving them proper medicine , because it is a documentary we could assume it is all fake , therefore we should assume it is fake . And you think the medicine men because they have no formal western education , they have been fooling around in the jungles for 2000 years just for laughs . again that doesnt matter because they could all be faking it . if they werent faking it you automatically assume it is still bullshit because you think the medicine men have no knowledge and studies or formal western education . The medicine your ancestors got was also from medicine men before there was universities , and those who gave them the medicine were medicine men .

Plant substances are also given by western doctors because they have tested them . You assume they have not tested anything for all that time in the jungle And there were doctors from the country that did checkups before and after to see their stats But that doesnt matter either because if it is fake then none of these discussions matter and is not a basis for any verdict for or against medicinal plants . you uphold 2 viewpoints one excludes the other",Turkic,Turkish

Error checking is disregarded in this matter , you can make the device double check the written data and send back error if there is any . and if you have MANY drives like 100 drives , then each will only have to write 1 packet each and all in parallel .

If the computer can handle it , still better than thousands of dollars on a san or nas server that limits the numbers of drives still . perhaps not competitive in terms of speed but I think it would be much cheaper and you can large amounts storage space to one standard computer , 100s-1000s of drives . using only standard network hardware .",Turkic,Turkish

The people in many cities were not expelled , and many people found guilty of mistreatment of armenians were executed . In the end armenians want that government to be responsible , even if they didnt give such orders and punished people . And armenians want Turks to feel responsible because thats what armenians tell the entire world . No matter if there were Turks who saved armenian families or if our ancestors have been here for centuries . Would armenians blame hittites and lycians for expelling armenians ? Because they are Turks of today . But it doesnt matter to the genocide proponents because it is the children of Turkey today that armenians want paying a price . And even if a Turk is born on the other side of the world this mentality will blame them as well . The thing is what happened was their only military solution according to them , armenians in edirne istanbul izmir were mostly left alone according to my information , and most armenians who were deported DID survive correct me if im wrong .

1980sumthing,answers,"depends on what you spend the utilities that use most energy in houses are heating elements and motors ( 500-2000-3000+ watts ) if it werent for these we would normally only spend max 200-400 watts and lower per person *in my opinion and in ideal temperature with no usage : 0 watts but modern lifestyle has made people spend watts even in their sleep . most problems are as usual the peak usage of machines and such , if we had buffers such as batteries connected to neighbors ' batteries we would need much less , there are people who dont even need 1 watt of expenditure in the world , *in form of electricity from outlets , it is the humans ' gadgets that require power . if your heating took advantage of the sun , your wouldnt need much heating either",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,answers,"/u/madpainter : Knowledge of what is possible and where you need to go is only one part of the equation ; the ability to put the knowledge into practice is as equally as important , and then there is the matter of raw materials , food supply , the mix of available talent , leadership etc . I suspect there is also a critical minimum number of scientists and engineers you would need , a sort of critical mass that will be able to get the work done within the balance of their lifetimes . Do n't forget the politics that will surely come into play , especially if there is competition for limited resources , and a host of other things like premature deaths and illnesses . Let 's make some assumptions so at least we can move forward . Assume you will have enough people in all the various sciences ; assume in that group there will be people capable of doing practical work and not just theoretical ; assume they have access to water , metal ores ; and other materials needed to get boot strapped up to a basic industrial level , say Level 1 . The first thing they will need to build will be a power supply driven off a flowing water stream . No big deal ; they can do that will wood for gears and tanned leather hides from animals for drive belts and packing . They will have rudimentary machines fairly quickly . The next jump is much more difficult . Next up they will have to build a steam engine . This step is huge . If they can accomplish this , they stand a good chance of succeeding overall . But to build a good steam engine they will need some moderate to advance metallurgy , and of course , sufficient raw materials to make the alloy blends . Someone will have to be able to make castings for machine parts . The goal here , after the steam engine is made , I think would be to produce a functional lathe and milling machine , and of course the tooling needed to use them . So now that we have a steam engine we can begin to build other machines and piggyback on them to create a new industrial society , but wait , we begin to run into the human problem . Let 's assume everybody gets along ( big assumption ) , there is still the division of labor and available hours . Most of the initial bootstrapping will fall on the shoulders of a small percentage of the group , nuclear and chemical engineers will be pretty much idle during the first mini industrial age , as will many of the other more advanced scientists and engineers . Computer coders ? They will be emptying the latrine trenches for a long time before they become useful . Since we have a limited number in our group , at some point , in the early stages , the people doing the initial bootstrapping are going to run out of available man hours . They can only work so long , and they have a limited shelf life . It would be great if your group was heavily skewed toward certain sciences and skills , but I am assuming it will be a random distribution covering all the sciences . So , how long will it take to get up to basic level 1 , water driven power ? A couple of months perhaps . That 's not too hard and actually requires only a skilled mechanic to do it . Level 2 steam driven power ? Hard to say , but at least 3-5 years if everything goes right ; 10-20 worse case . A new nuclear age ; 100 years but I am just guessing . It really comes down to how many people are available for the tasks that need to be done . I think if your group of scientists and engineers is only 100 , they will not succeed in their lifetime , and it may take hundreds of years to get back a a basic industrial society . I do n't know what the critical mass number is , but a hundred seems barely adequate with all the other factors figured in . You also have to solve the problem of food . Areas rich with mineral ores needed to reach stage 1 may not be suitable for farming . Are you going to have food scientists or actual farmers in your group . Could be critical in the outcome . There is the issue of medical care . Certainly your doctors will be able to produce penicillin easily , but will the current msra and other resistant bacteria continue for a while . A simple injury or cut could be fatal . An injury to a critical engineer or scientist might derail the timeline . Bottom line is that there are far too many variables to say with any certainty how long it would take . It could be done in as little as a 100 years , it might take a 1000 years if the group dies out or ca n't reach that steam level stage quickly . I think that is the key , how fast can they get back to the new steam age . If they can get that far , and the population of the group can be increased , then eventually a return to the modern age would be possible .",Turkic,Turkish

The whole deal would follow the same timeline of inventions , only limited by the time it takes to make those things , probably skipping steps because of advanced science . Depending on the size of the team , and the available resources , they could reach crude but modern standarts fairly quick . They could easily create wood gas and use it for many applications , speeding up development significantly . With the knowledge of metals we have now , they would also be able to amke strong tools very fast , too , skipping many years ahead . As soon as they get the metal processing going , they could take care of electricity , again , skipping thousands of years ahead , even if it is just an array of potato batteries .

Islam is the big elephant in the room nobody dares to criticize.And since Islam is more than religion , it covers politics as well . The sharia law for example are the constitution of several Muslim states because Islam covers politics as well . For example women inherit only half of what men inherit because God has made men superior to women ( 4:34 ) .

He was our key man , all attacks were constructed by him , he had huge responsibilities before , but he is out of form now , and not able to do shit .

What the Brits did is incredibly fucked up and as inhumane as it gets . Just googled it and came across this . & gt ; At a time when Ireland was enduring the terrible loss of a million dead and the mass exodus of a million more during the Great Hunger the story goes that the Ottoman Sultan , Khaleefah Abdul-Majid I , declared his intention to send £10,000 to aid Ireland 's farmers . However , Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only £1,000 , because she had sent only £2,000 herself . & gt ; So the Sultan sent only the £1,000 , but he also secretly sent five ships full of food . The English courts attempted to block the ships , but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors . That £10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately £800,000 ( $ 1.7m ) today . source : http : //www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/Little-known-tale-of-generous-Turkish-aid-to-the-Irish-during-the-Great-Hunger.html",Turkic,Turkish

Ottoman Empire is in control of most of the Southern Balkan parts where Christian people are feeling occupied for centuries . -Armenians start an uprising in 1880s and found a rebellion movement called Dashnak ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation ) to create a greater Armenia . -Armenian armed militas fight against the state and/or local Kurds and Turks like here ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanasor_Expedition or https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1894_Sasun_rebellion ) -their resistance gets suppressed -1915 comes and during the war the eastern part of Anatolia gets invaded by Russia . Russians and Armenians commit crimes against local Turks and Kurds . Local Turks and Kurds commit crimes against Armenians . The time has come for Armenians to create finally a greater Armenia with the help of Russians . -Ottoman Empire orders to evacuate Armenians out of Anatolia to the southern part of the Empire . Along the way a lot of Armenians die , a lot of Armenians get also killed . -Decades later Armenians form a terrorist organization ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Secret_Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Armenia ) and perform terrorist attacks on Turkish diplomats and on Turkish people ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esenbo % C4 % 9Fa_International_Airport_attack ) -during 1990 's they start a war with Azerbaijan , occupy Azerbaijani territory , massacre local Azerbaijanis and displace 700k Azerbaijanis . There 's two sides to this story , this is no 'poor Armenians were killed because they were Armenians ' , there were some legit massacres done by both sides . And the Russian & amp ; Armenian atrocities are heavily ignored . Also another issue is , the first claims were 300k people , then it rose up to 1.5M . These are some crazy numbers used for nothing else but propaganda measures . Armenians care more about being turkophobic than their own country .

19O5,Turkey,"& gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; Yes but how do they represent all Muslims around the world that you can reach and conclusion to attack Muslims ? Because the reason they do not want this festival to take place is their religion . Simple as that . And a Muslims is a follower of Islam , and is not ought to drink alcohol . There are sharia supporters in Great Britain going around districts and telling local Brits to put their alcoholic beverages down . ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-2y5n-hAnUE ) . Obviously forbidding others to drink alcohol is somehow related to Islam , is n't it ? & gt ; Like all religions you have to follow certain rules . That 's why we have secularism and Muslims in Turkey do n't care about secularism to promote Islam . In the West secularism is respected unlike in Turkey which is obviously backwarded due to Muslim majority . & gt ; MODERN Modern means to go with the time and adapt to the standards of the current time . I do n't see Muslims doing that . They still follow rules of 7th century Arabia which are obviously cruel and against any human rights .",Turkic,Turkish

It 's not couple of Muslims , if it was couple of Muslims the festival would take place . Obviously there are greater amounts of people supporting the idea that this festival should not take place because alcohol is served . & gt ; Every Muslim is modern Muslim . There are no medieval or ancient or pre-historic people living on Earth anymore . Islam is a religion which wants its followers to obey the certain rules of the religion . And the religion is a man made religion adapted to moral standards of 7th century Arabia . & gt ; Every Muslim is modern Muslim .

Before that he had a short loan spell at Manisaspor where he played right back . However under Rijkaard he played more of a central role where he played the role of the 10 in a 4-3-3 with Kewell on the left wing and Abdel Kader Keita on the right wing . I still believe that he played his best when he was a LW for us and I still believe that it 's the position he 's most comfortable at . He developed his mental attributes immensely at Atléti that he can play the 10 without any issues . Arda 's finishing and long shots are weak compared to modern wide forwards though .,Turkic,Turkish
