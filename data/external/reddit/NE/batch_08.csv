0bi,medicalschool,"Survey taken . About the questions : 1 . Yes , most definitely . When I go to see patients , I see them by myself . Both history and exam . I then summarize this for my attending , who will only check a few things but will take my word for most . This of course requires that I admit when I 'm not sure about stomething etc . but they are generally fine with that . Sometimes in acute cases when there is nothing to really add to the process , I like to talke with the family of the patient to explain everything to them etc . Also because I see less patients than the attendings , I 'm able to spend more time with them which sometimes reveals more underlying issues or causes , or allows to focus on the impact of the disease more . So a definite yes , in several ways . 2 . Sometimes this has happened . I find it annoying , because it often coincided with very little learning moments . Fortunately it has n't happened in my fields of interest . No problems with self-worth , but that 's probably mostly due to there being nothing to do in general . 3 . Two things : confidence ( /assertiveness ) and space . We work with six week rotations in several fields . The first week , you 're learning a lot and ask for a lot of direct supervision . If you 're well prepared , you can pick things up quickly . Once I 'm confident about my abilities to see patients by myself ( for example ) , I make the suggestion to the attending . If they are confident enough in their indirect supervision skills , they 'll let me/you . That 's the space part . Also , try to be a good colleague . In my evaluations I 've been told that people like to give me space to grow , because I claim it and because I offer to do the meaningless tasks as well , just to reduce the workload on the attending . So , to summarise : be prepared , try to be confident . Try to learn a lot at the start of a rotation , offer to do a lot of things and claim learning/individual moments when possible . And then it comes down to a bit of luck with your patients and attending . Hope this helps !",Germanic,Dutch

The pressure , the time-sink , no application or explanation of why what you 're learning is relevant ( which I wanted because it was just so much ) , not doing nearly as much of the fun stuff outside of school as your friends ... It was during this time that I also developed a period of depression . Fortunately enough , I got help for that .

And because cancer is such a high-risk diagnosis , it is always listed . Most DDX programs offer two columns : one with the most likely diagnoses ( e.g . the flu ) and one with diagnoses that are n't ( very ) likely , but because of their serious nature need to be excluded ( e.g . cancer ) . Important note though : diagnostic programs are meant to be used by physicians and are **all** still in their testing phases .

0bi,AskReddit,"I 'm kind of in the opposite situation . My girlfriend and I had known eachother for a year before we officially became a 'thing ' . When we got to know eachother first , we went on a couple of dates and I pretty much fell for her- she did n't quite fall for me . During that year , there were a couple of occasions where I thought there was something more than 'just friends ' as well . When we finally started dating , I asked her pretty quick if she wanted to be my girlfriend and I told her I loved her quite soon after , because , as I figured out , I never quite got over her during that year . This is ~2 months ago now . She has n't said it back yet- I 've said it twice . I do n't want to crowd her with it , and I do n't like the idea of saying it again and again getting no verbal response . The reason I do n't really mind it though , and the one that keeps me patient is this : when I said it , we looked eachother in the eyes and I could see pure joy in hers when I said it . So I know that even if she does n't ( know she ) love ( s ) me yet , I 'm sure she likes me and that she 's comfortable with how I feel and not at all freaked out by it . Moral of the story : be honest and even more so : be sincere . I have to respect that I was pretty darn quick in saying it and that she ca n't say it back yet , even if I want her to . And I can do that , because she made it clear that she does n't mind . So in your case , OP , tell her that you appreciate it and that you unfortunately do not yet feel that way . But also let her know that you 're comfortable with her saying it first- I think most girls are afraid they 'll chase their guy away by saying it too soon . Then hug her . Nothing like hugs .

0bi,AskReddit,"That 's not true either though . IBD and IBS are two different types of condition entirely . IBD is an umbrella term for two diseases ( Chron 's and ulcerative colitis ) , whereas IBS is just the syndrome . The difference is that both forms of IBD have a known pathogenesis ( that means we know how the process that causes the disease and its symptoms works ) , which IBS does not . That 's why Chron 's and ulcerative colitis are diseases , and IBS is a syndrome . This difference is most clearly illustrated by the treatment options : there are drugs available for IBD ( next to lifestyle changes etc . ) , but not for IBS . Sorry it that was n't clear in my previous post : )",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,AskReddit,"Hey dude , I think you 're skipping a couple of steps here ! First of all : most forms of skin cancer are local laesions . There is only one form of skin cancer that is malignant and causes metastases . This means that *if* one of your moles is cancer , this says nothing about all your other moles . Secondly : as stated before , most forms of skin cancers are benign ( i.e . they remain local ) and can be removed on the spot . ( this is preferable to leaving them be , because further growing can cause other issues ) Thirdly : they do n't have to remove all of your moles to see if you 've got cancer or not . Basic inspection by a dermatologist or GP ( if possible assisted by a dermatoscope , a certain type of lens ) can tell whether a mole is 'suspect ' or not . Only suspect moles need to be sampled for lab analysis . Finally : moles can come and go naturally . So getting checked out is just a precaution , not a guaranteed death sentence . To summarise : getting checked out is the doctor looking at your moles really closely , if possible assisted by a lens . If he thinks something looks funny , he 'll take that certain mole out and send it in for analysis . Most likely diagnosis : not cancer . If the diagnosis is cancer , that taking away the mole was most likely your treatment . Getting checked out can give you ( and those around you ) peace of mind and in the unlikely case of it being the shitty type of cancer : the best treatment for all types of cancer is catching it in its early stages . TL ; DR - get it checked out . If not cancer : yay ! If cancer : most likely 'meh ' or at least yay that you found out now instead of in two years when you 're dying of it ( which is n't necessary ) .",Germanic,Dutch

And to answer your questions : not strictly genetic , but it is observed in familial relations . 5 . Could be possible . Addiction is a very strictly defined term though . Just being hungry and eating more =/= addiction . Start eating less and excercising more ( it also helps to keep your mind off the food ) . Pills etc . are all scams .

However , constipation has a cause which needs to be found . Hence the doctor 's appointment . The cause might be dietary or excercise related , might be inflammatory and unfortunately could be cancer .

Please , please do n't freak out- there is no reason to acutely think this is cancer based on what you 've described , but it 's impossible to rule out right now . Hence why I mentioned it , I prefer being honest . Making an appointment one month from now and maintaining [ the diary ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale ) would make you a model patient and would you put you on the perfect track to finding a diagnosis .

0bi,medicalschool,"So , the post currently on the front page about number of procedures done during rotations got me thinking about what 's considered 'normal ' in the U.S. and over here . I started comparing the procedures I 've done to some listed in that post and figured it was like comparing apples and oranges and that people first needed to understand the architecture of medical school over here . I figured that warranted its own post , I hope you find it interesting . I 've made it specifically about The Netherlands , because I 'm not aware of all the specific differences between the EU countries . Maybe people from those countries can chime in on that . **So , general outline first . ** Medical school in The Netherlands is six years , but requires no premed . You can enroll straight out of high school at 18 . The education is then grossly divided in two parts of three years , the first three focus on anatomy , physiology , biochem etc . The latter three focus on rotations in increasing manner . My faculty is unique in The Netherlands due to the fact that we have full-fledged rotations during third year ( a big advantage IMO ) . You have two weeks of Christmas holidays and 8 weeks of summer leave , though this decreases each year as you advance . In turn , you get two weeks twice off at randomly designated periods during the year from fourth year onwards . **The Netherlands is a small country** ( [ 16040 sq mi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands ) ) but has [ eight university hospitals with ~300 first years each ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_hospitals # Netherlands ) , so due to student density you 'll never have to travel very far during away rotations . Door to door it rarely exceeds 1,5 hours and in those cases ( and often sooner ) you 'll most often have the option to be boarded locally ( paid for by your faculty ) . **Most medical schools** in The Netherlands have adopted a 'thematic curriculum ' . This means that instead of separate courses of anatomy , physiology etc . you get a course 'GI ' , or 'Circulation ' . You will then learn about anatomy , physiology , pathology etc . of relevant organs to that theme . The only 'traditional ' course I can think of that we have is biochem , though that 's already angled a bit towards onco . **So , the first three years** ( your 'Bachelor's ' ) consist of above mentioned 'themes ' . In general , this takes place in the faculty building and is made up of lectures , so called workgroup settings , practical sessions ( e.g . histo ) and live-patient lectures . You are also trained in scientific literacy and do an actual test-study and have ethics classes . If you 're an average or above-average student studying nine to five should be enough to pass with decent grades here . We do n't have the STEP-system , though each faculty has some version of 'progress exams ' where you take the same exam ( not the same questions ) at set intervals during med school but have to perform better as you progress . **The second portion** ( your 'Master's ' ) is mostly rotations with designated prep courses in advance . The length of each rotation differs per faculty , at mine most rotations are six weeks each . In general your first rotations will be at your faculty hospital or very close and as you advance you can have rotations further away ( this is relative though , see above ) . Most rotations are set , though you have several electives as well . Now , about the prep courses : these consist of repition and more in-depth study of most-common diseases , anatomy etc ; practical tools ( such as basic management of post-op surgical patients , heart failure pts , ATLS etc . ) ; more diseases within the field and practice patients and cases . In general you 'll be studying more than 40 hours/week during these prep courses as they are very short . **Rotations at my faculty** are ( with different prep course length , not listed ) : * IM 2 x 6 weeks * Surgery 2 x 6 weeks * Neuro 6 weeks * Psych 6 weeks * Ob/Gyn 6 weeks * Peds 6 weeks * GP 5 weeks * Ophto 2 weeks * Derm 2 weeks * ENT 3 weeks * Public health 4 weeks * Elective 6-10 weeks * 12 weeks of warding in one dpt of choice ) * Elective 12 weeks or 2 x 6 weeks All in all almost two full years of rotations . The last two bullets are both in sixth year , which is called the 'switch year ' nowadays as it has no more prep courses and focuses on actual clinical work . Rotations are generally 8-17.30 with several call duties added ; with of course the exceptions of surgery and [ derm ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/52elsz/i_dont_get_why_everybody_says_derm_hours_are_easy/ ) . **And afterwards ? ** You 're a licensed physician . You can either work as an *ANIOS* ( physician *not* in training for specialist ) , or if you 're lucky/very good/have work experience as an ANIOS you can enter a 3-6 year residency program , which will make you an *AIOS* ( you see the 'n ' for 'not ' is missing ) . There is no match system , you have to apply for a spot through regular means . After that , you 're a full fledged specialist and have to find work somewhere . Please note that to become a GP you also have to specialise . **Other notes . ** At a lot of faculties it 's possible to do a rotation abroad . At some faculties , there is a special 4-year med school programme for people who degrees in e.g . biochem- which is a lot more like your premed/med structure . I 'm not completely with all the differences between this programme and the US programme . However , they generally accept less than 30 students each year ( compared to ~300 regular 1st years ) . **So , I hope you enjoyed this read . ** Ask any question you like !",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,medicalschool,"So , today I started my dermatology rotation . I have to say , it was not like I expected . To start off , they made us come in at 8.30 . 8.30 ! ! That means I had to go to bed by 22.30 to get my minimum of nine hours of sleep as I have to bike 15 minutes to get to the hospital . Absolutely ridiculous . Rounds then took almost two hours , which left me with a measly hour for my coffee break followed by the mandatory two hours for lunch . But the afternoon was worse . I was seeing outpatients , and because my supervisor was slow ( he was supervising multiple people at once ) I finished 1.5 hours later than planned . This meant that after preparing all my cases for the coming two days , I could only go home at four and drink beer in the sun for a mere two hours before I 'll have to start cooking dinner . And the worst part of it all ? My attending said that *every day is like this . * I have no idea why you guys all say that derm life is easy , this is my toughest rotation by far .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,depression,"Hi , I may or may not be using this mainly as a step-up to seeking professional help . I have n't decided . I 'm just looking to hear someone 's thoughts , because I ca n't really talk to anyone about it IRL . I apologise if I 'm using this place for something it 's not intended for . Basically , nothing has been working out for me lately . Or at least , it feels that way . None of the things I worked hard for have yielded results , nor have the things I wished for come true . I do n't know why . All I do know is that I find it very hard to deal with- especially as a person who 's had a lot of things 'handed to him/going his way ' until the last year . It started about a year ago , but has only gotten serious the last 3 months . Nothing working out has made me apathetic , and it 's a self-enforcing loop I ca n't really get out of . The only times I 'm not having depressed thoughts are when I 'm out with my 'friends ' doing things that bear no relation to normal functioning- i.e . when I 'm keeping my mind off things . Lots of times , alcohol is involved . I always stay till closing , because I do n't want to go home . I put 'friends ' in quotes , because I have no one I can tell everything . They 're more like acquaintances , just people I have small talk with and know a little about . Over the past months , it 's gotten to the point where I do n't know what I 'm doing any more and how to stop this nonsense . I fail to see the point of life . The only thing that 's kept my from killing myself the last weeks is what it would do to my parents and some of my 'friends ' . I considered posting this to SW , but I figured I 'm feeling more depressed than suicidal . I 'm sorry if this is hard to follow or reads like a rant , I just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere . I really do n't know what I 'm looking for with this post , I guess acknowledgement would be enough . Thanks for reading . -0bi [ EDIT ] Thanks for all the kind words everyone .

0bi,medicine,Great post ! And a relevant username if I ever saw it . I also feel the OP misses the `` stacking problem '' as I like to call it : working long hours is fine . Not being respected by patients is fine . Nothing being improved about logistics is fine . Not making a lot of money ( yet ) is fine . Having student loans is fine . etc . etc . However *stacking those* becomes a problem . In other words : working long hours for little pay in shitty conditions with patients who are not helpful and who do n't respect you or what you do and who do not take responsibility for their own health but blame you for them not getting better is **definitely** something to be unhappy about . And blowing off steam every once in a while is healthy .,Germanic,Dutch

Do **not** go against/correct your attending/resident in front of other doctors . Bring it up later , in private . And frame it like you need help to correct your faulty understanding of a topic . Help your classmates/rotation partners . If you are being blamed for something that you did incorrectly , do **not** contradict this/explain it away . Apologise , ask how to do it properly next time . If you are being blamed for something that you in fact did correctly ( so it was n't your fault ) , do not shift the blame . Apologise , say you must 've misunderstood and that you thought the correct way to do it was ... .. Never , ever , say `` Yes , but.. '' That 's general life advice too BTW . You are there to learn .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"I 'm not 100 % on the Australian system , but this should basically explain it : Public healthcare is a hospital . Lots of different patients , many doctors and nurses . Partially paid for by the government . Private healthcare is a called a practice . It 's a lot smaller , and often targets one specific type of patient , e.g . those who need a knee replacement . # # # Warning : complicated stuff below that explains the underlying 'problem ' with private practice . # To understand why private practitioners make so much money , it 's important to understand the following . Hospitals can do two types of treatment : treatment that makes them money and that costs them money . Insurance companies are not willing to pay the huge costs for cancer treatment for a patient directly . It 'd mess up their statistics or something . So if that treatment costs 10X money , they get 2X from the insurance and have to pay the rest themselves . To be able to pay that treatment they need money , so they 'overcharge ' the insurance companies for the 'cheap ' treatments ( note : this is all regulated and consensual ) . So instead of charging X ( the cost ) , they charge 2X . So they make 1X profit per treatment to cover for the expenses of cancer treatment . A private practice offers only specific types of treatment- and you guessed it- those who make money . Since they do n't need the excess amount to cover for radiation therapy , they can charge less than 2X and still more than 1X . Result : they make more money , whilst being cheaper for the insurance companies . That results in more patients being sent there , and less 'cheap ' patients to the hospital . Eventually the hospitals will no longer be able to pay for the expensive treatment if this continues . That 's why doctors often dislike private practitioners- they 're money wolves and mes sup the system at the same time .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,explainlikeimfive,"About radiation ( I do n't think that was addressed in the other threads ) : radiation damages a cell . If you damage it enough , the cell will die . So they concentrate several radiation beams upon the tumor , to kill the cells there .",Germanic,Dutch

What you said in your last post is correct- and not to be a dick , but it 's mainly what I said before . # The differences between the last post and earlier ones , per subject : # Liver : Latest post : filters/converts bad stuff . Produces enzymes for digestion . Older post : `` All the good things in food get sucked out of the ripped up bits by your digestive system . Your liver and kidneys do a lot of it . See the critical difference ? The quoted states , at least implies/suggests , that the liver ( and kidney , but more on that later ) suck the useful stuff out of the ripped up bits of food . This would mean that they absorb food that is digested , if not digest food . This is not true- the liver converts food and waste products into things that can be removed from the body . This is metabolism . That is NOT the same as digestion . I think that 's where you went wrong . # Kidney Latest post : `` The function of the kidneys is to filter blood and remove waste materials while keeping the necessary nutrients in the blood . '' Older post : `` All the good things in food get sucked out of the ripped up bits by your digestive system . Your liver and kidneys do a lot of it . Again , in the later post you state what the kidney does- get rid of bad stuff . ( well , also blood volume regulation and other things ... ) In your earlier post you also state/imply that it digests food , which it does n't . # I hope you now understand why I jumped a little , and see the difference in what you stated at first and later on . # To summarise : Liver : produces enzymes for digestion .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"Blood can never move in two directions out of the same ventricle . During a regular heart cycle , the AV valves open because the atria contract , pushing blood outwards toward the ventricle . When the ventricles start to contract the blood moving back towards the atria pushes the valves back shut . So blood can never move in two directions , just like both valves can never be open at the same time as long as pressure exists . This is what happens during CPR : You push down on the chest , pushing out blood from the ventricles into the large arteries . The lower pressure then created 'sucks ' blood to the heart from your body 's large veins . You push down again , it moves out . You stop again , new blood is sucked to your heart . Circulation !

TBH with you , it 's really to early to say whether you will be able to do parkour or not . The only way to find out is to first condition and train you entire shoulder region ( joints : shoulder , including sternoclaviculary and acromeoclaviculary . Muscles : pecs , lattissimi , erector spinae , longissimi , biceps , triceps , trapezius to name a few. ) .

This allows the camera to focus on the colours better and also reduces shading problems . * take pictures in/with daylight if you can * use the macro mode of your camera .

I mean , after 1 you 'd kind of know he was n't sterile , would n't you ? @ Iced_Tea : a female is productive for more than 2-4 days . Sperm can survive for up to 3 days outside of the male body . An ovum can survive for two days without insemination . And that does not account for individual differences/special quirks , let alone ovulating a daily early/late .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"& gt ; Actually , you can compare a measured fasting blood sugar to a standard fasting blood sugar and draw conclusions just fine .

Yet the actual diagnosis , at least over here , is only valid if you did n't eat , with & gt ; 7 , the after eating & gt ; 11 has to be verified by a 'sober ' test . & gt ; That 's not true at all . It is called `` juvenile diabetes '' because it is more commonly diagnosed at younger ages , but people can still be diagnosed with Type 1 well into adulthood . The more important factor is whether the lifestyle indicates that Type 2 is more likely ; if one has high blood sugars and is obese or inactive or has a poor diet , it is more likely to be type 2 . The most certain way is to test for the antibodies associated with type 1 . Note the probably in my post . & gt ; It is not always faulty from birth . Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin , causing reduced and , eventually , no insulin production . This can happen at any time , though it is more common at younger ages . Okay , thanks . & gt ; That is also fairly inaccurate . Type 2 can be regulated with diet and exercise , yes , but type 1 can not . You can still eat a normal amount of carbohydrates and control blood sugar levels by taking more insulin . Yes , but people are still advised to reduce ( 'cut ' was the wrong word ) or at least regulate carbohydrate intake . & gt ; In tougher to control cases of type 2 , insulin is sometimes used to control blood sugar when diet and exercise are not enough . Probably the most important thing about this that you neglected to mention is that type 2 can be controlled by not being fat in the first place , exercise and diet , oral medication , and insulin , whereas with type 1 , you just get boned with a genetic predisposition or an environmental trigger or something ( nobody really knows ) .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"Cancer is an abnormal , uncontrolled growth of your own cells in the body . This can occur anywhere . The main problem is that cancer does not consist of other ( so called 'foreign ' ) cells , like bacteria , but of your own . Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt ) . Easier to reach = better prognosis . Malignant means that some of the cancer cells have breached the little layer on top , or that the layer is not in place . These cells can then travel through the lymphatic system into your blood and spread elsewhere through your body . They can then form a new tumor there . This is called metastasis , and severely curbs the prognosis . The xkcd comic is about malignant forms of cancer , because , like Randall said , there is indeed no way to make sure that there are no cancer cells left in the body . Until 6 months later , when there is either a new ( small ) tumor or not . Benignent cancer , is not that bad . It can be treated , and after treatment the only problem can be that it returns- because you are more sensitive towards cancer if you have had it once . The 10-year survival rate is actually 50 % , not 60 . It differs per form of cancer- colon cancer is one of the worst .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"Did you eat before the blood test ? If not , the diagnosis does n't stick . That said , there are indeed two types of diabetes . Assuming you 're over 15 , you 'll probably have type 2 . I 'll explain the difference below . Diabetes means that you are not able to properly filter sugar from your blood , or more accurately , absorb it in regular tissue ( muscle , liver , fat etc. ) . Normally , your cells receive a signal from a certain hormone , called insulin , to absorb sugar . In type 1 diabetes , this hormone is faulty from birth ( which is why it 's uncommon to see first symptoms past the age of 15 ) . This is like not being able to feel pain . In type 2 , your cell-receptors have become insensitive to insulin , because they have been exposed to high concentrations of it for a very long time . This can be compared to your brother punching you in the arm for half an hour- at some point you do n't notice it anymore . **Untreated** diabetes can have severe consequences , such as neuropathy ( losing your touch , often in feet and hands first ) and severely increases the chance of cardiovascular disease . It also leads to hypertension ( and thereby increasing the chance of CVD ) etc . Treatment differs per type , but in both cases you will need a strict diet , and mainly cut carbohydrates ( sugars are a form of carbohydrates ) . Type 1 diabetes has the 'advantage ' of being a problem with the insulin that you create , so this can be solved by injecting artificial insulin after each meal . This is not the case for type 2 .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"[ ] ( /awyeah `` I 'm a medical student '' ) The immune system is comprised of two parts : the innate and the adaptive system . The innate attacks anything they feel as dangerous , whereas the adaptive will counter specific antigens . It 's the difference between shutting the door of the city hall , and installing a system that keeps felons out . The innate immune system is comprised of several parts : firstly you skin , and the inner lining of your mouth , gut etc . Cells ( e.g . bacteria ) will have to get through this layer to enter your body and infect you . Just like they need to get through the walls/doors of the town hall . Secondly , you have macrophages and so called Dendritic cells that will 'eat ' anything they do not recognize as being part of your body . This is comparable to the security allowing only people through with a key-card and kicking everybody else out . They will then present a part of that foreign ( that 's the term ... . ) cell to other cells : the lymphocytes . ( B & amp ; T ) This is the security guard taking your picture and uploading it to the database , so everybody else will know what to look out for . The lymphocytes are subdivided in 2 main categories , which are both subdivided even further : * B lymphocytes , consisting of * Plasma cells * Memory cells * T lymphocytes , consisting of * T- helper cells ( subdivided , but this is omitted to keep it within limits ) * Cytotoxic T cells B-cells are formed in the bonemarrow , T-cells in the thymus . Both circulate the blood and lymphatic system , which is where they are activated . Each lymphocyte has a specific receptor , that can only notice one kind of antigen ( facial recognition software in the mugshot database ) . When a T-cell encounter its antigen , the response depends on which type of cell it was that encountered the antigen . * Th cells will activate other cells : the macrophages , B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells . They encounter antigen that is presented to them by macrophages and other cells . This is you alerting one security guard , who then alerts the rest . * Cytotoxic T-cells recognize antigens presented to them by normal cells , like your live cells . They get the signal that the cell is infected and kill the cell to prevent further spread . This is useful against viruses . This is a suicide- one hostage says that there are ten terrorists with him in the room , so they should just blow it up . When B-cells encounter its antigen , often presented by a T-helper cell , they will begin producing antibodies , that cling to the target cell ( that produces the antigen ) and make it easier for it to be eaten by macrophages . This is hiding a transmitter in the felons clothing , so that he can be tracked and weeded out easily . This is the task of Plasma cells . Memory cells will remember the specific antigen , and when they encounter it again they will be activated quicker than the first time around . In other words , he remembers the face and can print out the pictures more quickly . Because you asked specifically about NK cells : NK cells are like cytotoxic T cells , with one big difference : Tc cells have to be activated to kill a cell , whereas the NK are always active- they have to be stopped by the cell itself , otherwise they kill it . This is a back-up mechanism . Normally a cell , once infected , will tell the Tc cells that he 's infected so they can kill them . This is not good for the pathogen inside . So some pathogens ( like the herpes virus ) will prevent that from happening . But when they do this , they change the outside look of the cell . This is recognized by the NK cell , who then kills the cell anyway . This is like a room in a building with terrorists no longer answering the phone- they 're not answering , so the terrorists must be there . # # # This omits the principle of MHC molecules , among other things .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"2nd degree burn = serious . Go see the ER . That said : Skin has multiple layers , [ like a cake ] ( http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3514/3249111684_8b3d860e70.jpg ) . The chocolate and brown layer are called the epidermis , the yellow one is the dermis and the white the subcutis . As you 've noticed- the epidermis has two major parts ( actually five , but hey- keeping it simple ) : a layer of dead cells ( chocolate ) and one of living ( brown ) . If the dead cells burn or get removed , nothing happens . You can eat the chocolate fudge of the cake , and it 'll still be there . This is the epithelial layer . If you were to repair it all you 'd have to do is redo the fudge/glazing . If you have a more serious wound into the living cells , this can be more complicated , but nothing really serious will happen . You can still fix it up nicely from down below , as regeneration starts low and works upwards . This would lead to a clean heal and would still be a first degree burn . A second degree burn , however , extends into the core of the skin- the dermis ( yellow ) . Having a hole in that is more troublesome , do n't you think ? The cake will start to fall apart . In a response to that , a lot of cells will appear to try and fix things . But it wo n't go back exactly to what it was . Because you ca n't fix the cake back up as well as it used to be- the cells ca n't work upward as well as they used to , so they will start from all directions . There will always be signs showing that a part was missing . The top layer will be thicker , and the middle one a little thinner .

This usually comes from the super-wealthy , who in turn expect legislation that does n't screw them over ( e.g . raising taxes ) . So for someone to get elected , he first has to kiss some rich people 's ass . And then some more . For him , the upside is that he 's elected , for the rich that their interests are safe .

0bi,AskReddit,"Not quite actually . We were arguing mostly over morals , not laws . I am not trying to contest in any case that what he was doing was legal ( except perhaps in the cases of sex with 16-year olds , I know not of his location and related consent laws ) , let alone moral . NWF claimed that I was defending his actions , upon which I did my best to explain the very complex morality issue in cases like this . ( in addition to explaining that I at no point defended his actions )",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"& gt ; So is punishment for all of the people he hurt . Sure , I understand him , but I understand the victims as well and more importantly I tend to sympathize with them a little more than this guy . How do you know if he 's hurt people ? He 's had sex with them , that 's all . The fact that they 're under the age of consent ( possibly not even in all cases , it 's often 16 nowadays ) does n't mean he raped them . Understand this bit for the rest of your post too . The fact that we state that people under the age of 16/18/whatever the set age is wherever you are can not consent to things , does not make what he did rape . If the age of consent is 18 and an 18-year old guy has a girlfriend that 's 16 years old , can he have sex with her ? I agree that the situations are different , just trying to illustrate that **consent can exist , even if we legally state that it doesn't** . You also use the term 'victims . ' Again , this makes the assumption that any of them were actually abused . & gt ; Neither do your rapist apologetic comments . I get the understanding part , but you 're spending more time trying to cut me down for my opinion , then you are for someone who preys on 14 year old girls that he gets drunk and manipulates . But yeah , I 'm the bad guy here for not wanting to be `` understanding '' . Tell me why I 'm wrong , but lets be nice and try to understand the rapist ! Right , stating that *what he 's doing is wrong* ( yes , that 's all I said regarding his actual actions ) is racist apologetic . Yes , I try to alter your opinion . That 's why I comment . I 'm trying to make you see that there 's more to having sex with underage kids than the media would have you believe . Someone ca n't help who he/she is sexually attracted to , we can only learn them that we do not accept them acting on their desires . IMO we should do this . People generally do n't take advice from people that in their mind does not understand them . You see this in all things : kids and their parents , relationship advice , this post to you on reddit . So understanding why he has sex with underage girls is important . There can be tons of reasons for this , plenty of which can be shown to not only relate to young girls , e.g . small boobs . Re : the getting drunk- he has only ( AFAWK ) done this with one , others he has served alcohol . This =/= getting drunk . Also , every guy ever gets girls drunk and manipulates them . & gt ; I agree with that , but does n't apply in this case . He knows what he is doing is wrong , he even said he knows hes going to end up in prison , and on top of that he said he does n't care and is going to continue to do that . All your carebear understanding and forgiveness in the world is n't going to change that guy short of professional mental help which you ca n't supply . Oh , I agree that he should get professional mental help . Do you not think that extending the character of such help through everyday life works though ? Would you be fine with telling someone who attempted suicide that he should feel bad for shit he 's done and that he should jump off a roof ? No ? Moreover , stigmatising people only makes them sheltered . For this person to come out and seek professional help , he needs to be convinced that it wo n't work out negatively for him . For that , it helps for people to say that they understand his position , but do not agree with him . Witch hunting everyone is sure as hell not going to make them walk out their front door . & gt ; I do n't need to understand why he does these things to know that a mid twenties male intentionally getting 14 year olds drunk and trying to get them to `` do anal '' is wrong . It 's wrong . If you need to have a polite conversation with that rapist to understand that , by all means stop wasting your time talking to me and go have a private chat with him . As I explained above , people do n't take advice from people who they think do not understand them . You are also , as is usual in cases like this , extrapolating for the worst from things he says , and combining statements he presented as separate occasions . So no , you do not need to talk to him to understand that what he does in wrong , but to why he does it . Do you think you can get that from talking to anyone but him ? & gt ; Actually , statutory rape is a type of rape , and that is why it has rape in the term . First of all , that logic is flawed . Second , that depends on your definition of rape . If you view it as having sex with someone without consent then you are legally correct , practically not always ( see my example above about 18/16 dating ) . Again , **consent can exist even when we legally state it doesn't** However , it 's mostly defined by the public nowadays as having the inclusion of force , i.e . forcible rape . In which case , it 's something completely different . & gt ; Much like date rape . It 's still rape . This guy is a statutory date rapist , and sounds mostly like a date rapist if anything . Just because he is n't stealing random women off the street and sexually assaulting them , does n't mean it 's not rape , as that type of rape carries that assaul level charges with it . It is rape , but keep trying to sweep this dudes issues under the rug for him . AFAIK date rapists use GHB or similar to be able to take advantage of girls , right ? This is most definitely different- he may be having very consensual sex with the girls that we deem as wrong because they 're underage . That 's different from drugging someone up and feeling them up . & gt ; Your right , he 's a great guy , and we need to just talk to him and treat him nicely and he 'll totally stop being a shit bag . Which is completely what I 've argued this entire time in every post I 've made concerning this topic . See ? I can do sarcasm too . -- - Now , let me clarify something : I do think that what he 's doing is wrong . First and foremost on the account of the fact that he 's using alcohol to take advantage of the girls . The fact they are underage is something I 'm split on- on one hand it 's illegal , on the other hand the girls can be perfectly fine with what happened- as many college aged girls that have sex with men whilst they are inebriated . I like to assume the latter , because that would mean we have someone taking advantage of the girls instead of raping them and because **TBH if this guy does this so much , I 'd imagine one of them would have filed charges by now . ** -- -- - & gt ; Cheers , I wo n't reply to you anymore as I really do n't enjoy having conversations with pseudo intellectual people being apologetic over rapist shitbags . A , so I get a stab too . Thanks , I enjoy that . A shame you do n't like discussions .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"Yes , you should . It discredits your entire argument and has been pointed out by someone else , understanding is important in cases like this .

And further on , are some chests/merchants pre-determined to hold certain loot ? Say a chest has a unique diagram , but I go ahead and buy it first . Will that chest have different loot , or will it just not be there ? Or maybe it is there , what happens then ? I guess what Im really wondering about is whether I should buy as many unique items ( recipes/diagrams/cards ) as possible , because I will just get different/new items later on when looting/winning cards , OR , if I should save my money and count on finding most of the stuff by looting/winning cards etc .

Further on , I think the distinction is meaningless , because it 's not the firing mode that makes the difference for which rifles should be sold over the counter to millions of civilians , it 's the magazine capacity , the ammunition and the designed purpose of the weapon .

Regarding police-enforcement , I agree that they should never be above the law , but I do believe they should have a right to question/disarm a citizen at their discretion -- so long as they will be held responsible -- in a fair court . What is the point of spending a significant amount of taxation to uphold a police force if they are to be reduced to the same rules as everybody else , when on duty ? Also , ie . the video in question and many similar ones regarding gun-rights , I see the 'victim of policing ' being more than knowledgable about the relevant laws ( sometimes more than the police ) , but using it to thwart policing in semantics for their own particular case .

1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"As far as I know , meditation and hypnosis is scientifically proven to alter brainwave frequency when practiced , especially in more experienced individuals . I dont find it very unlikely that audio could help in achieving a desired mental state more easily , especially considering buddhist monks have chanted in groups for ages . Whether or not that is true , I find it pretty far fetched that you compare the use of audio to drugs , hyperventilation , crystal vibrations etc . You also seem to be implying that OP 's practice is not 'valid ' , because he/she happened to do so while listening to certain sounds , and that is just silly . All in all , I find your rant about what is right or wrong to be judgemental , non-constructive and quite random . I really think the meditation community would be doing itself a favor by distancing itself from this kind of thing .",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Yeah . Here 's the thing . Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . It is not meaningless at all . Every single thing you do might alter brainwave activity , but the relevant part is in which direction , how much , and for how long . When sleeping , the brain wave frequencies dramatically changes when compared to being awake . Why should it not be measurable on the opposite side of the scale , when highly focused and attentive ? & gt ; I did n't say OP 's practice is not valid , I have no idea what the studies are ( I would guess they 're inconclusive ) . All I 'm saying is that it 's not meditation . Why would listening to certain sounds prevent meditation ? Even if all this audio at certain hz ' is just mumbo jumbo , it could certainly act as merely whitenoise , which many people find useful to prevent distraction .",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Provide some study demonstrating that inducing certain brainwave frequencies brings about some kind of benefit . I did not claim that inducing certain brainwave frequencies provides benefits , and I will thus not defend said non-claim . I merely disagreed with your idea that meditation has nothing to do with brainwave frequencies because 'Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . ' However , my opinion as a layman and # not-an-actual-neuro-scientist , is that brainwaves have a lot to do with meditation , including its benefits . Here is an article about meditation that does not talk about benefits , but changes in brainwaves during meditation . http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100319210631.htm Feel free to read that or google 'hokey new age drug psychedelic buzz seekers studies ' to find your own sources . & gt ; First of all , I did n't say certain sounds prevent meditation My interpretation of your initial post was that you strongly disregarded OP 's meditation as valid , because he/she listened to certain audio while practicing . The title of this thread is 'Found this video to *meditate to* ' . Neither OP or I have claimed that the audio itself can be poured into anyones ears and it can be regarded meditation . & gt ; Also , you 're contradicting yourself here . *Audio does not prevent meditation* and *blocking out audio fascilitates meditation* is not a contradiction , even if reworded by you . I suggest we leave this matter for now , as we seem to not agree even on what we are discussing . You seem pissed off about 'new age stuff ' and I will certainly agree with you on a lot of things in that regard , but I found your initial post to be somewhat insulting , because my opinion is that there were no reason to bring up all that stuff in such a negative retoric , just because OP said he/she meditated while listening to certain audio , which he/she found useful or helpful .",Germanic,Norwegian
