12084182,dating,"That 's fine , did n't mean to state that lack of dating experience equates to being a virgin or lack of experience in bed . I was just annoyed with the poster above stating that lying is okay because the person will never know , but there 's a chance that they might . I dated someone who although he had a serious relationship of 5 years ( high school ) he was still a virgin and we were right around there 23-24 or so when he lost his . So lack of experience can come in many forms , but when you find the right person , it does n't matter . I would n't care if the person had few or short relationships , though I might wonder why they did n't work out and if the person had a reason/issues for ending them or they ended for normal reasons and there just was n't any compatibility and they do n't know yet what they really want , which is fine when you first start out . Even after so many relationships and serious ones at that , I still find myself realizing what I want in my next one and so on .

12084182,MaliciousCompliance,"The first university I attended was really crap . The degree was n't organized that well ( advertising , with a huge emphasis on traditional arts ) and I had some annoying teachers . Josh was a douchebag teacher that would come in an hour late , high as fuck ( you 'd see him hotboxing his car in the parking lot ) , tell everyone to hit the cafeteria and grab a coffee or whatever but then I show up 5 minutes late for a presentation and I might as well be dead . So I detested him and never talked to him about projects or anything . Just kept to myself which he despised . If you talked to him , you were guaranteed a pass in the class . I was always in class , all my classes . Another classmate that I was friends with , hated him equally as much but did n't show up to classes because of it . She did however talk to him when she was in class and got his feedback . Presentation day . We have to bring in all projects from all classes into a room and all the teachers sit around while you get critiqued by the teacher of each subject . Josh decides to tell everyone how my work sucks . One of the teachers that I happen to know outside of school , looks at my work , and goes 'umm ... this is actually quite brilliant ... Why does it suck ? I think it 's a perfect example of what the project should be ' Josh goes 'well , she 's never in class ... I never see her there ... that 's not good enough ...

12084182,Shoestring,"The concept is pretty simple : The traveler performs a service for a host in exchange for free accommodation . The service can be anything the two people agree on : from cooking lessons or massage to website design or house repairs . Likewise , the length of stay can be accordingly negotiated . Sometimes a service will require host ’ s presence ( in case of , lets say , personal coaching ) . Other times , the service can be delivered independently , such as website design . In such instances , it ’ s possible that the host will let you use his summerhouse for a week or two or maybe even their home without them actually being there . Whatever you two agree upon should be honored . We are here to provide a platform that will help you find a great opportunity and enable you to make a connection with your match , be it a host or a service provider . We are still in the early stages of project development , but are working hard to make it come to life . One of our main goals is to make this platform free for everyone . If that turns out to be impossible , and we are cornered into charging some kind of fee to cover our operating expenses , we will aim to make access fee as low as possible . We are determined , however , to grant our early adopters Premium Free Membership for life regardless of how much we may later decide to charge regular users . It 's for people that would love to travel and see new places but ca n't really afford to get a room . So you 'd just offer your skill set to a potential host and they 'd let you stay at theirs for free in exchange for helping them out with what you can offer . For example : I need someone to help me with this programming course I 've started . I ca n't seem to get a hang of it . You come along and I offer you to stay at mine in exchange for help with programming . You 've got a place to stay , food , and outings if we arrange it . It 's up to the host if they want to offer more than a place to stay and food/necessities . Discuss with them and find a suitable arrangement . Sure , you can teach programming online and get yourself a room in a hotel as you travel and work , but why not meet people along the way ? We think this is the best way to integrate into a local culture , be with locals !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

He said , 'you do love the dick more though right ? ' trying to make a statement that I would n't be with a girl , because his dick is good enough . He said it was probably an experimental phase , I was trying things out when I was with a girl ( we did n't date , but we went all out ) and he thinks I was just feeling adventurous or whatever , but I like guys better . He said I 'm straight , cause I 'm with him , right ? So that must make me straight .

12084182,ElectricalEngineering,"I have some old Sony stereo speakers that I got and ended up in my car a few years back and have stayed there since . Now I want to use them to power my birthday party . A friend who dj 's suggested he 'd play music if we can figure out a sound setup and throw a party in the middle of the woods . So we have the speakers from my car which are n't too bad ( in terms of loudness ) , but they just have wires at the end , like the cable sticks out of the speaker , and at the end it splits off into two separate wires ( I 'm guessing power and ground ) and then they turn into left and right when they connect to the main power of the car that the door speakers connect to . But how can I turn that wire into something more useful ? And would a generator help ? I might have an amp of sorts at home , but I 'm not sure if it works , it 's just been laying around collecting dust , some Pioneer amp that 's been in this house since my parents got it . Let me know if that 's of use and I 'll find a way to see if it works . But the amp needs powering as well , so maybe it 's not necessary if I can just plug the speakers straight to a generator without needing one . Also how much noise would a generator cause ? The speakers are n't bad but if a generator makes noise that will be problematic since they 're not party speakers per se . I just figured woods would make everything louder , but with a generator ... But if it can be kept at a distance , like really long cables away from the speakers then it should n't be a problem . And if this is not the right sub , let me know , I had no idea where to post this . tl ; dr : Have some regular stereo system speakers I would like to power in the woods .

12084182,careerguidance,"Well there 's nothing really bad about the employers themselves . The office is wow in a weird way . It 's a call center based out of a house . Right now we 're by ourselves at the night shift . But the one guy that trained us , he was here for the first week and then left to train people in another office ( different country ) but he 's super chill , like jokes around on the phone with clients , smokes weed at work , I think ( more like know as another employee that has been there longer hinted at ) he does coke as well . Tells us to swim in the house pool any time we like as well . So it 's a very weird atmosphere . We fuck around a lot , like the guy that 's been there a while , he recently got back from being at their other office in the other country and said they fuck around a lot too and barely do any work , the company is a mess and when I told him how we signed contracts the other day , he was surprised saying until recently there were n't any contracts . Another guy worked for 6 months without a contract , cash payments only but left for personal reasons . We 're basically 800+5 % . But the contract I signed says after the 3 months 'probation ' which is basically training and us being 'outsourced ' workers , we go permanent , just the 5 % and we were told it 's because of the amount of people that do n't like call center work and quit . Which did happen , out of 10 of us , only 5 of us are on the team now . Thing is after the 3 months , contract states it 's just 5 % and I do n't like that , it 's going to take me longer than 3 months to get a solid client from cold calling and getting money out of him a while longer before he decides to invest bigger money . ( We do sports betting/handicapping ) For now I 'm sticking around for the salary . Now the guy that 's been there longer said that he 's not sticking around either if he has to sign on permanently , we 're slowly piecing together how much of a scam our company is ( product wise ) and the shit they pull for evasion of things and I just do n't like it that much . It took them 2 weeks to get our contracts , we got paid for the 2 weeks , then the guy said to not date the contracts so the lawyer can date them when she gets back from holiday . We feel she might not exist and it 's a contract for us to think there 's one so we ca n't do anything but they do n't have it signed so it 's not legal in case we do try to do anything . What do I tell a new employer ? Why would I be leaving such a job ? I like the people I work with , I like the chill atmosphere , we can dress however , do whatever , I just do n't think I can handle living off just the 5 % and if something happens to them as a company because of weird practices , it 's not good for me .

12084182,cyprus,"So I got a job at a call center . First three months I get salary+5 % which is n't really going to happen unless I 'm extremely lucky and get a customer to sign up . But after the three months I sign a permanent contract ( as of now I work as an 'outsourced ' worker because of the amount of people that quit , it 's not worth it to them to do social , medical , etc . for the first 3 months if we 're going to quit fast ) but the permanent contract will not include a salary , just 5 % commission . Is that legal ? I had one co-worker tell me they worked for another place and were only paid 5 % so if this is standard practice , then I assume it 's legal , but I do know we have a minimum wage depending on industry and I ca n't imagine commission falling into that because what if you get no commission that month ? I understand why they do the first type of contract as I 've only been here 2 weeks and had 3 people quit within the second week ( first was training ) and so they do n't want to waste their time , but how can they not give us a salary after that ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I started one degree , a year in , transferred to another university ( the degree was really crappy , and the university too ) . The other one was better , but 3 years in I got accepted to a really good university in the States and moved there . I graduated . All 3 degrees were somewhat arts related , so nothing businesslike . The first one had a focus on advertising , but I never got to that , as the first year was very traditional arts based . I 've come to the conclusion ( long story , involving family , and me being fed up with my current situation , 26- jobless and stuck with family problems ) , that I 'd like to move out and just get any job . So I 'm trying to get into the forex/binary options/trading industry , whatever you call it . It 's huge in my country , so there 's constantly jobs available .

My social skills are not that great , and even though they hire just about anyone , ( you do n't need any skills for entry-level positions because they offer training ) , they want to see extroversion in a person . The last interview I went to , the lady asked some general questions , and even though I answered them the way she wanted , she was a bit stuck on how I have 3 artsy degrees and nothing on my resume related to their industry or business in general or customer service .

She pointed out how I worked as a lyricist for about 2 years , but when asked if I still do that , I said no . I regret not expounding on the interview . For lyricist I could have said that I did n't like the contract , which was true . My manager got 20 % of all profits and if I had any kind of job during that contract ( other than it ) , he got 20 % of my profits , even if the job continued when the contract expired ( what kind of bs is that ? who does that ? ) If she had known I quit not because I got bored and do that all the time , but because I was being treated unfairly , it would have been different , no ? Another thing I wish I had mentioned , though I 'm hoping you can tell me if my logic is sound , I have epilepsy that has only recently been discovered though I 've had it all my life ( a type that is n't easily noticeable ) and I might not be able to work in my field anyway if the doctors conclude that lights and sounds affect my health . So I wish when she had asked me 'what was your first job choice upon graduation , or what would you rather chose right now if given the chance ... ' that I had said I had epilepsy and could n't work in my field either way because of that , and am thus seeking work elsewhere without having to obtain another degree . Would that have helped reassure her I was n't a fight risk ? I 'm not sure how to land a job like that , since I do n't look like someone that would last long , but I really just want a job so I can move out and be on my own and not be surrounded by my toxic family . They are really starting to get on my nerves and I just want a place of my own , a stable job whatever it might be and time for myself to de-stress .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,SCBuildIt,"I tried Andy once before and could not get it to work but it might have been the laptop I had at the time that I do n't have anymore . Today I lost my tablet ( only device I can load SCBuildit on ) and decided to run BlueStacks on the desktop I have but it 's old and slow so that might be the issue . I 've not had an issue with BlueStacks running SCB before just it taking a while to set up . But this is beyond ridiculous . It 's just constantly setting up my Google account and I do n't know what else to do . I 've been going up steadily in the new contest of Mayors and was 9th place , going to be promoted to the next rank ( I 'm on the one where only 10 get promoted ) But I do n't want to lose that spot and had a ton of missions lined up and ready to just accept and take what I 've already made that 's just waiting , and now I 'm going to miss out on that and the extra points .

12084182,cyprus,"Not sure what to look for , I tried Googling everything , but nothing remotely useful comes up . I 'm talking about stuff like medication . My epilepsy medication is currently 160 Euros a month , and that 's not including this other one that I currently have a decent amount of thanks to my sister bringing some from our home country where it 's far cheaper . So that 's also going to add up once I run out . And I have no idea if there 's a way for it to get paid for through EU or if Cyprus has any policies on that . I have an EU citizenship and I have a yellow slip in Cyprus if that matters . How can I get my medication covered so I do n't have to pay this absurd amount every month ? I tried Googling various things , but it mostly comes up on random EU policies with other countries regarding drugs or things that are not what I need .

The one saying remember , remember the 6th of December is referring to the [ Greek Riots of 2008 ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Greek_riots ) The Akamas ones are referring to a part of the Island called Akamas that 's very peaceful and beautiful . There 's no human pollution , how to say it , no destruction of nature . and because of it 's beauty , various greedy pigs want to come and make hotels there and destroy it . The other thing , it 's also known as a breeding ground for a certain type of turtle that comes there once a year to breed and lays eggs on the sand . And people come to watch and ruin that , so we have to go and protect the turtles so they can breed and keep their species going . Building hotels and tourist attractions there would ruin the chances for the turtles survival . So there 's a lot of green anarchists protesting to keep that area clear of greedy fucks . There 's also anarcha-feminists , hence the purple anarchy logo ! The one poster with the antifa flag is stating that there 's a documentary on refugees screening and discussion at a cafe . I also saw another thing while driving but did n't get to take a picture : `` it 's a class war '' written on a wall . And the last two images were just nice graffiti I saw on the way .

12084182,techsupport,"Laptop , HP EliteBook 8760W A rundown of recent events : HDD crashed . Plugged another one in from a different laptop . I downloaded Windows to do a fresh install as that one had windows configured for the other laptop . Before I got to that though , the laptop suggested I do a free upgrade to Windows 10 . I accepted it and did n't realize that it had 32-bit architecture and that it would follow on to the Windows 10 installation without prompting me if I 'd like 64-bit instead . So I got 10 at 32-bit and it was sluggish so I downloaded the ISO for Windows 10 64-bit . Used some Microsoft tool for creating a bootable USB . Formatted the drive to install Windows on a blank drive without previous Windows on it . Now every time it preps Windows to install , it restarts and it gets stuck on the boot screen that says 'press esc to enter setup menu ' or whatever . If I do n't click esc right away the screen freezes and I ca n't click any button to get a response . I have no idea what to do at this point . In the installation menu for Windows it asks if I have a product key . I tried typing what came with the 32-bit windows ( going from what the properties of My Computer had displayed ) but I was missing 4 digits . So I chose 'I do n't have a product key ' thinking it 'd just know that I had Windows 10 and it was a free upgrade and register it for me . Should I find a key for it ? Would that make a difference ? I currently do not have access to any other computer other than a MacBook and I 'm not sure how helpful that is since it 's not Windows . I asked on the Microsoft support forums but all I got was 'we 're working on the issue . We 'll get back to you as soon as possible ' Like that 's of any use .

12084182,techsupport,"My main question is about Windows 10 . Here 's what happened , my laptop fell , HDD died and I just grabbed one from another laptop that was too slow for any use . Loaded it just to see if everything else was okay as hardware side seemed fine . It loaded fine , but I just needed to reinstall windows as it was set up for the other laptop with other drivers . Get the internet drivers , and basic drivers just so I can get a few things done as I did n't have time to reinstall Windows right away . Windows suggests I upgrade for free to 10 , I 've heard good stuff so figured it was worth a shot . And just did the upgrade while running Windows . It installed 32-bit as apparently the Windows 7 installation on that HDD was 32-bit and it kept the architecture and did n't ask me to chose . What can I do now ? I did n't think it would just default to what I had , and honestly forgot that it might have something other than 64-bit as I got so used to most modern computers being 64-bit . I tried resetting through settings , but it told me it had an error and could n't do it . Downloaded a windows upgrade installer , but I feel it 's going to do the same thing and just install 32-bit . Is my windows 7 activation code good if I just download a Windows 10 download , or would it require me to purchase a key for 10 ? 2 other hopefully simple questions . One , my trackpad has the scroll in reverse , so now I have to go up to scroll down and vice versa . Why ? How can I change this ? Two , my middle click button on the track bar is normally for open in new tab .

She gets up to eat and use the bathroom ( a porta chair/toilet next to her bed ) and that 's about it . No one knows how to talk to my one sister . She blames everyone for everything and is always angry and is on drugs as she claims it 's the only thing keeping her same . She until recently took care of anything mom related , paid the hospice women , organized doctors visits and anything else needed . I 've since taken over this role as dad has deemed her unstable and he thinks it 's brought her down too much . Anyway , mom has been given another 5 years to live and she will most likely not die from the Parkinson 's but from everything else , not moving and whatever else could happen as her brain is fine . But she does have at least 5 years in her and she 's a fighter . I recently planned a trip and my sister sees my status on facebook and messages me to hold off on buying tickets as our aunt is coming on the 12th ( september , I was planning on leaving 10th but with my aunt coming I planned on 13th so I get to see her but my sister wanted me to delay it further ) Then she drops the bomb that she 's planning a family reunion as a farewell for mom . What the fuck ? A farewell ? I told my other sister who is furious as to why we are having a farewell for mom when although she 's in a bad state , she 's far from dying . I ca n't wrap my head around this .

12084182,relationships,"Maybe I 'm overreacting but sometimes her attitude really grinds my gears and we 've had issues in the past over it , but I 'm trying to deal with it so we do n't have problems . I 've known her since high school . She 's always thought of herself highly and thought everyone likes her and so on . She 's also easily hurt and I 've made her cry in the past ( and I do n't think I 've ever made anyone else cry before ... ) She never really had any friends . I was her only friend in high school bar from one guy at her school ( we went to different schools ) Then we went our separate ways for college and just saw each other over holidays . But now we 're both living in the same city . She 's been here for 2 years , and does n't really have any friends , and I moved here 6 months ago . I found a group through Facebook that get together on a bi-weekly basis to play a board game I like . I invited her the first time because I did n't want to go alone as I do n't know anyone . We met 4-5 people that day and played some board games . The next few times I went alone as she was on holidays and more people came and it turns out it 's usually a bigger group , just that day it was a few people . I met the group and we all got to know each other . It 's been more than a month since she 's been and she was in town last time so I reminded her I was going ( so she does n't get hurt I did n't invite her if she realizes I went because that 's what would usually happen and she 'd start having self destructive thoughts ) . We walk in ( it 's a small neighborhood bar , really small , and just a place for regulars to chill and have a beer ) and her first reaction is `` HEY EVERYONE , REMEMBER ME ? '' I feel kinda awkward because we walked in to part of the bar and I know for a fact that she did n't know anyone there , and they looked at her like , no , who are you ? Then 2 people she knew came over and we did some introductions with the others . And decided to play games . We played cards against humanity because there were a lot of people and everyone knows the game . At some point people were engaging in discussion about something she does n't know anything about , and she was getting frustrated that a ) she ca n't participate in discussion because it 's a foreign topic to her , and she does n't like being silent , she has the need to always be talking or center of attention and b ) the game was n't being played . But we 're not there to just play games , we 're there to socialize and if we play games , great , if not , still great , we 're enjoying ourselves . She would be like 'ahem , so yeah , let 's continue with the game , we are playing are n't we ? ' Especially if it was her turn , she 'd be like 'so yeah , it 's my turn , and I 'm gon na read my cards now ... ' And one turn I pointed out how someone went for beer and we should wait for them to get back and she 's like 'OH , someone went for beer , so I ca n't read my cards , but when they get back , it 's my turn , so I 'll read my cards , and we 'll continue with the game ' really loudly . It just felt unnatural , and she left early and made it a point to say bye to everyone and loudly point out she was leaving more than once so everyone knew and make sure they remember her . So we 're texting when she left , and I said how I think the one guy liked her ( there were two were sitting together and talking most of the night , but the other guy definitely looked like he had it in for her ) , and she 's like 'yeah , I think they both liked me , they were into me ' She 's insecure so I tell her things like how someone might have liked her . I also compliment her without reason just because she 's like 'aww , thanks , really ? You think so ? ' to help her with her self-esteem . But then with things like this she gets this attitude ... All the guys liked me , I 'm sure of it ... I 'm so amazing and pretty , they ca n't help themselves . and I just hate that attitude that she just assumes everyone is into her and all that ... Maybe they are , hey , that 's not a bad thing ... but when people talk like that and say those things ... I hate that `` all attention to me everyone ! '' It 's fine and well that it 's her thing , I do n't want to change her , but when it affects the whole situation and gives her a lack of social awareness , then I have an issue because I 'm not enjoying myself anymore . Like if we 're all enjoying a discussion and having fun , laughing , whatever , you should n't just be like 'ahem , let 's play the game please . ' We 're all clearly in the mood to talk about something for a bit before continuing . It made her look weird cause she was n't fitting in with what was going on in the moment . I do n't really know anyone in this city and she 's pretty much my only friend , so I do n't exactly want to ditch her because she 's fine when we hang 1on1 or do something else , but it 's situations like these that make it weird . I like these people and would like to become friends outside of our bi-weekly game nights so I have more people in my friend pool . But I feel like she might make the game nights weird . If I do n't invite her to game night , she 's going to get hurt , but if I do , I 'm gon na get frustrated because she ca n't be in a social space where all the attention is not on her . It 's fine if you like attention , but save it for a club or some other environment . But if we 're all having a fine time and just talking , do n't ruin it by making everyone stare at you every second ... So I do n't know . Am I overreacting ? I feel like I should just ignore it and let it play itself out and hopefully she comes to her own conclusions but all the same , I feel awkward bringing her along if she 's gon na act like that and make things flow not as seamlessly as they would otherwise . Ideas ? -- - **tl ; dr** : So , in my opinion , I feel like my friend is really awkward in public and I feel like she does n't understand social cues . If I do n't invite her out , she 'll get hurt . If I do , she 'll make things weird for everyone ( or maybe it 's in my head ) .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,badroommates,"/x/post from /r/relationships since they thought it was more suited here . So I met my ex roommate Claire while she was in a tight spot and needed a place to crash fast . At the time I lived with my ex who was away for the summer teaching a camp and I was planning on moving out . I offered her a place to stay until she finds a place . Let the adventures begin . I had another girl staying with me who was to be my roommate once I moved out of my ex 's . In the meantime I end up in a car accident whiplashed and in a neck brace unable to even lift a glass of water . My to-be roommate decided it was too much for her and bailed . Claire seemed more than willing to help me with groceries , changing , and anything else because after the accident my hands could n't even go past my hips without it being too hard and painful . I was doped up 24/7 to kill the pain . We move in and I find out that Claire is one of the most disgusting people ever . Ex . Dishes never washed , to the point of mouldy food . Shower and shave and leave hairs in bathtub because she does n't know how to get rid of them . Her room was so gross with everything all over the floor ( and in general in the apartment ) . I 'd try and clean when I was a bit better but she 'd yell that I moved such and such item and lost it and now she does n't know where it is . Anyway , she was also BPD and would not stop leaving me alone . She 'd wake up and be like 'Hey , you awake ? ' I am now ... 'Great ! I 'm making breakfast ' 'Oh , where ya headed ? Can I come with ? What are you doing ? Can I join ? Oh I do n't mind that you 're just painting , I like to watch . Oh you want to read ... Oh , we can go to a park and read together ... Oh , I 'll watch that TV show with you even though it 's linear and I do n't know the history of the show or characters ... ' We were college students and my family was in Europe while I was an international student in the States so having family help out was complicated especially since they barely saved up to get me into this college , it 's good but affording rent too and all the other stuff post-accident was really complicated . So yeah . Also , Claire is bad with money . Ca n't make money for this or that . I 'm stuck . I ca n't be rude and have her starve , I 'm human , of course I care . But I also do n't have a backbone . So I bought food for the both of us . She got a job at Macy 's temporarily . Before she got fired she bought stuff like a TV for the apartment , which we did n't need . Among other things , like a GoPro for herself and some personal items for hobbies . Then she lost the job and could n't seem to land another one . We went to food banks all the time and she 'd get angry if I did n't have time to help her with her problems , like what kind of a friend am I ? What if I have my own life to live ? Like she broke her smartphone so she could n't have a phone with Uber . I was out with a friend . She calls me asking for an Uber since she got up late to get to work ( always woke up late and was bad with time management ) and got angry when I said I was busy ( it was a date , I thought it might be urgent ) , and could n't help her . Or she 'd bang on my door when she had a morning shift ( 1 hour ride to work , so up at 6-7 or something ) and she 'd bang on my door for the Uber when she was late and be like 'Do you not want me to make rent ? ' when I say I 'm still sleeping . Stop manipulating me . I could n't get her to move out as it was a joint lease and she 'd have to sign she 's leaving . Great . I tried everything , but where would she go anyway ? Be homeless ? She was also full of suicidal threats and transgender so on hormone therapy which made her mood swings insane , I tried to deal with it because you ca n't help who you are but some days I just could n't . Anyway , at some point I count up all the money she owes me for bills . 380 $ or something like that . I 'm broke at this point too because we let this couple crash on our living room for money and found out they are known for doing that and robbing the people they stay with so they took 1k out of her student loan and 600 $ that I got paid for something . I tell her at the end that I ca n't make last months internet bill , or rather 3 bills back that I did n't pay . About 300 , and instead of her paying me the 380 that she owes for what I did pay , she can just pay that off when she gets her tax returns and I 'll forgo the rest , so I 'm not stuck trying to find 300 in a hurry . She does n't do that . I think I hit her up about it once but she said she called and they made a fuss about it being in my name or something . I was outside of the states by then and back with family as my mom is sick and I just wanted to get away from there . I notice today on my credit report that the Brighthouse internet bill has showed up ( 3 years later ? ) and it 's sitting there , and I 'm not liking it . I already have some of the medical stuff on there that I have n't paid off yet , I made arrangements for most of it but I 'm not made of money so it 's stuck . But I 'm also not liking seeing her Facebook statuses that involve her crashing from couch to couch and being kicked out for bad habits of being a roommate and having no money for food , and how no-one will hire her . What do I do at this point ? I want to bring it up somehow , let her know I understand she 's broke but she needs to understand the consequences of her actions and that she needs to work on herself . I see her making posts about how maybe this is the life she 's destined for , she 's accepted that she 'll always be couch surfing and broke and jobless or some shit I want to write a positive email to her explaining how she can change if she puts the effort and she can make better habits and inspire her , because it 's no way to live . She 's also resorted to being an activist as of late and all her posts are protesting things and Trump . So I do n't know if it 'll be worth it , but she should know that she 's affected people .

I wipe them , still there , keep wiping , notice that they are leaking from a space where two plastic parts join . I did n't have them near any black ink nor did they get wet , and even if they did ( I do go to the gym and sweat a bit ) , copper oxidization would be green/turquoise/blue .

This one seems to be out of sale on sweetwater , hence the Amazon link , so I do n't know if it 's a discontinued model . Though it is discounted at the local site by quite a bit . Was originally 341 $ . ) [ Roland A-500 Pro ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/A500Pro ) ( 280 Euros . Also the local site has a different version it seems , instead of Roland it says cakewalk in it 's place . Other than that , it looks the same but I do n't know if that makes a difference , same model . ) [ Novation Launchkey 61 ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LaunchK2-61 ) ( 267 $ ) [ Alesis VI 49 ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/VI49 ) ( 224 $ ) So basically just looking for your opinions on each one . Why you would or would n't go for a particular model . I just want to make some music for fun . I can play the piano a bit , but do n't have an interest in actually playing piano , I 'd rather make other types of music/experiment . I do a lot of sound design and use that in DAW 's ( mostly Pro Tools and Logic ) to create stuff and make organic music , it 'd be fun to have a keyboard to work with alongside that .

Just a lump of mushroom . And one day I kicked it just to see what would happen and it fell off ( to note , the tree has broken apart about a year ago , it just snapped , and I 'm wondering if it 's the mushroom ? ) Anyway , for a while it was just that centerpiece until I kicked it off , and then within like 3-4 days of kicking it off it somehow managed to not only grow back , but grow that extra puffy bit surrounding the center ball . What the fuck ? I 'm wondering if the rain helped it grow faster or if the rain is the result of that extra bit that 's now there ? Also you can see in some photos droplets of something , that drip on the ground .

12084182,techsupport,"So there 's a situation at work . My boss and supervisor are both tech stupid and I 'm the 'smart ' one when it comes to computers and internet so they always ask for my help . But I have no clue how to figure this out . Now there was another guy who came during another shift and he did some stuff , like get the email reports I mentioned above . The guy has done some weird stuff with the company so they are planning on letting him go , but for now they are slowly limiting his access to stuff . So they changed the godaddy password to the web/email they use . He came in and asked for it since he was locked out , and they said they did n't want him to have it , just them two . So then he goes 'well at least let me know what emails are being sent out each day so I can send you guys reports ' Now I work at a call center , and we ask people for emails to tell them about our company . So sometimes we get the email wrong , and I can see that in the mailbox , but I do n't have access to the other report that he supposedly has access to . Where we can see how often they 've looked at our email and if they 've clicked on our link ? He asked for a list of emails sent each day so he can send us a detailed report of each one . How can he still have access to something like that if he does n't have access to the inbox ? How can we see something like that ? I only see 'delivery status notification ' in the inbox , just saying the email has bounced back . Nothing more than that . We want to stop him from having any kind of access but would also like to have access to those reports ourselves . I do n't see anything of the sorts in the godaddy email page . Nothing in settings , anywhere . Nothing suggesting he 's getting something forwarded to him .

12084182,callcenter,"So I got this job 2 months ago . I 'm a pretty quiet person so I was surprised I got it , but I needed something until I get something in my field . Anyway , we are outbound and try and convince people to sign up with our company ( sports betting sorta ) . We trade on their behalf . Anyway , first database we had , it was full of people that were previously in that industry and was really bad as most people would just be like 'fuck off , you 're all scammers ' , or 'I do n't bet anymore ' or some shit . Really hard to find clients to give emails as they 've had bad experiences in the past . Second database we got the other day was of general people , and most do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . With the first database I could write extensive scripts and change my approach every time because I knew the client knew what I was on about and their tone of voice and word choices would give them away if they were really interested or trying to get rid of me . New database , I say simple things because most people are just like 'I do n't do that , I do n't know what that is , I do n't have time for that , or money etc . ' So I just briefly state that we 're an investor company and we have a free email for them if they are interested . Anyway , manager that listens to all the calls and monitors us came in today to do our monthly meeting and give paychecks and told me that our boss who watches the cameras and stuff has seen me slack off quite a bit and be lazy . And I have two weeks to improve . BUT that he personally , from listening to my calls , says that I have the potential to be better than anyone of the others in my team and that I have a knack for knowing when the client is interested and when they 're just wanting me to fuck off which is hard to do and I know how to write great scripts and rebuttals ( using the customers words against them ) . He also said that he 's heard my prank calls ( at the end of the shift everyone gives me their 'bad ' customers and I prank them from a private line that they 've won something or another and everyone makes me do it cause they think I 'm the best at it ) and he 's confused how my prank calls are so brilliant and perfect and yet my regular calls are lacking enthusiasm and I sound 'docile ' as he put it . He said I 'm really intelligent , he can see that in me but he does n't know how to motivate me . Any other employee , he can tell them exactly what to do to improve but I 'm an enigma to him and he knows I 've got tremendous potential but he ca n't figure out how to get me to pull it out of me . Honestly , it 's a really boring job , we 're doing things manually as they do n't have computers set up yet . So I have a paper sheet in front of me , dial numbers on the phone and then write feedback on the paper and it 's just so tedious . I get distracted easily and do something else other than calls . I want to push myself but I do n't know how . I lack motivation because I never saw myself doing this , I have 2 degrees and ca n't find a job in either field . Maybe because I see this as temporary it 's hard to take it more seriously .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Do n't really need rape counseling with this post but since relationships might not want to deal with my post , here it is . Also to state , the rape in question happened when I was 11 , I 'm 26 now . Here 's the original post I had : Why do some people think that because rape is n't so bad compared to something else , it therefore is n't so bad at all ... ? This concept just baffles me . Last night I ( 26 ) was out with some friends I 've been hanging with lately . Rick ( 19 ) , a friend of a friend that I 've known for some time , have hung out a few times lately and sometimes with his friends . I moved back home 2 months ago and did n't really have anyone to hang with so my friend suggested I hang with him since he has nothing to do either . Anna ( Rick 's gf ) is a really quiet girl , she comes out and just tags along with whatever we do . And then there 's Dave who 's also Rick 's friend . So last night we went to some exhibition , checked it out and then at 9 there was a movie and discussion thing at another place that we go to once a week and we had time to kill so we just sat somewhere and talked . Me and Rick really started disagreeing about a lot of things , but whatever , it happens , everyone 's got their opinion , until he started talking about rape . First he said how rape is n't so bad . Me and Dave lost it , 'what do you mean rape is n't so bad ? ' Anna being quiet and just absorbing everything . Rick says 'Well , compared to getting your vagina sewed shut , rape is n't so bad ' Well duhh if I had to chose between rape and my vagina sewed shut , I 'd chose rape , but in the grand scheme of things , rape is fucked up and wrong . And it should n't be said that it 's not bad . So Dave says how Rick does n't know what he 's talking about since he 's never experienced it and Rick says how he 'd rather have a rape experience , which he said was 'temporary physical trauma ' than his finger chopped off . Me and Dave said how there 's emotional trauma too , and his response was 'emotional trauma is far from physical trauma ' At this point I just lost it , and started yelling and grabbed him really hard ( he was sitting in front of me , a step below me ) and I was crying/wailing . When I finally managed to compose myself , I explained how I 'd rather have my finger chopped off than 10 years of emotional torture that I suffered , and then cried more and kept apologizing , I guess because I was embarrassed of making a scene in front of them all . Dave kept saying how I should n't be sorry , why am I sorry ? It was just so overwhelming , I thought back to all that I went through , and explained how I could n't even let someone close to me hug me for the longest time , even that was impossible for me and then we had this awkward silence for a while . No one said anything . I wanted to break the silence and say that everything was fine , but it was n't and I did n't know how . So after some time Rick asks if we should go , and we 're like , alright . He gets up , asks if I 'm okay and before I could say anything more than 'yeah ' he starts talking about something like nothing happened . I hated it . The rest of the night was fine , as usual , and I tried to act like nothing happened but driving Rick and Anna home there was this silence , and the only thing Rick said was thanks for the ride and see ya or something to that effect , I did n't really pay attention , nor did I care to . Told my best friend today who 's sorta friends with him ( well , our other best friend is close to him as a family friend so that 's how we know him ) , and he got so upset when I said I had a breakdown because of him . I did n't really tell him what happened right away just that I was angry at him and that I was over it , but when he got angry and said he was going to kill him ( figuratively ) , and I explained what happened since he asked , I realized I was n't over it and it was all coming back and I felt so uncomfortable and thought , how could someone even think something like that ? He said that he would n't know if he could be friends with him after something like that if it were him . I honestly do n't know either . I want to explain why he 's wrong , and how that affected me so he can see things differently , but I do n't know if it 's going to affect him or if I should even bother . I feel like the only way I can keep being friends is if I explain why I reacted the way I did and why I think that he 's wrong in thinking that emotional and physical trauma are separate and they are not correlated . I get that he 's entitled to his opinion , and if he 'd want to be raped over his finger chopped off , that 's fine . But to state that rape is nothing and there 's no emotional trauma involved and that it 's not correlated to physical trauma just bothers the fuck out of me . and I get that as a guy , he 's taught to repress any physical stuff and not let it get emotional and that emotional stuff might not be real , but that does n't mean he should state that it 's true for everyone . Ahh . Any advice ? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way ? My best friend agrees with me but I know that he 's also experienced rape as a kid and that he might just feel this way because he 's thinking back to his own experiences and he does n't have that whole 'you need to suppress emotions ' thing that most guys have . So I want to know if his reaction was justified , but so far Dave and my best friend think he was out of line , but somehow I feel like maybe I 'm just overreacting .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

You can suggest something if it 's a bit off if you have nothing better to suggest , just as long as some of these features are there , that 'd be great . 1 . Starts itself in Artist mode , not album mode . I want to listen to a specific band , not album . Maybe the majority is the opposite , but not me . ( not too important but nice to have ) 2 . When loading said band/artist , do n't force me to pick a specific album or chose all songs . Have them all there , categorized under album , so I can just pick a song without having to make another touch to get to all the songs . 3 . When past 5-10 seconds of a song and I click the skip back button , I want to restart the song , not go to the previous one . First five seconds , fine , I 'll go to the previous one and play it again . ( this would be really handy , so used to windows programs that do that ) 4 . On the lock screen , I do n't need an extra screen with song info , only to exit that one and get to my regular lock screen and then finally get to my device , so if it has this option , I 'd like to be able to disable it so I only have one lock screen to go through . ( sometimes I need to get to my device fast ) 5 . When I pause a song and want to skip through to find another song , do n't auto play each song . I paused for a reason so I would n't hear 2 seconds of each song as passing through . Keep it paused until I press play when I reach the song of choice . ( definitely a plus )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I ended up at an emergency 24 dentist and you guessed it , he charged like almost the same amount just for one tooth that was aching ( whereas I was going to get multiple teeth done for that amount at a regular dentist ) . My ex pays and says I 'll just pay him when I get the money . Then when I got the money he said it was more important to get my teeth fixed and just give him what 's left over and pay him back later since he 's okay with money and I need my teeth fixed . Note that around this time my mom had a surgery and my dad had to shell out roughly around 10k for that , so money was tight for him ( he 's also paying for my education in full which is n't too cheap ) . My ex had no problem waiting . I went away for the summer to see my family ( right after he got jailed ) and now that I 'm back , I went to see him . He knew that I had some plan of moving out but I guess he did n't realize the extent of it . First he was saying how I should stay and that he 'll tell his mom to not charge me for staying in his house ( he owns it , and I was paying him rent ) , and that I can save up to move out properly , etc ... and even saying I do n't have to pay him back since I brought up how I still owe him and I 'll do what I can to get it to him . Since then he 's called twice to talk ( threeway call with his parents ) and has I suppose noticed my stern tone and me avoiding certain topics like coming to see him and moving out . I told him that it is happening for certain and most likely middle of the month and how it 's a lot cheaper ( so I have another reason for moving out ) . Then he goes , well do n't forget to save up so you can pay me back . Ahhh ... I have no issue paying him back , I just hate how first he tries to keep me around by letting me know I do n't have to pay him and not rent , but then wants the money cause he knows when I move out I can just lose all contact with him and now I 'm forced to contact him to give the money , and he 'll want to know where I am , and I plan on changing my number which is n't going to help . What can I do ? Our relationship was pretty much him being controlling ( from my/our finances , to outings/shopping decisions ) , and possessive ( if I 'm out with friends , he 's at home sulking and wondering what I 'm up to , and why I 'm having fun while he 's depressed ) , to him saying 'I did this and that for you ( which I never asked for and even told him not to ) and you do what for me ? ' -- - **tl ; dr** : If I stay in my ex 's house , I apparently do n't have to pay rent or pay him back , but if I leave , I have to pay him back since my rent is significantly cheaper than what I was paying him . I do n't want to deal with him and his psychological ways of keeping me around .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,travel,"So my friend was looking for flights to Miami , and he did n't want to search for flights from his origin ( Georgia , Europe ) but from any other big city in Europe that would have cheap flights to Miami . We tried everything , but the most we could get was a website that let you search nearby airports and had the option from a distance of 2,000 miles . It was able to show me that flights existed but failed to load them or tell me which airport it was leaving from . I know you can search by origin and leave the destination blank like on Skyscanner or Kayak or even Google , but the other way round seems impossible . How can one do this without having to type each city manually ? We 've already settled on a flight but I would like to know for future use as well because I travel to Europe sometimes and there are plenty of cheap airlines flying to major cities in Europe from where I 'm from , but not to the States and sites like Skyscanner do n't include those 'cheap ' airlines all the time so it 'd be nice to have options from a city so I can look up the cheap flights .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,CRedit,"I have two credit cards , my primary one is 10 months old . I 've paid everything off on time and never had even just the minimum balance paid , it was full . ( According to CreditKarma - it 's 662 ) I 've recently wanted to purchase some things from Amazon ( I have a bunch of gift cards saved up ) , Amazon offered ( through Chase bank ) to give me 6 months , no interest financing if I sign up for their card . I do n't know if I want to add another card and have more things to think about and pay each month , also from what I 've seen , Chase is n't the best bank . On the other hand , if I do n't have to pay for everything right away , I would go for that since it means I can afford all the things I want now without spending my gift cards . If I just pay a little over the minimum balance each month , does that mean my credit wont drop ? If I take one of the items out of my cart , I get 30 $ off instead , which is n't bad , but it involves paying for everything else with cash vs. gift cards . So I do n't know if I want to consider that instead . Any thoughts on the Amazon card ? Another card will help boost my score , but at the same time , is it a good one ? I 've looked at their terms ( such as no yearly fee , and cash-back ) and they did n't seem bad . I never bite more than I can chew , so right now I 'm not worried about any fees , but ...

12084182,Norway,"Hey , I 'm flying from Florida and my cheapest route takes me through Oslo . My current flight has me there at 1pm and leaving at 1pm the next day .

Graduation is only a month and a week away ( for him , not me , different degrees ) , and given the nature of the industry , we might not see each other again for years . For that reason , it is imperative that I do this now and not later . Also , I trust you will keep this private and not share this information with anyone . It 's a pretty big thing , so I do n't want anyone else in on this but you and me . So here it goes : Remember when you posted the `` Squeezing Cute Things '' article that you talked about fetishes ? Well , I have one . Do n't worry , it 's nothing kinky or disgusting or anything of that sort . It started out as a foot fetish that evolved to macrophilia . Look it up if you must , but I ai n't typing it out . Anyways , I satisfy that itch by sneakily taking pictures of girls ' feet . Apparently I 'm good at it because I have n't been caught yet , and since it 's not as intrusive as taking pictures up girls ' skirts , then there 's no real harm done . I do feel it 's somewhat intrusive , which is why I 've decided that it 's best that I go and ask instead . And that 's where YOU come in . You 're the first person I test this new idea on . I want you to come over and let me take pictures of you . It wo n't be anything weird like having you strip or anything - merely you going around my apartment doing normal things . It 's for my benefit only - it wo n't be posted on the Internet or anything of that sort . I know this may seem really weird to you and you have every reason to think that and back out if you wish . But I can assure you that it wo n't be anything outside of your comfort zone and believe me when I say it 's even weirder for me to be letting someone in on this . But like I said , I trust you enough to not go and spread the word . Please let me know if you 're willing to do this huge favor for me , and if you are , then we can arrange for you to swing by . I 'm free tomorrow ( tuesday ) ; it would be best to meet when the sun is still up , so anywhere from 12 noon to 4pm works .

First month , late payment . Second month , late again . Third month , no payment as of yet , ( should have been on the 25th of last month ) .

Then we got a call that because it was a civil matter , they ca n't do anything . But we do n't know where he is , if we did , it would be fine , but we do n't , so it 's not really a civil matter . The whole contract thing screwed us up and therefore the police wont do anything about it . We started going to all known addresses , everyone is clearly covering for him .

During our conversations I mentioned I was moving from Miami and that I did n't have a car . and then he goes 'I work at a dealership , I can hook you up with a car ' which now makes me think he 's sold the car and that 's why he could n't have delivered it because he does n't drive a truck . We 've considered telling the repo man to say we already got the car back and he stole it again , and at that point be able to report him for theft .

I frequently forget to do things he tells me to do or mess them up . Example , I often forget to put the sponge in the sink , a huge pet peeve of his as everything has to be clean and orderly , and I 'm not like that . I forget important things such as going somewhere and forgetting to bring something I needed to bring for that task such as a document . Or even simpler , putting laundry in the machine and forgetting to put detergent and washing a load without it . I 'm not focusing well in classes as well , even if they are really interesting .

My roommate on the other hand takes some seizure meds that supposedly give her ADD according to her doctor . She is so forgetful it 's almost frustrating , I 've learned to make habits of things , like turning off the lights in the bathroom when I 'm done . She however ca n't . Every time I bring up a pet peeve like how the bathroom floor is soaked after she showers , she says that she just wont remember to clean up or dry in the bath so it does n't happen and it 's just how she is . She forgot her house keys on several occasions and was locked out . She left the stove on a few times , once I came home to the house in smoke , and she burnt my pot , which had her coffee in it . She says that there 's nothing she can do , no technique will work because her meds force her brain to act that way , it 's not a natural state therefore there 's nothing she can do to change that . I think she 's just not wanting to even try . I 'd get it if she actually tried , and then said , sorry , it 's just too hard , fine , I 'd understand , I was as bad once , and it took a lot of effort to get to where I am now , but she 's not even trying to be mindful . Do you feel there 's a difference between the two , is her state the same as mine or is it different because there 's a different cause ? She said her doctor does n't recommend meds because she already takes different types of seizure meds and is on progesterone and some other stuff and it would n't go well . I just hope she does n't burn the house down one of these days . Sadly I was almost guilty of that a few times .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,Epilepsy,"So I was reading [ this article ] ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923147/ ) today about out of body experiences and epilepsy and it struck me as odd . A few years back , let 's say 4-5 years ago , I had a period where I 'd dream that I 'm awake and doing my morning routine , I 'd get up , take a shower , do whatever in the bathroom then get back into bed , nap a little more and then go to classes or whatever . One day by chance my friend and I discussed something and he said there 's no way I was showering at 10am as he was late to work and was up at 10am still at home . And I came to a conclusion as he mentioned that lately I had not been up at all until a certain point ( other roommate pointed it out ) that I had dreamt it all . I thought it was odd . It did n't last long though and stopped completely until recently . Now I 've graduated college 2 months ago and moved in with my mom and sister , who 's also come home to help with her as she 's old and needs care . I got her this squeaky dog toy so if she needs me from another room I can hear her ( she 's gotten real quiet and sometimes I want to watch something or she 's watching something ) and suddenly it became a trigger in my sleep . I 'd hear the squeak and know it 's her and realize I 'm dreaming but wake up and help her only to realize that I never woke up , she 'd squeak again and I 'd realize I 'm sleeping and wake up for real . Once I dreamt that she squaked , I got up , and realized she had fallen while wanting to go to the bathroom and I got her back up and went back to bed . The next day I asked her how she felt after the fall , and she goes 'what fall ? ' She never fell in the night . And now sometimes I just dream that I 'm up , helping her out , getting her breakfast and her meds ready only to have her wake me up and tell me she wants her breakfast . So I 'm wondering if it has any relation to my epilepsy or it 's random . Has anyone else had experiences like this ? I did n't even know it could relate to epilepsy until I randomly stumbled upon that article today . I have absence seizures and currently take 1000mgs of Keppra .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Dentistry,"So about a year ago I had some major stuff done to my teeth . I went to a dentist at my moms village that was cheap and he said I had more to be done but since I was only visiting for a week he said he did the major stuff and next year I can get the rest done and he thinks it 'll be fine for a year . Now I 'm back home for the summer but in the city ( my parents have an apartment in the city and my mom has her parents summer house in a village ) . I went to a dentist my sister goes to , she says he 's great , blah blah . He looked at scans of my teeth I did before the visit , said he really liked the work the previous dentist did , and all I needed were my fillings replaced as they were reaching their expiry date and falling apart . Alright , cool . First time just bottom right side . Second time bottom left . ( two teeth each time ) . Second visit he says for the top it 's easy , he can do both sides at once with anesthetic , unlike the bottom which has to be done separately for whatever reason so I 'll only have one more visit and he 'll also give me a nightguard for my bruxism . Great ! Next visit though he only does top right . I find that odd , but maybe he was just making a remark how the top does n't need to be done separately and never intended to do both sides . Gets the imprint for my guard thing and fixes my filling a bit ( from previous visit ) as I felt my bite was a bit weird . When he did my bottom and top right side , I had no problems , even after the visit , after the anesthetic wore off , no pain . Left side though , one tooth , as he was drilling , just kept being sensitive , he said it 's probably under too much stress . So I figured , okay , that must be it . Then after the visit , it kept hurting a few nights in a row , oddly enough right as I want to sleep , so I 'd take an ibuprofen and then finally it went away but the cold issue came in . Cold water makes my left side feel weird . Sometimes it 's the bottom part , my jaw area , sometimes it 's even the top part where he did n't even do anything to my teeth . My sister schedules a visit for general cleaning and so I can ask him stuff . He cleans my teeth , massages my gums or whatever . My sister made an off comment to him how I have breath issues and maybe something 's still up , and he said the spacing between my teeth is really tight , and that 's was what caused breath because I do n't floss enough and remove the food that 's stuck there . But when we got in the car , I said how he forgot to tell me why my gums are sensitive to cold , and she said it was the teeth spacing but then I told her it only started after he worked on my bottom tooth and now I do n't know why I 'm still sensitive to it . Do I have a problem ? Or is it normal to take a bit longer for some teeth to recover from all the drilling ? I do n't get my upper gums feel sensitive too at times even though he never touched my upper teeth at all . tl ; dr : Went for change of fillings , one tooth was more sensitive than the others during filling change . Since then ( a month ago ) my whole left side has become sensitive to cold and it took a while for the pain in my tooth to subside while other teeth that had fillings had no pain afterward .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Do I alternate ? Do I use one and then the other after in the same wash ?

12084182,HaircareScience,"Bleached my hair , so of course it 's in the brittle stage . I have one shampoo , purple for removing unwanted golden tones or whatever . Make it less yellow . But I also have another shampoo/conditioner set for strengthening hair and full of natural oils to help the hair get strong after bleaching . I want to remove the unwanted tones but also want to help my hair get stronger so I can bleach it a second time in two weeks so I can add color . Can I use both ? After bleaching I used the color one and then figured I need to make my hair stronger so used the other shampoo after rinsing the purple one and then used the conditioner that 's paired with it . Would this be weird on the hair ? Should I alternate ? How often should I shampoo now that I 've bleached ? ( my whole head , usually I only do partial ) I usually wash 2-3 times a week , try and let the natural oils kick in , but maybe using these products will help , so more often might work . Edit : If I 'm bleaching again in 1-2 weeks time , will the blue shampoo be of any use ? Will my hair get yellow again or will the second bleach just kill the yellow and there 's no use ? I 'm trying to get blues in my hair and have previously had dark colors like greens , reds , purples that have n't needed the hair to be perfectly white .

She walks with a cane and needs help getting to the bathroom most of the time . She 's very slow , speech is slow and her left hand ca n't do much . She thinks right is left and vice versa . I try and get her to do something with her left hand , like using it with the cane or picking something up with her left hand but it 's as if it 's paralyzed , she just ca n't . She forgets what she 's supposed to do with it and gets this confused look on her face and looks like she wants to cry because it 's too complicated for her . On the other hand , she 's also easily confused and set in her ways . She takes one medication that she 's supposed to slowly phase out and take another one instead . The doctor said 10mg 3x a day , then 10mg x2 a day , and then 5mg 3 times a day . That goes from 30 to 20 , to 15 . The thing is , when I put 3 x 5 today in her medicine holder , she said it was wrong , she needed just two a day . I said how it 's 3 a day but it 's a smaller dosage , resulting in a smaller overall amount of the medicine despite the increase in frequency . She got very frustrated with me , despite showing her the doctors orders , and said that I was reading it wrong but finally gave in and accepted what I said . She was on the verge of crying out of frustration because she could n't understand the situation and what I was saying was too confusing for her to comprehend . On the upside , she 's also on Prozac which makes her laugh at everything , even when I 'm telling her off for repeating things she should n't . It 's very frustrating to deal with this situation , I 'd like to help her with her hand , and my sister who was with her until I got here , said she 's trying to get her to go to physical therapy again .

Girl from said place adds me on Facebook , turns out she added a lot of people , including him . Thought he was cute so added him , had an excuse to . Profile did n't seem like he was in a relationship currently , no info , but it did show that he was with this girl for years from what I gathered , but any recent activity , past month or so made him seem like he was single or broken up .

12084182,Epilepsy,"Just looking for other people 's stories . Started last night . Took one dose , first three days I 'll be taking just one dose to adapt and then 2 doses a day . Woke up with swollen eyes and was too tired to get up , could n't even change my alarm , which is what I usually do if I 'm tired , set it for 5 mins later ( rare though , if I have to be up for something specific , I 'm up ) . ( had ~7 hours of sleep , not unusual but prefer 8 ) Woke up 35 mins later and got up . Went to the bathroom , stumbled a bit by the door . Maybe I 'm just so tired , maybe it 's the meds . Felt like farting later . Everyone farts , but this felt really strong , and it was ! Did n't eat anything out of the usual . Rest of the day would occasionally get knots in my stomach and feel like I might need the bathroom . Thankfully nothing happened there . Maybe it 's the meds , maybe something else . Only thing I could n't find under symptoms , I found stomach upset , but no farting . Maybe that counts . Came home , passed out , slept for a good 4 or so hours . Woke up , found my left eye to be swollen a bit . I guess I 'm a bit drowsy , but not a whole lot , just tiredness I guess . Took my next dose like 2 hours ago . I hope tomorrow 's better . Might be worse , oh well . Really do n't like this tiredness thing , my line of work requires not a lot of sleep and energy . Tomorrow night is my last night of a single dose . From then on I start morning doses too . I 'm on 500mg for starters , then it 'll keep going up until I reach my needed dose . I have staring spells , which is why I 'm taking this . At least I do n't have anger outbursts , that was my biggest worry as I irritate easily . Apparently the side effects subside within 4 weeks , get weaker so I 'm hoping that 's the case . Edit : Second day , right eye is n't swollen or even hurting to touch anymore , but left eye is swollen some more and hurts . Also itchy . Slight sore throat . Had a mild headache/earache this morning . Or , more like pressure on the head . No other symptoms , farted a bit ago , so I know that 's still ongoing , but less than before . Stomach still twists on occasion . Second Edit : So , turns out the whole eye thing was a completely separate thing . I got a [ stye ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye ) in my eye , literally right as I started taking Keppra so I assumed it was a side effect , but turns out a pore on my eyelid got blocked so that happened .

I have a full schedule at school this week , which was supposed to work in my favor , but she got mad and said that if I do n't do it , they will evict us and probably wont let her sign shit . So I 'm just panicking in advance at how awkward it 's going to be and how I wont be able to deal with them . I also have to act like I 'm the one that 's late , as if they know she 's the one that 's late , and I 'm going for her , they might not do it . But I do n't want to be seen as late and whatnot , I 'm never late with payments . How do I deal with the office people and potentially have them be angry at me and get weird about being late with rent . I think I 'll go and get a money order for my half so that I can show them that I 've got my portion there , and just the other half needs to come in , and maybe they 'll be more lenient .

He was planning to go to the mountains one day , see snow , and he asked her if she wanted to come . She said she had plans . Now this dude that was his acquaintance , said he was going for snow and would call him when they go and he 'd come . He never called . But he later saw over Facebook that the dude had gone and he had invited her as well and they were tagged in photos together , that 's why she had plans already , she was doing the same thing he had asked her , but with other dude . Weird breakup cause he brought her snow in a lunchbox and left it at her door as a breakup gift , and wrote a breakup letter , which was more of him writing some abstract ideas about how he feels about her , him , their relationship , future and stuff . I do n't think she really understood as her English is n't that great , since her response was 'thanks , it was very nice of you ' and acted like nothing had happened .

12084182,fullsail,"I ca n't say a whole lot about film , though I did have friends in film and they had a lot of writing I recall , and lots of software to work with . I am a show pro grad actually . I 'm not sure what to recommend really because a part of me wonders if film would have been a good fit the way my friend described it to me . Show pro is great , except for the first year that 's really focused on studio/audio stuff . Things are constantly changing at Full Sail so I do n't know what that 's like now , but you definitely get a lot of hands on experience . I got to intern at the House of Blues and for some other production companies and set up stages for bands . As for film , although I was n't in it , they always need people to help out with sets so you 'll see postings on the campus portal for hands needed and you can sign up and help with props and set making . Second year of show pro is amazing , you get to do all the lighting stuff , live sound , and video , and bands come in all the time and you help set up actual concerts weekly . You can even volunteer before then , but generally to get a specific position you need to have passed a class for that , so until second year you 're basically a stagehand . But that 's cool too , you can learn from others and someone can show you how to operate a camera , or you can get jib training and if you 're jib certified then you can operate a jib during shows too , so that 's neat !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

And then they saw what he did because of that , so they checked it . A student at my school got busted for making a fake Facebook profile of our chemistry teacher , and the profile added everyone and they tracked the person down , and monitored Facebook , but they also monitored a lot of other stuff , and could at any moment while you 're in the IT lab check what you 're browsing .

I saw his profile on linkedin and just that alone did n't make me think of doing anything ( his professional life is not something I care for , just something people do for money vs. passion ) , but I saw he was still in my city - 99 % of people that I have known from high school are no longer in this country . I Googled him and found a profile on Couch Surfing which turned out to blow my expectations because his professional profile seemed boring to me , but everyone 's different at work , which is why I looked him up further . Anyway , turns out we have everything in common and he 's like me in a lot of ways so I wanted to find a way to meet him but I 'm not sure how . Hence my question . I do n't usually just message people out of the blue so I wanted to know how to do it so it does n't come off as weird . Most of my friends here are in another city where I first studied , and all my high school friends went on elsewhere , and I did too after my initial degree here . So I do n't really have any in my city . Well , I do , a friend of a friend , but he 's 19 and I 'm 26 , and even though we hang out just fine , and his friends are cool too , it 's a bit weird with the age gap , I 'd like to meet people my own age as well .

12084182,MechanicAdvice,"Also , there were other numbers that had bigger rim sizes , but had the width of my back tires , and aspect ratio . Would that make it compatible ?

As an example , another compatible tire listed on the box is `` 175/60-14 '' my back tire has a width of 175 . And the aspect ratio is 70 and this thing is compatible with an aspect ratio of `` 165/70-13 '' as well , does that mean that it would work since it does work with 175 in one scenario and 70 in another ?

12084182,MechanicAdvice,"My tires were in really bad shape , like one went flat and then I noticed that the others had wires sticking out . Yeah ... So I just bought the cheapest used tires I could . One tire place said they only had 2 tires , and I went for them since I really needed the spare tire changed . Then I found another place that had 2 more tires but different sizes and they said they were compatible with my car . 2 weeks later I got my dad to go with me to take my car for a check up ( thought a problem I had was the suspension as the car feels every bump and pothole on the road , but no , they said it 's fine , nothing I should worry about ) and he asked them if we should change my tires ( different place to any other that I 've been to when I got my tires ) and they said although the tires are n't of a good brand , they 're in ok shape for now so they would n't change them . It 's a Nissan Pulsar ( 1996 ? 98 ? ) I 'll see if I can find some paperwork for it .

12084182,AskReddit,"Upbringing is a weird term . I had a weird upbringing , but a lot of these things didn ’ t come from my parents , it came from realising what it takes to be a decent human being and gain respect from others and be treated fairly . It comes with having common sense . Sometimes parents are retarded and raise their children to be that way too , but oftentimes like in my own example , I tried to do my best to not be like my parents and have better habits . Not saying these are theirs , just giving a general statement , but these are some things that tick me off and give me a general impression about yourself and your choices growing up : If they constantly try to sound smarter than they are . If they litter and try to say that there ’ s a janitor or city worker that cleans up that mess , it ’ s their job . Basic manners . People who fuck up , and apologize by saying “ I ’ m sorry , but… ” There ’ s no but . If you are sorry , you say so , then shut up and deal with the consequences . How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them . Maybe that McDonalds worker has a degree but can ’ t find a job in it . Maybe life forced them to change course . Also , who would serve you that McDonalds if they didn ’ t ? If you have read nothing but the Bible . Big red-flag for me . Open your eyes a little . At least try and understand other people ’ s points of view . I might not have cared for the bible , and am not religious , but I don ’ t judge you for your choice , so don ’ t judge me for mine . Try and understand my point of view and know how to have a civilised conversation without getting angry because I disagree about your God . Tattoos of a person you 're in a relationship with or were in a relationship with . That 's permanent , think about it . I do not regret tattoos , and you should n't either . I had a best friend in high school . This girl was madly into him , she messed up and he could n't get over it . She decided to show her undying love for him by getting huge wings on her back ( like , whole upper back ) with some saying and his name to show that she wishes she had wings to fly to him and fly off with him . Needless to say he was n't impressed and she lost him as a friend , lover , everything . Why the fuck would you get that as a tattoo ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"What life path to take . Found out my health is affecting my career choice ( my degree is now practically useless ) . It ’ s not a big health issue , I can work just about anywhere else but with my degree , it ’ s impossible to find a suitable job . So now it seems I have to look for work in fields I have no knowledge about or get a regular job until I figure out what I ’ m going to do with my life . I just hope I don ’ t get sucked in to being stuck with no progress because I end up living paycheck to paycheck . I can freelance , but that 's very unpredictable . I have three other attempted degrees , so maybe I can try and finish one of those ( saves time , instead of spending another 4 in a university , since I 'm 26 and already kind of old to not have held a job in a field of study ) but that 's also time wasting . I ’ m currently back under my parents roof and daily think about how homelessness would be better than this ( we do n't get along ) and that I should just move out and figure things out . But I have nowhere to go , can ’ t drive for a while until my medical tests come back as safe to drive . So can ’ t take a car either . I think about ending it all but then I remember the things I have to look forward to . My best friend of 10 years now , is finally seeing his life looking up and it ’ s because of me among other people/things . It ’ s something that gives me hope every day , knowing I ’ m the reason he ’ s still alive and here for me . I also think about this kid I took in , who was homeless , and had nowhere to go . I saw something in him , I wanted to help him somehow . Knowing what it felt like to have nowhere to go and feel worthless was something I didn ’ t want anyone to have to experience . I gave him a place to stay for a bit , and told him to apply for jobs daily and make something of himself . Find a way to finish high school and do something more . I wonder how he is , if he ’ s okay . We lost touch but he could n't have been more grateful that I came along and gave him something , hope , a home , something to look forward to . I ’ m jealous in a way that even though he was homeless and on the street , he managed to get away from his parents and get away from the abuse and didn ’ t give in to the manipulation . I also think about how I can find someone that 'll stay with me as both a best friend and partner . I ’ ve had some odd life choices and it makes it hard to open up to people because I fear they ’ ll reject my past . I also have issues with emotional abuse , I ’ ve been dealing with it my whole life with my mom and it ’ s affected all my relationships too , I always end up with those types , and I just end up giving in to their tactics and am too nice to do anything about it . I ’ ve learned my lesson though and am not letting it get to me , but for a while I was stuck in this pattern where people would manipulate me to stay in the relationship . I don ’ t care if we lack a social life because we ’ re both struggling to make something of ourselves , I just want us to have each other and be happy . My last ex tried to kill himself because of our break-up ( manipulation tactic , not really wanting to die… ) and I still can ’ t get over that . It was so hard because I still cared about him as a person . I was supposed to fly out to visit my sister , which he knew would result in me just leaving ( he was going away for a while , and figured I ’ d move out while he ’ s gone ) . So me missing my flight to be in the hospital with him was a sign of hope that I still cared and wanted to be with him . He changed himself for the relationship , he turned into someone he wasn ’ t just to get me to like him more but that made me like him even less . And I have this constant paranoia of ending up in a relationship where the person keeps doing that . Just be yourself . I ’ m tired of people suddenly being like me because they fear I ’ ll leave them because there ’ s nothing there . Do n't suddenly read books because you think I 'll like you more for reading them . I know you hate reading them so do n't torture yourself so I can stay . It 's weird . You might try and turn into all the things I want from a partner , but it ’ ll never be real . I ’ ll always want someone who ’ s just themselves around me and I ’ m myself and we never have to hide or be fake to feel like the other person will stay . I ’ m not changing for you , and I don ’ t expect you to change for me . If you change , change for the better , make better habits , be a better person for YOU . Not for me . So I think about that . Also friendships . I ’ m so busy all the time and the friends I ’ ve had have mostly left or are busy themselves , have gone their own ways and are doing other things with their closer friends . The few friends I do have that want to hang all the time aren ’ t as intellectually stimulating as I ’ d like or are n't doing anything worthwhile . They just sit around high all day and do nothing worthwhile for the most part . I have friends I can have a good conversation with , but now that they 're working and busy , they 're always tired and weekends involve sitting in a coffee shop chatting instead of activities like camping/picnics or going out like we used to . I want to make new friends but because I get busy at times and am not sure when I ’ m free it makes it harder because I don ’ t want people to get the wrong idea that I ’ m not interested . Also I don ’ t know if I ’ m staying here for now or leaving ( I want to leave as soon as possible but I know I need a job first to save up money and get medical stuff in order , I live in a small island in the middle of nowhere and it makes it hard to do anything here , small population and all ) but if I make friends , and then have to move , it ’ ll just be so much harder . I guess I hope I find people that are as busy as me or understanding of my situation so when we do hang out , it ’ s worthwhile and we understand if one of us can ’ t . So yeah , those are some of the things I think about .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"Depression is always a bitch , but you have to try and not let it get to you . We can let it swallow us up , or get up and fight it . It 's not easy , I struggle with that same fight every day , but do n't let it get to you and give in . You broke it off so clearly you had some reasons as to why you did n't see it working out , but do n't focus on the negative , focus on the positives that you 've learned from it . Maybe it took time to realize how it was affecting you and how negative the situation really was , but whatever the reasons , do n't let them get to you . Focus on the good things you 've got going on . Instead of wallowing of what could have been , think about what can be . Right now you probably have no intention of a new relationship , but it 's good to think about what you 've learned from it . If you broke up for reasons other than infidelity , there 's something to take from it , a reason why you could n't see marriage in the future anymore . Take that and focus on what you want out of the next relationship , so you when it comes along , you realize it 's what you 've been waiting for and it does n't pass you by . Do n't let the depression swallow you so you miss out on something , but also focus on other things that are important to you right now and get them done so you can stop thinking about how badly the relationship affected you . My last relationship ended with me realizing how it just was n't meant to be in the long term , and I now know what to expect of my next one . It 's painful , but you need to find a way to let go of the pain . Avoiding pain would n't be a problem if we did it once or twice a year . But for most of us , it 's a habit we 've embedded deeply into ourselves . We barricade ourselves behind an invisible wall and do n't venture out because beyond the wall is pain . I do this all the time . But you and I both need to get the strength to move on and find the motivation to get those things done that we think about . Instead of 'I should ... ' you need to say 'I will ... ' it reinforces the thought in your head that you will get it done . You might be avoiding anything that can make you feel exposed ... Avoiding facing responsibility , you hide in your comfort zone . Most people have a faulty way of motivating themselves . They ’ re motivated to get whatever they want , because they feel they don ’ t have enough already . This feeling of lacking is powerful as a motivator , but you pay a huge price for it . That price is the ongoing feeling that there ’ s always something missing . Even if you get something you ’ ve wanted , you quickly become dissatisfied with it , which then motivates you to get something else . You can never be happy on this treadmill . Eventually , it sucks the meaning and energy out of your life . So try instead of thinking that you lack something , think of what you 've got , use that to motivate you that you 've gotten so much out of life already , and there 's so much more yet to come . Pick something you hate doing . In your case it might be any of the things you mentioned , painting your walls , washing the dog . Or maybe a phone call/email you 've been delaying or running an errand you 've been asked of . Imagine that pattern is a place you hide in . That 's your comfort zone . What does it feel like ? You probably felt you were in a safe and familiar place . Free of the pain the world brings with it . This almost completely re-creates your comfort zone , but it leaves out the final ingredient . Strange as it might seem , merely escaping pain is n't enough for us . We insist the pain be replaced with pleasure . We do this with an endless array of addictive activities : internet surfing , alcohol , drugs , the aptly named `` comfort food '' . You order out , which is more likely less healthy than cooking , you might smoke , I did and it was n't all that good for me , but for those few moments , you get relaxed and feel stress free . All these behaviors are widespread - we 're an entire culture looking for it 's comfort zone . You weave those activities into your daily routine . Some get high every evening with their friends eating pizza and might feel like they 're in an alternate universe . I will never get that , but for them it works , they take one hit and the rest of the world disappears . This alternate world , which for you is different , as is for most people , feels like a soothing , pleasurable , warm bath , as if , for a moment , you 've found your way back to the womb . These `` warm-bath '' activities just cripple us further . The more you hide in the warm bath , the less willing you become to deal with the cold shower of reality . Ask yourself what your warm bath activities are . The more frequently you indulge in them , the more likely it is that you 're using them to create a comfort zone . Here 's another exercise I 'd like for you to try : Feel yourself indulging in one or more of these behaviors . Imagine the pleasure you feel lifts you into a womb-like world . How does this world affect your sense of purpose ? Think about these things . Try and change your thought process regarding them and make yourself more productive . It takes 21 days to make a habit apparently , so take one task at a time , something you are avoiding , and get into the habit of facing it daily and forcing yourself to do it . The same way you might wake up for work or class or whatever it is that you 're doing with life , you have to face other tasks . There are days we might not want to wake up at all , and just sing 'I 'm never waking up ... ' but the reality is , we have to , reality awaits and we have to face it otherwise our problems pile up and the stack of things we have to do gets bigger and bigger and we struggle harder and harder because it seems ever more daunting . The more we put things off , the harder they become to face . Think about someone you might admire . In my example it would be Elon Musk . He 's like a modern day Tesla . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla - electric car company - was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . So no ordering out , being lazy on the couch ... ( Which makes me feel like a hypocrite as I 'm writing this , as I 'm being lazy , eating delivery from this place called Burger Lab and not doing anything productive ... aha . ) But moving on , because Elon avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . He 's like an [ Ubermensch ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ % C3 % 9Cbermensch ) in a way . Always in the news with some new crazy project , and yet finding the time to have a family . The avoider , which would be you and me in this example , only care for immediate gratification ; we take no responsibility for the future . But we need to try our hardest to find a way to . The future being the things we need to get done that we 're lazy to do . That 's why you might have regrets about your past , I know I do . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . The moment you do this , you activate a force more powerful than the force to avoid pain . ( and I 'm not talking some high above force , just something within all of us , but see it as you find fitting ) Now as an avoider , like most people , we choose avoidance instead . As a result , you don ’ t live up to your potential , never becoming fully yourself . ( Just my statements , you might feel differently about this , not meant as negative criticism , just being constructive ) Like for example , my mom was always making negative remarks to me , and I tried hard to get past them and prove her wrong , but I started to feel I did n't want to be vulnerable anymore . That turned me into a limited version of who I wanted to be . I set up walls and did n't let anyone past them , and it took a long time to get over that , and I 'm still not , but I 'm trying , and I think everyone in a similar situation should do too . Just try and tap into yourself , find a center in you , and think of what you are avoiding doing , but then start to focus on how that feels , not the action itself , but how it makes you feel , and make yourself desire that pain or whatever it might be . Try and make yourself desire the feeling that what you 're avoiding is creating . You ’ ve now taken your normal desire to avoid pain and reversed it into a desire to face it . Doing this regularly will reveal the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . That ’ s why desire is a crucial part of this . It keeps you moving toward pain . You ’ re not desiring pain because you ’ re masochistic ; you ’ re desiring pain so you can shrink it . When you become confident you can do this every time , you ’ ve mastered your fear of pain . I do n't always remember to do this , but when I do , it helps me get over a task quickly and I feel satisfied knowing I 've managed to do something I 've been slacking off about . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the endless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and fuelled your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . You had one goal and nothing was stopping you from reaching it . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things .

12084182,relationships,"Sound advice . You might be thinking 'well I 'll just avoid the drugs part ' but girls like that or people in general have a way of making you want things or do things you would n't otherwise or think in a way like 'oh just this once ' and stuff , and then you go down a path you can never come back from . So keep that in mind , she might be a manipulator .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"lmao . I would ask your sister why she thinks this girl is bad news , and maybe even though your sister is friends with her , she keeps her at a distance and knows what she 's like with boys . Now if you know you can have some fun and not take it seriously and not expect anything out of it , or attempt something more serious , then go for it , but not before finding out why your sister said that . She seems to have your best interest at heart and maybe she has good reason for wanting you to stay away from this girl that clearly only wants fun and likes you for being a sporty guy . I do n't ( from your short description of her ) picture her as the type to go serious with someone .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,cyprus,"'Sports handicapping ' which is a fancy term for sports betting . Like if you 've seen the website bet365 ( it pops up everywhere for me so I 'm going to assume it 's known ) but we use another bookey and we convince clients to use our services and we place bets on their behalf . They bet , earn 75-82 % on average for each game ( apparently we have some top traders that do amazing guesswork and have access to trainers/coaches that give inside information to get those high percentages , no idea how that works ) , our company takes 20 % profits , and I get 5 % of that . So if you 're good with convincing clients , then you have clients that are constantly betting and every time they withdraw money and it hits their bank , you get 5 % of that . Basically instead of placing bets yourself , you let me place bets on your behalf in exchange for commission but I promise high winnings .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,cyprus,"I was shocked when I read the contract , though it stated that after the three month period it 's 5 % , another guy working there ( who has yet to reach 3 months but has been there 2 months before me ) told me about a guy who left a bit before my group started training and worked with him . The guy was around for 6 months and his average salary was 5,000 Euros a month , with his last salary being 6,000 , so it was on the rise . I was shocked . How can anyone do so well ?

I would definitely in your spare time while working build on your portfolio , but build it from your future perspective . Do a lot of research , look up facts , statistics , information , anything to further your knowledge on a specific topic then create short animations that broaden people 's perspective/information on that topic . Perhaps create a YouTube channel and then forward that to any companies/NGO 's that you 'd like to work for and explain that you 're so dedicated you 're willing to sell your car and relocate because you 're so into the cause .

12084182,relationships,"It really is n't uncommon for people to dissociate from a terrible situation they do n't know how to deal with , especially at a young age . What happened was unfortunate , but the root cause of your mother 's suffering was n't you . It was multiple sclerosis . Admittedly mistakes were made , but every human makes mistakes , especially when we do n't know any better . You ca n't blame yourself for your mother 's condition , the pain she went through or not knowing how to deal with it . I know your mother would n't want you to do that . She 'd want you to forgive yourself , and live your life without being paralyzed with regret and suffering from low self-esteem . It is possible to raise your self esteem by investing in yourself , doing things which you feel improve yourself , and giving yourself credit for your accomplishments and positive traits . Learning new skills , trying new things , anything that you feel betters yourself as a person really . Exercise is a good one , and studies have shown it is as effective as an anti-depressant . You already have a job and are sustaining yourself . That 's more than a lot of people your age . Even if you ca n't afford therapy , you might consider going to a bookstore and looking for a self-help book .

12084182,relationships,"There 's actually quite a few ways you can get chlamydia . My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past . The birds carry it , get sick and then sicken their owners . There is Chlamydia pneumoniae , and it causes a different form of pneumonia . You find this infection more often in older people . It 's not common ( and neither is psittacosis ) . There are also chlamydia eye infections , too . Chlamydia in the eye is rare in countries that have better sanitation and hygiene . But it blinds many women in Africa every year . Not that I intend to exonerate the girl myself , but I would like to note that vaginal chlamydia is often silent in women , and it can go undetected for a long time . If she has not had a STD screen in a while , the infection could have gone undetected , and she may have given it to him .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"This does not work for everyone . In my situation , the moment by boyfriend knows what I 'm doing , he is in control of the situation . He does stuff without saying anything , and that involves anything that would be beneficial for me . Example , I ca n't decide between two dishes in a restaurant . The moment I order one , he orders the other . He does it without saying he will otherwise I would do something to stop him as I do n't want him ordering for me . If I do n't say I 'm deciding between two things , then I get to let him chose what he wants . I suck at doing it without saying I 'm doing it , so almost 90 % of the time in our relationship , everything is done how I would like it , and the moment I realize he 's not up for something or whatever , and make it clear that we can do something else . Too late , I should have done that something else without saying anything . Now he thinks I wanted the first thing and wont let me do the second . Everything evolves around me .

12084182,AskReddit,"Ants . Ants are so fascinating . One day after watching a video on YouTube I spent the whole day reading about ants . People do n't realize how amazing they are . And it rarely comes up in conversation . Some ants harvest . They harvest [ fungi ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-fungus_mutualism ) , in exchange for harvesting it ( and letting it grow ) they get to eat it for protein . Some tend to or herd aphids or leafhoppers . The total biomass of all the ants on Earth is roughly equal to the total biomass of all the people on Earth . There 's a type of [ killer fungi ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis ) that infects ants and eats their brain , and takes over their nervous system . They essentially turn into zombies and walk around until the fungus has found a convenient spot . If other ants spot them , they take them away so they do n't infect anyone . There 's a colony of female only ants , that are all clones of the queen , and reproduce by cloning themselves . Ina regular ant colony , only the queen is allowed to reproduce , if other ants have sex , they give off a scent that they did so and other ants have orders to beat them to death , so the ants find ways to mask that smell . They may even enslave ants from other colonies and make them work for them !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,getdisciplined,"Tell your mind otherwise , try and see your mind as a completely separate thing . As , not you but the voice in your head that tells you to feel and act a certain way . Tell it to fuck off and that you 're in charge now ! You have an absence of awareness of what 's going on around you , except for the thoughts that are continuously passing through your mind . It is the state of being so identified with the voices in your head , that you think you are the voices in your head . It is when we identify with this inner chatter - when we come to think of it as us - that thinking becomes compulsive . We do it all the time , ceaselessly , and the idea that we might ever enjoy a respite from thinking never occurs to us . We come to see our thinking , and our continuing to exist as people , as one and the same thing . Not being able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction . But we do n't realize this , because almost everybody is suffering from it . So it 's considered normal . The sense of self that we construct from identifying with our thoughts is what we call the 'ego ' . And by definition living in the service of the ego can never make us happy . Why can the ego never bring happiness ? Eckhart Tolle argues that the Stoics , who concluded that our judgements about the world are the source of our distress . But he takes things further , suggesting that these judgments , along with all our other thoughts , are what we take ourselves to be . We 're not only distressed by our thoughts ; we imagine that we are those thoughts . The ego that results from this identification has a life of it 's own . It sustains itself through dissatisfaction - through the friction it creates against the present moment , by opposiing itself to what 's happening , and by constantly projecting into the future , so that happiness is always some other time , never now . The ego , Tolle likes to say , thrives on drama , because compulsive thinking can sink it 's teeth into drama . The ego also thrives on focusing on the future , since it 's much easier to think compulsively about the future then about the present . ( It 's really quite tricky , when you try it , to think compulsively about now . ) If all this is correct , we have inadvertently sentenced ourselves to unhappiness . Compulsive thinking is what we take to be the core of our being - and yet conpulsive thinking relies on our feeling dissatisfied . The way out of this trap is not to stop thinking - thinking , is exceedingly useful - but to disidentify from thoughts : to stop taking your thoughts to be you , to realize , that 'you are not your mind ' . we should start using the mind as a tool , instead of letting the mind use us , which is the normal state of affairs . When Descartes said 'I think , therefore I am , ' he had not discovered 'the most fundamental truth ' , Tolle insists ; instead , he had given expression to 'the most basic error ' .

12084182,fullsail,"What was your degree program ? How much effort did you put besides what was required ? Did you attend any on campus events ? Did you network with anyone while there ? Did you take any internship opportunities offered ? Just curious as I 've read a lot of negativity from past Full Sail students prior to joining but figured from other reviews that they just could n't stand the workload and left complaining the education was inadequate when really they could n't stand the workload , and I 'm just wondering how much they tried . I get it 's really hard to get a job these days , but any school does n't promise to hand you everything on a plate . I hope I do n't feel the same when I graduate , I thankfully am not taking a loan for anything , but I 'm doing my best to network as much as I can and take any opportunities for internships that Full Sail gives me , so I hope I do n't end up without a decent job when I graduate .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,fullsail,"As an on campus student , I 'd like to say that every online class I 've had , sucked . I did n't like the teaching style , though it might work for some . I prefer being in an environment with other students , where the teacher is actually there , talking and interacting with you . I love my degree , I think it 's intense , I think the instructors for the most part have lots of experience and are super knowledgeable , but from what I 've seen , it 's not the same for all degrees . My boyfriend is in Game Art , for the most part he likes it , but says that for one class he had a teacher that he felt knew nothing , and recently was in a class that had so much workload that he was n't able to complete it without a break . With that being said , his class last month , he thought it was boring , did n't put much effort , got 85 % and was apparently the highest student in the class in terms of grades . His classmates feel like a joke , when I see his work and think , that was you being lazy and it was the best ? What ? So I guess it depends on where you 're at . If you prefer to work on your own and just get tasks to do , then maybe online will be suited for you , you mention writing since you were a kid , so it should n't be hard for you at all .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,fullsail,"A bit late , but thought I 'd chime in as well . Definitely want to say that you should be on campus , not just because the online classes suck ( they really do , it 's so boring ) but because you get to network with people , experience a new environment and can experience so much more that the campus has to offer , such as talks from industry people ( sure , you can see them online , but it 's better being there in person and asking the right questions , and meeting people , networking ) If it were me , I 'd go for the Game Design , but both sound good . I 'm in Show Production , loads of fun , my boyfriend is in Game Art , and he enjoys it too , though from what I 've seen it 's super easy , last month he had what he said was one of the most boring classes as they switched round how they were going to approach that class , he decided to not do his best , got an 85 % and was the highest in his class in terms of grades ( I could n't believe it , my group is way more competitive , I guess people there do n't care as much )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I 've been on the site for ages ( no investment ) but I got enough to get golden and had about 300 referrals almost , but then had no internet for a while and really things were hectic , no free time so I started losing referrals and I feel the only way to save my account now is investing or just really clicking religiously . Neither which I have time for . My account has about 50 referrals . According to my friend ( who got me into the site , as I saw his statistics ) he earns about 100 $ a month , no investment on his end , but a LOT of time . OP is right , it will take a long time for anything to happen . But I think it 's worth it in the long run . Recycle when your referrals have n't clicked in a week and/or if they have average clicks below 2 or even 3 . But start of with 1-2 as it 's really hard to find users that click daily .

When we got there I saw this old dog just lying in the corner of his cell , all alone , no one wanted him , he was heartbroken and I was gon na be his savior ! I 'll never forget that day , they told me he was 12 years old , he was their oldest dog they had . Something about him , about his loneliness , and maybe mine too , made me realize we were the perfect match ! All the other dogs could jump around , wag their tails all they wanted , pull off those cute puppy faces , but I wanted him . We bought him everything new , collar , bowl , a chew toy , and took him home . I took him for a long walk and he fell asleep on the bed next to me . I never expected that I would wake up to him not with me anymore . For years I kept blaming myself , that I did something wrong , even though they told me it was not my fault . It was n't until I was much older that I realized that , that was probably the best day in his life , and he waited his whole life , using whatever energy he had left , hoping that someone would love him , if at least for one day , and I gave him that and he went to rest in peace .

I 've been in situations where I asked for advice and no matter how many people told me the same thing , I found counter arguments hoping they 'd change their minds and give me advice that in my head would be the ideal situation even though I knew it was n't . I would say try and contact her first cause it might creep her out that you went out of your way to find her contact info and so on ... Or if you 're planning to go there , make sure to let her know , do n't have to tell her about the ticket cause she 'll definitely get the wrong idea about you flying over just to talk about a break up that happened 1 year ago . I 'd say find a way to call her or text her . Well personally I think writings better as she has to read it all before responding and wont but in and shut you off . If you call she might put the phone down . Writing a letter is great as she has the option to chose if she 'll read it or not . If she does , make it clear that you 're over her , so she knows that you 're not wanting to meet up to get back together cause that 'll stir up old memories and make her think how you 're just gon na hurt her again . Once you 've made that clear , just tell her you 'd like to meet up , you 'll be in her area and it would really mean a lot to her or mention that you have a ticket and the relationship meant a lot to you and you thought you were doing what was for the best at the time and her parents disapproved of you and that you felt you needed some closure .

With two cases I clearly visualized the 'accident ' and in another case I just felt this horrible overwhelming emotion of negativity consume me and I knew something horribly wrong will happen and then my car broke down , I guess cause I was n't able to picture what exactly would go wrong , but I knew something would . And in the recent case , I just felt the electricity would go . I did n't visualize anything or get a strong feeling coming over me , I knew what would happen but did n't really visualize , just said to my friend , 'I bet the electricity will be out tomorrow ' . And my electricity was out . Surprisingly enough and I reminded him of it and my other incidents that I mentioned before . I went through my chat logs , and this is exactly what I said to him : Me : Wtf the light flickered and it flickered earlier but this time I felt like the a/c stopped for a second too . /later in the convo/ Me : I have no idea what just happened , it just would n't connect and then my network disappeared for a bit and then it came back , but it could n't find it : S Somethings really wrong tonight , I bet there will be no electric tomorrow ! And the next day we found out a big electricity station had been blasted off just hours after our conversation took place . Me : It 's weird how last night I mentioned light flickered , and then again with a/c and I just knew something was wrong ... I told you electric would go off . But I did n't realize it would be something big like this , but I was waiting for electricity to go off , I felt it would Him : yeah , electricity acted weird here too but at night not after 6 ( when the thing happened ) Me : Yeah , I know but I said it was odd , cause your internet went and then mine went around 3-4 AM Him : yeh around that time Me : But that 's why it 's all fishy to me , like something was going on lol idk , maybe just me wanting something big to happen and not just an 'accident' Him : overanalyzing lol",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,Paranormal,"Nothing as drastic as the other three posts , but I used to hear the sound of chairs screeching above me when I went to bed to sleep , like someone on the roof was dragging chairs , and no one could hear it but me . Another thing , years ago mom had some guests over and a woman told her we have a ghost in the house and he 's reading a newspaper . I did n't think too much of it . Weird person . Then a friend of mine about 2-3 years ago told me I had a ghost in my room and he likes to read newspapers but he 's annoyed that it 's on the same page for a while now ( I do n't really read ) So that kinda freaked me out , and sometimes my dog loves to bark into the middle of nowhere at absolutely nothing . It drives me crazy cause I feel there 's a ghost somewhere , and strange thing is I guess I feel a little afraid ? I mean I 'm not scared of them like watching horror movies , those are fun for me . But I guess the realization that there 's something unknown out there and it 's in my room watching me makes me feel a little uncomfortable ... Also I a made a post about this , I had some premonitions in the past year and I just felt something would happen or kinda saw it happen and it did and it 's really weirding me out . hahaha",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"No down votes from me . I was 11 when I got molested by a guy at the beach . Long story short , years later trying to do it for the first time with my boyfriend , I ended up beating the crap out of him when we tried to do it as I had horrible visions of what happened when I was younger flash before me . I just kept hitting him and crying and ended up having to explain why , it was so hard for me as I had never told anyone before about what happened . That fueled some anger in him I guess , and he would n't stop pressuring for the details , and finally I caved in and told him . Pretty much every time we tried to get close , he 'd end up getting so anger filled that some guy did that to me that it ended up tearing our relationship apart .

12084182,AskReddit,"A slightly different situation on my end , but still dealing with it in the same way . When I was younger , just beginning school , so 1st-3rd grade , I got bullied so much and the whole class hated me , and it was so traumatic for me . Now , years later , when I talk about it , I joke about it , but I start crying . Well the other night I was talking with a friend and the subject somehow came up , and I was laughing how all the kids would throw lunch food at me and call me names and stuff but I was crying at the same time , trying to laugh it off but it still bothered me in a bad way . Do n't know why I try to laugh about it , she was nowhere near laughing , more in shock . 'Why are you laughing about it ? '",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"That 's not bad at all . For a research paper at school I chose to study the sex trade industry . Girls as young as 11 get traded , or even younger on some occasions . Stories from survivor girls include the most gruesome shit you 'll ever read . To sum up the day of a girl working as a prostitute : Almost no sleep , drugs keep you awake , barely any food , if you do n't sleep with at least 30 men ( in some cases more ) a day , you get beaten badly , having a bad day ? Your pimp does n't care . On your period ? Lower the light so the customer does n't notice . Hungry ? Well tough luck . Absolutely horrible . One girl got forced into a marriage by a man that claimed money for her , he sold her for a couple thousand , remarried other girls in the same way . She ended up being used as a sex slave in a guys house , tied her to a wall in chains and his friends could fuck her whenever they pleased . Another girl got sold into the sex trade by a false job ad , she found her way home finally , pregnant , her dad failed to believe her and the rest of her family , they called her a slut , so she went to a family friend who offered her a job and told her it was safe , when really she just got sold into the sex trade again . If you want references let me know and I 'll find my paper and cite the sources/books I read . That 's just some of the stuff I 've read . Another unrelated story was a girl that got molested by her grandpa since she was 4 , that led her to do heavy drugs so she would n't sleep cause sleep induced dreams of him molesting her . As a rape victim myself , I do n't even want to know what that feels like for them , it 's bad enough that I occasionally have flashbacks and nightmares about it . I really hope to be able to do something about it some day , go out there and help these women in need .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,funny,"My mom was mean , I think at 15 I had a 9pm curfew . And all my friends stayed up later . I remember lying that I was going to a sleepover at a friends house and then I 'd just bike home or walk home from town really late . I never told her stuff , mostly cause I knew how she 'd react , she was overly protective and strict , and I still do n't tell her stuff . Had she been different , like your parents , I think I 'd be able to be open as I know she 'd be ok with that stuff . I 'm definitely doing a similar approach as yours with my kids .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,IAmA,"Ok , here 's my opinion as a girl : First thing , everyone 's different , but I do think you should try out different things and find what works for you . For me personally , masturbating by hand and fingering myself has never done much for me , tbh it 's probably me not wanting to invest a lot of time learning what my body likes as I know that I can easily be thrown out of the mood and then I 'll be annoyed and so I do n't bother with that . It rarely got me anywhere . What I do when I 'm in my bedroom , put some porn on and masturbate by rubbing my underwear . I also usually have daily pads in there ( but that 's usually out of habit , I always wear them and I find when I 'm doing it , it also adds pressure , without one , it 's not the same . ) So I just rub and get off . But seriously , that 's nothing compared to what happens in the shower . Just rubbing will give me a mild orgasm , and after a few times it gets weaker and then I do n't do it for a while so when I do it , it gets strong again . Maybe do n't do it for a while and then see what happens . But in the shower , it 's amazing . Take your shower head and bonus if you can change the strength and make it extra strong pressure or if you have a jet thing like in a jacuzzi . Mess around with that and see what happens , those are the best orgasms you can ever get . Just place it on your pussy and move it around and find what feels good and keep it there . Also note that if you feel like peeing , that 's normal , you do n't need to pee you 're just on the way to orgasm . And here 's something , I do n't know if it works for other girls , but I know it definitely works for me . Cold water . When I was a kid I was always the one daring to jump into the sea or the pool when it was cold , everyone else would slowly get in , putting little water on them to adapt/adjust . I would jump in and swim fast to get warm . Thought I also found out that moving my legs in cold water gave a good feeling , which I later found out was an orgasm ( kinda disturbing when I think about it now ) Anw , I used to fill up the bathtub with really freezing water and get in to feel that way . Though when I found out there were better ways to do it and learned what an orgasm is , then things changed . But if that is true to all girls , maybe try that : Fill a bathtub up to the top with cold water , freezing water will only do the trick and then get in quickly and just move your legs apart and close fast . And I 've never been able to get an orgasm through sex . I 've been with two guys , one was a virgin , and the other claimed he was good at it and whatnot , did n't do anything for me .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,funny,"I think that 's great . I really think it 's stupid how in the US you drive before you can drink . So of course a 16 year old that can drive to a party will drink and not know of the consequences . You learn to drink and what effects it has on you so then when you are able to drive , you know what your limits are . I hate when I see stupid kids here drinking and then driving cars ( I do n't know how they get access to a car as driving age is 18 here ) But I 've seen it happen at parties I 've attended . My parents were always against drinking and those things . Though I was never a crazy party type , but my best friend liked beer , so I got into drinking some of that when we were out . I know my limits now .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"I know I 'm not him , but I 'll try and put it from his perspective , take that how you will , I know I might not even know what 's going through his head . `` It 's been years since the incident , I 'm still depressed but I manage to go on . I 'm in college for game art , I suppose that 's good , better than engineering school , that was too easy , though I suppose this is too since I 'm better than most of the other students . I 'm bored enough to join a dating site , lets message some girls to see if they want to hang . Hmm , she seems cool , she 's into games too . Maybe we can play sometime . Oh God , she 's amazing , we spent every day together this week , I have n't had so much fun in years . I 'm in Love . I told her that today , I think it might have been to sudden when I blurted it out , she looked at me funny , but hey , I ca n't help what I 'm feeling . I asked her to be my girlfriend . There 's not a day we do n't spend together , I do n't want to be around anyone else . I broke down tonight , I guess my past caught up to me . I told her about my only other girlfriend , how she was in a car crash when we were 18 , after dating for four years , and how I had to pull the plug . Nothing was the same since . I was so depressed and gained weight abnormally ( after stopping all sports that I was actively in ) , that they had to remove my stomach , I became obese , I 'm better now , but she has n't seen what I was like . I told her that she was the only thing that made me feel good anymore . She made my world . We 've been together for 3 weeks , and she 's going away to visit her family in a little over a month for 3 months . I do n't want her to go but I do n't want to be too forward to suggest to go with her . I brought it up , kinda , I do n't get why she 's being weird about it , what has she got to hide ? She got a weird message the other night from a friend back home . I could n't sleep , it was 3am and I did n't like it , but there was nothing to suggest anything weird in their conversation history . I 'm worried she 's hiding something , I should just leave this place , forget it all . I do n't want to get hurt . She 's awake and convincing me to stay , that it was a wrong message , and that there 's nothing in the history , which is true . I 'll trust her . But as I say this , I do n't trust her going home , I 'm going to go with her , I bought myself tickets , it 's two months in and I 'm spending 2k to go be with her , is n't that romantic ? I hope she thinks it 's as romantic as I do . I hope she moves in with me soon , I told her I 'd get her a cheap car from craigslist so she can drive to school since I 'm not at a walking distance from it . We 're heading back home , her lease is running up and I suggested she moves in with me . It 's been 5 months now . I 'd like her to be with me , we have n't spent a day apart except from her being 1 week home until I got there . Her roommate brings up moving with some friends so she can move in with me , perfect ! I told her she 'd be paying less rent if she stays with me , besides , her mom just had expensive surgery and her parents are probably short on money . She 's not going to be selfish and spend more money is she ? She can get a car now with that money she was meant to use for rent . I lost my income , things have been a bit tight so I 've asked her to contribute to me more than usual . But we 're a couple and we help each other right ? I helped her with her stuff when she needed it , now it 's her turn . She wants to go out often , which I think is a waste of money ( by often I mean , 2-3 times a month ) . She goes out with her friends and stays up late , like 3-4 am and I do n't know what she 's doing or if she 's alright . She texts me all the time but I feel bad to interfere with her friend time so I tell her so but she still texts me . Then I start feeling bad for her so I stop texting , but then I sulk at how she 's out having fun while I 'm home alone . But it 's okay , I make sacrifices for the relationship . She says I should go out with my friends , but why ? I 've got her , she 's all I need , I do n't need anyone else in my life , she makes me happy , my friends were there just to kill time . I was still bored , even hanging with them . She gets me , like no one else does , she makes my day , anything she does is just magical . If she were to leave , I 'd be devastated . I said the other day that I 'd probably kill myself , then I realized later that she took it the wrong way . I noticed she posted to that Reddit site she 's always on , I did n't like her post , it sounded like she was unhappy . She mentioned that it was emotional abuse , but then I told her that I did n't mean it that way , I was joking . I was n't , but I did n't want to crush her , I love her , she 's my everything . I do n't want to hurt her . She told me it was n't the same , things have changed , she has different feelings now . It crushed me , I was devastated , how could she say that ? Was what I offered her not enough ? I got her everything that she wanted , even when she told me I did n't have to , I knew she 'd want it and was just modest . We still have sex regularly , 1-2 times a day , I know she 's not always into it , but she knows it makes me happy and I know she wants to make me happy . I do n't get how she can suddenly not be into it , it 's weird . I still try hard to get her to enjoy herself and hope that she changes her mind . I ca n't take it anymore , everything 's piling on , I 've got a warrant for my arrest , I failed to mention I have some bad habits , but it 's okay , she accepts me , bad habits or not . That 's what I love about her . I told her I could n't take it , and I got some sleeping pills . I planned on doing it right at the time she leaves , oh yeah she 's flying to see her sister for a month , I feel like she ca n't take it here anymore and it 's the only reason . I told her it was selfish of her to want to just hang with her sister while I 'm here struggling with a warrant and everything turning to shit . I used to make 4k a week , and now I 've got nothing . Except the job that I got right out of college , out of 500 people applying to the same company , 80 in my city , I got the job among 6 other people . I was that lucky guy . I mean , I also have a house , of my own , my own car , smart TV , gaming computer , 5 consoles , 4 laptops , etc ... But I 'm broke , really . I have nothing , I ca n't afford to pay for things soon . And she 's leaving . She found me , paralyzed in the bed , not feeling it , and called an ambulance . I told her to go , but she could n't , she stayed by my side . I made sure my parents did n't find out , it would devastate them . I got out but realized I could n't evade my warrant for too long so I turned myself in right before she got a second ticket to just go see her parents . My parents had to find out eventually . They were more supportive than I thought , I told her to not tell them all the details of what I did , just enough . Especially not about killing myself , I ca n't have them know that . She 's gone for the summer , I ca n't call her . I used to call her daily , and she 'd brighten up my time in here . I ca n't take it , I 'm not meant for jail . She 's back now , and she came to visit me once , but seems to be busy to come again . She wants to move out . I do n't see why she should , I mean , she can stay there , and does n't even have to pay rent , my parents got it covered , I do n't want to stress her while she has school and all these other stresses moving is too much for her . I told her I 'd help her once I 'm out , I want to help her . Plus money 's tight , so she should save up while she 's here and I can help her get money and fix things . It 's official , she 's leaving and sooner than I thought . I told her to at least stay until I can get house visits once a week for 10 hours . Just to hold her and hug her and watch a movie one last time . I was hoping the distance would make the heart grow fonder . Turns out I was wrong , oh so wrong . What do ? I get out of jail , I lost the job I had for the summer , I lost my car , did n't make payments . I have the house , but it 's empty , she 's gone and I 've got nothing .

12084182,AskReddit,"When I was in high school I had some really fucked up dreams that kept recurring . I 'd watch something take place ( usually some form of abuse or a murder , or something just downright atrocious ) and I could n't do a thing to help , I 'd be there physically and talking and trying to get people to notice me but nothing happening . So a girl would be raped , and I 'm just standing there , watching and not being able to do anything . This started happening after an operation I had in which they did n't administer the anesthetic properly . I woke up after the operation to find I could n't move or talk or respond . The doctors were trying to wake me up yet I was there , trying to talk to them to tell them I was awake and I could n't do a thing . It was a horrible fear of mine and I still have n't gone for that second operation I was supposed to go for ( 5 years later ) because of that fear . The dream manifests that fear in a strange way . I have lots of recurring dreams though . The most common being where I 'm running from something or someone . Usually with someone else or a bunch of people , or occasionally on my own .

12084182,canada,"Hopefully these tragedies will shine more light on our society 's mental health problems . General knowledge about mental health is pretty distorted . A lot of people disparage anti-depressants and other pills . Well , do you know why most people turn to medication instead of counseling or talk therapy ? No , it 's not because the drug companies are pushing their products on people . It 's because counseling and talk therapy are not covered by any healthcare plan , and they cost dearly . Moreover , it 's very difficult to obtain a psychiatrist in most provinces in this country . In Ontario , you need a referral from a medical doctor ... you ca n't just book your own appointments . If you manage to get such a reference , you 'll be lucky to land one appointment every six months or so . So what ends up happening is that most people are treated for their mental health issues by their family doctors or other regular MDs . And all they can really do is prescribe drugs and encourage you to seek counseling which you ca n't afford in the first place . This is the world that people suffering from mental illnesses face . It 's not a pretty one .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I 've had guys tell me how heartbroken they were from before to get my pity only to do the same thing to me . Well , one guy , but I 'm sure there 's other people out there like that . Perfect liars too , always know what to say . 2 ) Maybe they do n't have sex yet ? Or early on ... But I assume by that , that she 's still into you , so this is a tough one . Maybe they 're just friends and she thought you 'd feel weird by it if you knew since he isnt ' a mutual friend or anything . Or maybe for the reasons she 's friends with him , and you would n't like them , but they 're anything but sexual . Or he likes her and she does n't like him but likes his friendship . This is my advice , bring it up , why is it weird to look at each others phones ? Me and by boyfriend do it all the time , nothing to hide , right ? Just say you want to check something . If she gets weird about it , ask why ? Or maybe be playful about it , be like , why is he texting you so much ? Hmm ? Or I do n't know how you guys are in a relationship , byut if you are that comfortable and playful , you can be like , oh Julia huh ? Let me text her and see if she notices that it 's not you , and take her phone from her . Prank her essentialy ... Or if that 's weird , talk to her friends , if you 're on good terms with them and they know you , just call 'Julia ' or whoever and ask her how things are going ... hint hint ... and then be like 'so Julia said you guys never met up ' or even better , make a surprise date for your girlfriend and call Julia and say , I know you guys are meeting up today , so I was wondering ... and then plan a surprise and she 'll be like , 'we 're meeting up ?

I would suggest explaining that it was your first relationship , and you have only spoken to him twice because that 's how little he mattered , it 's merely catching up since you were important people in each others lives . The main thing I want to say is that if he disapproves , maybe an option is to invite him along , as akward as it might be , it might give him the perspective that it 's the last time you 'll ever see him and nothing 's gon na happen since you invited him along and he might either feel more trusting of you or might decide to come along for your sake , so it 's a win win sorta , if you 're okay with him being there .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My teachers first diagnosed me with ADHD because I was n't paying attention in class , but really I could n't hear a thing of what they were saying and did n't bother to participate in class . Then I moved to a different school and they were like , 'well , your hearing 's fucked ' so I had to wear a hearing aid , and then after various treatments ( my parents never opted for surgery ) my hearing got slightly better , but I still could n't hear about 70 % on my left ear . This summer I finally went for surgery and got about 30 % of my hearing back , I can hear more in stereo which shocks me sometimes but my hearing is still somewhat bad . : / Also , I 've only 3 times in my life had dreams with sound . I thought it was normal to not dream with sound and last year I woke up and went to my friend 'I dreamt with sound , there was a song in my dream , holy fuck ' and he was like , 'you do n't dream with sound ?

12084182,AskReddit,"You asked for elaboration , so here goes : There 's so many things I would change . So many scenarios that could have played out differently and change my life entirely . Make more friends , real friends , stop being introverted and shy , and actually go out and meet people . Study more , get decent grades and be more directional with my life ( even though I 'm studying what I want , there 's at least 5 other things I 'd gladly be studying right now ) Tell my parents I can predict the future ( well , just over time make them realize that little things I say come true , not make a big deal of it , cause that would probably be weird and go on a grande scale ) , and make them make better choices that impacts my life . Little things , that made my life harder , just avoid them . Avoid certain people that were bad for me . Change relationships . Stop my friend from killing himself . My current boyfriend ( that I love to death ) had one girlfriend before me , and she died in a car crash . Even though it would pain me to do this , I 'd prevent that so he did n't have to suffer the way he did ( totally messed up his life , he stopped exercising , caused him to gain a lot of weight since he ate a lot and did n't burn it off , and it got so bad that he became obese and his stomach overproduced acid and it ate his stomach and they had to operate to remove it , which resulted in no stomach , he can only eat a cup worth of food for a meal . No more . ) He 's lost the weight but you can see the scars from the surgery all over . I 'm pretty sure he 'd be better off not having to experience all that , also his life was very dull before he met me . And I know he would n't be with me unless I was physically around him , and we lived countries apart , and he 'd be with her at some point so I 'd just hate to live life knowing him but not at the same time , and so on ... I 'd stop my best friend from dating the bitch he was dating for 5 years that told him that she did n't love him for the past 2 years but stayed with him cause she felt sorry for him and finally felt the courage to tell him that since they were long distance for a year . Almost killed himself over it . Stop my dog from getting run over and suffering badly after that . Assholes ( tried to break into our house , he bit the guys leg - mind you , he 's a small terrier/poodle type mix and is n't violent at all , but knows bad intentions when he sees them ) They came back a few days later and as he chased the car ( according to neighbors ) they ran at him . Complete internal bleeding and for months he could n't move an inch without pain and suffering . Find better ways to make money . I was always scheming how to make more money , but definitely make better choices there . Maybe even make something I knew would be popular ( not necessarily something big , I do n't want to alter the world that much so that the whole future changes and I do n't know a thing about it - I do want to retain at least some control of my future ) Now that I know what people think about me , perhaps change their perceptions to something better ? If they did n't think much of me anyway ... ( A lot of people in high school thought I was weird cause I stuck to myself , I just did n't want to be a part of that stupid crowd )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

While someone waits 5 years to get adopted , because of adoption laws , others go out into the world without parents . Reason I 'm saying this is cause a friend of mine , who was in an adoption center , never got adopted , he 's studying at the same university as me and told me that at 21 , he left the adoption center as did many other kids he was with , never knowing what a home is . Had to start his own life , did n't want anything to do with the people from the adoption place , hated everyone there .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# The Carnivorous Hare ’ s-tail Cottongrass * *What is plant 's name , etymology , season for bloom ? * Ok , so… on the first glance you would call this cottongrass…but I have named it Eirophorum Dangerousus because when no one else is around these specific blades of cottongrass in front of my door get wildly unpredictable and grow sharp venomous teeth . I have not been able to show this trait to anyone yet because they seem to only do it when I ’ m on my own but I think this is my chance to show the world that this exists and needs to be taken seriously . In all respects except this one , the Eirophorum Dangerousus is equal to the hare ’ s-tail cottongrass ( Eriphorum vaginatum ) . They are English to bogs and other wetlands and grow to be about 30-60cm . The hare ’ s-tail cottongrass is a tussock-forming plant and the fruit is an achene . * *Where does it grow ? What does it look like ? Feel free to include an image ! * As far as I can tell , these plants only grow right outside my house but my hypothesis is that they exist in all appropriate climates but usually kill anyone that comes near them . * *What history does the plant have ? Who discovered it ? * This plant has probably been around for millennia because it will eat or poison anything that comes to close to it . Everyone that discovered it before me probably died from the poison . I noticed something was wrong because I kept finding corpses of rabbits and birds next to the plants but I originally thought there must be a den of some carnivorous animal close by . I was never a big fan of plants ( sorry Madam Pomfrey ) so I didn ’ t usually come too close to this particular bunch of cottongrass until one day when I was retrieving the newspaper and one of the bunch lashed out at me . Luckily , I was wearing full-body armor after a whole night of working in my laboratory . At first , I thought this was just a side effect of the chemicals I was experimenting with , but later inspections of the armor revealed significant traces of poison and I have since retrieved several samples to confirm my findings . * *What are its uses ? How were these discovered ? How does this plant help Madam Pomfrey care for her patients ? * This plant needs to be handled with extreme caution ! A steel armor needs to be worn at all times when handling this plant . However , there are uses to the plant that will be helpful in treating patients . When extracted and applied to a patient , this poison will eliminate any other poison and overpower it . With an equation I developed , the exact amount of poison can be calculated so that it overpowers most known poisons but only leaves the person with symptoms similar to the common flu for a week , which can obviously be very convenient .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species ? Hagrid used all his favorite , completely harmless animal friends , now presented in one compact species : the acromantula , the norwegian ridgeback and the three-headed dog . **Yes , you 're reading this right folks , all your favorite cuddlies at once ! ** * What is its name ? What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem . These magical researchers report back to Hagrid on a daily basis and send him monthly paintings to keep him up to date on what these cuddlies are up to . This author would not recommend keeping norwegian acrowoofs as pets unless your dwellings are inflammable but whatever floats your boat .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,relationships,"I do n't really know what this falls under . Background : I 'm 19 , living with my mom , stepdad and their son in a European country where it 's customary to live with your family until you get a job . My parents got divorced when I was 2 , but I saw my dad at least once a week and I was always much closer to him than I was to my mom . I never got along with my stepdad , especially since him and my mom got a child , because he uses everything I do as a reason to mock me ( for example , if I decide not to eat dinner with them I 'm ''on a diet again '' if I do I 'm ''finally deciding to get out of my room '' if I 'm taking too long to pick what I want to eat I 'm ''picky '' if I get a good grade in school I ''have no life '' ) . He also says those things to my brother when he thinks I 'm not listening . My dad died three years ago and because I was underage , I was justified to what is basically his pension money , 800€ a month until I finish college ( so that 's about 7 years of getting it which is 67,200€ ) . This money was only mine . Because I was only 16 and very upset and did n't even want to think about anything relating to his death , I asked my mom to take care of it . We decided the money would be going to her account and be put away every month , possibly to eventually buy an apartment for when I decided to move out . After a couple of months of her getting the money , I checked in with her and she said she had n't been able to put it aside because of something urgent . After another few months , the same thing . So we decided we would buy an apartment and rent it out ( I mostly decided on it because I saw she was n't going to save the money ) . I did n't do anything then because an apartment would be more money than I was going to get in the long-term and I was grateful she decided to buy it for me . Nothing happened with the purchase of the apartment even though I repeatedly asked about it and whenever I pushed too hard , she would call me ungrateful and unloving for even thinking about doubting that she 'll do it . Meanwhile , she has used this money to remodel the kitchen and bathroom while she keeps telling me we do n't have enough money to put any of mine on the side . Fast forward to this year when I started college . Because I have to eat out due to my schedule and receive no money beside what she decides to give me , her and I decided together that 200€ a month would be enough for me to buy myself food , pay for my bus rides and be able to save a bit on the side . A month after we made that deal , I went to the ATM to withdraw my lunch money and found out it was n't there . When I confronted her about it , she said she did n't have the time to do it yet ( the whole month ) . She promised she 'd take care of it that week and also give me what she owed me from the month before . She went last Friday , decided to give me 160€ a month instead of 200€ without even checking with me , saying that if I need anything more I can just tell her every time I want to buy something , and she also did n't give me any money for last month . I have begged her to let me move out and she wo n't . She says it 's proof that I hate my family and want to destroy it like the ungrateful daughter I am . She also said that she will divorce her husband before letting me move out ( and I think she will do it ) and when I brought up the fact that she ca n't use up more than 300€ a month for me she agreed but said that after 19 years of taking care of me , she deserves to get something for her effort . I could make the money go into my account without her permission , but it would naturally make her scream at me and cry because of how much I hate her . If I moved out without her permission , I am certain that she would follow me around , wait for me at college etc and do everything she could to make me come back . There 's also the issue of her parents which already think she 's a bad mother and as she says ( and I agree with her to some extent ) would make her life miserable if I moved out . The only solution I see right now is to move to America with my long-term boyfriend . That way my family would n't be able to force me to move back with them and I would n't have to listen to them anymore . His parents that know about this situation have also offered me to stay with them until I can figure things out . Basically the only thing that 's stopping me is that I 'm currently in med school and ca n't transfer because here medicine is a study like every other , not a post-graduate study , and I do n't have a degree in anything else . As such , I would have to find a way to transfer to something else or quit school and also stop receiving my father 's pension money , which would make moving a lot more challenging . I 've also told my mom already that since I am planning on moving to America eventually , I wo n't be needing that apartment , but she 's still intent on buying it with my money . I 'm sure there 's something vital to the story I 've forgotten since this has been going on for years and years . Thank you for listening . **tl ; dr** : My dad died and my mom 's taking all the money I should be getting while also not letting me move out . I want to run away from all of my family 's bulshit and move in with my boyfriend who lives across the world .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Her skin seems permanently smudged from climbing trees and her eyes appear unusually big in comparison with her thin face , like two drops of green paint on a face made brown by spending so much time outdoors . **Personality** Leena is a bit shy and slow to trust at first , but once she gets to know you she 's very warm and fiercely loyal . Her laughter is loud and natural , always to be heard among her friends . She 's rather mischievous , not above setting up small pranks ( though always careful not to actually hurt anyone ) , but can also be patient and hardworking if it 's for something she finds important . Above all , she loves spending time with her friends and being there for them . Her world is full of excitement and laughter and she ca n't wait to make new friends at Hogwarts . **Hobbies** Anything involving the outside ( she does n't mind getting dirty ) , spending time with her friends , maybe just lying and chatting on their beds after a day of excitement . **Wand** Cedar with unicorn tail hair , 12 '' , pleasantly springy . **Backstory** Both of her parents being writers ( muggles ) , Leena was often left to entertain herself on her own . She quickly made friends with the rest of the neighborhood children and together they formed bands of pirates and aliens , battling each other in the woods surrounding her town .

Now , A is asexual/aromantic and I guess you could argue asexuals and aromantics are queer because their sexual preferences do n't fit the norm , but it 's still a little different from what most people consider queer . Intersex , on the other hand , is not a sexual preference , it 's closer to trans in that your body/mind does n't match with your label in society . A lot more goes into making your biological sex than most people think ( hormones , outside sexual organs , inside sexual organs ) and sometimes those do n't all match up , though doctors at birth will usually mark you as whatever your outside organ is , or sometimes not even that - maybe you were born with both .

Our team of travel experts will then sit down with you and discuss your wishes then arrange the perfect experience – without telling you about it ! On the day of your trip , you just have to show up and hold onto the pre-prepared portkey ! Per request , one of our employees will travel to the location with you to make sure you settle in nicely ( not available for the survivalist package ) . Your accommodation will be included in the package , as will all food and drinks unless you specify otherwise . We offer a variety of customizable packages , help us choose the best fit for you ! * The standard package : Includes a week/two-week vacation for one to two people at one location put together by a team of travel experts . * The family package : Includes a family-friendly adventure that takes into account non-magic-performing travelers . * The adventure hop : Our most popular choice is a multi-destination experience that lasts between two weeks and a full month . You will be sent off to your primary destination and regularly supplied with new portkeys that will take you to another destination . The frequency of environment swaps is your choice and will determine the price of this package . * The survivalist : Our challenge is to challenge you ! This one-week experience will test your skills of survival and is only intended for the bravest of wizards and witches . Your environment will be changed multiple times by portkeys in disguise . Obviously , you could disapparate at any time but this is intended as a challenge to yourself . You will be observed to insure nothing goes wrong . Wizards and witches that make it through the week will be rewarded . *A testimony by Gilderoy Lockhart : Being the fearless adventurer I am , I of course went with the survivalist option . I requested an emphasis of monsters to see what their ‘ ’ adventure ’ ’ were really made of and test myself against them . I was faced in rapid succession with a colony of acromantulas , a horde of manticores and a hive of tarantula hawk wasps . Being as skilled as I am , I readily dispatched them . Then they threw a basilisk at me . I averted my eyes and quickly retrieved a mirror from my pocket ( I always carry a mirror ) , instantly turning the basilisk to stone with its own gaze , and returned home for my reward .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # By Thy Sparkling Brew The Triwizard contestants are always very talented witches and wizards , able to cast a variety of powerful spells , but do they have the versatility a true champion needs ? Many witches and wizards neglect one of the most useful and potent facets of magic : **Potionmaking . ** We propose to challenge the contestants with a series of four rooms , each with its own unique mini challenges designed to test more than raw power . The contestants will be allowed a 12 hour period in a private chamber stocked with potion-making ingredients and equipment to prepare ( as well as supplied with a potion bandoleer with which to carry vials ) and will be relieved of their wands immediately following their potion-making . In the process of completing the previous challenge , contestants will find themselves in possession of a piece of parchment , blank but for a picture of a potion . Upon holding this piece of parchment above a cauldron with a brewing potion , [ four additional images ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fjff1bo.jpg ) will be revealed on the parchment , each image providing a hint for one of the four rooms . The judges will be instructed to score the contestants based not on their speed of completion , but more the finesse and subtlety used in passing each obstacle . Therefore , a less straightforward path will be worth more than a more obvious one ; phasing through a wall would garner more points than knocking it over . Points will be reduced for injuries received from the various obstacles . Bonus points will be awarded for skill , imagination , and care in handling the challenges faced . & amp ; nbsp ; *The four rooms are as follows : * The **first room** consists of two chambers completely devoid of light . The antechamber is separated from the rest of the room by light-proof curtains , and has the following riddle carved on the ceiling : & amp ; nbsp ; *Go boldly forth unto the night* *Fearing not your fate ahead* *Step quickly , bravely , without fright* *If you wish to end up dead ! * *Move slowly , quietly , without noise* For sleep disturbed will cause your doom* *Should you tread with utmost poise* *You may survive to the next room . * & amp ; nbsp ; In the main chamber sleeps a mountain troll , sensitive to noise and light . Scattered across the floor are the skeletal remains of the troll 's previous meals , sure to wake him if kicked or stepped upon . Contestants objectives are to read the instructions in the antechamber , and move past the troll in the second chamber . & amp ; nbsp ; The **second room** consists of a rickety , swaying bridge over a moat of blast-ended skrewts . An enchanted wind ensures the bridge 's constant movement . Upon entry , contestants pass through a spell that completely paralyzes their legs . Upon exit , they pass through a counterspell that undoes any remaining leg paralysis . Inscribed on the wall is the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *A simple walk from door to door* *Without your legs is made a struggle . * *Will you crawl across the floor ? * *Can you do better than a muggle ? * & amp ; nbsp ; The bridge shall not at any point degrade or fall further apart except at two predetermined planks , which will immediately fall should any weight be put on them . We can not guarantee that the bridge will not at any point swing to the point of being upside down , especially given the variable intelligence of contestants . Contestants objectives are to pass from one side of the room to the other , preferably without falling into the moat . & amp ; nbsp ; The **third room** consists of a goblet on a pedestal , clearly marked with a symbol for deadly poison . It should be noted here that the supply room in which the potions are made is conspicuously absent of bezoars . Upon the wall is inscribed the following mockery : & amp ; nbsp ; *This room is easy , without malice ... * *no nasty creatures seek your death . * *Just down the contents of this chalice , * *take a step , and your last breath . * & amp ; nbsp ; The door at the other end of the room shall unlock when the final drop of the poison has been consumed , however , without some method of mitigating the poison , the contestant shall not make it more than two steps . Contestants objectives are to drink the poison , and to not die . & amp ; nbsp ; The **fourth room** consists of a gauntlet of mini-mini-challenges . The contestants must get through a relatively simple and straightforward obstacle course , with the addition of a spout of flame , continuously falling shards of razor sharp ice , and a dense cluster of Venemous Tentaculae , each of which completely obstructs a portion of the path ahead . Upon the wall is inscribed the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *Good work surviving , you may yet live ! * *You 've made it through the easy part . * *Three challenges this room will give . * *And not one for the weak of heart . * *Try not to burn within the heat* *If you truly be must told . * *Do n't supply a plant with meat* *And avoid bitter shards of cold . * & amp ; nbsp ; The obstacle course on its own is of a level than can be easily completed with minor to moderate athletic skill , but the specific obstacles should be expected to add some substantial difficulty . & amp ; nbsp ; EDIT : @ * # $ reddit formatting",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # Conservation - The pudgiemudgies & amp ; nbsp ; **Description** The pudgiemudgies are small forest creatures , not much bigger than an ant but incredibly cute . They look similar to a [ puffskein ] ( http : //www.deviantart.com/art/Puffskein-261178762 ) and are their distant relatives . However , pudgiemudgies live in groups up to 500 individuals and stay close to each other at all times . Consequentially , pudgiemudgie clans will look like a curious colorful moss patch to an uneducated witch or wizard but upon further observation it will become obvious that the ‘ ’ moss patch ’ ’ is pulsing and moving as pudgiemudgies communicate by dancing . Pudgiemudgies vary in color but one clan will always only consist of one color and all the babies born to that clan will be of that color . Scholars assume that the colors are based on their environment . Once a year , all pudgiemudgie clans of an area will congregate for a meeting and a ball . This event is known as a *kaleidoball* in scholarly circles due to the mesmerizing mixtures of different clans and their colors . & amp ; nbsp ; **Endangerment** The pudgiemudgies are pretty much defenseless and rely on their small size to evade any predators . Recently however , there has been an increase in the illegal trade of pudgiemudgies as decoration and even potion ingredients . Furthermore , due to the changes in global climate , some colors of pudgiemudgie clans are beginning to die out , most notable cobalt blue and electric orange . These two clan variations were found in colder climates and need a period of snow to continue producing offspring with their colors . When offspring of the wrong color are born in a clan , they have to find a clan with their colors , which can be a treacherous journey for a young pudgiemudgie . & amp ; nbsp ; **Protection** There have been a couple of plans made to protect this vulnerable species , including bringing up the fines for trade and possession of pudgiemudgies , and efforts to restore and protect the natural environment of the clans endangered by climate change . The most interesting of conservation plans , however , is to selectively breed pudgiemudgies in order for them to develop defensive abilities that would make them less desirable as decoration and harder to hunt , such as breathing fire and manipulating their environment . Your average wizard would be much less likely to scatter them over his Yuletide tree when doing so when doing so is likely to set that tree on fire .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

How many students do you want in your class ? ** The wizarding world is amazing and awe-inspiring but let ’ s be honest : the delay in technology can sometimes be inconvenient . There are ways in which muggles have definitely overtaken us . That ’ s why I want to not only teach young witches and wizards about the ways technology and magic can intertwine but also work with them to create new ways to improve the magical world . The new subject I am proposing will be called Wiztech and will incorporate muggle technology with magical ways or repurposing and improving it . **How long will you be a guest instructor for ? Are your classes consecutive or will you be doing various courses over the year ? Is your course a one-time exclusive ? ** I will teach students for a full year ( or maybe more if this class is successful ) . My classes will occur every week in groups of 10 to 15 witches and wizards . **What is your teaching like ? Can you share a lesson plan with us ? ** My classes will begin with a series of lectures introducing students that haven ’ t had experience with muggle technology before to the ways in which it works and ways in which it can be improved with magic . Afterwards we will begin workshops in which I will show the students how to incorporate magic and technology . The last part of our year will be spent on students working on their own projects in smaller groups . These projects will be represent the majority of the final grade in my class . **What sort of homework assignments do you plan to give our students ? ** Students will spend the first two thirds of our year together researching muggle technology and ways magic can be incorporated into it , and will be required to write essays on their findings . Homework will not be given in the last part of the year when students are working on their own project . Students can obviously spend time outside of classrooms figuring out ways to improve their project , however , students will not be permitted to work on the actual project without supervision . **Describe how you would like to begin your first class , or tell us about a previous teaching experience you are proud of . ** This will be my first time teaching a class at a school but I have taken on several young assistants in my many years of invention .

AgentSmax,funny,"If we are going into specifics then you are only partially right here . From wikipedia : & gt ; Fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 , basing it on three reference points of temperature . In his initial scale ( which is not the final Fahrenheit scale ) , the zero point is determined by placing the thermometer in brine : he used a mixture of ice , water , and ammonium chloride , a salt , at a 1:1:1 ratio . This is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically : that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F ( −17.78 °C ) . The second point , at 32 degrees , was a mixture of ice and water without the ammonium chloride at a 1:1 ratio . The third point , 96 degrees , was approximately the human body temperature , then called `` blood-heat '' . Only 0°F was using salt water out of the three points .

Granted I have n't really tried it in ArmA yet , but 1000m is pretty low . From what I saw in DCS standard operating altitude of an Su-25 is at about 3-4km of altitude . And that 's a plane that really does n't feel like it wants to fly .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,Tribes,"So I 've been having issues with Tribes Ascend for a while now ( last 1 or 2 patches ) . I usually have over 60fps consistently , but then I started having framedrops in intervals ( 10-20fps for about 10 seconds in 15-30 second intervals ) . It was very consistent - especially on full servers . I have tried many solutions - closing programs that could affect the performance , trying different drivers ... Nothing worked particularly well . Since it clearly was n't the graphics card lagging ( fps drop remained if I looked at the floor or at the sky ) the only possible fault is the CPU . One day I was monitoring the CPU with the task manager and came on the idea of changing the CPU core affinity . Turns out it works for me on no more or less than 4 cores . If Tribes runs on any other amount than 4 cores it starts either being jerky or has framedrop intervals . Computer specs : The laptop is an MSI GT780DXR CPU - Intel Core i7 - 2670QM Graphics card - Nvidia GTX 570m Ram - 8GB DDR3 **TL ; DR** - Tribes only likes exactly 4 cores on my pc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting games is n't `` talking over a game you play '' . I find people cast sc2 because they genuinely love the game and would like to try their hand at casting . From what I see in cod , there were actually vlogs with gameplay in the background . That is not casting . There is also a difference between `` need '' and `` want to '' . And you do n't know it 's going to be bad . If people do n't try we may not get good casters . You ca n't just say you will cast it in a new way if you do n't know you can pull it off . Casting style develops with experience .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting I would think is not talking random non-game related bullshit . Casting ( to me ) is play-by-play and analysis . Talking random shit is talking random shit . The thing is , cod community is n't really the same as SC community . From what I have seen , except for a troll here or there , the SC community is much more mature than any mainstream FPS community . The thing is , it 's always nice to see fresh talent . And if no one wants to someone who says `` uhm '' every two words , I would think they would want to improve their casting , which could only benefit the community . This may sound a bit optimistic , but I think people recognize quality .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

I 'm not quite sure about the comments but I have found nothing wrong with it yet . The topics that are bad usually disappear pretty fast . Concerning the 100 people as good as Husky , It 's your problem who you would want to watch . It 's not like you 're forced to watch them . Nobody can be exactly the same as another caster .

AgentSmax,arma,I 'm not an expert in this but I reckon the explosive in those grenades is only powerful enough to launch shrapnel and is n't really meant to do anything else .

AgentSmax,arma,"Though I wish it was better I would n't say it 's terrible . I find the sound assets miles better than ArmA 2 . Weapons sound like they have actual power behind them . Walking sounds are great though it seems some sounds for different materials are still missing . Helicopters could use a bit more `` punch '' if you know what I mean , but otherwise they sound great . Sounds that bother me are explosions and miniguns . Explosions sound similar to arma 2 so they might as well be placeholders . Miniguns just sound weak . And I 'd like to hear some good echo . Although I wish something like [ this ] ( http : //youtu.be/MQt1jtDBNK4 ) would be picked up by game developers already . Sound technology generally seems to be lacking in games . EDIT : Seems like I should have researched the engine problems more . Yeah , they should definitely fix those things .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I also did n't quite understand it before posting my comment due to my mistake of not checking OP 's link . To quote the description on the page : & gt ; Sound positioning is terrible , there only seems to be few different volumes of gunshots- less than 50m , 50-250 , 250+ ( anything within that range sounds exactly as loud ) , you can only hear footsteps at less than 10m , when you lean your footsteps sound 3m away etc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"So basically I thought it was a sound assets problem , but it 's actually a sound engine problem . I do agree with that . It feels like that the sound engine really was n't the big focus point of the game or they have n't pushed out the proper one to the public yet . Hopefully it will be improved in the coming months .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I do n't know the specifics of either JSRS or the ArmA engine but I do n't see any other way to enhance awareness but through scripts/proper code .

The question then is : Is it more efficient to create high pressure gas by explosions or by boiling water ? Turns out , boiling is better . Mainly because the boiler of a power station can be very finely tuned to produce steam at a constant rate 24/7 , while gasoline engines have to be able to adapt to various operating conditions , like cold/hot weather , slow/fast speeds , low or high load ( towing ) ...

When transmogrification was introduced in Cataclysm , Blizz needed to add some extra inventory space to every character in the game to store all their transmog items .

Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation .

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

We find it funny when we see people of high status put into situations where they are humiliated/embarrassed . The juxtaposition of the two ( high and mighty vs. humiliated ) is a source of humor . For example : A priest slipping on a banana peal is considered funny because priests are seen as cautious , reliable , inflexible people who do n't make simple mistakes like stepping on slippery trash ; when the priest slips his stature is reduced , there is a juxtaposition and this can be considered funny ( no accounting for taste , obv ) A crippled homeless woman slipping on a banana peel is n't funny .

It can happen as a sudden descent of Lord 's Power ( śaktipāta ) : & gt ; such a being becomes spiritually illuminated and liberated on his own , relying directly on Śiva , not needing initiation or instruction from other exterior guru . This is facilitated by an intense awakening of his spiritual intuition ( pratibhā ) which immediately eliminates ignorance That being said , this is extremely rare , to the point that it 's practically best to not even consider it as an option . But it 's important to keep in mind that liberation is possible at all times since the Lord 's Freedom is unlimited and not conditioned by anything . In practice though , you will need the assistance of an external Guru and holy scriptures . But do n't give up just because a Guru has n't appeared in your life yet . Just study a good scripture such as the *Yōga-Vāsiṣṭha* to give an example and absorb the words of the Sage and the Guru will appear when you are `` ripe '' .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It 's hard to give a complete answer in a Reddit post , but if I had to attempt it , I would say that they are two ways in which nondualism exists . The Vedanta nondualism is nondualism *as opposed* to dualism . But when we juxtapose the two , we create another dualism . By contrast , the Śaiva nondualism is thoroughly nondualistic , which means that its nondualism *includes* dualism . A nondualism that rejects dualism is dualistic by this very rejection ; true nondualism must be able to absorb , integrate , its own opposite . To be less abstract : for instance , the relationship between the individual and God . In Śaiva advaita , they are identical . God is simply playing , willfully limiting Himself , His essence , and descending into individuality : being a mere man with all the stupidities and sufferings that this entails . This world is not an illusion , but it is an inward projection on the `` screen '' , as it were , of God-consciousness . So even maya is not merely negative and illusory , but it 's also true in a way , as it was created by God ( Śiva , which is ultimately You , Yourself - pure *I-consciousness* ) . If you 're familiar with European philosophy , the philosopher most resembling Śaiva idealism is Hegel . God , the Absolute Spirit , is involved in a kind of self-alienation , a cancellation of His simple perfection , and descends into limitation , negation ; later , he negates this negation itself , and regains his infinity ( when he recognize his true nature as the universal Self ) . So God Himself is dynamic , he is the totality , but at the same time , he projects his own opposite in order to reflect on what he is not . - The Vedanta view is more similar to Spinoza : the Absolute is a self-same Substance that is static , it 's like an absolute object that , because of being perfect , it is immovable , it does n't transform , nothing happens to it . If there is any happening , that is illusion , a mistake of perception . The Śaiva idealism would reply : but this illusion , too , is a Power of that God ! So , from my very limited and also partisan perspective , the difference is that the Śaiva nondualism is more thorough and radical .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

However , I think all the peculiarities of Kamakura-era sects like Shin can be deduced from the common Tendai background . - Even more interestingly , I found out Chinese Tiantai was influenced by Japanese Tendai since 10-11th century on , mainly because China lost its own texts ( by Zhiyi and Zhanran ) , and those texts were conserved only in Japan . )",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,Trika,"> 1 ) `` Trika '' means `` threefold '' . One interpretation states that Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir is known as Trika or Threefold System because it analyzes the nature of Śiva , Śakti and Nara . Śiva is God , and Śakti is God 's I-consciousness . Nara is man ( the human being ) . Trika teachs that Śiva , Śakti and Nara are not different from one another . In short , Man and God are one and the same . In fact , just the Supreme Self , known as Śiva in this philosophical system , is the Self of the entire universe . > 2 ) Therefore , there is no difference between Śiva ( God ) and Śakti ( God 's I-consciousness ) . God is and knows He is . There is not any difference at all . > 3 ) Śiva is a name for the static aspect of God . > 4 ) Śakti is a name for the dynamic aspect of God . > 5 ) Śiva-Śakti is Freedom Itself . > 6 ) Therefore , the human being is inherently free too . > 7 ) However , the human being experiences bondage because of `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) . > 8 ) Nevertheless , that mala is not something outside human being himself . > 9 ) God becomes `` man '' ( so to speak ; because lastly God is God and becomes nothing ) through mala ( impurity , limiting condition ) . In a word , mala arises from God . > 10 ) Śiva or God is not inactive . He has Śakti or I-consciousness . In short , He has Will , which gives rise to Knowledge and Activity . > 11 ) When a human being realizes his inherent unity with Śiva and Śakti , `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) ceases to exist completely . > 12 ) His realization puts an end to the whole `` apparent '' bondage . > 13 ) Since a human being is essentially God , manifests the entire universe around him ( maybe a `` difficult to accept '' teaching ) . > 14 ) Even though Non-dualism between God and human being is predominant in this philosophical system , all others viewpoints ( mostly dualistic ) are explained and included too . > 15 ) The universe is the playful unfoldment of God 's power . Therefore , the universe is born right now from Joy . > 16 ) Unhappiness is experienced by a human being when he becomes oblivious of his spiritual nature . > 17 ) When he remembers his spiritual nature and realizes his unity with God , unhappiness is turned into happiness . > 18 ) Mala or impurity is nothing but ignorance of one 's essential nature . > 19 ) Human mind is Śakti Herself having undergone a process of successive contractions . > 20 ) Therefore , human mind experiences complete happiness only when it merges in God . > 21 ) God is not a void , but a Self full of I-consciousness . > 22 ) He may appears to be a `` void '' because He does not contain , in His innermost nature , any objects . > 23 ) The human being must understand that his own mind is the Divine Mind having undergone a process of succesive contractions . > 24 ) Consequently , understanding of one 's mind is encouraged , not simply control of it . > 25 ) To control mind , as it were , one must firstly understand it . -- - source : http : //www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/en/trika-1-1-non-dual-shaivism-of-kashmir/496",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

In it , he reproduced liturgical correspondence , in one of the Q & amp ; A we find this very question : & gt ; Q : I came across a Japanese Shinshu scholar who states that *it was the Dharma-Body itself that incarnated as Dharmakara* . The identity of the Dharma-Body and Amida is thereby made explicit , and I remember you describing Amida as the 'personal ' face of the Dharma-Body . Amida is not just another Buddha and , even though all Budhas are , in essence , of the Dharma-Body , and invoking or worshipping them is , in effect , referencing the Absolute , Amida is the Supreme Buddha in Whom all other Buddhas may be subsumed . & gt ; A : Regarding your remarks about Dharmakara , *Shinran himself actually said 'Manifesting a form from this ( formless ) treasure-ocean of Suchness , calling himself Dharmakara Bodhisattva , and making the unhindered Vow as the causes , he became Amida Buddha'* . In that sense , you are quite right - Amida is more than `` just another Buddha '' but a manifestation of the wisdom and compassion inherent in ultimate reality itself . ( p166,167 , *The Unhindered Path* by John Paraskevopoulos ) -- - This idea of `` Suchness-itself-as-compassionate '' is the special mark of the Shinshu school , perhaps not found in any other PL school . I think this ... rather unconventional ... view of Amida ... was not derived from `` standard '' PL theory of the Shan-dao `` line '' , but rather comes from Shinran 's Tendai background ( he was trained as a Tendai monk ) , his thinking seems perfumed by Tiantai theories of nature-inclusion / interpenetration which allow such maneuvers .

It wins its truth only when , in utter dismemberment , it finds itself . It is this power , not as something positive , which closes its eyes to the negative as when we say of something that it is nothing or is false , and then having done with it , turn away and pass on to something else ; on the contrary , Spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face , and tarrying with it .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It only appears that way and I 'll tell you why I think that 's the case . As a non-American follower of Shaivism : 1 ) The separation between religion and philosophy is more pronounced in the West , because of historical reasons we do n't need to go into . So you wo n't include Leibniz or Hegel in the list of `` Christian philosophers '' , even though they were , and their thought contains a Christology etc . If we were to include say , a Hegel , into the umbrella `` Christian thought '' , then Christianity would suddenly become at least equal to Hinduism in philosophical depth . The trick is that in the case of Buddhism and Hinduism , many philosophers are included as religious thinkers ; while in the case of Christianity , the thinkers , even if Christian , like Hegel , philosophized about Christ , are simply considered `` philosophers who happened to be Christian '' and are n't thought of as `` Christian thought '' 2 ) American Christianity - probably here you mean the mainland Protestants - have a somehow anti-intellectual attitude towards existential questions . You know , the *Bible says it , I believes it , that settles it ! * - so when you break away from *that* , you want to go as far away from it as possible from anything related to Christianity .

AirSandFire,Buddhism,"This is not the `` ultimate standpoint '' , though . It 's still caught up in duality ( the duality between duality and non-duality ) . Huang Po knows this of course , as he remarks elsewhere : * '' Ordinary people look to their surroundings , while followers of the Way look to Mind ; but the true Dharma is to forget them both . `` * Here `` looking to surroundings '' means being caught up in distinctions and nonduality . `` Looking to the Mind '' means overcoming dualistic distinction , refraining from dualistic distinction . `` Forgetting them both '' means seeing the non-distinction between distinction and non-distinction , between Mind and surroundings . So the quote you show is the `` second step '' to take , to see oneness in everything . But that `` oneness '' is still caught up in dualistic thinking , and it means that the mountains are something other than mountains and the rivers are something other than rivers . You can arrive at the ultimate standpoint through mere logical means like this : What 's the difference between dualistic and nondualistic thinking ? Whatever answer we may come up with , that will be already `` dualistic distinction '' . So , from the standpoint of nonduality , dualistic and nondualistic are one ; but then why refrain from dualistic thinking , if dualistic and nondualistic thinking are nondual ? The very idea of refraining from something and instead opting for something else is dualistic . Ultimately , nonduality is duality , duality is nonduality , and what is Mind ? Mind is mountains and rivers . TL ; DR : Dualistic distinction is oneness .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

But what fascinates me is that the empathy we feel toward the *automaton* actually demonstrates how we ourselves are automatic , too - that is to say , even something as `` human '' as empathy ( we usually consider it an authentically human emotion ) is just an automatic trigger , not different from a program running in a robot .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

ACS primarily enables support for manual assignment of PCIe® graphics cards within logical containers called “ IOMMU groups. ” The hardware resources of an IOMMU group can then be dedicated to a virtual machine . > This capability is especially useful for users that want 3D-accelerated graphics inside a virtual machine . With ACS support , it is possible to split a 2-GPU system such that a host Linux® OS and a Windows VM both have a dedicated graphics cards . The virtual machine can access all the capabilities of the dedicated GPU , and run games inside the virtual machine at near-English performance . > This is certainly a complicated setup for most users , but I have no doubt that there will be a whole lot of you enthusiastically nodding at this news .

The QVL gives you tested setups that work . Better would be to get certified RAM . If you have a 3200MHz rated kit , you should easily get 3000MHz OC ( use XMP , set only the MHz to 3000 - worth a try ) . I use a RAM kit that is not even listed on my QVL and running it at 2666MHz of it 's rated 3000 ( rated Vendor* ) .

0x126,Amd,"Ok so there are many reasons that could happen . First of all it does not seem to be a power throttling ( but you can always go to full % since it only consumes what it needs ) . Temp throttle at 76°C is also excluded . So the most common thing left is that the VRAM is full or the RAM . 8GB of VRAM are only maxed out on AAA titles in 4k with AA fully on so - nope . Since your paging file is 11GB ? ? ? I think that this is the problem . Mine is mostly 0-200MB with 32GB RAM Close all other apps and play around with the settings of the game . Vertical Sync may also be leading to downclocking or some other target setting for FPS . The card seems fine , there has to be some periferal problem ( HDD , RAM ) . Do you often switch to the desktop ? or how do you play ? windowed or full-widowed or fullscreen ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,no it 's not normal . As a wrote this may have nothing to do with the GPU but rather the RAM/Paging/HDD read/write . open the task manager and look at the performance graph of RAM and HDD . Even huge number of page faults or read/write errors may be a hint ; ),Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,I gave back the reference 480 and getting the Red Devil too . Best after market cooler after intensive research .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you did n't change the fan curve and throttle at 85-90°C in the best case . in the worst you throttle because of power draw ^^ if you have some G/V/Free-sync at 1080p on it does n't matter but when I used the reference card with 4k it jumped from 40 to 28 and up to 35 FPS in seconds . horrific . stable clock with power limit up and fan ramped up got me to 70° ... and a vacuum right next to my head . going for custom cooler now .,Germanic,German

For science calc , encryption , image and video editing , basically everything where time is money I would choose the 1800x over the others . For me at home coding for university and doing maths it is irrelevant .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Mine does 3.8GHz at 1.28V So I guess if you do n't get the lottery silicon you just have to put +0.05V on it - which with your watercooling is no problem . I run that on the Wraith Stealth ( I think it is the stealth ! ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Usually the RAM has XMP profiles or DOCP . These are overclock profiles which set voltage , clock and timings . As currently they do n't function ( till they get patched by amd/manufacturer ) you can do it by hand . My RAM e.g . Has a base clock of 2133MHz ( 2200 ) . But it is a 3000MHz certified one . So I could push it up there with 1.35v , CL 15-17-17-17-36 and 2933 ( 3000 ) MHz . My mobo does n't store that correctly ( works for one boot fully stable . Then it gets reset - buggy ) .

0x126,Amd,"yeah but you get +4c +8t for all the workload ahead and games are maxed out with 4cores currently ( DX11 are fine even with 2c ) So why bother ? in 2 years even 1700 & gt ; & gt ; 7700k ; ) Edit : what I mean is , i buy a 1700 over a 7700k cause more cores , almost same 1080p be better next 4-6 years . that simple .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Hi /u/AMD_Robert , first thanks for your work . Second : will it be possible to store or share OC profiles ( Edit : online ) for games and applications ? e.g . disabling 4 cores and oc others higher ? Since it is possible with Ryzen Master to store those localy will there be a import/export function ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Got the 1700 still happy I preordered since my 2500k had to go anyway . Mainboard not yet chosen - since this is the real critical thing . Does it support 3200MHz DDR yet ? Do I go for a B350 or the X370 for future upgrades / APU use on one ? How do prices react the next few days ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess it is more a software or mainboard problem with the review all over the place . it makes no sense that these CPUs die in games like flies . Anyway why would you choose 4c over 8c ? because of 5fps ? That is crazy stupid,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,With a mid range CPU and a SSD yes sure . If not you got a CPU bottleneck or in another place . Totally correct . He elaborated it again later .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you should have wrote that somewhere ; ) the minimum are HUGE btw,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,there is another thread that states other issues currently not solved . This is only one of them but can be seen as you mentioned in the 4+0 and 2+2 fps . 12fps are about 10-12 % which in turn would be 16fps with all cores . only this problem alone : ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Cache management seems off the rail on some boards ( other thread looked it up ) . Which would be reasonable : in fully threaded benchmarks only the core cache is used heavily ; in games the commom cache SHOUD be used too since multiple threads work with same materials . Hence the issue could be windows driver or bios . Iff there is any . Idk . Plz asus let me buy the mobo and do my build . Please .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Waiting for stock in germany/austria of anything currently . Only some shops have mobos with 20€ shipping costs ... that is too much,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,As I do n't want it all over the CPU and socket anyway I 'll wipe it and apply a fresh layer of noctua on the cpu .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"If you game , why would you get a Ryzen ? This is a workload CPU not a high clocked gaming CPU : ) You may have to wait till all problems are sorted out ( May ? ) to use full capability of ryzen . Furthermore , OC potential of 1700 ~4GHz , 1800x ~4.1/4.2GHz = & gt ; 7700k 5GHz As I said 8c low clock for workloads , 4c high clock gaming .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I looked into mindfactory and caseking but shipping is between 10 and 20€ that 's 1/5 of the board price ( 90€ B350 ) . So I 'll wait the 1-3days till cyberport has it shipped to the vienna store ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Low FPS not dropping like shit . So with ryzen you get lower average and peaks but higher consistent lows . No one talks much about that beatyful fact which it to me more important than 200fps.. Double the physical cores reduces the 0.1 % low bottleneck a 4core cpu has some times . thats all . And I have a workhorse for all the other stuff I do and have to do , but thats not gaming ; ) Edit : stutter makes me go enrage",Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Since I do programming calculations gaming and encoding there is no other option than max cores for lowest price,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"So why does it in some games and others not ? LOL yes . Games use the same resources as other applications but are crafted to supply specifically the gpu . Hence it depends on HOW it is done and if the architecture is suited for this . Wrappers or fixes are needed to avoid such scenarios where the cpu has to work around a implementation that is not suited like the cross ccx context switching that windows does . Or single thread for draw calls , or wrong utilization of caches . Boy there are so many things that can be done !",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Thanks but that was my research topic some time ago . There is no reason to use serialized processes or one thread for draw calls . And with 8 cores we are not on the limit of 11 where the overhead exceeds the gain ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Now that is exactly one of the problems why one should not use high core count cpus for gaming the next years . There are some already well written . AMD has cooperations with devs to do this in the future for the ryzen architecture too not only intel anymore .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Calm down . Clearly overreacting .,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,That is exactly my setup too ( when Asus PRIME B350-PLUS is here ) . But I do n't know why it should not ? Just downclocked to 2133 PS : DONT BUY IT IF FOR GAMING ! ! ! ! ( i5 4690k is not bottlenecking in any way ! 1700 wo n't get you more fps ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"yes , depending on what bios automatically recognizes ( on stock of now it 's 2400 ? 2666 ? ) . but with update most vendors allow overclock to 3.2GHz or at least 3GHz ( 2993MHz ? )",Germanic,German

17DF53E,DIY,"Our main water line had a leak in it for at least 2 years , propably after a minor flood damaged the old piping . We had water in our basement ( about one inch in some places ) and very low water pressure in the house ( it was pretty infuriating trying to shower on the top floor ) . We thought the water in the basement was caused by cracks in the foundation and missing drainage of the soil around causing rainwater to be pushed through the floor . We also thought the low pressure was caused by an old and probably clogged meter , and because noone in our household REALLY cared we did n't do anything about it . But after the pressure did n't change after we replaced our meter as advised by our water supplyer my dad figured out the two problems might be connected . We hired a company to look into it and sure enought , after digging about four feet down we hit water . They replaced most of the piping on our property and the pressure hit the recommendet 6 bars and after a week the basement was dry .",Germanic,German

17DF53E,DotA2,"As you might have noticed , the launcher is currently full of minor and major bugs . I think Valve should make an update focused on the launcher . Here are some changes I would like to see : * **Fix bot-only botgames** When you leave an offline botgame and *immediately* start a new one , you will be placed in a 100 % bot botgame as some weird sort of spectator . * **Fix the in-game build maker** [ This ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2v3b96/slight_bugs_in_dotas_in_game_build_maker/ ) post already describes it well . * **Make levels actually be worth something again** I don´t see what the problem with the presents you got every 5 levels was . I know I´m complaining that Valve doesn´t give us more free stuff in their awesome free-to-play game , but cmon , currently you get almost nothing from drops . * **Please add control profiles** I think it would be very neat if you could just save your *1337 Meepwn* control sceme and not have to manually change every single key everytime you use a hero you control different . Not many players will use that feature , im certain , but i don´t think it would be hard to add . * **Fix the DotA-TV camera** I think I dont have to say much about this . Just go watch a replay and try to change the camera to player-perspective . * **Please add a key-overlay to DotA-TV** I think an optional overlay in player-perspective that shows you what keys are being pressed by the player at the moment would be pretty nice . You could see what the pros are doing different , notice what keys you use the most/least without knowing and you could verify that you *cast suicide but the game didn´t notice ! ! Volvo pls fix ! ! * * **Maybe add a record function too ? ** I know all the encoding stuff is fairly hard , but *maybe* this would be possible ? I think it would definately be nice if you hadn´t to rely on third-party software to export your clips to e.g . YouTube . I know that ~~most~~ all of my points are not game-breaking , but still , the launcher seems so much behind the actual game that it kind of drags the game down a bit ...",Germanic,German
