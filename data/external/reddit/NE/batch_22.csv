The more promiscuous a girl is , the less likely she can find a good long term partner , so I did n't let anyone so much as kiss me , cause for a lot of guys an untouched virgin wife has a lot of appeal . I started going on dates with my current husband and he said he was impressed by how sexually conservative I was . I told him that if he wanted to deflower me he 'd have to put a ring on my finger and so that 's what he did ! We have a very nice life and a beautiful daughter .

You can have a great married sex life",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; its important to explore your sexuality to an extent ( in my opinion ) . in my case , i see a bit of pre-marital sexual experience as just that -- experience . a way to learn about what works for you and what does n't ; what you like in bed and what you do n't . ultimately , with experience , you can feel more confident in your sexuality and please your lifelong partner to the best of your ability , etc . to gauge sexual compatibility and chemistry -- both are critical elements in maintaining a healthy sex life . I think it 's far more beautiful to enter inexperienced and to have everything be new . Just two partners together learning how to please each other .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"Basically our subreddit is about maintaining long term relationships with our men . I 'll try to summarize the main points as quickly as I can . We recognize men and women are different and have different needs in a relationship . We put our men as a very high priority in our lives and we wish to make their lives easier , which will end up improving the relationship . We put effort into our relationships and try to make them work well . One thing that I noticed is how you said that the woman gives sex to the man , that 's a bad attitude , it 's a mutual activity which benefits the relationship .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"Yep , it 's rather nice that way . Also both parties agree to sex when the other wants it , stuff like that means there 's very little disagreement that happens once the relationship has gotten going for a while .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"It totally depends . Some retards think reactionary is anything right wing , I think reactionary characterizes regressive ideologies such as primitivism and anarchism and some 'back in the old days ' conservatism . I think Nazism as Hitler had it was totally revolutionary . He destroyed the banking establishment , destroyed the German left wing movements , and he created a new society with totally new ideas and characteristics , moving forward . He wanted to create an organization of European states too , contrary to those who say he only cared about Germans . Mussolini in my view may have been a combination of reactionary and revolutionary , he wanted a new Roman Empire and he brought order to Italy , so in a way he was trying to go back to the old days , but he infused many new ideas so he 's partially revolutionary too . I think it 's fair to say Franco was a reactionary",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"When I was 14 I was dating a 19 year old . That same guy ended up marrying me . We did n't have sex until we married either , we just got to know each other , spent time together and then married and started having sex . The feminists are afraid of youth , afraid of virginity , and afraid of beauty because generally speaking they lack in those categories . As a result , they try to push men to wait until later ages by which time girls are often already deflowered . A big age gap in dating is only a problem for a society which is perverted and expects all couples to be sexually active . An age gap is also beneficial because it enforces patriarchy and accounts for the fact that women mature faster . It also allows the man to be better able to provide for his woman and for her to be in a more reliant role .",Uralic,Hungarian

I generally wake up a half hour before my husband to make him breakfast and get myself presentable . When he 's out of the house and I 'm home alone is when I work , so he does n't feel like I 'm putting myself through a lot of trouble . I would also recommend working briskly , if you do you can get a lot of work done in that time .

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"I honestly waited till I was married to have sex , it let me have a very high quality husband . There are two caveats to that though . I live in a mostly Catholic country which is very traditionalist in some ways . I also was dumped by many many guys who wanted sex before marriage which really bummed me out . These days I have a great sex life though . This I can be sure of : Do not have sex on the first or second date . This is how you get slutzoned . If you want to save yourself for marriage , there are a lot of traditionalist Catholic and Mormon men who will be fine with you saving yourself if you choose this . If your goal is to get married , you have to make a guy desire something from marriage that he does n't currently have . Let 's say you decide to have sex with him before marriage . If he does n't live with you and wants a housewife type gal or wants you to live with him , he might want to marry you to do this . What I 'm saying is , if your goal is marriage , make sure he has something to gain from it . If you sleep with him , and live with him , and cook for him , and do all the stuff wives do before you marry him , he does n't get much more from committing to you . But let 's say you save yourself and do n't cohabitate with him , and you simply go on dates and outings with him , he might be more interested . Then he finally gets to conquer you so to speak and have you around 24/7 when you marry . That 's why divorce rates are lower for couples where the wfie saved herself and where they did n't cohabitate .",Uralic,Hungarian

Articles in the Jew run New York times constantly marr our image . There have also been a large number of barely veiled threats against Hungary economically such as by the world Jewish council . One such veiled threat I saw was from the World Jewish Council where they said that a Jobbik run Hungary would be unattractive to foreign investment and that we should worry that Jews wo n't invest in our country anymore . Id be happy if they did n't . About the attacks by world Jewry on Jobbik , I believe Goebbels had similar thoughts , `` and if the Jewish press believes today it can make veiled threats against our movement ... they shouldnt keep lying , one day our patience wiill end .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Your egotism is honestly just incredible . To talk about what you 'preach ' as if you 're some fedora tipping messiah we all should heed is hilarious . From what I 've seen you say about yourself you 're simply not in a good place to judge others . You just are a massive degenerate , you 're dating an adulteress if I remember correctly , and from a picture , you are an unattractive manlet .

Oh classic stuff right here . The 'logic and reason ' atheist who still believes in racial equality . The one commandment of your religion of leftism seems to be faith based egalitarianism .

2PantsLady,CoonTown,"Many people go from lolbert to AnCap to Fascism . In my view , libertarianism is neocon crap spread by Jews like Ayn Rand . The state is not a bad thing , it keeps niggers out , it prevents exploitation of workers , and it can serve to mold society in the proper manner by wedding out degeneracy . In a largely unregulated capitalist society like America , you end up with the Jews ( highest IQ , its inevitable ) controlling the media and promoting degeneracy . Hence , use the state to create homogeneity and fight degeneracy .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"I would say giving away sex without getting commitment . Each guy a girl has slept with makes her less attractive generally .

I far prefer the state oreinted economy plan of Hjalmar Schacht and Albert Speer . I 've read lots of AnCap stuff , but Fascism has always appealed to me more . For recommended reading/viewing I 'd say read A Doctrine of Fascism Mein Kampf Zweites Buch The International Jew by Henry Ford The Culture of Critique ( about Jews and Marxism ) Currency Wars For recommended viewing The Triumph of the Will The Greatest Story Never Told The Man Who Fought The Bank & gt ; I do n't think you need a state to create homogeneity and fight degeneracy . Homogeneity happens naturally and the degenerates would be taken care of anyway . I disagree with this .

2kewl4skoool,digimon,"The whole game is similar to Shin Megami Tensei games especially Persona . The combat is similar too , minus the press turn system , so it 's a fairly standard JRPG but it also has more depth because of the team building and stat raising aspect of the game , so there are some similarities to Pokemon .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,mega64,"I think he is kinda right . In theory these kind of openers are great and throws you right into the good stuff , making you excited . The setpiece was pretty impressive , but it was narratively lacking and just pointless . It should have had some intense cliffhanger or a red herring element to make you intrigued in the story , instead all you think is `` that was kinda cool , I guess there will be a train '' .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,mega64,"Actually the comics have been great since Duggen and Posehn took over in 2012 ( they even had a great serious arc ) .

2kewl4skoool,mega64,"Does it really ? It 's just generic mcguffin treasure item # 173 , a treasure that will obviously be in every piece of the genre . I meant it as something that would confuse you and keep you waiting on the edge of your seat until the story catches up , like a character appearing to be a traitor ( like Chloe in the whole game several times ) or if it has to be an item just make it less obvius . But this is just my preference .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,comicbooks,"There is a huge difference between making fun of someone and hating them for their nationality or simply being a foreigner or stranger . It 's just a negative stereotype , that 's word for it . Context and interpretation can make it either humurous or insulting . Considering it 's a dumb one liner straight out of a B action movie it 's safe to say it was intended to sound cool and witty . It just fails because it 's such an old , overused and irrelevant stereotype , though Cap is fresh out of the 40s so it kinda makes sense . Also it 's from 2002 , a lot has changed on since then .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"Because he is an actually fantastic wrestler , great technically and stiff as fuck . Watch the recent Evolve 53 where he tagged with ZS Jr. against Hero and End , his PWG just before he went to NXT were also amazing , especially the iron man match against Cole .

Their families have the exact same ideologies and motivations . If you consider this warcrime then America has commited several far worse crimes in recent years there .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,pics,"That 's still not satirical at all ( nor was it ever , parody is different , satirical style is n't even popular in Japan ) . Aside from Saitama everyone follows the standard role , that 's why he is the twist on the genre , but you have to admit the beginning before he joined the association was more of a parody where 100 % of the events were part of the joke . After that jokes were just there and started focusing more on rule of cool moments .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"It 's simply a terrible game and one , if not the worst RPGs I have ever seen . It 's missing basic functions , descriptions , lacks polish , audiovisually painful and just horribly designed with maze like overworld and frequent random battles . Also from what I 've seen it 's missing any kind of real narrative ( what 's there is bad ) , and even towns , the whole thing is just a series of random battles . It seems like a game someone with no familiarity of the genre would make , some design choices are baffling . One could even believe it 's an intentionally awful game with its only purpose to troll the fans . I 'm honestly not sure how this could ever be fixed .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,GamePhysics,"They are way better . The originals ran poorly , mostly below 30 FPS and even low 20s , the remasters are rock solid 60 .

You should find it now for cheap .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Not really . This is more about maturity , Seinen is more of a target audience , which is young men . Many genres and anime can belong to it that you would never put on this list , like some ecchi or moe crap or try-hard edgy shit , those can be the most juvenile ones in my opinion .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"It does sound strange but it 's true , but none of his earlier efforts makes me think that he knows what it takes to make a good RPG . Pilgrim 's Progress looks terrible to me but The Desolate Hope nails the nonsensical nature while remaining entertaining and somewhat technical and functional , I do n't think it 's a good game , but it 's certainly an interesting one .

By Marineford the average became closer to 1 chapter per episode and since the time skip there are barely any episodes that cover more than an entire chapter . This slow pace became even more apparent because the pacing of the manga became slower too thanks to bullshit like the bird cage in Dressrosa and too many unintresting plotlines running parallelly .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,OnePiece,"But foreshadowing is inherently something that you ca n't even see and realise it 's existence until the future event , at which point you make the connection between them and see it as a neat hidden little hint to what was coming .

2kewl4skoool,vita,"Digimon and Trails of Cold steal are easily the best and safest choices . Atelier is nice , but crafting focused and because of that it might not be everyone 's cup of tea . VLR is excellent , but I recommend playing 999 first . Danganronpa is kinda fun for a silly dumb VN , but it 's also very much style over substance , which I do n't think works well for a VN , but if you like stupid anime cliches , over the top drama and weird murder mysteries then you might as well check it out . I do n't think Neptunia is good , especially not compared to the others on the list . And I 'm personally not a big fan of the action games on handheld , but they are all decent , especially Toukiden and SSD . I think Toukiden is the safer choice , because Soul Sacrifice tries some very unconventional things for the genre and not all succesfully imo .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,movies,"The difference is that people like those characters because they are either cool , professional or just ridiculously villaneous .

I just found the movie completely forgettable .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,horror,"Slight spoiler , but more like getting your expectations right : The scary vampire bit is pretty much the last shot of the movie , so you wo n't get that from the movie . The whole thing is basically a kung-fu movie with a simple traditional vampire yakuza and the transformed people fighting against the normal yakuza with some unexplained supernatural elements . Basically you should n't expect horror but a slightly weird ( the condensed trailer gives off false expectations ) martial arts movie with yakuza and vampire elements thrown in . It 's decent if you are into that .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,lewronggeneration,"Yes it does , fire attacks of both sides are ineffective against each other and fighting type moves are ineffective against Charizard 's flying type . Sure you can teach Blaziken other moves like Brave Bird , but it will still lose to Charizard , because that attack wo n't have the STAB bonus and also causes recoil damage . A move with no STAB bonus and no super effective damage is worth as much as a STAB move with not very effective status . The lack of the x1.5 bonus evens it out , making none of its moves effective at all . You can also teach it TM80 : Rock Slide , but it 's not a naturally learned move , so I do n't consider it part of the who 's stronger argument .",Uralic,Hungarian

So yeah they are both love it or hate it situation but for completely different reasons .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,manga,"I meant that the art is not on a professional level and he is fully aware that he is n't an artist . I do n't consider paneling a part of that , since that 's very easy to learn and understand even if you are only a reader and proprtions are 101 . I 'm pretty sure it 's not much of that being his stlye , but more like he knows the limits of his skill and he does what he is capable with it . As opposed to that Matsumoto Taiyo and professional artists are excellent in many styles , and end up choosing one or creating their own , a quick google search would prove his brilliance . I did n't compare him to just anyone who picked up a pen , but another professional mangaka , the context for that is very important .",Uralic,Hungarian

I compared him to Matsumoto because that 's how the whole discussion began , your last paragraph is exactly what I was trying to say , that context and the reason for dislike matters a lot .

2kewl4skoool,PS4,"Cool , I loved Fifa Street 2 . The demo is really impressive for a small team , but I think you should try to make the gameplay a faster and snappier and simply more different than FIFA and PES , because honestly it 's impossible to compete with them , that 's why I think realistic football is not the way to go . Instead of an alterEnglish to them , try make the gameplay its own , a small field is not enough for that imo . I recommend putting more arcade elements to it . I think you should focus on multiplayer ( that 's what keeps these games alive afterall ) and make very different game modes , sort of like in Smash Bros you have Final Destination and crazy level with all items . So simply a pure competitive mode ( maybe one with completely default teams and one with the pro clubs ) and another mode that 's more chaotic and fun oriented .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,PS4,"That 's a bad idea . Zero is the perfect starting point and playing 6 without the others wo n't really spoil anything . There is continuity in the series ( a pretty soft one though that frequently negates the ending of the previous game to the status quo for the new game ) , but the story in each game is self contained and perfectly enjoyable in any order . Also these games are huge and very similar , playing them back to back is going to burn you out and make you dislike them . Best to take break for a year or at least few months between them . So just play Zero already .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I expected bland , rehash adaptation and came out pleasently surprised . It had plenty of its original ideas that I appreciated and I found some of the deviations from the manga actually better , like the Mia/Misa character . And the original concept left plenty of room to explore in an alternate take , I found the romance angle to be one of the better ideas . Unfortunately the script was terrible and the execution of these ideas were all around poor . But I still prefer this kind of adaptation , or really more of a new interpretation , than the wast majority of anime adaptations from Japan that stick too much to the source and end up feeling like a shitty cosplay video to me . Comparing it to the manga will of course make it look a lot worse than it actually is , some of those can be excused by the short screentime , but not in this case . They completely fucked up the mindgames and they have no excuse for that . Light ended up being a completely average kid while L was just a pretend-genius , with most of his investigation being skimmed over and just dumped at you . A mediocre but interesting movie .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,4chan,"It 's not good , but I respect that it 's not just a shitty cosplay recreation , like most adaptations , but an alternate take with new ideas , and I actually preferred the new Misa plotline ( it made an twisted romance angle with loser Light ) . However all those ideas were poorly executed because the script was awful . They also fucked up the core of the series , cat and mouse mindgames . Every character was dumb , especially Light who only had one master plan at the very end , which was hoaky shit , the kind you would never see in the manga . I still appreciated it for at least trying .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"It 's as good as the player makes it out to be . The core is basic , it 's a traditional beat em up afterall , but it has a huge range of moves that you will only see if you go out of your way to do them . Most people who dislike it play on a lower difficulty and if the bosses are pushovers there is little incentive and pressure for exploring everything the game has to offer , especially defense and counters and end up using only a few moves that get the job done the fastest . The only big fault it has is that the flow of the combat is a little off and breaks too frequently . But it 's very impactful and for Fist of the North Star that might be the most important aspect .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I doubt that 's the case , it 's just a new chapter that 's first being introdueced with the mobile game , and according to the new characters bio on the Gematsu article the series will still take place in Kamurocho and continue the same timeline . I also do n't ever see them doing a timeskip , they only did that for the prequel story of Zero and some short flashback scenes , every mainline game takes places at its release year , and so will the new one , the bio says 2018 . I doubt we will ever play as one of the old characters again but they will be very likely to show up , however even 6 had very few returning characters , that 's why I also think a `` 7th '' game is unlikely .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"HNK definetily will be , it 's really popular or at least recognizable in many countries , that IP paired with finally a good production can be far more successful internationally than any of the Yakuza games have been so far .

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"True , it failed at establishing him as the villain in the actual games , but to me it did it in the histrorical aspect of the series through recontextualising the early games .

I do urge everyone to watch the short , self contained ones , like War in the Pocket and 08th MS team and if they really loved it then give it a try , but even as the die-hard UC fan I am , the kind that loves even ZZ , I do n't think 99 % of the people in this subreddit have the tolerance to watch through the entirety of any of the original series , much less the whole timeline . With the drawn out format and Tomino 's strange scripts ( plot at a snails pace while characterisation is frantic ) I ca n't say it with confidence that they are even great anime . Influential and special , absolutely , but not something that must be seen . Same goes for the alternate universe , modern series . Turn A and 00 are probably the safest recommendations , Mobile Fighter G Gundam must be fun for all though .

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"While that 's true I think that might be because of the circumstances .

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"That 's true . I guess the two reason I do n't see it happening is because of the brutal violence and also because I have n't seen or read any Japanese crime stories , serious fiction , non-fiction or documentary that involved any women actively . While the Yakuza series has plenty of zany stuff in it , they always tried to stay as grounded as possible in the core of it , I just do n't think they would have a lady beat up dozens of gangsters in a dramatic story ( it has happened in the last game but it was played up mostly for comedy in a narratively unrelated arc ) .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"I 'm Hungarian and we really do n't have the western kinds of leftists . The opposition is barely left and has no identity or larger agenda besides being the opposition and far left is just of the bleeding heart kind and they are completely irrelevant politically with zero power , and in contrast our actual and real far right party is pretty popular . Also I 'm a university student in the capital , Budapest with a population of 2 million and I have NEVER seen a trans person . That should tell you a lot how right everything on our political spectrum is .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"That 's a shame . At least Estonia is not a prime migrant target ( from how I saw ) so you can still have hope that the identity politics will inevitebly implode on themselves without serious consequences unlike in the west .

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"They will never do that because it 's pretty much unlocalizable . Most of the writing requires so much historical knowledge and antiquated language , so much so they even needed to have built in dictionary for the dialogue box . Even if they gave it a shot it just would n't be worth it . Also it came out 3 and a half years ago , before Zero and Kiwami , it 's time to give up any hope .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,horror,"Looks well done , but at the same time I 'm very disappointed . After the Pan 's Labyrinth Del Toro 's works became very safe and by the numbers and they relied too much on already established stories and ideas . Pacific Rim ended up good , but Crimson Peak was incredible dull and derivative . To me unfortunately this seems just like that too . I hope it ends up being more , but this trailer showed nothing original . It seemingly spoiled the whole story too and it seems like the most predictable and cliche monster movie from the 50s . At least visually it 's looking excellent , as expected from him .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"The anime is fun but drawn out and both narratively and artistically old school to a fault , however it has amazing atmosphere and the hypest soundtrack . Have only given a quick check to the manga , but that is stylistically different . Anime is pure Go Nagai , manga is more like Go Nagai tribute with modern take . Also I do n't think much of the manga was translated , so the anime is the only way . Oh and do NOT watch the first episode . It 's like a retarded preview that spoils the whole series and the twist .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"I think it could work . They could introduce her as an unbeatable force with a monster streak , the next big thing who would define an entire era , by an authority figure who immediately gives her a title shot at the next PPV . For a month they would hype it up , giving her only small segments , contract signing brawls , all the usual , but no in ring matches , essentially making her victory seem guaranteed . But at the title match she would lose quickly in a fucky finish , without ruining credibility . After that she would demand a rematch which she is not granted , and instead told to fight her way up the ladder from the very bottom , making her go through mini feuds one after another destroying everyone in her way .",Uralic,Hungarian

But that 's just me making assumptions , other than this it looks awesome .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"That 's not how the game works . For some reason the devs just insist on calling those endings when they are not , just major turns in the narrative there is only one ending . Route A is the first `` playthrough '' , it 's about half the game . Route B is the same as A but from the perspective of a different character ( still largly same , but a lot faster playthrough ) , the rest of the routes/endings are just continuation of the story . With one true ending . Also all routes share the progress and after B or C you unlock a chapter select too . It 's hardly tedious .",Uralic,Hungarian

It 's still no big deal , I 'll just make a UK account and use the 14day trial to play it , but I wish I got to keep the game on my account .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SRW,"Hey people ! I 'm not sure which version I should get . On the PS4 the animation looks incredible , but I prefer to play these type of games on handheld whenever possible . However I have found absolutely no Vita footage . Does the performance and the art quality ( for a lower resolution of course ) hold up , or at least decent ?",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,adultswim,"I was trying to finish the second tournament only to find out the whole season was removed from Youtube ( the first one is still on ) . I ca n't find any news about this , and its adultswim page is empty too . Does anyone know anything about this and an alternate way to watch it ?",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,PlayStationPlus,"Only the PS3 version , so giving away the PS4 version is very possible . This happens sometimes , recent example is Limbo , was offered multiple times , but for different versions ( even in different regions ) .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,manga,"It was 10 out of 10 in Golden Age arc , then the series started to have a major identity crisis paired with bad execution . First of all , it got too schlocky . With the conviction arc it lost all subtelty and turned embarassingly edgy . Same goes for the violence . It lost all restraint , that retroactively cheapened so much of the impact of previous event . Like you look at the Eclipse again and think how lucky Casca is that she was only raped by handsome demon boy instead of gangbanged to death by a bunch of repulsive trolls . Miura instead of knowing when to go all out or restrain himself he tries to balances it out with even more comedy . Now half the cast is comic relief . Obviously those characters are also there to help Guts keep his humanity , but once again , no restraint and too many unfitting gags , and to me it completely ruins the atmosphere . Then we have some rule of cool stuff , like the Berserker Armor , with its own classic risk-reward mechanics that feel straight out of a shonen battle manga . It is badass , but it personally feels a little out of place . My biggest problem is the plot and mainly its narrative structure . You already know the end point , and the destination of the series , you are excited to get there but the plot seems to stop and get sidetracked with its long story arc format . With other long running series , like One Piece ( I know , not the most comparable ) the heavily segmented story telling does n't get in the way and makes you impatient because the endgame is n't obvious , and you still feel excited for every event , and how it could shape the world , I never have that feeling with Berserk .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Puts too much stock into the big 3 meme , ignores details behind the sales number , interprets trends and weekly ranking system wrong or at least not accurately , does n't know the current and previous lineup just randomly mentions few ( some that were n't even good and got cancelled fast ) , downplayes the huge success of their sports and gag mangas , brushing off one of their biggest recent hits that was Assassination Classrom ( Toriko did fine too ) , the big success of the other Jump magazines branching out to other demographics , anime centric viewpoint while they are just basically ads ... A lot . It just seemed like a video with an overly deductive approach , like he already had a conclusion in mind so he only presented the stuff that would confirm his view .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,Thankfully it was `` quickly '' fixed by Bluepoint who was brought in just for patching it . That team is seriously so good at remasters everyone should just hire for them to do theirs . I guess Konami ca n't fuck that up again because the groundwork has been laied already .,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"It 's just another enhanced version of the 2nd game ( or really an enhanced port of the previous enhanced port ) , not much room to fuck up .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Yeah , it 's just a coping mechanism for being shitty . It does n't matter if you are waste because you are small and inconsequential anyway . It 's also interested how it got this cool kid image attached to it in entertainment recently , it 's almost like someboy has something to gain from making you feel small and never question moral relativism . Really gets your noggin joggin .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I was half joking , you know . But there is plenty of nihilism in adult animation and comedy nowadays , usually portrayed and glorified as intellectuality and even if it is n't fans interpret it that way . Like Rick in R & amp ; M is written as a piece of shit wreck of a man , yet many fans see him as the opposite . & gt ; People do n't just eat up whatever entertainment industries throw at them . You are giving way too much credit to the average person , especially in the age when escapism is at its peak and people look at pop culture like its their religion .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"But Nietzsche was also completely against it , he saw it as a poisonous state of mind , an obstacle in existence that needs to be overcome by adopting/creating productive values .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"They are basically the members of an indie game dev clique , the kind that brings identity politics into everything , and gives special thanks to Sarkeesian and her crowd in the credit section of their game .

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Even if he could n't write a script for shit at least Lucas tried new , ambitious and more complex ideas than the same old rehashed very good guys vs very bad guys stuff that was Force Awakens . What ruined the prequels is that he was surrounded by yesmen , and that it was a personal project of his , not a safe and calculated product of a corporate think thank .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,It 's 100 % just leftover from initial testing of their new game .,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Her venom also got the hell-mark later , so now she has a demonic symbiote that can summon demons .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"The combat is fantastic , but I found the writing unremarkable and just incredibly generic , but not bad by any means .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"That large cast sounds and looks cool , but I already feel tedium at the same time . I hope Vanillaware does something more creative structurally than simply making us replay the same game 13 times , like they usually do .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Do n't be . Until the New World it 's a legitimately excellent anime that uses every advantage of the medium to enhance an already fantastic mange . For a long time it had great pacing too for about 400 episodes , with an average 3 chapters per episode which is incredible , now it 's only 1 . For comparison 's sake BnHA only adapts 2 most of the time , and in its first season that average was about only one and a half chapters . So the OP anime was really well done for its genre .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That 's not how shonen series work though , sure there is an overarching plot , but each arc tells a self contained and conlcusive story which alone I find way more compelling than the vast majority of one or two cour animes out there . Though that 's only true for the better long running series , like One Piece . Bleach starts rehashing the same arcs again and again real soon .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Most modern animes with cheap and lazy digital animation looks like shit compared to those . They have some of the most legendary artists of the industry behind them , they became timeless classics for a reason .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That does n't add a correct statistic though , I only looked at canon episodes , there are a lot of single episode fillers and character specific recaps especially early on and after each arc . But most canon episodes have at worst 2 , and at best even 4 chapters adapted .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I guess I 'm the only one who outright dislikes it , though I barely played more than an hour . The parry ruins it for me , it 's overused and makes the game way too easy , worst of all you must use it too because of the charging moves of enemies so it 's not a mechanic you can ignore . The idea of having to defeat 40 of the same metroids is already tiresome . The map design is sometimes tedious and does n't flow as well as the previous ones . The graphics are great but I dislike this ancient cave theme , I prefer the futuristic look . The analog controls are great for 360 aiming but feel off for platforming , unfortunately its not customizable . It 's not bad , but the raving reviews sure made this really disappointing for me .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That 's interesting because Jump really wants to push it as the next Naruto , going with Pierrot made me think that it would be long running too . I 'm kinda disappointed because we have n't really had one in a some time , and I think only 13 episodes will give it a very bad first impression and stigma because the beginning is very derivative and formulaic .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,That does make me feel a little bit better about it .,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"But Black Clover is the worst to have a test run on , plenty of people have grown to like it , but there are n't many in the community who did n't get a bad first impression from it .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Yeah , I forgot what really matters , in Japan it 's always done pretty well in the Jump rankings .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Also it 's just a 40 dollar budget game . I do n't think it looks graphically bad , just very dull . The texture quality is pretty good if not beter than some full priced games and many Japanese games . But the art design is really tainting it .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"Yeah , not only did he have two daughters , but he fucked them too !",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"I feel like even the manga started to suffer from this but in the opposite way . Ever since the anime has been dangerously close to catching up , so since about New World , Oda started rushing , cramming too much into every panel and every page . Rarely lets the story and the reader breath to take in the atmosphere and the art . Not like the chapters were ever light , but I feel like they got way too busy .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"Even worse , a lot of times it was just vacated and gifted . The Heavymetalweight champions at least pin the previous ones .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"We do n't realize how good we have it ( at least in the sense that we can get distracted easily if not overstimulated ) and compared to it how dull and bleak the past was just some decades ago . This is also apparent when you approach it from the other end of the spectrum . In the 30s there was the famous Hungarian suicide song called Gloomy Sunday which was immediately linked to dozens of suicides , these were only claims and pretty much urban legends , but this only paints a more striking picture of the era , because even though it was most likely complete bullshit they did not take any chances and banned the song .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,movies,"Paranormal Activity Budget : 15,000 USD , Box office : 193 million USD But yeah , those are two very similar movies that hit the cultural jackpot and this is not something anyone should consciously aim to do .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"This was like something straight out of the 80 's , both the animation , in the best sense , and writing , in both the best and worst . The writing was extremely rushed , shallow and childish , so do n't except original concepts , great promos or much creativity . It really felt like it was written by an 8 year old kid , in the first few minutes we witnessed a bear getting bodyslammed in the air upside down and then a guy gut straight up murdered , only for the whole thing to be followed by ancient wrestling cliches with sensless booking . However on the other hand this really has a fun , dumb , campy charm to it . The action was weird too . Started with over the top moves , then later it attempted more realism with a series of head and chinlocks and grounded wrestling , but not even that felt like a cohesive match , just random moves . At least it looked really cool . So all in all we will have to wait longer for a decent wrestling anime ( depending on what you want out of one ) , but we might have just gotten an awesome old-school throwback anime instead . I 'll definitely keep watching it .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,Such a shame . He went from having a five star iron man match with Adam Cole in PWG to barely getting any chance other than a few one or two minute squashes in his whole 3 years of NXT with a completely gimped moveset .,Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,horror,Really loved the first 80 % of the movie . Felt extremely realistic and every individual zombie was an actually terrifying threat .

2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,I 'm from there too . Crazies are the same everywhere . You stick a camera in their face and they either go apeshit or spout their madness because they just got someone to listen and a platform .

Seriously there are single HxH panels with more writing than an entire Bleach chapter .,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Me too , but I loved the second . The first one bored me and all the episodes felt samey , but most of the episodes in the second season are very unique . I recommend checking out the 3rd and 8th episode , they are directed by Masaaki Yuasa and Yasuhiro Nakura , also they are one of the few episodes that do n't even try to be a comedy , just a very compelling piece of animation . S2E04 ( the musical episode ) and S2E09 ( dancing with alien Travolta ) are also really fun . The season ended really well , if you have the time it 's worth watching .",Uralic,Hungarian

It has several fighting styles with their own skill trees , two characters , dozens of contextual moves and a bunch of weapons . It has a lot of options and it 's the kind of system that 's as good as creative you get with it . Gameplay videos are often not representative .

The same thing is going on ( except for the initial third party involvment ) with the long development and major changes in it , and I ca n't help but feel like SE will once again release a completely unfinished game because of the bloated costs , expecting to sell on name alone . Granted , I 'm assuming a lot too , as we do n't know exactly why the development shift happened , how much CC2 has already done and if that will be scrapped at all to start over or continued where they left off .

I am currently watching the original Gundam and Kinnikuman and absolutely love the old-school art , in my opinion it 's very charming , all hand drawn and nostalgic , mainly because I grew up on Captain Tsubasa in the 90s .

It 's good for the classic survival horrors like RE 1,2,3 but not so much for this game , not needed and a lot more awkward than usual .

It 's only 7 more episodes , 2 and a half hour is not a big additional time investment so go for it . Also the first four eps do n't represent the rest of the show accurately , it changes and evolves a lot by the end and focuses less on the sport and more on the characters .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,I 'm just saying that those 4 episodes do n't reflect the rest of the series at all . It 's about the payoff . Those couple of episodes are a lot better time investment than the whole series of Cross Ange or Aldnoah.Zero or most of this season for example .,Uralic,Hungarian

A language spreads because of the prestige associated with it *but* language use is based on mutual accommodation : the language you speak is secondary to the actual things you 're trying to say . This creates a snowball effect and since you 've already got more than 1.5 billion people speaking English to various degrees and an enormous amount of data and information available only in English , we are no longer in a position where people speak a particular language because it 's *cool* to do so -- English has become a language that serves a utilitarian goal ( rather than a social one ) above all else , and changing this status will require a lot more than the emergence of a new superpower .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,news,"For what it 's worth , I think it should . And it is . There is no *hate speech exception* to the First Amendment *per se* . What you 're referring to is [ Brandenburg v. Ohio ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio ) , and that one case clearly defines what forms of expression are illegal . The problem with banning speech that is *hateful* towards a certain group is that only speech that is offensive , polarizing and/or subjective needs protection . & gt ; Should we not protect minority groups from obvious hate in our society ? No , we should not , if this means creating extra rules just to accommodate these groups . What we should do is treat minorities like the citizens that they are . That means they are ( or should be ) entitled to free speech and all the rights everyone else enjoys . A necessary consequence of this is that they might have to listen to speech that 's potentially offensive to them . & gt ; If you think hate speech can be subjective then why do n't you think normal crime can be subjective ? Normal crime *can* be subjective , that 's what we have the court system for . The whole purpose of its existence is that people disagree over whether certain acts constitute a crime or not . Also , *hate speech* is not a legal term in the US so there 's literally no weight to that statement . The problem with hate speech is *precisely* that the definition is to flexible to suit any particular agenda . Moreover , if you define hate speech as *all forms of speech that attacks someone on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation* ( which is the Wikipedia definition ) , you basically end up with a bunch highly polarizing issues where no matter what you do or what you say , you will end up offending someone ( and the PC police strikes down , etc. , etc. ) . This is precisely what happened here . If you mention that the shooter 's Muslim , you might accidentally offend Muslim individuals . If you say something pro-LGBT , that will be offensive to at least some Christians/Muslims/anti-LGBT people . Just let people say what they want to say .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Yes , but he probably meant to say that certain languages are more apt for expressing yourself , either because of personal preference ( i.e . having a broader vocabulary for a specific domain of life ) or lack of sufficient/widely-used vocabulary in one of the languages . These things also factor into language death , not having good enough words being one of the most important problems a language user can have , especially if there are competing languages within a person 's community .

They would still encrypt their data using available encryption algorithms and continue to not give a fuck . Even in the US where cryptography was an army munition until the 90s , many managed to smuggle encryption out of the States and there were lots tech-savvy people who used `` illegal '' ( too strong ) encryption . The only people who would be worse off would be ordinary , law-abiding citizens who would not have the opportunity to protect their data online .",Uralic,Hungarian

It 's just that ISIS does this on a much larger scale than anything else in the modern age .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,AskReddit,"Sure , but the constant term does n't matter in the end . Yes , if you have a small input size , you might want to use an algorithm that runs in O ( 2^n ) time with a small constant term as opposed to something with O ( n^2 ) and a huge constant term , but the former wo n't scale well , the latter will . In the end , that constant wo n't matter . If you have an algorithm that solves things in P1 ( x ) = x^^2 + 10^^39 time and another that does the same thing in P2 ( x ) = 2^^x time , even though P2 might work a lot better for small inputs , this trend will always change ( in this case , at around x=130 ) . Also , the constant term can be easily overlooked because advances in computer engineering will create new hardware that will be able to do operations much more quickly , essentially eliminating any disadvantage caused by the constant factor . This is something that you ca n't rely on in NP algorithms , they 're slow and their slowness `` scales '' incredibly well . The constant term is also influenced by the programming language the algorithm is coded in and a ton of other things as well , so it 's a moot point to talk about it , the asymptotic complexity is intrinsic to the algorithm , the `` actual '' time complexity is n't . An n-bit encryption algorithm has 2^n possible keys . If a government developed a computer that could calculate every single possible key , you could simply make n bigger , which is trivial and easy to do on your part but makes their job exponentially harder ( they would have to compute 2^2n = 4^n keys ) . If there were a polynomial algorithm to make this process easier , simply increasing the size of the key would n't solve problem because the algorithms would generally scale well enough to make any potential increase in key size insignificant . TL ; DR : it would n't break everything , but it would n't take long for everything to eventually break",Uralic,Hungarian

Also , if the content we 're talking about is in English , it has to be translated ( dubbed or subtitled ) first . This is often overlooked but there 's a *minimum* 6-month delay simply because of having to translate the first season into the local language before it can be aired on TV . I distinctly remember watching a trailer for a new season of a TV show when I was like 13 . The whole trailer seemed strangely familiar , then I realized I 'd seen every single episode of that season *1.5 years before* . And let 's not even talk about how certain shows like *Last Week Tonight* do n't have an adequate following for cable networks to even *consider* bringing them overseas .

6i7kh,worldnews,"I 'm not from Germany but I am European . Ethnicity is subjective . An ethnic group is a group of people who identify with each other based on ancestry , culture , religion , language , etc . Now , let 's be clear , your ethnicity *is* inherited and ca n't usually be changed . The problem is that the definition is designed to be ambiguous - you said *you 're a German because you 're a descendant of Germans* , sure , but you still do n't have a good enough base case . If it 's racial , a huge percentage of the German population would n't be *German* even if they 're perceived by other members of the community as such . Yes , it 's going to be impossible for a Caucasian person to immigrate to Japan and get the population to accept them as Japanese ( because of differences in culture , religion , language , country of origin and national identity ) . However , the same person 's great-granddaughter or great-grandson will probably be Japanese , simply because the whole definition is based on being accepted by other people who are perceived ( by other members ) as belonging to the same ethnic group . If your family tree has a lot of people associated with Japan by Japanese individuals , the fact that you had a great-grandfather who came to Japan from the USA does n't actually matter at all . I chose this example because the situation of Turkish immigrants in Germany is quite similar . The problem 's that if you take away some of the differences between these groups , the whole thing becomes a lot less obvious . In Austria-Hungary in the early 1900s , for example , a lot of residents were neither Austrian nor Hungarian and a huge percentage of the population of Budapest was not Hungarian at all . Even today , having a Germanic or Slavic last name is incredibly common and has absolutely nothing to do with one 's national identity .",Uralic,Hungarian

Also , cultural integration is by definition circular in that you 're considered integrated if other integrated people consider you integrated . However , simply claiming that you ca n't possibly become *German* if you do n't have a family tree dating back to the Roman Empire is incredibly stupid in my opinion .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"My German is not that great , but *Fahrvergnügen* is simply a compound word meaning `` driving pleasure '' . I think this is not a good example because I do n't care whether a single thought is expressed by a compound word or a structure like `` driving pleasure '' . I do n't have to paraphrase , I just have to use two words instead of one . Now , if I wanted to emphasize the Volkswagen connotation that this word carries , `` driving pleasure '' obviously would n't work and I would be frustrated . In fact , in Hungarian , a language with a lot of compound words , the appropriate expression is *vezetési élmény* , again , two words , but no paraphrasing needed , this concept is mapped to a collocation that 's as apt as the single German word for the same quality . There 's a lot of cases where a language might be more verbose in certain situations : *french lesson* is *franciaóra* in Hungarian , *Französischstunde* in German but *урок французского языка* ( urok frantsuzskogo yazyka , lit . : lesson of the French language ) in Russian . If there is a better/shorter way to say this in Russian , please let me know . I guess a better example would be *Schadenfreude* ( *káröröm* in Hungarian ) . If English had n't borrowed this word from German , I would have to explain it to people with a long-winded sentence like `` you know , that feeling when someone 's misfortune makes you happy '' , because there would n't be an appropriate expression that would invoke the same feelings as any of these words . There 's other , overly specific words like this in every language that are culturally distinct and ca n't be effectively translated without a loss of meaning . This is , again , not due to the *language* being inferior , but it can hinder communication and make you frustrated if you have an abstract idea that you know a perfectly good expression for in , say , English , but ca n't appropriately express it in German without a lengthy explanation . You can either code switch , simply use the word and make yourself understood if you 're talking to bilinguals *or* you can start explaining what you mean in the original language . I would probably go insane if I had to type all this in German because of my German vocabulary ( or lack thereof ) .

6i7kh,programming,"I happen to know the guy , he was taken by police , his house was searched , his phone was cloned , he was fingerprinted , mugshots were taken , he was questioned and then let go . I do n't know what you would call this but it 's definitely far from voluntary action . What happened here ( known as an *előállítás* in Hungarian* ) is equivalent to an arrest in common law countries . There 's basically three types of detention here , this particular one is most commonly done when someone is reasonably suspected to have committed a serious crime . It can theoretically be extended for like a day . After that , by default , you are free to go ( similar to the bail system , but you do n't pay ) , unless the prosecutor has an indictment and wants to lock you up until the trial but that has to approved by a judge . The second one ( known as an *elővezetés* in Hungarian** ) is the one you get if you do n't appear in court or do n't show up at the police station when you are summoned . Police will simply show up at your door and enforce the summons . The third one is what 's more appropriately called a Terry stop ( per Terry v. Ohio ) in the US . The problem is that this process is only used for serious offenders in Hungary . For most other cases you 're just sent a letter to appear for interrogation at a police station in connection with a crime , police wo n't take you anywhere normally in most cases , this sort of procedure is usually reserved for serious criminals where telling them that they 're suspects would pose a threat to prosecution ( flight , witness manipulation , etc. ) . This is what the outrage is over . You are normally summoned for interrogation where you may have your mugshots taken and fingerprinted , then you are free to go until you get another letter to appear in court for your trial ( or the police might tell you to show up for another interrogation in between ) , and then if you are convicted and you have to spend time in jail you may actually still go home and stay for a while until they send you another letter to show up in jail to start your sentence .

That has a negative effect on your eye 's ability to accommodate the lense 's focus by bending it to see things that are far away from each other quickly . This causes you just `` default '' to blurry vision ( which is like the thousand yard stare ) . You can also get double vision which is basically due to your brain not being able to move your eyeballs precisely , hence the twitching that causes the double vision .

6i7kh,nottheonion,"Well , I ca n't really answer the first question , but the SMTP server is run by the government , whereas HTTPS uses TLS , which should mean that your communication is ( well , depending on the system used , but most definitely in the case of Twitter ) end-to-end encrypted .

Edit : yes , I understand that you *can* intercept HTTPS traffic like that , hence my disclaimer , in this case being applied to Twitter instead of the US gov't . But to my knowledge he is n't necessarily using a US government network to send tweets all the time . Setting up a proxy to do so is n't really doing a lot to comply with this law .

I tested out of all the ESL modules in my first year because the class was just too easy and I wanted to study a third language instead ( testing out in your first year is n't normally done here but me wanting to study another language on my own justified that ) .

However , you have to consider that NASA missions require a lot more precision and you ca n't just treat everything like a two body system . After that it does get a LOT more complex . He even mentions how these new `` computing machines '' can do that sort of work a lot faster . Also , trajectories are a lot more involved than orbits and this was a time when computers were also programmed using punched cards or even more rudimentary methods . I am not a historian but I would assume , based on Feyman 's notes , that people used electronic computers mostly for doing arithmetic more quickly rather than for pure automation .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Jeez , you would think you could make deductions about elementary ratios on Reddit without someone bringing up *calculus* and what the limit of 1/x is . First of all , I would claim that x/0 being undefined is the same thing as `` ca n't do it '' when you 're on reddit , because I 'm not doing a proof or a derivation or anything , it 's just common parlance . An operation being undefined means it is not valid to perform that operation and if you 're talking about anything practical that is basically the same thing as `` you ca n't do it '' . The same way my high school math teacher did n't say that a quadratic equation has two , one or zero REAL roots instead of just `` roots '' . And , since probabilities are strictly non-negative , yes , in this case , it makes sense to intuitively say that since zero times anything is zero , there is infinite better chance of something happening than if you did n't do anything at all . If we 're talking about a strictly negative quantity , the same thought process leads to the same conclusion . Division by zero being undefined has nothing to do with whether there 's two limits because even if the limit was just infinity/minus infinity it would n't make sense to talk about the limit as the actual answer to the division , and no one actually said anything about the limit of a function or a series , so this is not relevant at all . I 'm not trying to differentiate 1/x at zero . I 'm not trying to calculate the limit at zero . I 'm just making an observation about ratios . The fact that zero as a base value for a ratio does n't make sense is the reason for both of these statements .",Uralic,Hungarian

It seemed completely natural to support it and it was applauded by almost every developed country in Europe as well as the U.S . It makes sense , and it actually *works* , both in theory and in practice . Unfortunately , the reason eugenics got such a bad rep was because of Nazism and that Nazi scientists used the eugenics programs of Allied countries as a defense . Not because of its huge potential for abuse by governments , its reprehensible attitude towards human rights , and the fallout that happens later on as genetic diversity drops . Now most people think that something like this is wrong because the Nazis did it , conveniently forgetting about all the other countries that also participated because it seemed rational to do so .

6i7kh,explainlikeimfive,"Because , for most batteries , there is no surefire way to measure `` battery percentage '' . A battery is basically a series of chemical reactions that move charged particles from one terminal to the other , creating electricity . How many particles move in between the terminals ( the rate of the chemical reaction ) depends on a number of factors , and it 's far from being constant ( including temperature , the current battery percentage , and how much current your device is drawing at the moment ) . This means that a battery 's discharge pattern is non-linear , going from 12V to 11V does n't take as much time as going from 11V to 10V or 5V to 4V . You either have a system that is non-linear and not very useful ( going from 20 % to 5 % would take as fast as going from 100 % to 90 % , for example ) , or a system that 's mostly linear and not very accurate . Now , most LiOn batteries use a different system called `` coulomb counting '' . When the factory releases a battery , it comes with two `` states '' that correspond to how much charge the battery has , which correspond to 100 % and 0 % . When you 're using your battery , the system looks at how much current your battery supplies and it converts it into charge , which it matches against the pre-set values . When your phone is charging , the same thing happens . The issue with this is that some of the current is converted into heat and will not be used to charge your battery . Also , batteries tend to discharge on their own even if no outside current is drawn . Meaning , these measurements will drift , resulting in situations where if you have n't fully discharged your batteries in a while you might run out of juice at 10 % or you might be able to use your phone for an hour at 1 % .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,AskReddit,"No , not really . I 'm gon na have to correct this a bit since I know a lot of people have a pretty mistaken view of this matter . The special theory of relativity is based on the fact that every inertial system ( roughly , a frame of reference moving at a constant speed ) is equivalent . If you 're inside one , you get the same experimental results as the guy in the other system . Therefore , both you , an observer in a car and the guy on the ground can claim that they 're stationary or that they 're moving at 80mph relative to you . If you 're inside the frame , you ca n't conduct an experiment that 'll tell you how fast you 're going because all experiments have the same results in all inertial frames . The only thing you can do is measure your speed relative to another frame ( in this case , the ground ) , but that 's going to be relative because you *assume* that that inertial frame is stationary . The point is that it does n't matter whether you 're moving at 80mph and the ground is stationary or you 're stationary and the ground is moving at 80mph . Looking out the window is not an option , because both are equally possible and there 's no point arguing about which is true , because they are *both correct* and *equivalent* : crashing into a wall at 80 is still going to kill you the exact same way . Now this , combined with the fact that light moves at the same speed in all inertial frames is what causes all that weirdness . Both are pretty easy to wrap your head around but the implications are huge . TL ; DR : both the ground and you can move and it does n't make a difference . edit : typoz",Uralic,Hungarian

You can still be deported and you ca n't vote and you ca n't have a US passport .

6i7kh,videos,"It is formally allowed , each country sets its own rules with regards to its own naturalization process . The fact that you have to renounce all previous allegiances is simply the wording of the oath . The thing you have to realize is that a country 's view of you as a citizen is n't dependent on the views of other countries . The US can consider you a citizen while the UK considers you a citizen as well and both are valid unless one country decides not to allow dual nationality . It 's a diplomatic mess , for example if you happen to be the national of both the US and a country that is engaged in hostilities with the US and you are enlisted in the army of one ( or both ) of the countries , it can be a pretty shitty diplomatic situation . I had to explain this particular point to a dual citizen once , he thought that he would lose his US citizenship if he got conscripted into our army , which is not normally the case . Also , it becomes very difficult for the US embassy to protect you in a country that you 're a citizen of ( if you 're a UK-US dual citizen and you get arrested in the UK , you are not entitled to any consular aid or protection ) . There are other restrictions on becoming a minister , a prime minister or a president of another nation and you have to travel on your US passport when leaving or entering the US , but that 's it really . As for the supreme court rulings you asked for , the most important one is [ Vance v. Terrazas ] ( https : //supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/252/case.html ) , which says that *In establishing loss of citizenship , the Government must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship , not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation . * In that ruling , Justice Stevens explicitly mentioned that the US accepts dual citizenship . Also , read [ this State Department website ] ( http : //travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-and-dual-nationality.html ) about this issue . So , yeah , the US does n't give a fuck about who you pledge allegiance to once you 're a US citizen . However , these laws deal with the issue of a US citizen getting another nationality **after** acquiring US citizenship , which is not what you need . You have to make sure that you do n't lose your other nationality after acquiring US citizenship . You have to ask the US State Department or the government of your own country if becoming a US citizen results in the loss of your other nationality . Usually , if both countries have dual nationality laws ( e.g . Germany does n't ) , it should n't be an issue . Edit : typos & amp ; formatting",Uralic,Hungarian

The application was actually related to gaming ( edit : just for clarification , it was hobby work , nothing commercial and I was the only one actively contributing to the project , and I had about 9-10 testers who were also volunteers ) and the server would shut down , sometimes with no players , sometimes with 50 players , sometimes in 1 minute , sometimes in 3 days . It took me nearly 8 months to finally find what caused the error ( unfortunately , the platform I worked with was apparently built in a shed in 2 weeks cause it had no debugger or anything like that ) . Just to demonstrate how obscure these bugs can be : In the end , the bug turned out to be caused by a bug fix I did because the network engine was bugged beyond belief but it was closed-source so I could n't edit it . I did a couple of quick fixes but some of the bugs I fixed in the code were later fixed by the people who wrote the netcode . The only thing in the changelog corresponding to the version that fucked up my code was `` minor fixes regarding xxxx '' which did n't raise much suspicion . This resulted in code that was no longer doing what it was supposed to thanks to the bug fix that fixed the bug that I did a fix for . It was a time bomb that would set off every now and then and kill the whole server . Imagine the same situation with a code base that 's a lot bigger than mine . edit : typos & amp ; stuff",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,movies,"I 've been speaking English from a very young age and yes , it does not make any sense to me either , but the point I was trying to make is that , in the end , learning other languages sucks just as well , and so you want to make sure you learn the one that motivates you the most .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,movies,"& gt ; If you do n't respect the law , which you clearly do n't , I do n't know how you 've come to that conclusion . The only thing I said is that I will choose an alterEnglish that has a better user experience . I have never claimed that I would ever download a movie protected by copyright . Which , by the way , would be legal in my country so long as I do n't share my copy with someone else . & gt ; Why not use Webster 's , dictionary.com , or the Oxford dictionary ? Because any definition that explains *stealing* has to first define what *property* and *own* means . If you consider someone 's intellectual property *property* , then , yes , downloading movies *is* technically stealing . However , let me remind you that most people , when this topic is brought up , use loaded language like & gt ; '' It is inconvenient for me to purchase your products , therefore I am going to steal them . '' to juxtapose downloading a movie with walking into a store and stealing a physical copy , which is n't the same thing , neither legally nor *morally* . You either claim that it was only your intellectual property you were deprived of , or you need to stop using the well-known damages = ( # of copies downloaded ) * ( value of DVD/BR ) formula when you start a lawsuit . You ca n't have it both ways . Wording like this implies that it is the actual *product* that 's stolen , which is not true . You do n't steal physical objects or even information when you download a movie illegally . The only thing you steal is someone 's intellectual property , but saying that would n't be as good a deterrent as calling pirates *thieves* .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,movies,"Okay . If you think downloading movies is stealing , how come people who download films illegally do n't get charged with theft ? Why did the US have to come up with a completely different law in order to enforce copyright laws if they could just charge people under the same law that protects a store from people who want to rob them of their stock . edit : typo",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"Can absolutely confirm . I 'm not saying this is an acceptable answer or that it should be an excuse , but to all the other people out there , imagine finding a bug like this . You basically find a possible reason , you test it ( you and probably a couple of other guys from Valve who are not dedicated testers ) and repeat if it does n't work . This also applies to other kinds of software , not just video games . After the fifty millionth fucking testing session for almost every update , you **burn out** pretty quickly . You probably wo n't be able to comprehend how fucking annoying a 12-hour debug session can be and how you wo n't be able to enjoy your game after being forced to do the same menial task for as long as it takes , but it makes you want to throw the fucking game out of the window in most cases and burnout is a real thing in software development . This also means you will want to work on something different ( which Valve allows ) to regain your motivation .",Uralic,Hungarian

User experience matters . Just look at YTS , Netflix , Hulu , Popcorn Time , Steam or any of various other entertainment-based platforms and you 'll see what I mean .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,movies,"Learning English is like becoming a country . The only requirement for becoming a country is other countries recognizing you as a country . What kind of other countries ? Well , those that are recognized by other countries ... you get the point . The only reason people learn English is that others learn it as well .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Grammatically , yes . However , you need to think of this as a legal definition : The jury proves you guilty if they are certain , beyond the shadow of a doubt , that you committed a crime .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"Yes , if only it was that simple . Sometimes updates which have nothing to do with a given system cause bugs in that very system through some complex chain of modules .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"I wanted to reply with a longer comment but /u/c4boom13 explained it pretty well . Generally speaking , if the code 's complex , old or hard to maintain , throwing money and resources at it wo n't make it any better , in fact , it can become counterproductive . This phenomenon is called Brooks ' law ( e : [ wiki ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks % E2 % 80 % 99_law ) ) and it 's pretty well explained in The Mythical Man-Month , a very good book on software engineering . You need people with familiarity with the code base who can reliably test and fix things and that only comes with experience . Edit : also , I 'd like to add that reports like *the AWP feels a bit weird lately* or *a lot of my recent shots have n't been registered properly* are n't of much help , these can be caused by a wide variety of modules/issues so the problem is n't specific enough to be worked with . Anyone that Valve hires would have to look through everything and it 's very easy to lose track of the various ways these modules are connected .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,explainlikeimfive,"I know very little about Finnish but I speak Hungarian ( the two languages are linguistically related ) . I think what he means is that each syllable has to contain at least one vowel so you can never have words like scvrnkls , which have absolutely no vowels in them .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"They should have hired more developers when Valve took over CS : GO . Brooks ' Law only applies to *late* software projects . Adding manpower to an already late software project does n't usually work out , although it 'd be interesting to see how it would fare given Valve 's business structure . My analysis is that complex bugs that have been in the game for a very long time would n't be fixed by simply hiring more developers . The main problem is that it takes a long time for new developers to become productive and until that 's the case , you , as a developer , would have to spend a reasonable amount of your time educating the new guy . Valve , however , does n't actually hire people to work on one project only so this might not be a big problem . They might be able to roll out more updates if more developers concentrated on CS : GO but fixing these very subtle bugs related to hitboxes , for example , would not be accelerated by throwing manpower at the project . The required amount of familiarity would be too high a barrier for any developer assigned to a completely new project .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,news,"Yes , but , to be honest , in most states with capital punishment , murder *is* punishable by death . This , combined with the fact that it was premeditated and done for financial gain should be able to convince every reasonable judge/jury that the death penalty is not unreasonable . ( This would n't be murder in most jurisdictions , though , negligent manslaughter or its equivalent is more reasonable , but I 'm sure the prosecutors will try to pin murder on him as well just for good measure . ) The sentence they get does n't really matter in the end . What matters is that there 's gon na be a precedent establishing that when something potentially unsafe gets shipped with the consent of the person responsible for the whole process , knowing that the shipment is unsafe for human consumption , and this results in the death of someone , the person can be punished for murder/manslaughter .",Uralic,Hungarian

'' The words **democracy , socialism , freedom , patriotic , realistic , justice** have each of them several different meanings which can not be reconciled with one another . In the case of a word like democracy , **not only is there no agreed definition , but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides** . It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it : consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy , and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning .",Uralic,Hungarian

There are other games as well , mostly strategy and rpgs that ca n't be fully appreciated in the standard 2 hour trials or demos , especially when these first moments often misrepresent the whole experience . Basically many see piracy as an extended demo and advertisement to the creators . And the last reason , living in a middle european country , our wages are a fraction of the western average , while our basic expenses ( food , tax , bills ) are only sightly less , yet prices are as we say sized for the American or German wallets .

Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Actually I played it , but I was curious because he only mentioned mechanics from the first game . Which I found weird because the second one felt a lot better overall .

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"I loved that one so much , and it 's actually pretty logical , horses themselves prefer staying on the road .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Honestly I think racing games are a pretty clear choice with a keyboard like that , along with any game where you have to control your vehicle 's movement in real time . It 's pretty annoying that unless you have gamepad or wheel+pedals you either go max speed or none . Also gentle presses would be good for gently steering the car instead of tearing the steering wheel off then putting it back in a second . Though now that I think about it , platformers or really any game could use soft pressing as walking without having to use another button . The biggest winner here is platform games , it lets you position yourself more precisely without the fear of walking off a platform .

I know that it sucks but it should be better for everyone .",Uralic,Hungarian

People in soloQ constantly deal with idiots trying to reinvent the meta while failing miserably and losing their ELO , along with trolls who pick random shit just for the sake of it . How do they know if this guy is different ? Also , even if they win , I 'm pretty sure that by the end his teammates get tilted and nervous , probably not really enjoying the game . As I said in another comment , if so many people have problems with this pick , get a few friends and play with them .

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Huh I do n't even remeber how old I was , probably around 5 or 6 , but we had a neighbour family which we became friends with . So one day they gave us their old computer which had 3 games : Sim City , Prince of Persia and Prehistoric . Me and my brother played those games all the time , but due to not knowing English , or even to read , as well as not having necesseary muscle control , apart from Prehistoric we could n't finish any of the games .

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"This is not my joke , I 'm pretty sure it has been around for a while , but it 's the best one I 've read in a really long time . As for the bonus points , the GOW series was the one which with I got my girlfriend into gaming , we played the series split screen on my 360 , if I win this giveaway I 'm buying another copy to play it on PC . I recall my first time with a condom , I was 15 or so . I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy . There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter , and she could see that I was new at it . She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one . I honestly answered , ‘ No , this is my first time. ’ So she unwrapped the package , took one out and slipped it over her thumb . She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure . I apparently still looked confused . So , she looked all around the store to see if it was empty . It was empty . ‘ Just a minute , ’ she said , and walked to the door , and locked it . Taking my hand , she led me into the back room , unbuttoned her blouse and removed it . She unhooked her bra and laid it aside . ‘ Do these excite you ? ’ She asked . Well , I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head . She then said it was time to slip the condom on . As I was slipping it on , she dropped her skirt , removed her panties and lay down on a desk . ‘ Well , come on ’ , she said , ‘ We don ’ t have much time. ’ So I climbed on her . It was so wonderful , that unfortunately , I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW , I was done within a few moments . She looked at me with a bit of a frown . ‘ Did you put that condom on ? ’ she asked . I said , ‘ I sure did , ’ and held up my thumb to show her .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Titanfall seems like more fun , but I 'm pretty sure Overwatch has more longetivity . Though if you plan on buying both , Overwatch will have players for years , and I 'm not that sure about Titanfall , so you 'd enjoy it more if you buy it first .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwoXChromosomes,"Yeah , I know and we are definitely having a genetic counselling when we will be planning a child .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,todayilearned,So basically my experience with Dr. Who .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwoXChromosomes,"Yeah , I 've heard some people use pills along with condoms . Which is funny , because most people swithch to pills to avoid condoms .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Congrats to the new baby and thanks for the giveaway !,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"It 's especially bad , because it makes the PC side of the arguements look just as bad as the console . Along with listing low effort indie games and 20 years old games as a counterarguement against console exclusives . ( Not saying all indie games are bad , Stargew Valley and Undertale are my favourites forever ) We have to decide wether we just want to circlejerk about how consoles suck or actually help fellow gamers make informed decisions about their purcashes .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Well , some people get confused on keyboard and prefer controllers since there are fewer keys to get lost in . Also controllers are more easily portable .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Is the GPU core soldered onto the board ? Or did he tear the pins out as well ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Wait , those strands are supposed to be part of the circuit board ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Oh , then I actually feel like the small blobs are way too volunerable sometimes , especially when I 'm behind with Zac .

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , and the baron steals happened in the double smite meta .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,TwoXChromosomes,"They are still people and people are not perfect . Even a normal child can turn the parent 's life upside down , and all the stress , worrying , sleep deprivation , lack of free time can cause people to flip out . Just think of all the shaken baby cases . Do n't let a person sleep for more than 3 hours in 3 days and you will have them do crazy things . Now imagine someone working 2 shifts every day to provide for a child who is bigger than him or her and has no future because it still needs it 's diaper to be changed . I 'm not saying that it 's ok to do something like killing a child for it 's handicaps or disabilities , but I can totally understand people who do n't want to be walking life support machines for the rest of their lives . Remember that in many places the term dumpster baby is not just of horror stories .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,meirl,"Missing those shots your really depend on is especially crushing , because you the player almost always avoid taking shots that have how chance of hitting .

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Well , the biggest problem is , chat toxicity is pretty black and white when someone says things like cancer , autist , fuck you etc . You can read those things in chat . When someone says that someone is trolling , it 's 90 % a 0/5 Yasuo top who screwed up against Trundle , and the rest is someone intentionally losing the game . But lots of these incidents can look like mistakes , like a bad Anivia wall , support roaming to other lanes , jungler dieing in ganks and Riot does n't want to ban people based on false positives . Unless the troll flames in chat or is doing it blatantly , Riot ca n't really do anything about it . Also ever since the automated banning system , the situation with trolling has improved a lot . I remember that back in the tribunal ages there were accounts who had hundreds of games where they only picked Zilean with ghost and revieve , built nothing but zeal and boots of mobility and ran down lanes getting 40 deaths in a game . Have n't heard of anything like that since then . The worst things were Tyler one and Dotot , both of whom actually played the game normally between troll games .",Uralic,Hungarian

To be fair he was kinda weak back then , but still , somehow everyone overlooked how safely he could farm and poke and still have one of the best escapes on adcs . Though at that time people argued that right click champions are for noobs and hitting abilities is what makes you skillful , so Pantheon is more skillful than Yi .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Nah skins are what makes you win . /s,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I 'd say that 3 or 4 rune pages are more than enough at your level , but later on you will probably want to get more than that . Think of it as an investment . If you buy them right now , you will miss out on skins and other shiny stuff , just so future you wo n't have the trouble to grind IP for them when he will need to build a specific one . Also try to save up some RP for per win and per day IP boosts and get more than enough IP when a party IP weekend comes around . That way you can get ten thousands of IP a day , so you might not even need to buy those rune pages with RP .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,summonerschool,"With the basic settings if you press A , your cursor changes and if you left click your champion will automaticly walk in that direction and attack the closest enemy that gets into range . There is also attack move click , where pressing A immediately issues the attack move command without the need to leftclick . This is really useful for adcs who usually want to stay at max range from enemies while hitting basically anyone who is in range . With only rightclicking you have the danger of missclicking an enemy and running into them instead of attacking . I have a gaming mouse , so I rebound attack move click to a thumb button .",Uralic,Hungarian
