So you have to sacrifice some army ( so did I ) to accomplish that . Then after you occupy land in the Balkans . So with your ships now try to split it up to two different ship groups . One keeping the ottomans on the island and the other keeping remaining armies in anatolia . If you manage to have allies before the war , it will be even better . I had poland ( they will bring lithuania with them ) and Wallachia ( I think ) . On your peace treaty you gain land and ducats to pay off your loans .

And one other thing is the charge . Clearly if you 're a main you should notice that there been changes to the logic of the collision . When the smallest ramp could stop the charge and count it as a collision . This has been change ( I think to the better ? ) Example , when attacking in Route 66 , I used to love and try to charge on [ this little ramp ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/R8Wfz ) you see , it used to stop me everytime , whether I charged from middle or left gate .

By the way , an easier route to cleric beast is after you killed the two werewolves on the bridge , right before the Cleric beast you should find a path to your left where a human-monster guards it , kill him and continue that way . You 'll enter a small house , kill the rest monsters in there , as you go down the stairs in the house continue to your left you 'll see a door there ( not the door right next to the stairs ) , open it and continue straight ahead kill the one monster guarding a gate , open the gate ( I do n't know if you need any key for it ) .

I didnt work that much , but my first day I worked at the restaurant , we all ( the people who worked there ) decided to go to the bars after work . Because the restaurant was in a different town , I didnt have any place to sleep the night in , my sister was with her ex in a small apartment . But a coworker ( a female ) offered her place , so I said `` javisst , tack '' . So after some heavy night drinking with all these people I went home with this waitress . She showed me her room and I took of my clothes only wearing my underwear , she joined me at the bed , and was clinging on me , sure whatever I was drunk and like it . She started to look me in the eyes and i said to myself `` eh what the hell why not '' , started to kiss and fingering her . Later I got some bj and vag ( one of the best sex I had in my life ) . She was aggressive in bed , gave me scratches on my back and kissing marks on my neck.. not good for tomorrows work . Anyway the day after I took a taxi to work to begin the day at the restaurant . Our alcoholic tunisian chef understanded what happent because of the kissing mark and started to call the waitress `` vampire '' hence after that day . Oh and yeah our chef got fired some months later after we found out that he was truly an alcoholic.. tl ; dr had sex with waitress , and she was baptised with a new name `` vampire ''",Greek,Greek
