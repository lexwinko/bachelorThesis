12345ieee,spacechem,The worst offender on this is definitely KOHCTPYKTOP . A single flip-flop in a single reactor would probably save me ~60 symbols .,Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"I 've recreated the whole thing , and the temptation of overhauling everything is pretty strong . Turns out that going 2 or 4 times over that flip-flop is very difficult in this layout , so we just get rid of it , as the guard function is actually performed by the other flip flop . So , [ SPOILER ] ( http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=682142090 ) here is my minimal modifications solution , you lose 2 cycles per output due to pathing , but at least it works . I see a lot of simple optimizations that can be done further ( like removing 2 useless blue arrows or cutting some pieces of useless red path ) but I 'll leave that to you . EDIT : Did all the simple optimizations that came to my mind , for further improvement you probably need an overhauling : https : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=682176314",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,spacechem,"/u/Deimorz and /u/contmo , is there any news on this ?

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"As /u/GemOfTime is saying above , someone did the math , keeping amps into account , too . That someone is me .

12345ieee,spacechem,"Still , it strikes me as pretty impolite ( and unethical , if you want ) to clone an original game from an indie dev , while you have no idea if it still brings money or not .

12345ieee,askscience,"You 'd probably have more luck using the Z as intermediate step , then getting photons via charged lepton decay and recombination/bremsstrahlung .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Some of it is still confusing . I tried a game with the managem listen in there ( havent tried the super-ultra-perfect managem you suggested since it looks like it takes hours to make ) and I definitely did notice an increase in mana . You asked for the optimal setup . You 're not supposed to do recipes this big by hand , feed them to wGC . & gt ; Also , I looked at the skills guide and realized just how much of an end game noob I am . I modified my skills to what it suggested though . I still do n't understand why the guide says not to do hatred . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but enemy xp is based on their base hp . If you end at X hp no matter what , should n't the hatred skill not really matter ? If anything , it gives you a multiplier bonus and ends the game earlier . Assume you can kill 1e50 . With hatred you get there at w500 , without at w600 . In the second case the multiplier is lower , but you killed more waves . You can run the math , turns out Hatred 1 loses by & gt ; 10 % , higher is worse . & gt ; I am guessing it has to do with the max hp chart , but I thought enemies max out at something crazy like 10^333 hp . After a certain point , it 's harder and harder to level up gems , so it is unrealistic to make it this far , right ? & gt ; & gt ; I hear that the max is not , in fact , 10^333 , but I still do n't know what it is . The cap is at 1e300 , but player damage sure wo n't go over 1e80 , we do n't have enough mana .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"Let 's get started with a simple overview . Chain hit is worth between x500-x10000 in gem efficiency , depending on how many monsters you have over your gem . For comparison having slow gems is a x10 in gem efficiency ( 90 % slowed = speed x0.1 = hits taken x10 ) . Now , the nice global scaling formula `P=M^ ( gk/ ( 1-gm ) ) *K` tells you that if you lose a x10 in gem efficiency you roughly lose a x10^5 in final damage ( this factors in mana collection , managem scaling , killgem scaling , etc ... ) . So , uhm , leave out red and you roughly lose a x ( 1000^5 ) = x1e15 . Technically it is possible to win an endurance with this penalty , you 'd change the easiest endurance in an extremely hard one ( see https : //docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mfWXh80KGKTaTx-p033c6xeEuH2UoyoWna6SoKKXB2U/edit # gid=1391672033 ) . So , to answer : & gt ; Are there any ways of improving performance to have a steady 30 fps while still using chain hit gems ? I have tried every tip from this sub regarding option settings . No & gt ; Is it possible to finish endurance mode on the hardest difficulty without chain hit ? If my math is n't wrong , yes it is . But it 's very very very very tight . & gt ; What would the optimal setup be ? Same one you 're using : slow , managem ( s ) ( the more the better , till too much lag ) , space ( optional , in case you want WoE-cycling ) , slow ( optional , you might not need it ) , killgem . & gt ; Can the gemforce software be used in a way to return the best recipes without the red gem ? Yes , gemforce actually builds red-less gems , the red adder is a shitty hack that adds red with a semi-decent brute search . You 'll need to run gemforce itself , though , asking it to give you the red-less recipes and then feeding them to wGC . In case you **really** want to do that feel free to ask for further help , both with the tools and with battle tactics .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Link to youtube video generated by the game 's record function for verification , done . No need for any steam id friendlist bullshit , just submit a link and anyone can verify it . This way all the solutions will become public . I do n't think this should be mandatory to submit a score . & gt ; I would n't bother listing scores by platform , as there 's no easy way to verify that something like a production level is using a specific platforms random seed except for fully constructing the solution on that platform . Just lump them together and let people minmax their random seed by platform selection if they want to push the envelope . The problem with this is that the score table will become meaningless . The first place would always be of the guy who wrote a botched C math library ( this counts as 'platform ' ) , had the game load it and then abused a randomness he can perfectly control . The table should lock down the platform to be usable . & gt ; I would n't try to evaluate what is and is n't a state machine , because you run into a lot of edge cases . Is a solution that is n't able to handle a rare input combination a state machine for taking advantage of that or just not a perfect solution ? What about only using knowledge of the first input , or just the last ? Many optimized solutions take advantage of that kind of knowledge while handling all other inputs normally . & gt ; & gt ; For bug exploits you 'd need to be very specific for what is and is n't allowed , since the same bug that enables particle smashing also enables Input + Fuse where you input on top of another atom and avoid collision by fusing the same cycle to remove the collision . Input + Fuse is used in a ton of optimized and even regular solutions to various fusion levels . Choose a standard , then rely on the honor system .",Romance,Italian
12345ieee,spacechem,"For comparison , in Shenzhen IO we rely entirely on Steam scores ( and the honor system for the less significant digits that the game does n't show ) . This is possible because it was decided to not record full information ( cost/power/lines ) for each record , but just the score , because knowing the cost leads to metagaming in Shenzhen IO . In Spacechem I do n't think there is any information gained from the number of reactors used , so there is no problem with recording the whole score . We can definitely start with the honor system and the hundreds of solutions already on youtube .

12345ieee,dataisbeautiful,"I do n't think you know where dark energy enters the equations here . Einstein 's equations have a free parameter , called `` Cosmological constant '' ( I 'll call it L ) , that ca n't be constrained by local measurements ( we can just say it 's very small ) . It turns out , if you want GR to match what we see , you can not take L to be 0 , but it 's got to have a certain tiny value . This is not a `` fudge factor '' , it 's simply a free parameter of the theory we tuned with experiments ( like , dunno , the value of surface gravity in classical mechanics ) . L then reappears in the equation for the age of the universe , we plug it in and do the math , no funny business anywhere . The interpretation of L , now , it 's difficult . It turns out that L is on the same side of the equation as the densities/pressures of matter and radiation , so we think about L not as some wavy factor , but as the density/pressure of a strange kind of `` energy '' ( hence the name `` dark energy '' ) . But we know of no kind of particle/field/whatever that can produce the observed density/pressure of the dark energy , so for now we simply measure it and put it manually in Einstein 's equation . In the future we may identify some exotic `` thing '' that produces the right density/pressure and we 'll be able to compute L from the properties of this `` thing '' .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,dataisbeautiful,"I 'm not sure I follow you . Physics theories are just giant machines that ( assuming they are correct ) get some data in input and spit out some other data we want to know .

In an ideal world you 'd measure each one in a separate experiment ( so you have no correlation ) , here is a bit more complicated , but whatever ... Once you have these 4 values you can throw them in the age equation and it spits out the age of the universe , which is the important thing you wanted to know .

Nope , in physics one usually talks about `` correction factors '' when a simple derivation gets you close to the result you want , but then you need a more complex theory/treatment to refine the first result and get what you observe .

12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Bad comparison , since using things like particle smashing or telekinetic waldos require a deep understanding of the game and a lot of design work to use well and are n't an automatic win button .

But that 's part of the fun and charm of the game , and things like particle smashing are just another tool in the toolbox ( a hard one to use practically at that ) for designing clever solutions . I do not agree here . In a sense , you 're not playing Spacechem ( or I 'm not , perspective ) , you 're playing a game with slightly more ( less ) tools at your disposal .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Thanks again for the info , I followed that guide and changed some skills around and got 300 more levels . I have some other questions now though : ) . Ok & gt ; & gt ; You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; What exactly are the skills you are referring too ? Do I need some special program or is it programming code ? I have some familiarity with coding . Also , do you know if changing the sprites would help ? I just kinda pulled that out of my ass . The short answer is : forget it . & gt ; In the guide you created/helped create you mentioned at the end that it could take up to 40 hours to max out exp on a map . Does this mean that endurance runs take so long that you usually have to leave it paused while you go to work/sleep and it spans several days ? Cuz that sounds terrible . Yes . Yes . Yes . & gt ; When I tried out using bloodbound gems , I noticed my managems at one point had a million hits , yet my killgem only had ~30,000 around the same time . What can I do to up the hit count of my first killgem ? For the final killgem you need to use a training killgem before your manafarm , the EEG guide explains this . Upping the count of the first killgem is hardly useful at all . & gt ; The guide also mentions at a certain point you want to stop mana farming and start building your final killgem . When do decide to do that/how do you know when you have enough mana ? When you 'll be an experienced player and go for the endurance victory you 'll do the math and farm enough mana that allows you to build a killgem good enough to kill the last waves . For now , farm till you get bored . & gt ; Also , how do you construct the final killgem ? I had about 6 g2rb gems each with between 1 mil and 3mil hits . I combined them all with yellow and each other and then did killgem combine with the gemweaving program , but it still was worse than my first killgem even though it had way more hits ( I guess the start was really bad/inefficient ? ) Yep , the 'spec ' you used is horrid , refer to the EEG guide for an effective method ( training killgem ) . & gt ; Finally , is there some way to add mana cost to gem recipes in the gem weaving program ? Because I used a combine when I did n't have all the mana I needed . It stopped halfway through , and I did n't know how to finish the recipe , so it seemed like a huge waste . It makes no sense , how is the combiner supposed to know how much the starting gem costs ? For all it knows you could be using the same combine for a g3 or a g110 . The only things that make sense is the cost increase , which is showed . & gt ; Thanks again ! You are welcome .",Romance,Italian

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Hello , I recently started playing this game and I 've enjoyed it quite a bit , but I 'm a little confused on the next steps I should take . I am wizard level 2.3k and have just started some endurance runs . Hi & gt ; Lately , I get bored cuz it takes too damn long with lag , and I stop enraging and just send all waves . I 've made it to wave 372 in endurance . Is there any way to reduce lag ? Get all your settings to min . Short of that , nothing to be done , game is in Flash , the engine itself is shitty . & gt ; Maybe by modding the game to change the sprites of all the enemies to small boxes or something ? You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; However , I 'm not exactly sure how I should spend skills optimally . I saw a guide on steam that ranked skills in level of importance , but it did n't mention how many unused points to save . Right now I have almost all capped skills maxed out ( just the spells left at 30+15 ) and all non-capped skills at 30+15 ( the important ones at least ) . Said guide is mine . You have to leave enough unspent points so you have enough mana at the start . I do n't play for you , you have to find a balance . & gt ; I am also curious how people enrage waves and how often ppl upgrade gems . Any guidelines would be helpful . So far I 've just enraged until the HP of reavers/swarmlings is about equal to my killgem 's max dmg , then used the same number of gems on giant waves . Nope , enrage for armor over managem damage , not HP . The EEG guide has a ton of info on this and gems . http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=434889753 & gt ; Another question I had was what are the optimal talisman bonuses ? I 've heard anything with WoE is good , but I 'm not sure how to balance + % charge of all spells and enhancements . Anything with +1 all skills and +10 % exp is good , extra stats are just for show . Skills sought after are WoE/Freeze charges and effect and shrine charges & gt ; When are you strong enough to take on hatred 10 ? Never , unless you cheat & gt ; Final questions : does destroying a monster nest reduce the number of monsters in a level ? No & gt ; Does endurance mode end and how strong do you need to be to reach it ? Yes , at w999 . Depends on the difficulty . & gt ; When is it better to use bloodbound instead of poolbound ? Always after g30 & gt ; Thanks ! You are welcome & gt ; Edit : Another question , lets say I blocked beacons from spawning everywhere but a corner of the map and that corner can have a max of 20 beacons , if I were to enrage a wave such that 22 beacons would spawn , will the extra two beacons spawn after I destroy some of the first 20 ?

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"& gt ; It 's coming to the point where I 'm worried that I may just end up groping a random girl because the urge to explore and experience is just getting too strong . This is absolutely not the way to go . I know it and I 'm sure you know it too , so let 's just get that out of the way . & gt ; I 'm pretty sure that once I have a bit of success my anxiety will dissipate and my skills should come up to the level of others my age . This jumped out at me , too , so I 'll tell what my experience taught me : your anxiety is there to stay , unless you tackle that mofo down , with the help of a therapist if needed ( I can assure you , for many people it 's much easier with one ) . Tying the solutions of your internal struggles to an external 'miracle cure ' will never solve your problem : your head will simply find something else to be anxious about . Now that I 've gotten that out of the way ... This probably wo n't be exactly what you 're looking for , but the way you 're feeling is normal . At 20 , you 're still incredibly young , and , even if it feels that way , not having had any sort of relationship at 20 is neither particularly uncommon nor something you should feel ashamed about . I myself did n't have any sort of relationship with anyone until I was 22 ; I absolutely felt sexually frustrated , unwanted , ready to be with any guy at all just to get rid of my virginity . I was being way overdramatic about the whole thing ; worse , I was treating people like a means to an end . You say things like `` to find a reliable source of real life sexual release '' , or `` what conversational techniques do I need to employ to avoid the dreaded friend zone and get quite quickly to the point of having a sexual relationship ? `` , and that just feels like you 're seeing these potential girls as the way you 'll get sex . That wo n't solve your insecurities or your desire of intimacy with someone else , and it will just make it a sad experience for everyone involved . So , this is how it happened to me : I actually got out of the house to do the things I was passionate about . I stopped approaching every conversation with a dude as a `` can I get him interested in sex with me ? '' minigame ; I just talked about the things we had in common . I met new people at the places I went for my hobbies ( you mention liking music : are there any local band you can follow , maybe a smaller scene where you can chat with people , close to your home ? ) ; if you can start talking about your shared passions , the conversation will be more fun for everyone , and you 're probably going to feel a lot less embarassed . I got an haircut that suited me and made me feel snazzy ( silly , but effective ) . In the end , I employed a lot of `` fake it till you make it '' : I could act more confident , make people believe I was confident , and feel slightly more confident myself as a result . I finally had sex , it was super fun , but my insecurities stayed firmly in their place . To close this already long-ass post , I used to read what Dr. Nerdlove wrote on his blog : it has a lot of stuff about helping nerdy and otherwise shy guys with girls ; things about presenting yourself well and being charming without being pushy . I have n't read it in a while , and I have n't always found myself agreeing with him , but it may be something you want to check out . Edit : syntax",Romance,Italian

For what it 's worth , I would not have had any trouble dating a virgin at your age . I 'm a girl who lost her virginity at 22 ; it actually did n't happen until I stopped obsessing about it . Secondly , your mother is right , therapy would do you a world of good . I 'd actually say you go before worrying about a relationship : you 're a ball of anxiety and that makes a relationship much more likely to fail . It 's much more mature to recognize your issues and work on them , than to pretend you 're without weakness ( nobody is ) . the people who would think less of you for going to therapy are assholes , and why would you want to date assholes ? The very large majority of girls *do not* want Superman , because he 's unrelatable and pretty boring . Lastly , I feel you have a bit of an unreal perspective on relationships .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I was molested by my stepfather when I was about 16 , did not tel my mother until one year ago , more or less , 8 years after the fact . The disappointment did get easier , for me , and ultimately I did want a relationship with my mom , so I had to make some mental adjustments . I accepted that she 'd rather keep the status quo , at least for the time present , than confront her partner about shit like this . This , though , was something that worked for me ; you may want other things . It 's supremely shitty that your mother did n't recognize the abuse when you were younger , and I think she knows it was a partly her fault that this never came up , and that 's why she 's unresponsive now . She does not want to face it , so she 's running away and pretending the problem does not exist . Which is doubly shitty , because one good step to repair the damage would be being close to you and helping you . My personal reading , you know best if this fits your mother or not . And honestly , no matter the reason , you can decide how much contact do you want with your mother from now on . You can not control her reaction , but you can control how much she 's around . I would second the advice of trying therapy ; for me , it meant I finally sterted to deal with the molestation . Sometimes you do n't click with your therapist , but that 's normal ; you can always try with another . I would also advise you to tell your boyfriend or a close friend , to have someone 100 % on your side , because that helps immeasurably . I think it 's good that you finally told someone , even if your mother failed to support you in any way . Anger is your friend here , it can push you forward and make you learn how to deal with stuff that seemed too complicated or scary before .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"First of all , I 'm very sorry to hear about your abuse . I 'm seconding the therapy advice , that would be the most reliable solution , really .

Still , as a psych major , I 'm sure you can see that bringing this up in a thread from a young girl who was abused by her own father is not appropriate ? We can have this discourse , but away from survivors who really should not deal with that . It 's not her job to forgive her father , if she even wants to , on anyone alse 's time but hers . Rereading your comment , though ... I do n't know how anyone could do what he did and not think it 's wrong . And further than that , it 's really not up to me or you to decide if this man could be forgiven or not . That would be up to OP , and , again , only if she wishes to and only on her time .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"So , here 's my take in the DLCs : *First of all , you only lose your items during Dead Money . DM 's a very particular DLC , that people tend to either love or hate . Personally , it 's my favorite . It 's a bit hard , though . *You wo n't take your companions with you . OWB is a solo mission , the others give you companion ( s ) as much as it makes sense for the story . *Nope ! Your ED-E will wait for you in the Mojave . I do n't really want to say more . *It depends on how you play . I prefer not to cheese and to stay closer to a role play perspective , others have more fun trying to get all the cash home . Bear in mind that by the end of the game you will not have money problems , gold bars or not . *Lonesome Road is , IMO , best enjoyed near the end of the storyline , because it wraps up all the other DLCs and touches upon your alliances ( if it 's not still bugged- are you on PC ? If so , get the unofficial patch ) Above all , have fun and do n't spoil yourself too much . These are some of the best DLCs I 've ever seen in a game .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"These things make my blood boil . Absolutely seek out a counselor for yourself , second-hand trauma is something that happens , there 's nothing shameful with looking for help in a stressful situation . She ABSOLUTELY also needs therapy . What I 'm hoping here is that telling you may have broken the dam regarding keeping the abuse a secret , and that it means she 's ready to talk about it . Therapy will help her cope with what happened and find out how she wants to deal with this situation , wether that be secrecy again or not . You should n't push excessively , but I think that saying that you 're very worried and that you think she 'll be infinitely better with therapy would not be too much . How old is your friend , by the way ? If she 's had any experience with relatives or friends who were helped by therapy , it would be a good thing to remind her . Also , this story is almost step by step what happened to me , except that thankfully I was never raped . So , if you want to PM me , or somehow if your friend wants to talk about it , feel free to .

Closure is something you find in yourself , IMO , not something other people can give you . Do n't go , not because you 'd be professing your feelings to `` another dude 's girlfriend '' , but because this fixation is unhealthy for you , and you showing up and declaring your love would probably be really uncomfortable for real-person-Jane . On a positive note , I once nursed a one-way crush for four years straight and let me tell you , buddy , once I managed to stop obsessing over him and I was able to move on with my life without heartache , it was SO great .

I 'm going to offer a different opinion : you do n't *have* to tell anyone of you do n't feel like it , but maybe talking with a therapist could help . I tell you this because I was in a similar situation ( although it happened when I was older , so there are no missing scenes , so to speak ) and the memories never really went away . I did suppress them for a while , but in the end , they always came back and ended up fucking with my head quite a bit . Maybe you will deal with them on your own and all will be well .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"Ad Dionysus said , JE Sawyer 's is pretty great . Keep in mind that with that mod , you are also going to level up slower and die more often , and IIRC get crippled more easily . Project Nevada is also a good overhaul mod with a lot of separately customizable parts , just do n't use it with Sawyer 's . Other than that , go nuts with your character ! Are they a sniper , maybe a cowboy ? Keep a theme with weapons , armor and perks ! Is he/she a mysanthrope with horrible charisma and a 12 in Speech ? I feel that imagining characters with motivations and a personality with virtues and flaws makes for a better experience . And then have the skills and SPECIALs reflect that personality .

13RunawayTurtles,fnv,"No worries , I like planning characters ! And ok , so no mods then . If you want to go solo , I 'd recommend a higher Perception , rather than Agility ( you probably want to go for the one-hit-kill as a solo sniper , anyway ) , since you 're not going to benefit from ED-E 's perk . You need at least 6 Luck for the Better Criticals perk ( +50 % crit damage , and keep in mind that every hit from sneak counts as a crit ) . Also , you 'd have to have at least 6 Strength for the sniper rifles ( 8 for the AMR , but I do n't think that 's made for stealth ! ) . Christine 's Rifle in OWB ( if you have the DLC ) or the Gobi ( if you have some lockpick skill ) are good choices . Moderate intelligence ( and probably charisma , since no companions mean no benefit from it ) sounds fine . Guns , sneak , lockpick , speech if you want , repair and medicine/survival would all be good skills . Then there 's the little things that have no effect on the mechanics , but help you choose the quests and responses , like how empathetic he is to other 's misfortunes , wether he likes technology or not , if he prefers to approach problems diplomatically or with violence , if there 's a particular group of people he likes or dislikes , and so on .

13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"Oh ! Totally did n't catch that they 're all in the USA now , sorry . It 's even *more* ridiculous now that I see that . That said , they 're using European categories to discriminate , considering that racist Western Europeans look down on Slavs ( which IIRC she technically is n't , since her family is muslim-bosnian ) . Racist non-Muslim Europeans in general also look down on Muslims , BTW . I 'm not entirely sure I understand what American communautarism is , but I 'd be ready to bet quite a lot that they would n't have problems if the girlfriend was a Catholic or Protestant girl of French descent or something .",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,relationships,"There 's plenty of racism towards African ( North or Sub-Saharan ) people , you 're right about that . Here in Italy I also see a lot racism against Eastern European people ( doubly so if they happen to be Roma or Sinti ) .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I do n't know if you 've mentioned it in your other replies , but have you tried to talk to your therapist about sex ? I go to therapy for other things , but also talk about sexual-related problems if I have any . It looks like you had a terrible upbringing regarding your sexuality , of course it must be hard to relax during sex . I 'm pretty sure your therapist would help you like with any other issue . Also , regarding your boyfriend and foreplay , he should understand it 's okay sometimes to do things in bed that are just 'meh ' for him , but make things better for you ( keep in mind : not stuff that makes him uncomfortable , just stuff he 's not crazy about ) . Sex is a two-people ( or more ... ) effort , and he 's not *that* young , so he should already know this .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Hey , I 'm just an Internet stranger , but I think there 's nothing to feel ashamed about . Sex can be awkward as fuck , and none of us started out already sure of what we wanted and how we wanted it . It 's only going to get better , if you and your boyfriend can face the issues together . You do n't have to talk to your therapist if you do n't want to , maybe just keep it in mind for when you feel ready . I 'm sending you e-hugs !",Romance,Italian

And boy did I have your same fears as a teen , especially seeing how almost all of my friends had boyfriends or girlfriends . How you 're feeling is perfectly normal . Like everyone else , I 'm going to tell you not to worry about it : there 's no expiration date to anyone 's virginity , and nobody with a modicum of maturity will really care about when you first had sex . If you 're not comfortable with it just now , then it 's perfectly ok to wait until you are , and I , for one , think that it 's smart that you 're picking this choice , even while feeling conflicted . You 'll be fine . Right now it may feel like the rest of high school is a damn long time , but really , it 's not a couple of years that are going to make a difference .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Honestly , I see what you mean , it 's just the expression `` glutton for abuse '' that does n't sit too well with me .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I do n't know , OP . I can tell you that when my brother was ready to leave his unhealthy relationship , I was glad that he felt he could come crash with us . He had already alienated the rest of the family and , as far as I know , also did n't have much contact with his friends . I 'll agree that it 's draining though , what with the excuses and the lies and the going back despite all the red flags ...",Romance,Italian
13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"It does n't sit well with me because people do n't *like* being abused ... People are young , or they are afraid to be alone or have incredibly stupid notions that if love does n't mean pain and sacrifice , it 's not true love . Maybe they think that they are being loyal to their partner , when they are just being manipulated . Maybe they just do n't want to admit that they could ever end up with an abusive pertner . Nobody ever thinks that being controlled and cheated on and constantly hounded is a just swell way to live . It 's just that they tend to minimize , because they think that the good stuff is worth the bad . And you and I know that it 's bullshit , but an 18-years-old may not .",Romance,Italian

Unfortunately , that is just what 's going to happen to anybody that criticizes him , for now .

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"Well , first of all , deep insecurity sucks , I know how that feels ! As already suggested , maybe therapy to deal with that could be helpful . Also , I do n't know how serious you are with your last line , but remember that any kind of suicidal thought is a serious matter , and should be addressed with a therapist . That said ... I was a very insecure 20-something , who never had a boyfriend and had n't even held hands with anybody . A thing that helped me immensely with insecurity , and also led me to meet my current guy , was launching myself in all kinds of activities , because I liked them , and not just to meet men . Go volunteering in something you care about , or join a political group if you 're so inclined , or develop a social aspect to your hobbies , be it sports , or reading , or gaming ! This way , you actually get more experienced in dealing with people , find out how to navigate a public setting , and , gradually , it would maybe help with being a bit less nervous . Cherry on cake : you get to meet new people who like the same things that you do , and with whom you have at least a starting common topic . People who will automatically consider some of the things you do interesting , because they do them too ! I mean , maybe you just are n't the type of person that 's able to approach people out of the blue . Some people are , I sure am not , and I do n't think that it 's a bad thing . You 're still very young . Your twenties are all right there to be experienced , time is not running out as much as it seems . And remember that , even when you go out and pursue hobbies and meet women who like the same things as you do ... sometimes your personalities will still be incompatible , or maybe you wo n't be their type . This happens , and it 's nobody 's fault , and it will not be a strike against your worth as a human being . Rejection sucks , but it happens to everybody , and how we deal with it says a lot about our personality . Good luck , OP !",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,TwoXChromosomes,"I 'm so sorry this happened to you , it 's terrible to even think about something like this . You did good though . You involved the police , you protected yourself and your son . You took the most difficult step , now you just have to keep going in this direction . Other people will have more experience than me in this , but until they write , I 'd say : -go stay with family or friends for a while , or maybe look for women 's shelters in your area , if you want to stay somewhere he does n't know about . On that note , I 'd maybe turn off any kind of tracking/gps app on your phone , if you have any . I do n't want to scare you , but you have to keep in mind that this is the most dangerous part in an abusive relationship ; do n't tell people who might speak to your ex where you are , and try to always be with someone ; -take pictures of all the bruises he gave you ( on multiple days , maybe , so they can be seen better ) and the property damage , for the trial ; -sending your son to a therapist is a good idea , but do find something for yourself , too . If you do n't want/ca n't afford a therapist , RAINN.org has a hotline for abuse survivors , and I 'm told it 's a good one . Actually , do call them anyways , because they surely have better advice than I do . You are brave , and you are a good mother . I 'm sending you hugs .",Romance,Italian

Yeah , to the outside eye , it 's not great . It sounds to me like you handled that first conversation well , but it 's something I 'd expect from a long-term partner . An addiction is a tough thing to push back , and alcoholism is a pretty destructive addiction . Even if he 's completely serious about stopping drinking , there would still be a lot of highs and lows . I 'd tell you to proceed with care and compassion , if he was not taking his difficulties out on you . Matter of fact , he is . I honestly do not see this ending well , I 'm sorry .

So , if you feel that they are resolved in a constructive way , then you 're good .

13RunawayTurtles,dragonage,"You totally should , the gut punch is delicious . As far as your character goes , I played a non-hardline Dalish and it was consistently believable , plus your clan is said to be one of the friendlier ones . You can , IIRC , express a desire to move forward in a few convos , like the post-Mythal one with Solas . Speaking of which , I also found really interesting to play a faithful Dalish that gets disillusioned with their history , ancestors and gods after the Well and becomes a non-believer . This from someone who vastly preferred the City Elves to the Dalish in earlier games , so , in my experience , it can be a satisfying story even if the Dalish are not your favourite . As far as class goes , it 's really not much of a difference ( it changes one line in the Solas romance , and I think that 's it ) . Mage seems to be the favourite class , but my Lavellan was a rogue and I actually prefer it , for that `` scrappy '' feeling . Also , damn that turned out long . Sorry about that .",Romance,Italian

Also I feel like context matters . This is just an example in an ocean of oversexualized ladies in video games . I 'm not an expert of the series by any means , so do you think that MGS 's representation of women has been so consistently good that we can reasonably assume it 's satire instead of applying Occam 's razor ?

I 'd say because it is closer to the ideal `` tall and strong '' shape for men , coming a little bit from nature , a little bit from culture IMO : cultural expectations of how a man `` should '' look are definitely there , even if maybe they are not as strong as with women . If this is coming from a shorter man : do n't sweat it so much . There are women who will not be interested in your body type , just like not all body types probably interest you .

Main missions are really obvious , though , you 'll notice the point of no return . Oh , and a companion quest in Act 2 is actually timed : to try and stay as non-spoilery as possible , you 'll derail an ambush , and after that you have to go to the ambush source soon-ish , or you lose your companion IIRC .",Romance,Italian

13RunawayTurtles,GirlGamers,"Mmm , let 's see if I can make this more coherent . First of all , the `` ashamed '' bit parrots a statement by Kojima ( or the company , I do n't remember right now ) , who said that the people who were criticizing Quiet 's design pre-release would be ashamed once they understood why she dresses like this . Except the reason presented in-game is pretty contrived . Also , i think that not liking a game because you do n't like shooters , or stealth games , or puzzle games is not the same thing as not liking when a game has a bad portrayal of women , or black people , or gay people . Because one is a matter of taste , the other is a matter of feeling excluded , or mocked for what you are . These kind representations make me feel `` othered '' , as it is , because I see my gender and a body ( broadly ... I mean , I wish ! ) similar to mine used simply for titillation in something that 's not supposed to be porn . I do n't know , can you relate to what I 'm saying in any way ? Has anything ever made you feel like this ? To conclude , I also do n't think this does not hurt anybody . Obviously , it does n't hurt people directly , but it exists in , and reinforces , a cultural paradigm in which women are seen as sex objects in contexts that have really nothing to do with sex .

It 's very much male-gazey , and therefore it makes me feel like the creator is telling me `` This is not for you '' . And that hurts a little , when it comes from something you love ( gaming in general , for me , not MGS in particular ) . Like the author of this article said , it 's not about the boobs .

333ml,civilengineering,"The ASD and the WSM are the same design philosophy , which is limited to the elastic range . Basically you have a member that you want to design , you compute the forces acting on the member , the next step is to choose size the member/reinforcement . You want to makes sure that the required strength does not exceed the allowable one , so you compare the stress acting on the section with the yield stress of the material being used . The yield stress is reduced by a safety factor . Concerning the limit state method , the loads are amplified by a safety factor and then you determine the cross section properties . The cross section has to satisfy the ultimate limit state and the serviceability conditions . The ultimate checks basically are about the safety of the member ( the condition just before collapse ) , for example for a concrete beam you want to make sure that the strain is less than 0.0035 ( I think this is the value given by the ACI ) . Serviceability limits are not as critical as the ultimate ones , for example you have to limit the deflection of a beam or check the amount of cracking . The LSM method allows for more economic design , the structure is allowed to go beyond the elastic range , the yield strain of concrete is about 0.002 but your allowed to go beyond that in a beam design .",Romance,Italian

333ml,lebanon,"Check qs rankings for universities in Europe in the field of ME and check the websites of the universities that you find . In general UK universities are expensive whereas in the rest of Europe the tuitions are very affordable . It does n't matter if the university is listed in the study abroad page . And you do n't need to know the language if the courses are given in English , of course it 's beneficial for everyday interactions but I 've been abroad for 2 years and the language barrier was never a serious problem ( I highly recommend you to start learning the language in Lebanon you wo n't find time to learn it in Europe ) . As for how useful it is and if a master in Lebanon is better it depends on what you want to do after graduation . If you 're interested in working in research and development a master abroad at a reputable university is infinitely better , you learn interesting advanced topics that you wo n't find in Lebanon . If you want to work in hvac design ( I do n't know much about ME ) I think a master in Lebanon will be enough . In terms of difficulty it 's harder here . In Lebanon most of my courses were 3 hours a week each . Here it 's either 6 or 10 hours for each course so you have much more content to learn and the semester length is nearly the same . And you will lack a lot in terms of background ( again 3 hours vs 6-10 hours ) so you 'll have to study some extra stuff that your colleagues know . A lot of people fail , in my first semester abroad there was around 35 foreign students , in the second semester around 10 people left and at the end of the year around 10 more people left .

333ml,civilengineering,"Because of the lateral confinement which is present in a plate but is not present in a beam . If you consider a beam elongated along z under a transversal load it will have out of plane displacement , not only in the same direction of the load but in the second plane ( x-y ) too due to Poisson effect . Now in a plate these lateral deflections are prohibited ( that 's why you have internal moments in both directions ) , just imagine the slab as a row of beams which inhibit each other from expanding/shrinking . This change in behavior reflects on the constitutive relations between the resultant stresses and curvature . Consider the case of cylindrical bending , I think it 's the best way to compare the beams to the plates . The relation between the moment and the curvature in the plate is : Mx=DX D is the plate stiffness and equal to Eh^3 /12 ( 1-v^2 ) where h is the plate thickness and X is the curvature . Now consider a beam , the stiffness is EI=Eh^3 /12 . As you can see D is higher that EI ( the Poisson ration is ~0.2 for concrete and ~0.3 for steel ) .",Romance,Italian

And there 's something I would like to implement but I 'm not sure if it 's possible . Wind turbine have some sort of blade control mechanism which depending on the wind direction and wind speeds changes the blade pitch .

333ml,arabs,"I never had issue with government surveillance , I was like I do n't do anything harmless meh . My opinion changed after reading this post . I do n't have a link to the original comment , I only have the text : ***************************************************************************************** I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship . One of the Arab spring countries . I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US . People here talking about curfews are n't realizing what that actually FEELS like . It is n't about having to go inside , and the practicality of that . It 's about creating the feeling that everyone , everything is watching . A few points : 1 ) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state . Not terrorists . People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo . These could be religious ideas . These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking . It makes it very easy to know who these people are . It also makes it very simple to control these people . Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals . So you make a plan and go to protest these practices . You get there , and wow , the protest is huge . You never expected this , you were just goofing off . Well now everyone who was there is suspect . Even though you technically had the right to protest , you 're now considered a dangerous person . With this tech in place , the government does n't have to put you in jail . They can do something more sinister . They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend . Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes . Or they can threaten to get your dad fired . All you have to do , the email says , is help them catch your friends in the group . You have to report back every week , or you dad might lose his job . So you do . You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid , you 're reporting on them to protect your dad . 2 ) Let 's say number one goes on . The country is a weird place now . Really weird . Pretty soon , a movement springs up like occupy , except its bigger this time . People are really serious , and they are saying they want a government without this power . I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal . You see on the news that tear gas was fired . Your friend calls you , frantic . They 're shooting people . Oh my god . you never signed up for this . You say , fuck it . My dad might lose his job but I wo n't be responsible for anyone dying . That 's going too far . You refuse to report anymore . You just stop going to meetings . You stay at home , and try not to watch the news . Three days later , police come to your door and arrest you . They confiscate your computer and phones , and they beat you up a bit . No one can help you so they all just sit quietly . They know if they say anything they 're next . This happened in the country I live in . It is not a joke . 3 ) Its hard to say how long you were in there . What you saw was horrible . Most of the time , you only heard screams . People begging to be killed . Noises you 've never heard before . You , you were lucky . You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you , but no one shocked you . No one used sexual violence on you , at least that you remember . There were some times they gave you pills , and you ca n't say for sure what happened then . To be honest , sometimes the pills were the best part of your day , because at least then you did n't feel anything . You have scars on you from the way you were treated . You learn in prison that torture is now common . But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker . Its considered a threat to national security . Pretty soon , a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad . You think it 's infected . There were no doctors in prison , and it was so overcrowded , who knows what got in the cut . You go to the doctor , but he refuses to see you . He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you . Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police . You decide to go home and see your parents . Maybe they can help . This leg is getting really bad . You get to their house . They are n't home . You ca n't reach them no matter how hard you try . A neighbor pulls you aside , and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and have n't been seen since . You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest . Even your little brother is n't there . 4 ) Is this even really happening ? You look at the news . Sports scores . Celebrity news . It 's like nothing is wrong . What the hell is going on ? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper . You lose it . You shout at him `` fuck you dude what are you laughing at ca n't you see I 've got a fucking wound on my leg ? '' `` Sorry , '' he says . `` I just did n't know anyone read the news anymore . '' There have n't been any real journalists for months . They 're all in jail . Everyone walking around is scared . They ca n't talk to anyone else because they do n't know who is reporting for the government . Hell , at one time YOU were reporting for the government . Maybe they just want their kid to get through school . Maybe they want to keep their job . Maybe they 're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor . It 's always a simple reason . Good people always do bad things for simple reasons . You want to protest . You want your family back . You need help for your leg . This is way beyond anything you ever wanted . It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms . Now you 're basically considered a terrorist , and everyone around you might be reporting on you . You definitely ca n't use a phone or email . You ca n't get a job . You ca n't even trust people face to face anymore . On every corner , there are people with guns . They are as scared as you are . They just do n't want to lose their jobs . They do n't want to be labeled as traitors . This all happened in the country where I live . You want to know why revolutions happen ? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse . But this thing that is happening now is big . This is the key ingredient . This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above . The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described . In the country I live in , they also claimed it was for the safety of the people . Same in Soviet Russia . Same in East Germany . In fact , that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone . But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality . Maybe Obama wo n't do it . Maybe the next guy wo n't , or the one after him . Maybe this story is n't about you . Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now , when a big war is happening , or after another big attack . Maybe it 's about your daughter or your son . We just do n't know yet . But what we do know is that right now , in this moment we have a choice . Are we okay with this , or not ? Do we want this power to exist , or not ? You know for me , the reason I 'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance . I was taught that the United States meant `` liberty and justice for all . '' You get older , you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution . That 's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is . Well , the government just violated that ideal . So if they are n't standing for liberty and justice anymore , what are they standing for ? Safety ? Ask yourself a question . In the story I told above , does anyone sound safe ? I did n't make anything up . These things happened to people I know . We used to think it could n't happen in America . But guess what ? It 's starting to happen . I actually get really upset when people say `` I do n't have anything to hide . Let them read everything . '' People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads . They are naive , and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no .",Romance,Italian

Beirut is the capital , it attracts most of the foreigners , it has the AUB , professors coming from outside will settle there . The biggest companies are located there , the headquarters of the banks are in Beirut . So in theory Beirut should be doing fine , lots of opportunity to work , good infrastructure to accommodate for the traffic and the foreigners . So everything should be good but it 's not , even in the capital . Tripoli does n't attract as much people as Beirut , it does n't have the biggest companies so poverty is a big problem . I mentioned the banks in Beirut because I know people who work in banks in Tripoli and all of them will tell you that there salaries are lower than the salaries in Beirut .

But you probably did n't stop and think about the income these people are making or if they can feed their family with it .

Several local media outlets reported earlier in the week that “ out of 1.9 million Syrian refugees present in Lebanon ... there are 300,000 pregnant Syrian women that will give birth in 2017. ” The outlet did not provide a source for the information , raising questions as to its credibility . “ We ’ re not quite sure about the source used in the report , but our records show that since the beginning of the crisis in 2011 there have been a total of about 100,000 Syrian newborns in Lebanon , ” Khaled Kabbara , spokesperson for the United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , told the Daily Star . Mounia Amrani , Medical Coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres , also challenged the figure . She said such a number was impossible based upon MSF ’ s data and work with Syrian women . “ The number is exaggerated and really strange . We can expect an estimated number of about 80,000 [ pregnant women ] maximum , ” she told The Daily Star . “ The Syrian women that come to us for aid often request and use methods of family planning . So the fact that these figures are so high doesn ’ t make sense with practices we see at MSF , ” Amrani added . Minister of State for Refugee Affairs Mouin Merehbi dismissed the media reports ’ claims , saying he thought that such false information was part of an anti-Syrian refugee agenda in Lebanon . “ The maximum growth rate is maybe about 4 or 5 percent in some countries . In our region , a 3 percent increase in population is very high , ” he said . “ It ’ s not right [ to report this ] . I ’ m not sure what the purpose of this propaganda is , but it is definitely crazy. ” The report claimed that unnamed Scandinavian and Gulf countries had offered aid packages in response to the alleged projected uptick of refugees in Lebanon . Specifically , it noted that the EU had already donated 200 million euros ( $ 219.4 million ) in support . As of Thursday evening , the European Union was unavailable to corroborate or deny the claim . Over 1 million Syrian refugees are currently registered with UNHCR in Lebanon , but the government has estimated that the number is closer to 1.5 million . Large populations of refugees settling in remote and vulnerable areas of the country have sparked tensions with equally underprivileged host communities .",Romance,Italian

The military said in a statement that the Syrian families left the makeshift camps in the northeastern border town of Arsal in a convoy of 30 civilian vehicles . They were accompanied by the Lebanese Army until the last military checkpoint on the outskirts of the area , The army said that the departure follows a `` high interest of the families '' to return to their homeland . Local media reported that the convoy comprised of 50 Syrian families . The families left through north and northeast Lebanon , the latter route going through the Lebanese border town of Tfail . Local Al-Jadeed TV reported that around 500 families are expected to return to Syria following `` reconciliations in Qalamoun and the Damascus countryside , and the militants leaving to Idlib . '' In February , Hezbollah 's media spokesperson told The Daily Star that the party is mediating the return of Syrian refugees from Arsal border area to their villages in the Qalamoun region in Syria in talks with Syrian opposition group Saraya Ahl al-Sham . MP Nawwar Saheli had told The Daily Star that `` it won ’ t be formal until the Lebanese government contacts the Syrian government . For now , it ’ s indirectly between Hezbollah and opposition groups. ” The Lebanese government estimates that around 1.5 million Syrian refugees live in unofficial camps around the country in deteriorating economic conditions – which Lebanon was already suffering prior to the refugee crisis .",Romance,Italian

AdamEdge,asoiaf,"Wargs . It 's interesting to me that we just take it as fact that since magic is returning then the family of a Lord would start having magical children . It is stated by GRRM that all the Stark kids are Wargs ( including Sansa ) , but what does n't match is the fact that Jon is also a Warg , he is not Ned 's son , but Lyanna 's , so this generation of Starks is giving birth to these kind of people . If we thrust the fact that Benjen is not a Warg ( do n't know why he would ) then something must have happen between his birth and the birth of Rob Stark/Jon . I believe whatever Howland did in the isle of faces is connected to this , he immediately meets the Starks after this visit . He was there , alone , looking for something or someone , then Rhaegar sees something in lyanna that obsess him and although Lyanna is not ugly there were far more beautiful women in westeros , he saw something in her other than beauty , but have never met her before . I think Howland was but a messenger to deliver some kind of gift to the Starks , the gift that is passed on their children , skin changing . Howland Reed after waiting all these years finally makes a move and sends his kids to Winterfell to fetch Brandon Stark to the 3ER . As if that was part of the plan since that day .",Romance,Spanish

I ca n't really speak for the country as a whole but I visited Warsaw and Krakow and I absolutely loved Krakow . I 'm from Portugal and I do n't really see a future in my country and Poland seems to be in a good place economically , cost of living is cheaper and salaries are about the same or even higher ( I 'm a web developer ) than in Portugal . So it seems like a good choice . But since being somewhere as a tourist is very different from living somewhere , I have a few questions : - How bad is it really with religion and the conservative government ? I have n't met that many poles while traveling but the few I did seemed pretty fed up with religion and with the impact it had on their lives and they spoke to me about it out of their own initiative . Maybe I was unlucky but how big is the influence of religion in this country ? - How is the public healthcare ? According to what I found on google it seems almost required to have private insurance to have effective care , correct ? - Do you think it 's a good idea to move there ? : ) - Any other cities you think I should absolutely visit before making up my mind ? Gdansk ? Poznan ? About Krakow : - While researching I found out that smog could be a problem . Is this still true ? How bad is it ? - I can rely on trams for my transportation , right ? I would n't want to have a car and Krakow seemed great for that . Thank you : )",Romance,Portugese
11111000101,IWantOut,"Hey everyone ! As most of you probably know the situation in Portugal is sort of shitty money-wise so I 've been thinking about leaving . Europe is an option but I would have to sacrifice the great weather I have here so I 'd like to explore other options . I 'm aware that the US has a lot of problems but AFAIK as long as you have a job there and do n't do anything too stupid you can manage to live better than you do here . I feel somewhat close to the US already , they export their culture everywhere , a lot of the things I use daily were made there and reddit is very US-centric so I end up absorbing little nuggets of info here and there about the country . Still , it 's nowhere near a replacement to actually going there and experiencing things for myself . Especially the people . Even if I did ... the country is huge so things could be very different depending on where I went . So ... I 've been entertaining the idea of moving to California . The weather is very similar to Portugal 's and as a web developer it 'd mean I 'd be close to where the most important companies in my field are ( or seem to be ) . It also seems more progressive , or at least that 's the image I have . Unfortunately it seems really difficult to move to the US and I wonder if it 's realistic to think that I could get in or if it 'd be a good idea to do so . I 'm 26 with a bachelor 's degree and about 3 years of experience in Web Development . What are my options here ?
