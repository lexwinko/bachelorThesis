19O5,Fitness,"After years of experimenting I 've found the best quark recipe that 'll make you enjoy your quark ! So , I go with the [ 'Bio Magerquark ' from Aldi ] ( http : //images.fatsecret.com/food/7faa028c-f622-4d86-ba44-c1f18a202907.jpg ) ( living in Germany ) . I use half of the quark which is 125g . It 's a bit more expensive compared to the others ( double the price ) but it 's worth it . Of course you could take any low fat quark because the recipe makes it tasty anyway . By the way Bio stands for organic . Then I add about [ 15g of organic muesli ] ( https : //d9gkwhfwam31p.cloudfront.net/0296776/4775570_lightbox.png ) . Then 30ml of milk ( 0,3 % fat ) , and 30g of Whey protein powder and here the taste matters , because I 'm using strawberry protein powder which gives my quark the strawberry taste . I 'm eating my quark in the morning , so it 's my breakfast ( therefore Whey ) but if you eat your quark in the evening ( quark contains up to 80 % casein protein ) then you should of course use casein protein powder . And the last ingredient I use , is the [ calorie free strawberry syrup ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/Walden-Farms-Syrup-Strawberry-Ounce/dp/B000W7GXZ2 ) , some drops already makes a difference . And they have some varieties too . If you follow my steps you 'll have an amazing conistency of the low fat quark which makes your quark neither too solid nor too liquid .

19O5,greece,"Hey neighbours : ) I taught myself the Greek alphabet and can read it perfectly . When it comes to writing , I make a few mistakes or do n't know what letter to use , so therefore I wanted to ask that stuff here . - So there are several **i** 's , what 's the difference between them and when do I know what to use which one ? - What 's the use of *oi* or *ai* , When there 's i or e ? - are accents for widely used to make sure which syllable is emphasized ? - is it right to say that if there 's no *k* after *g* that the *g* is not pronounced ? - is in modern Greek the *d* pronounced like the th in that ? Because I felt like that - is it sure to say that *b* which is now pronounced like a *v* , the reason that *b* exists as *mp* ? - is there any reason why *au* and *eu* become pronounced like af or ef although there is *ph/f* ? By the way last question not language related . So AFAIK Greece is Ellada , but I see people using hellas . What 's the difference ? By the way I think that the Greek alphabet is the most beautiful alphabet after Arabic . I really love it and learnt it because it looks so pretty . Now it 's a bit useful to read Greek road signs . From time to time I listen to Greek songs and sing along or read Greek news to hold my level . Maybe one day I 'll learn Greek as well . And I do n't get how some diaspora Greeks are not able to read or write in Greek . It 's amazing .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,arabs,"I came across this today : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_Arabic So I knew about the Cypriot Maronite people of Cyprus , but never really did research on them . And I was wondering if their Arabic is similar to any of the Arabic dialects . *Ismi* *o* *Kumetto . * *Ayşo* *ismak l-id ? * - *My name is Kumetto . What is your name ? * *Ismi l-ana o Pavlo . Ayşo ismik l-idi ? * - *My name is Pavlo . What is your name ? ( fem . ) * *L-aδa aş pikulullu ? * - *What is his name ? * *L-ism tel l-yapati o Antoni* - *My father 's name is Antoni* *Xmenye u tisca aşka pisawnna ? * - *What do eight and nine make ? * *Pisawnna caşra u sapca . * - *They make seventeen* *Aş xar kan imps ? Imps kan Yamuxmis* - *What day was yesterday ? Yesterday was Thursday* *Aş xar tte kun pukra ? Pukra tte kun Yamussift* - *What day is tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday* *Yamuxxat marrux fi li knise* - *On Sunday we go to church* *Kilt xops ma zaytun , xaytċ casel u şraft xlip tel pakra* - *I ate bread with olives , some honey and drank some cow 's milk* *Ye* - *Yes* *La* - *No* So , I guess that δ ( delta ) is probably pronounced like a dhal ( like in medhep ) , since it is pronounced in modern Greek like that as well . The ş ( like in shop ) is taken from the Turkish alphabet . The x is probably pronounced like an h or like a 7 . In Greek alphabet the x is equivalent to h. There 's also this letter ċ I have no clue about . - > ع/ayn Unfortunately I could n't find out more about their language specifically . But if you are interested I found some articles about them . [ Article 1 ] ( http : //www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/people/cypmaronites/dialect.html ) , [ Article 2 ] ( http : //linguisticsoman.blogspot.de/2012/01/cypriot-maronite-arabic-descendants-of.html ) Maronites and their Arabic : In 1974 , thousands of Maronites streamed across the Green Line leaving their homeland for an uncertain future in the Greek Christian south after Turkish troops invaded northern Cyprus . The intervention followed a decade of ethnic strife between the Greek and Turkish communities and a coup aimed at bringing about unification with Greece . The Maronites left behind them ancestral villages such as Agia Marina , Asomatos , Carpasia and Kormakitis . The latter is the only remaining place on Cyprus where Cypriot Maronite Arabic - **a dialect infused with a melange of Turkish , Italian and Greek words** - is still spoken.The dialect 's long isolation from the main currents of the Arab world has caused it to develop on a track of its own , to such an extent that it is practically unintelligible to English speakers of Arabic . Linguists are puzzled by the characteristics it shares with the medieval Arabic dialect spoken in Baghdad by the Muslims and Jews , even as they point to evidence that it has reached an advanced stage of language death .

She considers herself being from Turkey , but being Christian Arabic though , but is in full solidarity as being from Turkey . That 's very common by now , and due to Kurdish migration , it is very much inhabited by Kurds and by Turkmens also . What I love about Turkey is , we have places with influence of different ethnicities , Anatolia has Hittite , Lydian , Byzantine , Greek , Armenian , Assyrian backgrounds , and nowadays provinces and local cultures are influenced by different Kurdish , Arabic , Turkmen , Albanian , Bosnian , Circassian , Lazuri , Turkish people and cultures . We differ a lot , but in the end we are people from Anatolia , people from Turkey . I really find it annoying that people of the Arab World still claim parts of Turkey , due to the fact that most of the Arab states themselves have uncertain borders , and yet they claim , claim and claim . Funny , last week a Syrian dude I was talking to was saying , 'but you know Hatay is ought to be ours , right ? ' .

If you wan na support the supplement companies financially , go ahead , because your loading phase dosage of 20-30g of creatine is 4 to 6 times of creatine you should take a day . Supplement companies know that we know how much protein we should take , but they can fool around with creatine , and too many BroScientists still believe in loading phase and higher dosages , because they want to believe it , or they went through it successfully . But 5 grams a day will have the same effect as 20 grams a day , because your body ca n't take up more than 5 grams anyway .

So we have short vowels , and every vowel is short , but if you want them to be pronounced like a long vowel , ^is used to make them longer , or double *a*s or ğ . For example : alâmet ( pronounced like alaamet ) . So this is an Arabic loan word , and you 'll find ^a lot in Arabic loan words , but ^ is n't used any more , so you will just know by speaking it that the second a is a long vowel . aa : kaale almamak ( to play it down ) : again we have an Arabic loan word here with a long vowel . ğ : Kağanlık ( khaganate ) : well there 's a binding between both *a*s but nowadays you wo n't hear the binding very much and it will sound like kaanlık depending on the person talking .",Turkic,Turkish

It 's a lot of upheaval . & gt ; When I say do n't write down vowels , I mean , unlike in the quran , where pronounciation is dictated strongly and every vowel spelled out , common writing does n't really have that . But some scholars see this as a transition state to a future form of farsi where it 's more codified . That 's what I meant by not writing down the vowels , makes it harder for our language . Well it 's impossible for us Turks to read old texts in Ottoman archives , because it 's Turkish , but in Arabic script . That 's write , but the latin script is fitting our language really well , and a transition back can be considered as ruled out . & gt ; I do n't see why turkish could n't use a modified version of the arabic alphabet tbh . It was used in that way in Ottoman times though .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,iran,"& gt ; I do n't know why any language could n't use another alphabet . Well , if we did n't use any vowels like you and the Arabs in the written form , there could be heavy misunderstandings . For example : 'sıkıldım ' means I am bored , and 'sikildim ' means I am fucked . Well , there 's not that much of a different between the latin and the cyrillic alphabet except for that the cyrillic alphabet is used the way it is written . That of course does not fit to French , English or some parts of other Latın languages like Spanish ( gue vs güe ) or İtalian ( cia vs ca ) for example . Turkish is pronounced the way it is written so Turkish would totally function with the cyrillic alphabet . Proof for that is Crimean Tatar or Tatar and other Turkic languages used and used before like Azerbaijani .",Turkic,Turkish

Well it was n't our culture anyway . So it is quite legitimate , is n't it ? Turks had an alphabet before Islam : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_inscriptions Turks had another religion before Islam : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengrism With Islam and Osman Bey , the Turks adopted more and more Arabic and Persian culture . Atatürk brought us back to our Turkish roots . The latin alphabet fits Turkish more as well . While you guys mostly do n't use any vowels , we have to do so . For example : sıkıldım ( I am bored ) , sikildim ( I am fucked ) . We are Turkish , not Arabic , not Persian , and Atatürk did the great step to bring our nation forward and to cut a border to Islam which is a backwarded religion in my opinion . Those Turkish wannabe Arabs like Erdoğan and his followers who read for example and pray for example in Arabic although they do n't understand shit ; these want that kind of Ottoman times back .

I swear it 's so hard to describe , a bit like , think of how Arabs pronounce Youssef , and the last vowel , that 's very similar to ı . & gt ; However , turkish itself is uralic right ? And it amalgamated many farsi and arabic words into it . Are those still as common or were they culled during reforms ? Well , the Türk Dil Kurumu ( Turkish language institution ) started at some point after the foundation of the republic simply by replacing used Arabic and Farsi loan words by their Turkish word . So we still have a lot of Farsi originated words , but there were definitely much more . & gt ; I also disagree with your `` harder for turkish '' argument , Even someone here commented that reading Farsi in Arabic alphabet is a bit harder . I learnt how to read Greek and Cyrillic and can say that I can read by now relatively very fast Serbian for example . And if I read Croatian or Bosnian , that 's even faster . Of course that differs from person to person and their first alphabet .",Turkic,Turkish

About end of the first decade of the Millennium Erdoğan realized that it is pretty impossible to become part of the EU , and changed his policies internally , but also he changed his attitude externally . Erdoğan lead the country in the first years to economic stability , but with the general election in 2007 where his party won the absolute majority of the seats , he realized that he has the ultimate power and is accepted by the people . Out of fear , he started to weaken the army by processes where generals and important people were told to be part of the 'state within the state ' , so they were jailed . Erdoğan had by that the control of the army again . Fearing a coup d'etat , he had to go the direction the army wanted before , with the US and Israel . After this , he literally did what he wanted . Erdoğan started a neo-Ottoman line . Wanted to become the hegemon of the Middle East and the Balkans . But except for Macedonia and Bosnia , we do n't have much influence in the Balkans . In the Middle East he supported Mursi , and said that Sisi became president by a coup who needs to be sorted out .

Great attitude , great father ! & gt ; I am aged 46 [ ... ] I found out that Islam is man made at the age of 15 . Have been in the closet since . Same for my father , I guess , although my father never admitted to be ( in public ) Atheist or Agnostic , but does n't say that he 's a Muslim as well , or believes in Islam . His parents were all Hajjis , so he always kept it for himself . But he was criticizing a lot of times how Muslims ( esp . Turkish politicians ) use Islam for their benefits . He 's 53 , and he told me he 's a non believer since he 's 16 . When I was younger , I was very much influenced by my maternal grandparents who we 're living close to , they would every time they had the possibility bash my father for being not religious ( enough ) . I did n't like my father very much between the ages of 15 to 18 where I was quite religious , and I was always like 'I wish my father would have taught me how to pray properly , would have gone with me for Jumah 's prayer ' etc . Now , I really have interesting conversations with my father , and I 'm proud of my father for being free in his thinking to accept that Islam and religions in general are man made . My sisters and mother are quite religious in their thinking , but not very active , so they fasted this Ramadhan , and went from time to time to Teravih prayer but still they do n't practice in their daily life . If my father was n't around , it would have been much more complicated for me to tell my family that I have become an Atheist . So , everyone should go his own path , I wanted to show you , although I hated my father 's attitude towards religion , now I love him for thinking freely . But do n't forget , if your wife and the people around you ( relatives ) were n't Muslims , your kids would n't have been Muslims as well .

19O5,CasualConversation,"It 's mostly not the colour , but the shape of the clothes . I have an older sister who has a great sense for fashion . And I started dressing fine with her help mostly . Since you 're fourteen I do n't know how you 're gon na feel my fashion advice , but if you 'd go with that , then you 'd definitely stand out among your friends . The thing is to look classy , casual and nice . Let 's start with shoes : Of course we all like sneakers , do n't we ? But everyone wears them , especially in your age , so we wan na look a bit different , not just normal . Therefore I recommend two types of shoes : [ These kinda boots ] ( http : //i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v2/1070167088_1/Wholesale-Best-Seller-Discount-Top-Class-Mens-Lace-Up-font-b-Suede-b-font-font-b.jpg ) [ these kinda shoes ] ( http : //www.restposten-germany.de/shop/images/product_images/popup_images/934_2.jpg ) or [ these ones ] ( http : //sp-product-images.s3.amazonaws.com/31599/pic1.jpg ) . Both shoes are relatively cheap , you do n't need to buy $ 150 shoes and be a burden to your parents , and they look classy . You can find these kind of shoes for a very cheap price on the internet ( mediocre quality ) or for a higher price in shops ( very good quality ) . Let 's continue with pants : Well , I was wearing jeans basically till I was about 18,19 , then I stopped wearing jeans and started wearing pants . I still have like two or three pants in my wardrobe but I almost never wear them . So depending on the colour of your shoes , you could go with [ these pants ] ( http : //cyt.mytrends.de/eb/m1chinohose1/s4.jpg ) [ or these ones ] ( http : //cyt.mytrends.de/eb/L5502mzui/s1.jpg ) .

It needs to look cool and not too 'formal ' . t-shirt : Well I mostly prefer t-shirts with only one colour , but nicely cut/slim fit , and having a v-neck . Like [ this shirt ] ( http : //lp.hm.com/hmprod % 3Fset % 3Dsource % 255B/environment/2014/3BL_0126_001R.jpg % 255D , rotate % 255B0.3 % 255D , width % 255B3969 % 255D , height % 255B4640 % 255D , x % 255B739 % 255D , y % 255B29 % 255D , type % 255BFASHION_FRONT % 255D % 26hmver % 3D1 % 26call % 3Durl % 255Bfile : /product/full % 255D ) . And to top it off a nice cardigan : [ Like this one ] ( http : //www.wholesale7.net/images/201302/goods_img/69310_P_1361251657297.jpg ) , although it looks like for a bit older people . Or [ this one ] ( http : //4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TMUCxG6RunI/AAAAAAAAAOk/yLNa3BNNKCw/s1600/cardigan14.jpg ) . Jackets are usually more expensive , but you can still find a nice coat for not that much : coat : [ Something like this ] ( http : //www.mlo.me/upen/v/201403/20140310/Modern-Stand-Collar-Cotton-Blend-Mens-Pea-Coat-205538-859174.jpg ) , I do n't like the color though . Start wearing stuff which fits your body size . If you 're an M guy then wear Medium , if you 're an S guy wear Small . Try to stand out , and you 'll get the attention , but the other way round .

Most of these cities were destroyed during the process with large civilian suffering . In Marash , 4.500 Turks died . [ 54 ] The French left the area together with the Armenians after 1920 .

19O5,soccer,"I guess it 's probably Juventus . We had some games with them during the last fifteen years , and one of them was highly controversial , it was during the time of Zidane , Del Piero & amp ; Inzaghi . So basically the head of PKK Abdullah Öcalan was stuck in Italy , and Turkey wanted Italy to hand him over to our intelligence service , however Italy let him flee somewhere else , and there were diplomatic tensions , and Turkish people attacked Italian embassy and burnt Italian flags . So Juventus did all they could to not play the match in İstanbul and the match was postponed to the week after that match , and Turks were really pissed that İtalians indirectly supported the head of a terrorist organization which was the causation for more than 40.000 deaths . In the stadium there were more than 1000 cops , imagine that , We had to win , it was more than a match . Juventus scored , and we equalized in 90+ with a header by Suat Kaya , probably one of the smallest on the field . İt was season 98/99 . Season 03/04 : We have Juventus again in our CL group , and they basically qualified for the next round but we are trying our best to qualify at least for UEFA , so in November 2003 there were terrorist attacks in İstanbul , targets : a synagoge , a British bank and the British embassy . Juventus should have played us in December 2003 , however they did all their best to not play in İstanbul , this time they were successful . So the match had to be played somewhere else in Europe with a high distance to Turkey , and it was decided to be played in the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund . Galatasaray 's European supporters turned Westfalenstadion to hell and Kral Hakan Şükür scored two against them , making us win 2-0 against Juventus , and we were so happy . Again Juventus could n't profit out of the situation . And the third controversy was last years CL campaign in İstanbul , we needed a win to qualify for the next round , and Juve needed either a draw or a win . However the snowfall led to the game being postponed to the day after . The pitch was unplayable in my honest opinion and Juve tried again to get the match postponed to another time or place , however the match was played the next day and Sneijder scored during the last minutes of the game , and we qualified for the next round . Juventus were pissed at us again . So I guess our international rival is Juventus .",Turkic,Turkish

For fact that he was a closet Atheist and abolished the caliphate , invented the Latin alphabet is pretty much enough reason for any conservative to hate Atatürk . Islamic progression you were saying ... is it Islamic to steal the money that belongs to your state ? To build a palace and claim it is the palace of the people ? Is it Islamic to celebrate young students getting attacked by cops for protesting ? Is it Islamic to jail people who do n't agree with you ? I do n't know if that is Islamic progression , it 's a dictatorship , and his sheep will follow him as long as he mentions the prophet , Islam every third or fourth sentence . Then again , when I look at any Muslim state , I see that they are either ruled by religious maniacs or are undemocratic . So I guess , yes Turkey made Islamic progress , according to that .",Turkic,Turkish

The others ( Central Asia , Siberia , East Turkestan ) , well we have the same language roots and we can understand each other enough to understand the context but we differ a lot culturally . I really do n't feel any special connection to them except for knowing that we have the same roots lingually and racially . I consider central Asian Turks to be our relatives . However , they 're more like the cousins we never meet . Like the cousins in your family you have almost no contact to , but you meet once or twice a year for a family fest .

And since we 're gon na play 4231 , the last spot is reserved for a foreign winger that could be either Bruma or Nordin .

19O5,arabs,"& gt ; why Arabs dislike Ataturk Please enlighten me . & gt ; Ataturk `` saved '' your country and your people . He threw the Arabs , and every facet of Arab culture he could , under the bus just to be more similar to Europeans . The rest left of the country was mainland Anatolia . Back then it was mainly populated by Greeks , Turks , and Kurds , and in the South a minority of Arabs . What is your problem with Atatürk ?",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,arabs,"On the other hand the Egyptians were cool with that . The problem was that the Empire declined under the rule of Sultan Abdülmecid . Especially his legitimacy was damaged with the Young Turks gaining more power . You have to see it from a different perspective . The Empire was declining , but that does n't mean that the solution created out of this mess of the WWI was the best outcome for Arabs and the Ottoman Empire . It was the best outcome for the foreigners for sure though .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,arabs,"& gt ; What ? You 'd rather we join the great Turkish Republic with Ataturk ? Oh boy , Atatürk back then was a commander busy fighting against the British in Çanakkale . So you think it was a right decision to fight against the Ottomans , with the British and the French ? Wow , I 'm quite surprised about that . Because first of all , the intentions of the British and the French were to destabilize the Middle East for their own benefits . They partitioned a whole entity , and created states within states within states . With the creation of the British and the French , there 's no and there will be no Pan-Arabism . Why ? Simply : 1 - The foreigners divided the states to create a larger influence and to control them . If those states were as big as the initial Arab states like [ The Kingdom of Syria ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/FEisalkingdom.png ) they were seen as a threat to their own benefits . Who the fuck destroyed that Kingdom ? The French . Why would they do that ? Because it is against the colonial mentality of divide & amp ; rule . Do you really think those foreigners wanted the good for you ? 2 - Puppets : The foreigners installed puppets of them in office in the created Arab states . 3 - Filistin : Jews started to migrate to Palestine after it was under British control . Later they fought against the British , but when it was under Ottoman control , there was no such thing as the wish of Jews to create an independent Jewish state . It came later with the Arab-British conquer of Palestine . Great job . With your first question , I see that you have no clue about WWI and the Turkish War of Independence , but let me enlighten you . Turks basically lost WW I and lost most of their territories , outside of Anatolia . The WWI ended in defeat for the Ottoman Empire and the [ Treaty of Sèvres ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/TreatyOfSevres_ % 28corrected % 29.PNG ) was signed . The treaty included the partitioning of Anatolia as you can see on the map . So we were basically fucked . But Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as a commander could n't accept the circumstances like the Turkish people . And he formed the Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi - the Grand Assembly , and declared war on the occupiers . The Ottoman Sultanate and the traitors who signed the Treaty of Sèvres were overthrown and Atatürk 's victory ended in the signing of [ the Treaty of Lausanne ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne ) . This treaty reinstalled Turkey in its form before it was occupied , leaving only the question of Hatay open . I do n't know why there 's so much hate towards Atatürk among Arabs , but he saved our country and our people . If he would n't have started our War of Independence we would have been cocksucking some foreign dick right now , trust me ! He 's the greatest person who 's ever lived , at least in my world .

19O5,arabs,"Arabs fought with the British against the Ottoman Army , because the British promised them independence in return . However , the Turks still feel backstabbed by the Arabs for supporting the British . The Palestinian flag and the Pan-Arabic colors were invented during the Arab revolt by a Briton . The flag was seen as the flag of the Arab revolt and became later the flag of Palestine after its independence . The British and French have replaced the leaders of the Arab states with their allies . For example [ this guy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali , _Sharif_of_Mecca ) is a good example . Most of the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire did n't necessarily want independence , since back then the religion shaped the identity of the different peoples . However , the British accomplished to convince some Arabs to start a revolt , which lead to a wide spread war against the Ottomans . For example the Egyptians were not supportive of the revolt , it was more the Levant , and especially the Hejaz . Sadly the Arabs shot into their own foot ( that 's how I 'd say it in Turkish ) , and today we can see the struggle of the Arab World as a consequence - especially in the case of Palestine .",Turkic,Turkish

It happened recently more often in South East Anatolia . Especially in Kahramanmaraş , Gaziantep or Şanlıurfa . The thing is , and I 'm pretty sure about that , that these people do n't hate the Syrians that they 're Syrian and in our country . So I would rule blind fascism against immigrants/refugees out . Why ? Because there are quite high numbers of Kurds , Turks and Arabs in South East Anatolia . The thing is , the government literally put large numbers of Arabs at some critical places . And since Syrians have taken some places over , or offer work for less money , there are places where Arabic is spoken and people would n't understand Turkish . That kind of stuff you know . And when it happens that a Syrian does some bullshit ( a Syrian killed his landlord recently , some Syrians beat up a child ) it 's easy to gather and chase some Syrians . This kind of stuff makes me really sad , I want our people to not be a burden to already suffering Syrians , but our government fucked up . First of all they involved themselves in the Syrian Civil War , they supported/support ( ? ) the FSA , Al Nusra , ISIS . Why ca n't fucking Erdoğan keep his nose out of a crucial situation ?

19O5,arabs,"& gt ; Ataturks downside is that he was a racist supremacist with a vision that simply did not match with reality . Wow , actually I 've never heard Atatürk being called a racist supremacist , so that 's interesting . I 've heard him being called : gay , Greek , Macedonian , Crypto Jew , Crypto Armenian , alcoholic bastard , Islamophobe , Arab hater , Kurd hater , French cocksucker , wannabe western . And probably more that I ca n't remember . But if you are hated that much , you either did a pretty good job , or a pretty bad one . And I 'm sure that it 's not the latter one . So you were talking about the 'de-Arabifying ' as a racist aspect . What 's racist about giving your nation a whole new identity and taking it back to its roots ? We are Turks , we 're neither Arabic , nor Persian . We are neither Western , nor Eastern . We are neither fully for Islam , nor fully against it . We are stuck in between east and west , between Islamic World and Christians . Imagine that we lived side by side with Armenians , Kurds , Greeks , Arabs , Persians , Georgians and later the Soviets . And all of them except for the Persians and the Soviets wanted a piece of us . Atatürk generated a Turkish identity that was more than more or less the religion of Islam . And I 'm very glad for that . He created a secular state , so our people wo n't get beaten with lashes like in most Arab countries . I 'm an Atheist , so , as an Atheist , can you imagine how fucking great it is that I can be freely an Atheist and do n't have to fear for my life ? So that said ; & gt ; Arabic culture It was n't particularly Arabic culture but Islamic culture . For example our elders wash their butts after defecation . You 're talking about Persian or Arabic culture , yet we have different cultures within Turkey . These would n't have existed if Atatürk 's reforms would n't have been executed so successfully . The West Turkish culture differs from for example the South East Turkish culture , but how can u know it ? You 're ignorant , and talk about our culture . And all you have seen is probably Istanbul . & gt ; Ataturk 's actions are simply racist , and are akin to Hitler 's dream of purifying his Aryan people . What the fuck ? ? ? We Turks are mostly a mixture of different races . I know my ethnic origin , and my [ forefathers used to be Nomads ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y % C3 % B6r % C3 % BCks ) . However most of the Turks either do n't know their ethnic origin , and do n't care , or they know their ethnic origin and still consider themselves Turkish . You 're talking totally Bullshit , there was no such movement like purifying the Turkish race . WTF ? ? ? What you mean by Turkifying though , is a whole another aspect . That was no part of Atatürk 's policies though . Turks are and were predominantly in Anatolia . We have people of different ethnicities in our country from the Balkans , Caucasus , Middle East . What you are probably trying to say is actually exactly the same Arabs did with the Berber people . I have the feeling you 're mad at Atatürk for giving us an identity that would have been lost with the downfall of the Ottoman Empire . I really feel that there 's a lot of ignorance and hatred towards Atatürk , mostly from people who hate him for being successful .

19O5,Turkey,"Well , we ca n't say that the Westerners simply drew the borders along ethnicities or religions/sects . So therefore the situations emerge like we have nowadays . There 's a 'balkanization ' of the Middle East about to occur . As someone who has knowledge about the end of Yugoslavia , I can see that happening in the Balkans as well . Although the people might have different sects , religions or languages , ethnicities , they can live together - until they demand complete self-determination in form of a state . Maybe , maybe the Iraqi Kurds should be governing themselves as a state , at least they are the ones deserving it most in my eyes . I actually think that if the Kurds became independent , who 'd be next ? But if it should be only one state , I 'd say Iraqi Kurdistan . But that would lead to problems within Turkey though . Ca n't imagine the wish to hold a referendum among Kurds and such kind of political demands . I think that your points make sense though , and your time has come now to show the people that you can function along all that fuck that is going on in your region .

19O5,Turkey,"Hi , My view on KRG : Pro : KRG could be a reliable partner in a region full of terror and fighting . They seem to have no or much less troubles within their region , and it is quite expectable that they wo n't have any in the future . Con : I am first of all supporting the territorial integrity of Iraq . I see Iraq as a failed state since the US decided to fuck Saddam , and therefore I support Iraq and want them to unite their own people and to live in peace and harmony . I think Iraq should become a federal state , so the different peoples in Iraq - Kurds , Turkmens , Assyrians , Shiites , Sunni Arabs can live in peace and harmony . The KRG are trying to make use of the fucked up situation right now in Iraq - they try to extend their territory by claiming cities which were left by the Iraqi army . I do n't like this policy at all , since most of the oil fields are in the north anyway , and they want to claim the most , and they try to assimilate the other ethnic minorities . They either tolerated or supported the PKK for decades as well . Also an established independent state of Kurdish Iraq would lead to the wish to extend their territory . Especially the Kurdish minority of Turkey would want to 'unite ' with them , so that could be dangerous for Turkey , Iran and Syria . Minority language : Well , that 's a bit different compared to other states . Turkey was founded after the Turkish War of Independence and by that time the percentage of Kurds was much less compared to nowadays ' numbers . The desire was to have a united country , no matter of the ethnicity . So nowadays you can find people of different ethnicities like Laz , Circassian , Albanians , Bosniaks , Arabs , Crimeans , Tatars , Kurds , Zaza . The thought to have only one language was simply to keep the different ethnicities united . And that pretty well worked , except for the Kurds . What I criticize is that the Kurds were forbidden to speak Kurdish , which is wrong . Everybody should be able to speak their mother tongue , but the official language should be remained as Turkish .",Turkic,Turkish

And I still do n't . You know what you should do imo ? Look for some Turks from Turkey and talk to them in Turkish for example via skype , and maybe a tandem , where they 'll speak in English and you in Turkish . So it 's a win-win situation . I do that to improve my French and Spanish , and it really works , cause there are tons of people who realize how important English is and they wan na talk in English .

What did he do ? Sign for fucking İnter on a free deal . And when he was playing for Newcastle and called a black player the 'n-word ' and was accused for being a racist , Galatasaray backed him from İstanbul not only by supporting him , but trying to tell the media , that he 's a nice guy and whatsoever . After Newcastle he signed in 2008 for Fenerbahçe , because 'he always was a Fenerbahçe fan ' , at that time we had financial problems and Fenerbahçe had overtaken us not only financially but sportive as well . It was like being stabbed at the back . And his words before the derby were 'Galatasaray is no special team to me , it 's just one of our opponents like the 16 other teams ; so I do n't see a reason why I should n't celebrate if I score ' .

We won the Turkish Cup without playing against any of the big teams . But it was his decisions , which made him controversial . He for example bought shitty players with the budget he got . He bought for example Salih for 2.75 Million , Hajrovic for 3.5 Million , and these players , though , he gave these players no real chance ! On the other side , he played Burak the whole season as a right winger , and Sneijder as a left winger . And that did n't work out at all .

However , I 'm gon na grab the German citizenship next month , and I really look further to leave this country , after finishing studying .

But these people do n't get that the location where I live does n't change my nationality . However , the thing is : a successful Turk is a German or a German with Turkish roots like Mesut Özil ; a failed Turk , who eg . killed someone , he should be deported back to Turkey . Although bother motherfuckers were born and raised in Germany . Funny thing is that , Mesut Özil , ca n't neither speak proper Turkish nor proper German . That kid is a total failure , but is incredibly talented when it comes to football . But they see him as a perfect model for integration .

I really loved all these Italian legends , and it was nice to see Milan being so successful in the 2000 's , and later Inter being so successful in the late 2000 's with finally winning the Champions League .

Nowadays you have people from Karadeniz who are obviously Rum or Georgian or whatever , but they consider themselves being Turkish . However , my point is , you can have a dominant majority and still have secularism . It 's just since Tayyip , it 's not legitimate as much as it was anymore . People are starting to question Atatürk 's importance . People are wishing back the Ottoman Empire , just because 'we ' were so powerful and 'led by our faith ' .

That catastrophe gave us though the Republic of Turkey , and we have our country , our language , and we can be Turkish . However , since I said that I supported national states , I have to say that during that time the World was fucked up anyway . But you are the only victims in the whole World right ? Africa was enslaved back then , South America was not fully independent , half of Asia was under the control of super powers . Even Central Europe/Balkans was largely under the control of three major states , German Empire , Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire . I never heard a Serb bitching about Austrians and Hungarians , but they always bitch about Turks . What do you want me to say ? ? ? History is history , I am not even mad at Greeks , Armenians and all these people who have murdered Turks . For your information the Greeks lit my village before withdrawing during Turkish War of İndependence . And in a short time I 'll start studying Greek .

If your country was so keen on getting your economy and relations better instead of trying to get a fiction recognized , you 'd be in a better situation .

19O5,syriancivilwar,"Well ın Iraq the Kurds have their own autonomy . That 's the biggest difference . Although the Iraqi Kurds diverse a lot as well , they 've been mostly united by their fight against Saddam , or now by their fight against ISIS . There 's the Barzani and Talabani clan . Talabani used to be/is president of Iraq , Barzani is leading the KRG . Although most of the Kurds in Iraq are Sunnis , there are a bit more than 500,000 Ezidis which makes about 10 % of the Iraqi Kurdish population . The KRG seems to be relatively stable , and they are committed to the unity of Iraq . Recently though , they 've declared anti Iraq statements , and it can be observed that the Peshmerga are fighting for the flag of Kurdistan and not Iraq . They are also in some bigger cities like Erbil assimilating Arabs , Turkmens and Christians , to create a bigger influence on the occupied territory and claim bigger lands , especially the areas where oil is . The Syrian Kurds , I actually do n't know much about them , but they do not play a big role as far as I know , even in the region where they are , they do n't play much of a role , since those areas are not homogeneous . I know that they are mostly Sunnis . The Turkish Kurds , well I could write a lot about them since I have much more knowledge of them compared to Kurds in other states . But I 'm gon na try to keep it relatively short . They were discriminated in the past , mostly because they are a very big group , and claim to have the right to have special rights as a big minority group . Well , the Kurds were promised an independent country , in nowadays South Eastern Turkey by the treaty of Sevres . However , Atatürk won the war of independence , and created Turkey under one flag , one language . So some Kurds were upset , and some started an uprising in Tunceli in 1938 , but the government suppressed that . Kurdish became a forbidden language . But for example İsmet İnönü , the president after Atatürk , and Atatürk 's closest partner in during the war of independence and after the independence , was even partially Kurdish . But that 's quite common , and not a big deal . Even Öcalan , the founder of PKK is only half Kurdish , his mother is Turkish . So we Turks and by Turks I mean people from Turkey , are very mixed , and that 's why Atatürk created a state under one language to stop any separation by forbidding minority languages , and by centralization . Nowadays Kurds have got special rights to some extend . I am neutral about this , so are many Turks . But most of the Kurds do not support PKK , though , they 'd like to have more rights . So it is twisted , since PKK claims to serve in the interest of those Kurds . The main problem is though , that the education level in South East Turkey is the lowest in Turkey , so unemployment and ignorance are the biggest issues .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,syriancivilwar,"ISIS is less of a threat to Turkey than PKK . It is easier to take control of a state that is in a civil war . As a matter of fact , ISIS took most Syrian territory simply from the FSA . There might be suicide bombings in Turkey , true ... But the same could be done by PKK as well , right ? The fact Turkey is not supporting any air strikes from İncirlik Air Base , is the same as in 2003 , it 's because the government is militarily not on good terms with the American administration . Turkey is not interested in supporting America . Simple as that . Politics is about interests not about solving problems like Reza Aslan said , I really liked this sentence , and I think that this sentence is pretty much a good explanation why some things happen although they could be prevented . For example the US supporting Saudi Arabia , which supported ISIS .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,syriancivilwar,"There was no such thing as a genocide against the Kurds . The only 'massacre ' committed by Turks was the Tunceli events , which was actually an uprising by Kurds , destroyed by the Turkish forces . The thing about the PKK is , that most of the westerners I am referring to , do n't care about their history , because they are ignorant , or because they are fighting ISIS . Turkey could n't do anything because of the hostage situation . And still , ıt 's not any issue of Turkey . As long as Turkey is n't attacked , I see no reason for involvement in Syria . In Iraq Turkey could have involved in the situation of the Ezidis and Shia ' Turkmens . Considering that Erdoğan and Barzani are close to each other , but again there was the hostage situation . Syria declared that they 'd declare war to Turkey if Turkey involves in any kind of situation in their country . So Turkey should not get involved in Syria , but they could have got involved in Iraq . PKK burnt down more than 25 schools in eastern Turkey last week , because some letters the Kurds use are banned , how can that be justified ? Anyway the support for PKK is declining in South East Turkey . But among western Kurds they are very liked since they do n't have to deal with their bullshit .",Turkic,Turkish

How the US killed hundred thousands of Vietnamese , Iraqi and Afghan civilians . How the US supported undemocratic coups in countries like Turkey , or in Latin America . Fact is , every nation did more or less crimes in the past . But to bringing a topic up , that 's quite irrelevant here does n't solve the issue . If you are so keen on researching 'genocides ' , then look up the so called 'Assyrian Genocide ' which was mainly committed by the Kurds ! ! ! ! ! Kurdish was forbidden until mid 2000s , they were not allowed to teach in their language , and they were not given any extra rights , while they always had the same rights as the Turks or any other minority in Turkey . That 's why the PKK was founded and that 's why they were supported . But since the PKK committed crimes in Kurdish villages , collected money from the people against their will , recruited kids or young people against their parents ' will by propaganda , the Kurds are not supporting PKK as much as they did , nevertheless they support BDP and HDP to seek the power on a political level .

Atatürk and many other Turks could n't accept that , and the Turkish awakening started with Atatürk going to Samsun , leading to the start of Turkish War of Independence against the occupiers and the traitors of the Ottoman Sultanate in 1919 . Atatürk and his followers won the war , and Atatürk created a republic , demolished the caliphate , the sharia law , implemented Switzerland based humanitarian laws instead . He reformed the Turkish language , adapted it to the latin alphabet , and even prohibited the Quran and the Adhan in Arabic , from then on it was in Turkish . So people could understand what they are praying , and that makes sense , does n't it ? ? ? Reasons to hate him as an Islamist : He used to love his rakı , and demolished the caliphate and the sharia law , made Turkey secular .",Turkic,Turkish

We play now in a 4-2-3-1 system : GK is Muslera , he 's fantastic , experienced and imo one of the 10 best goalies in the world , reliable ! our defense line should be like this : ( RB ) Veysel-Semih-Chedjou-Alex Telles ( LB ) There 's definitely the chemistry in our defense missing , Alex likes to push forward like a typical Brazilian . Semih is good at marking and tackling , he 's like an old school CB , Chedjou is good in the air , and usually is the guy for building up from the back , makes sometimes silly mistakes though . Veysel is a good one , but he 's more or less our RB because of the foreign players limit in our league . Midfield : Melo-Selçuk Melo is defensively amazing , works really hard , can score from set pieces and is reliable . Selçuk used to be amazing , two seasons ago , he 's declining , but still can play amazing passes , he 's our Nuri Şahin . Watch out for his free kicks , they 're incredible . Attack : Olcan ( RW ) -Sneijder ( AM ) -Bruma ( LW ) Olcan is a good winger who can score from distance , is solid in 1vs1 situations and he can play deadly passes . Sneijder , I think no words needed , when he 's fit and in great shape , he could be really the one deciding if we go through or play Europa League . Bruma , well , He 's out of a 6-months injury , he 's torn his ACL , he 's an incredible talent , really fast , good on 1vs1 situations , but lacks to see the better positioned player or finishing in general . He needs more time to improve . And this season will be really important since we 're going to play with proper wingers . Forward : Burak : Well , some of you probably remember the Burak Yılmaz who scored 8 goals two seasons ago in CL . He 's been playing out of position since Drogba 's arrival and he lacks confidence atm . He misses incredible chances . But if he gets back to 100 % he can be really important for this team .

Do you really think that if ISIS is beaten , then everything will be alright ? The Kurdish forces for example have helped the Shia in Amerli to expand their territory , not because they want to fight the bad .

Not only . People already wanted Hamza to leave before the season begun . They now have a solid reason to hate . People were mad at the management for not getting Ibra or Konoplyanka or any other transfers . I 've seen people criticizing the management for extending Sabri 's contract and transferring Jem Karacan , Bilal Kısa and for going after Niasse . For example in the case of Niasse : First 'amk Fener van Persie'yi ve Nani'yi aldı bizimkiler Niasse'yi istiyor , bavulunu topla da git Hamza , düş artık yakamızdan' İbra rumours : 'İbra'yı alın da forma alalım , bize İbra şart' then Niasse started to perform excellently in the Russian league : 'bari bunu alsaydınız yönetim , amk ne beceriksiniz' you see that ? At what time these cunts deserve İbra ? As a matter of fact , they think they are vizyonlu when they want a 32 year-old Huntelaar or 35 year-old İbra , but 25 year-old Niasse is vizyonsuzluk . The Turkish fans are fucked up in their minds because they want names , transfers and think with that success will come . These are the same people who wrote after a season with Bruma 'Çabuk satın da elimizde patlamasın' and then they get mad that he has a 8M buy out clause in his loan contract . Or the same people who write stuff as 'Yekta'nın sözleşmesi feshedilmeli nasıl topçu bu ' after photos of his fat shape was posted online , and when his contract got terminated with him getting 600k€ for it , people went like 'Amk , oyuncu bile satamıyoruz , nasıl berceriksiz bir yönetim bu ' . These people get mad at the president for not signing Konoplyanka or Gignac and go like 'elimizden kaçırdık , amk beceriksiz yönetimi ' but they forget the fact that these people probably earn much more where they are . These are also the same who go to facebook pages of our CL rivals and post stuff like 'welcome to hell ' . Turkish fans ' mindset is just retarded .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,4chan,Your education must suck if you do n't know that the proto Bulgars were Turkic warrior tribes . The fact that they were in modern Bulgaria by the seventh century does n't change the fact they were Turkic .,Turkic,Turkish

19O5,soccer,"So , you would n't respect the territorial integrity of a sovereign state ?",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,soccer,"So , you will only accept laws that fit you ? You 're gon na have some trouble in the future .

19O5,soccer,"If he violates Azerbaijani law and that does n't allow him to enter Azerbaijan , then he should stay at home . Our player Emre Aşık was banned from entering Italy after he fought the cops in Rome in a CL match in 2002 . Then when we were about to play an Italian team , it was clear that he 'd stay at home . The sovereignty of a state should be out of question . If a law is violated , the player should not be able to enter the country . It 's just a football player , not a diplomat . Armenia should withdraw from Karabağ and issues as such would n't come up .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,bodybuilding,"Mike ~~Munzer~~ Mentzer felt he was robbed that year .
