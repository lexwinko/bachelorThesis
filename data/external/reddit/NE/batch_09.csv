Happy House : I liked the song , but I 'm not that fan of female vocal . In Dulce Decorum : A good song and the kind of rock I like . The Chameleons : I have already heard a lot from this band before . A good suggestion , thanks . First Chapter : I heard the songs 'Tomorrow Never Knows ' , 'Garden of Delight ' and '1969 ' . My first impression was that it was a little slow-paced , but I liked it and will probably listen to the whole album another day . I liked 1969 the most . Sisters of Mercy : I started by listening to 'Marian ' and it was one of the better songs I 've heard today , even though I 'm not the biggest fan of songs that last over five minutes . There was something I liked about 'Alice ' but the melody was n't that good in my opinion , but as you said their earlier EPs are better . The two last songs I listened to was 'Walk Away ' and 'Train ' . I really liked both song , especially 'train ' and its different kind of sound . Nick Cave and the bad seeds : I liked the way the vocal talks instead of singing in 'Rings of Saturn ' , really unique . I also listened to 'Into My Arms ' which was totally different . I also liked this song , however it was more of a time-to-relax kind of music , and not what I looked for now . Nick Cave and Warren Ellis : After I had listened to the first two songs I realized that maybe I was listening to the wrong Nick Cave , so I checked out another Nick Cave I found on Spotify . I guess this was the Nick Cave you meant , since this was a more punk like band . I listened to 'All the gold in California ' and 'I 'm you 're man ' and they both was the kind of music I was looking for , even though they were a little slow paced .

I think HotS is doing a much better job stretching the game mechanics . Just want to add on anskie 's comment , the game mechanics of Dota 2 has not really been streched that much , if at all , as Monkey King is the only hero that was made originally for that game engine . All the other heroes were created in the Warcraft 3 map editor , for DOTA 1 , and that limited what you could do and could n't do with spells . Some spells have been reworked and only exists in Dota 2 , but no hero has had `` huge '' changes that warrant stretching the game mechanics .

They bought the rights to one of the biggest pop-culture fenomens and we know how wide and interesting the universe can be , based on the first 3 movies . What do they do ? First a movie containing and revolving around the OT characters , a movie about something that happened prior to the OT and Han Solo origin . It 's like ... Do something new and interesting !

I know you have used 3 in midfield for a long time , I 've watched Real a lot since 2013 . Kovacic and Casemiro is different players and Casemiro fit that DM role nicely , leaving Kovacic out of the starting 11 . & gt ; He is the natural heir to Modric who will turn 32 later this year and has shown signs of regression this season . Modric has n't though ... only think is that he might not be able to play that often when it becomes 2-3 games in a week , but he still outperform most midfielders in the world .

It really depends on the system , and yes he is young and all that , but if United comes knocking , saying they would like either Isco or Kovacic , Real could sell with a reason . Asensio is n't sub for those 3 midfielders , and James already seems to be on his way out . Turning 22 , but can be a guranted started at United if he wants to come and play . Real does n't have a big reason to sell because they can just keep him for depth , but the question is if he wants to wait until either of the 3 midfielders right now stop playing for Real , or become a starter for a club ( with possible CL ) I do n't think it 's too out there to suggest a transfer for him , and I think it 's a bigger chance getting him than either of the others ( the reason I suggested it in the first place was because I rather have United spend money on Kovacic than James , not that he was a very realistic buy )",Germanic,Norwegian

The rule changed a couple years ago , last time it happened in PL was when Chelsea won CL and finished 6th . Tottenham lost their CL spot because they finished 4th . After the rule that EL 1st place gave a CL spot , thry changed the rule to 5 teams from one FA allowed .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,reddevils,"I would think it depends on how his contract is , both with Real Madrid and Nike . It could be that in RM contract , he has to be in some ads , while Nike 's contract have to allow CR to be in RM related ads , but he is still sponsered by Nike . This means whenever Ronaldo is with RM , he is `` under a Adidas contract '' while when he does things on his own , he is with Nike . Nike still has his shoes , whenever Ronaldo do interviews on his own he is covered in Nike etc . It benefits Nike more to have Ronaldo on a contract , and also allowing Adidas/RM to use his image rights , than not have him at all . If Adidas had both Ronaldo and Messi , it would blow for Nike not being able to front any so profilic as them . So Ronaldo being in Adidas ads & lt ; Having Ronaldo on contract to use him in private , for Nike . Just my take on it though ...",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,soccer,"It was funny to joke about , because there was the small minority of Spurs fans on here that thought Leicester would collapse while Tottenham would finish the season strong , basically that even tho they were 5 points behind they were the nr . 1 contender for the title . Remember having conversations with delusional Tottenham fans on here how Tottenham would win , when there were 5 or so rounds to go , so when Tottenham collapsed it just felt good to put salt in the wound .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; BW an e-sports that had been going for 10 years had almost 0 scene outside of korea , sure in korea it was THE e-sports but korea was just one country . & gt ; or at least for a time , something BW never managed to do . Because the game came out in 1998 , a time where it would have been impossible . What people point out is that BW made the way for every single other game to develope a pro-scene . People saw how in Korea , BW had a competetive scene with many many pros , and saw it would be possible in their own country . Maybe not with BW , but with other , new games . BW showed people that if you organized and the game was good enough , it could be an e-sport . Not just a tournament at your local school , but a country-wide , even worldwide e-sport . It allowed games and developers to push toward this . Starcraft 2 became `` the esport globally '' , no one denies that , but the godfather of all esport is BW . Anyone saying that SC2 could become what it did without BW is n't seeing it right .",Germanic,Norwegian

But it might look better in-game than in videos .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Doubt it will be that expensive , hopefully not . I will get it either way I think , but not sure how much I will use grapichs ( as they look now , I 'm just too in love of the old look , but can accept HD with some improvements ) I 'm more exicted for ladder system and all that really .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Sorry , completly misread your comment . Or maybe I misread Emu401 , and it lead to me thinking you meant `` grapichs is disabled for ladder '' , but I see what you mean now . Did they comment on it ? I saw it and thought they would update it , as it 's not that big a change and probably wont affect gameplay that much , and is a result of monitors at the time being 4:3 , and in their tests they did n't see it as a big change . However , if they already said it 's disabled for ladder , it 's pretty clear .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"BW is still a better game , and also a more fun game for many people . The limitations are something you improve on , it 's not like a new player is as good as a veteran at controlling their army . Of course , not like that in SC2 either , but it 's not as damning to have all your units in 1 hotkey . Which is why BW have a bigger `` compete with yourself '' aspect that many enjoy in games . Look how big MOBA games are when people feel they are competing with themselves to be better , and not feel like the game is unbalanced to favor the other race/player . There is something satisfying to us to get better at things that is harder . Getting better at army control or macro in SC2 is not as good as feeling as getting better at it in BW , so BW just gives a better impression . & gt ; What is toxic though is people arguing that having interface limitations is something positive at a point you can contemplate a community that bashes a more recent game because it has actually evolved and does provide less interface limitations , while improving tons of other aspects to the game . It 's a balance to people bashing older games because they ca n't control the whole army with 1 hotkey . Some see it as interface limitations , other see it as `` the game '' BW is a game where you control 12 units at a game and need to select each induvidual building . It 's the game , it 's not a `` limitation '' in any way , because the game do n't wish you to be able to select more than 12 units . A limitation is how the game was 4:3 , because that 's what the computer screen was . Now , the game is updated to modern standard . That is what a limitation is , not `` being able to only select 12 units '' Also , `` while improving tons of other aspects to the game , what do you mean by that ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; if you could just mass ling 1A it would be wayyyy to easy . Remember that pathing in BW matters . You wont have a ball like in SC2 , however , the 12 unit balances out someone being ahead , it 's more tasks to do therefor harder to be ahead in BW than SC2 . But deathballs are never a good thing in Brood War , and would be a pathing nightmare .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"How would reavers ruin the game ? Other than harrass , they are n't a big deal for Terran , just be sure to have 1 goliath in your army if they use dropships in fights . Or keep 4 marines or so in your base when the timing hits . PvP is different issue . Doubt he would rage about just a random unit like Reaver . Actually , in my many years of playing BW , I 've never raged about a specific unit . However , I can see how Vultures are cancerous for many people .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Yeah you just want broken balance in your favor . Actually , not always . Have someone deathball Protoss and attack a land mine/vulture/siege tank army . Yea , that protoss lost the game easly . Even tho the units pathing in BW make it hard to create a deathball .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,Atleast SC2 BW custom map .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; with regards to deathballs I highly doubt it . Also , in BW you do n't want to approach any army using a deathball . Imagine having a deathball and then a fungual hits , only that the fungual is big enough to hit all your units and it puts every unit , except your strongest , to 1 hp . Yea , that 's Plague for you . Have fun with 1 muta coming in killing 3 of your units with 1 shot . Or have a death ball and 1 storm hits . Or try attacking a siege line-up with a deathball . Deathball is a disadvantage in BW . A protoss having deathball Zealots would never be able to attack a Terran set up with mines and siege tanks .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"1 building select is part of the balance too tho , just like 12 units select . Look at is as , the further ahead you get , the harder it gets to control everything and be effective . Thats why pro 's are so incredible good , they do both the micro and the macro to an incredible extend .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; but if your looking to add more people to your scene i am not so sure your really moving things forward here . Blizzard 's video , before showing HD remaster , at the event was basically a video how people in Korea talked how they used to play BW and spend hours and hours of it . It 's basically marketing old fans that HD is coming out . I think they know their target group : People who used to play BW and/or SC2 that look to play some RTS again . I doubt they are working to get many new players into the BW scene , but I have a theory that they want to develop a new RTS in a new setting/universe , and try to get some RTS hype going again . But changing the gameplay for BW would be a pretty big decision , and big in a bad way . The game already survived 19 years in it 's current interaction , that living through it 's sequel . I do n't think it will change the pull of the game that much .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I respect sc2 for what it is and I would n't see it work if it had the limitations bw has . It would n't . But SC2 is balanced around being able to select your whole army at once . BW is balanced around having only 12 . That 's the point people try to make and why people do n't want to have being able to select more units . A big part of the interest of BW is how difficult it is mechanically . SC2 issue with many BW fans is how the mechanically skill disappered , and it went more down to balance issues that was n't properly fixed the first years of SC2 , and lower ranked players felt the game worked against them in a bad way . BW works against it 's players in a good way , with being mechanically hard , not bad balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"No , it will not . The games will most likely be played through the new game client Blizzard has , so all that happens is that someone starts the game in HD and some in the BW , and they play eachother on the same server , kind of thing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"As Tastosis like to point out , when you can only control 12 units at a time , being far ahead is really difficult to make a big advantage out of , because it gets more and more things to do . Not being able to select your whole army at once is a big balance point .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Yea , I noticed that too when I looked a bit tonight on some videos . The Battlecruiser looks insanely good and what I think they are going to aim for with most units . Hopefully . Zerglings look a bit iffy to me , same with marines . Zealots looked pretty good tho . Terran-buildings , definetly need shadowing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think so , yes , because what it looks like is that BW is moving to the client that SC2/HOTS and so is . In this video , he talks how people with old users will be able to log in/connect the user to the modern one . As I see it , we who now owns BW will need to download it on the new client . And because of that , all I can see is that in the summer , the HD remaster will be sold on that new client , and all play will happen on that client . Meaning people who have BW now outside of the client will not be able to play with people on the new client . But remastered will not replace the BW out now if that 's what you are thinking of . It 's not like they put out a patch that updates the grapichs . The game ( I think , but not sure ) will be out on the client now soon , and then Remastered will be released on the client as a sellling item ( which will be like a DLC to the game on the client ) and it will just be updated grapichs , and everone that play BW , either in its original form or HD , will be able to play together since everyone use the same client ( this last part im 100 percent sure of ) So yea , we will need to buy HD remastered anyway , 100 percent sure , but it 's probably not expensive .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I 've always wondered why people disregarded these The gameplay in BW is very unique to it 's game and engine . The SC2 engine just makes the balance all messed up , and it feels very off putting . It 's nothing like BW , where the gameplay `` flaws '' , or just commanding 12 units at a time , or needing to select 1 and 1 building , is part of the balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; You seem to have completely missed the point of SC : R. SC : R is not meant to replace SC2 and make BW great again , it 's meant to give lifelong fans and ex-players something that can provide a ton of nostalgia and enjoyment by updating an ancient game and giving it modern day features and support for modern software . Anyone that watched the event would see the video Blizzard played before the Remastered trailer . It was basically a `` nostalgia '' thing , and Blizzard knows that . They do n't aim to revieve BW as a globabl esport , but it will definetly help the scene again . I 've been loving the revive for BW the last couple of years , because I loved the game as a kid . But never got to see any live events as in streams . Just VODS on youtube . Now , I can watch Flash livestream himself for every game he plays . Even Nal_ra . It 's amazing . But I do n't expect Blizzard to try push the scene more . I have thought that Blizzard is more trying to get more and more people back into RTS before they release a new RTS set in a new universe . Would be very exciting .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What he meant was that when SC2 came out , Kespa still had tournaments in Korea , but even tho it was BW tournament in the proleague , they added a `` SC2 match '' into the best of 5 series , meaning it was quite forced . Everybody thought SC2 would be the big thing , but it was still a bit more time left for BW really , as it was still big , but with forcing in into the BW scene , it just looked rather disrespectful . Should just have let time pass and the scene make the transition itself , not have a poor SC2/BW hybrid . Probably what he meant .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The coaches stand right behind them in the booth , have n't you seen the International ? & gt ; If timeouts gave better strategic games then that could add value to the game . But it 's ... real time strategy ... People want to see RTS , not a pause screen and someone filming the players for 1 minute . Nobody want to see the best of the best having to take a 1 minute timeout to strategy ... They want to see them being capable of playing at the highest level while coordinate at the highest level and strategy at the highest level , all at once . It 's why the game is so fucking hard to play with 5 individuals with no communication . Just leave timeouts out of the scene , seriously . Nothing kills the experience and flow of a game more than a pause screen and a minute of watching nothing happens , or commentators just talking , or watching the players just talk . It 's a real time strategy game . You play and strategy at real time speed , not with timeouts . If a team need timeout to talk and strategy , they are not a good team .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Oh , he was , even back in 2002 . But he is one of the older generation carried into the mid-generation .

As a Toss player , Reach and Nal_ra were incredible fun to watch . But neither had the `` dominance '' factor . Crazy to think that the careers of Flash , Jaedong etc . have now passed , by a good margin , the amount of time the older pros career was .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"& gt ; but lots of professional sports use them and I could see it being a good experiment . But in Dota 2 , there are 5 players all constantly talking with each other . In sports , it can be difficult for coaches and managers to talk to all it 's players at once . & gt ; Certainly the team using it could take some time to calmly re-assess when they do n't have to focus intently on the micro and decision making of their hero for a few seconds . But that 's the RTS part ... You play , you strategy , you do the micro at the same time as the macro , you plan your next move while doing something else . It 's a big part of the genre . Would every team in Dota 2 say `` Yes , please '' to a timeout ? Yea , definetly . Should it be like that ? Definetly no . It 's what makes the team better and a team with players of less induvidual skill can beat a better team or a team that is ahead in terms of farm and items , because they are better at playing and strategy at the same time .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The game was 8 years old when this happened . It been 5 years without any patches . Dota 2 and SC2 and LoL are getting up there in terms of age , but they have recent patches , and are different type of games . 8 years for a game like BW are like forever . And 5 years without a patch is crazy when we are thinking todays standard .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Why ? Tactical timouts ? ? ? Video games mix them together , you play and strategy at the same time . ARTS , action real time strategy , which Dota is . Being able to have tactical timouts just ruins a big aspect of the game .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I really hope Blizzard will be able to create a RTS that can bring all the different scenes together , but the problem is that games like AOE2 , WC3 and BW are just so good . It takes a lot to have people make a permanent switch .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Maybe , but changing it is not a great idea , since it 's part of the balance of the game . No kidding , it would be a huge difference if you had unlimited selection and you could just keep all your production in one hot-key , it would just make the game unbalanced . Which they did n't want , they wanted to keep the same gameplay , appealing to the older fan-base ( people who have played BW ) , and maybe some new people would wan na try it . But the decision to not add it is the correct one .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think every choice they did , about what to add and not to add , and what to change and what not to change , are the correct ones . They have just touched the grapichs and bugs , and let the game be as it is . Changing a lot of the mechanics will change the balance , and while it 's obviously more comfortable playing with the newer features like SC2 have , it 's part of the game in BW and a big part of the `` feel '' of the game . Keeping everything as it has been is not a bad choice , consider how highly the game is rated . I was very happy to hear most of their changes being non-gameplay related . With you saying that you hoped it should be in the SC2 engine , what do you mean with that ? Do you mean like many of the mods in SC2 that is BW ? Or that the game just was playable in the SC2 engine ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think the biggest selling point would be that it 's a fresh universe , really . Blizzard making an RTS outside Warcraft/Starcraft . & gt ; '' It 's like SC2 , but with cannons instead of lasers ? '' Simplifying it a bit too much , are n't we ? See the huge difference between the Warcraft series and Starcraft series , despite both being RTS from Blizzard . They will find a way to do it different enough . Overwatch is something completly new and outside Blizzards comfort zone , and it 's amazing . A new RTS game soon , and with soon we are talking 2-3 years to announcment , will be a fitting time . Soon , as in `` 4-5 years from now '' , and by then SC2 will be , what , 10 years old ? Actually , 11-12 years . So why would n't they try to make a new , big RTS ? Selling points : Set in a completly new universe , it 's 12 years since the release of their last big RTS ( biggest difference in their RTS release are just 7 years with WC3- & gt ; SC2 ) , try to bring back the fans that have left Blizzard because they do n't play any of their games ( because RTS are the only ones they are interested in )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Tell them , BW is a game where you compete a lot with yourself in terms of getting better . Yes , you can only select 12 units , and yes , only build from 1 building at a time . It 's really hard . But the better you get at it , the more fun is it . It 's really rewardful getting better at the mechanics . Tell them , this is not a limitation of the game , but rather rules of the game , just like most sports have rules about how big of a field you play on , or how many people can be on one team at a time . Also , I ca n't remember I 've lost a game and felt it was because the game fucked me over , rather that I played badly or the opponent play better . There are no balance-whining .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; People do not understand that at this point , any RTS game that pulls some attention is good for any of us . I love that Blizzard did a BW HD remake , and my hope is that it 's to get more `` older fans '' , aka . those who stopped playing BW and SC2 , to get some feel for the RTS genre again ( I 've been playing RTS my whole life , from BW to SC2 to WC3 and now back to BW , so I love the genre ) I hope with increased interest in BW HD , they are `` making a fan base '' before launching their new RTS , set in a completly new and fresh universe . But since it wont have `` Warcraft '' or `` Starcraft '' attached to it , it 's biggest pull must be `` Blizzard RTS game '' , and it will be a wider base of fans if as many as possible play a RTS Blizzard game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 've seen a couple of comments on here about players doing some sort of `` tutorial '' , but nothing recent . But the game has n't been patched since 2001 , and most builds are viable even tho some are preferred than others . Day9 dailies are many BW videos , check them out maybe . Other than that , just watch many pro-games , as the action is often slow in the start and you will pick up some openers and build orders . The standard build openers are nothing crazy and pretty easy to learn actually . The difficult stuff are doing a good execution and deal with your opponent .",Germanic,Norwegian

For us that are a bit more aware , it did become a bit repetative , but it 's alright since the casters are some awesome people with lots of passion .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; No multiple building select and manually rallying workers to mine makes it unfun to play for me . No multiple building select is part of the balance . And , you might enjoy getting good at it . Part of the satisfaction with BW is how you compete with yourself at getting better at the game , at it 's mechanic . It 's not a limiation , it 's part of the game . Imagine going on a football pitch and complaining that the field could be a lot bigger so you have more area to run around on . Yes , that 's true , but the rules of the game decide you have to stay on it . But I can definetly see it being less fun for many since it takes focus away from controlling the army and doing more `` acitve '' stuff , but it 's just part of the game . Workers automatically mining was actually a change I would like to see , but it 's not really a big deal in the end . Keybindings are really sweet to have , but I realised that all buildings and units current hot-keys are so burned into my brain , that I 'm more sure I will be able to handle it better using legacy hotkeys ... Will be hard to change , even tho key-bindings are a lot better ofc .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I remember playing a lot of BW and thinking back , I was so horrible ( to my defense , I was like 10 and only had played it for myself ) , think 1 worker per mineral , in the mineral lines . Then I found the pro-scene , and oh boy , did I learn a lot . Just watching the pros play will make someone a lot better , and now we live in an era where most pro 's stream every day and you get FPVOD of anyone ( back in the days , up until SC2 release , it was unheard of having FPVOD of the pros , it was as holy grails )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Lol , not in BW . A move into a tank/vulture army that is correctly setup ? Yea , your zealots are dead and your dragoons will most likely die . I think you are likely joking , but it 's interesting to see how a BW fight can be changed just with adding some flavor . Fast arbiter tech has been popular in recent meta , and works wonders most often . But a Toss army A-moving into a sieged up , mine-laid terran army are just too weak , unless it 's the toss catching the terran army off-guard . 200/200 army Terran will crush most things in the game , but the strenghts of Zerg/Toss is how they have spell-casters to even the scale .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Definetly looks better in your edit , and my `` theory '' is that they have made everything to look remastered , and will polish with comparing the models now , the ones they made and the old , and add details/changes ( like your edit has done ) to make them more similiar . I think the issue I have with remaster is how everything looks really `` shiny '' , or too flat , definelty needs the hard shading that BW have . Still , really excited to try it with new grapichs , but it will be really , really hard to move away from the current BW look , if the HD do n't `` improve '' My biggest fear is the HD remaster kinda staying too `` weird looking '' for me , and throw me too much off , and then the pro-scene use the HD look . I 'm actually quite interested in how that is going to turn out . I 'm just so in love with the BW look that I hope it stays that way ... And it 's something poetic that a game is being broadcasted with the same look for 20 years and going strong .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Bugs develop into features , but they are releasing some fixes , like Dragoons will stop and not do any commands . The pathing issue is a feature in the old engine , not a bug . The engine used in BW have a `` timer '' that updates the pathing every few second . Every x second , the unit will `` update '' it 's pathing , but it can cause for weird movements when a unit try to , say , go down a ramp because it 's pathing gets `` blocked '' when the timer updates . This is not bugs . This is the engine . People like the engine and they wo n't fix it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s Day9 demonstrates it here . Also , just because some of us like the weird mechanics and pathing , does n't make us `` neckbeards '' , it 's just something satisfying with flaws like that . The smooth movement in SC2 is great , it 's works really good for that game . But if one have played BW , one could easly see how the smooth pathing and units clumping up would not work for the game . And as you can see in Day9 's video , it 's possible to counter this if you are good enough .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If true , I can see BW coming back big . Some of the best with it was after losing a game you would just jump into a custom game and relax for a bit . It might be old tech , but so many of the maps are fun .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"BW 1.18 will be F2P , not sure if they meant BW HD will be free to play .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Not really , and who knows , maybe Blizzard is n't that caught up in making big bucks for BW HD , and it does n't seem so with BW free patch ( even tho making BW free and have many come back to it , reliving how amazing it is , will have them buy BW HD , is a great move ) I think they most likely just want to have so many as possible back , and making BW free and releasing BW HD is going to have 2 games drawing people back into the scene .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Really a selling point for me , together with classic gameplay . Do n't care much for updating the grapichs , but the rest is so good to see being implemented .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Modern matchmaking tho , and the 1.18 patch leading up to it will try fix bugs and also make it more compatible to more modern PCs , so thats big too .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"For some , this is n't a big deal . But for some of us it 's on the level of SC2 announcement . Taking BW up to modern age , in term of match making , a bit grapich update but still keeping the old gameplay style , is amazing news !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"`` Modern Online Play '' , not sure if there is any other way to take that than matchmaking system .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If you have ever wondered why pathing is bad , check out Day9 video on it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s It 's not a `` Pathing issue '' , it 's literally how the engine is .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Its a fucking video game . Most people excited for this do n't care if BW does n't have a flawless engine with perfect pathing . Few that played BW back in the day is at an age or level that they can become any sort of profesional in it . & gt ; Did n't realize the SC community had completely fossilized at this point . It 's a 20 year old game . I 'm probably one of the younger people putting several hours into the game , and I 'm 22 . The target audience just want to play BW with a good match-making system and is happy they did n't change any of the gameplay . If you watched the event , they even had the lead up to it being people in their late 20s to late 30s talking about how much they enjoyed playing it back in the day , and this is just to bring a new looking BW to those who wants it . If you read up , you will also know that BW players playing 1.18 will be able to play against 1.18 BW players , which is why they wo n't change the big gameplay features like pathing . Is the pathing bad ? Obviously , the engines 20 years ago are like that . Does it need fixing ? Not really . It 's the game , and if you do n't like it , just do n't play it ? Many other games out there you can play , do n't see why you latch on this or even take time to comment if you do n't like what they are doing . Just do n't play BW . Surely you have better things to do . Also , if with pathing you also mean how the units move and with clumb up like in SC2 , you have not an eye for gameplay features like that , because it 's essential for lots of the BW gameplay to be like that .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,samuraijack,Thank you !,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Overwatch Blizzard releasing a game like Overwatch was definetly a big , big risk . Usually you make a game after your reputation and fanbase , and while Hearthstone was kinda `` out there '' , it 's not so weird for the fanbase to see Blizzard making a card-game based on Warcraft . However , Overwatch was one not in any genre Blizzard was familiar with , was even a FPS , and on top of that , a whole new universe and franchise . And it was great !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Well , this is just an issue because Avilo is a new account , surely ? He will play up to getting his rank , but will need to play D 's first . It 's been like this for ages and the BW community always wanted that matchmaking system new games have . Obviously did n't `` desperatly '' need that new system , seeing how it all turned out , but it 's a big deal to keep lower ranked players staying and improving .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think , the biggest atmosphere factors will the sounds and the music . Seriously , sit down and just listen ( without eyes open ) during a fight and it 's all about the music and the sounds effect of every shot fired , or death sounds or spawn sounds or the music playing in the background . I think HD can really get a BW feel if you have all elements included .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I will be very impressed if they have , or well , I can see they `` updating it to 4k '' , but remaking completly new cutscenes , same quality as SC2 ? Doubt it .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; because this game will only push the downfall of SC2 ... . When the HD announcement was made , they played a video that was basically people in Korea recalling their time when they used to play SC ( as in SC1 ) and talk about all their memories . Very marketet at `` remember SC1 ? Why not come back for a bit , watching it again , and play it again with updated grapichs ! `` , and not so much about getting new players into it . However , SC2 got it 's big chance and it 's been amazing that it has lasted so long . Few games ( as games that you have to buy to purchase ) has lasted so long . Think about games that came out in 2010 , and how many have big tournaments as of lately ? There are not many RTS out now , so we might be able to have all BW and SC2 , other options I can think of is WC3 and Age of empires 2 , but not many others . If Blizzard is willing , they can support both a BW scene and SC2 scene , and many people will be playing both . And nice thing with BW is that all balance is done and they basically wont need to use time or money to work on it anymore . I also doubt many that already left SC2 community will come back to BW if they did n't come back to SC2 already . Idk , just think the RTS genre is on it 's way down , and BW HD might be a sort of plan to get more people back into the RTS genre , before Blizzard is dropping a new RTS . What would be amazing is a new RTS game in a new universe/setting , in the same way Overwatch is its own universe . I think Blizzard have seen that , a problem with SC2 might not be gameplay or balance , just that people are sick of playing in the same universe for 20 years . Maybe it 's time for something completly new and fresh . At one point , people just need to accept that SC2 has had it run , and do n't talk bad or think bad of BW growing . BW is an amazing game , better than SC2 ( coming from someone that loved playing it and rate it highhy ) , but a revive of BW might mean we get another RTS soon !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The grapichs of WC3 is pretty alright , but I do think some would welcome some balances . As far as 1v1 go , there are most likely more about `` the races themselves '' that really have the issue , like the Blademaster being incredible strong , so not going him as first hero is ... well , it 's cheesy not to , which makes it a bit , idk , boring ? Same with Demon hunter for night elves . And the meta is kinda stale , the same builds vs. the same races , but I still find the game very fun to play and watch , mostly because of the heroes coming into effect and changing up each game ( as with item drop or good spells/hero combos )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; If the BW esport scene thrives it will hold a unique position in that it is one of rare , if not only game that has `` settled down '' . Blizzard just got incredible lucky with the `` flaws '' of the game . Like the developer here brought up , it 's okay that not every reaver shot connect . The reason for this is if it did , the reaver would be so incredible strong in harrass . It would mean as soon as reaver landed in your base , you would not be able to run away with your workers ( as the pro 's do now , and is an incredible skill to jump between the bases to move the workers quickly ) With every shot connecting , the reaver shot would hit however , even if it landed behind the minerals patch or far away . So that 's a flaw that just is needed to stay it , or the balance gets a bit icky . E : Also a point that Tastosis likes to bring up , is how the game balances its self with limitation . Being able to just select 1 building or just 12 units at a time , means that the further you get ahead , the harder it gets ( an army with many , many units and spellcasters are difficult to handle , vs a smaller army ) so it 's nicely balanced that you can sacrifice and come back without having to straight up fight a stronger army .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Probably for the best that back in 1999 the developers did n't get a message from thousands of people over every single change and every singel one with an opinion , a disagreeing opinion , would be able to talk shit to them over how they ruined the game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,That 's a hilarious story haha,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The game will become free , as in , Starcraft Brood War out now will get a patch , 1.18 , that makes it free ( basically , free to download ) Then , Starcraft BW HD will come out in the summer . I 'm not 100 procent sure , but look at is as an expansion pack , or a DLC , that allows you to play with the updated grapichs . However , you still play on the same servers as the ones just playing BW . So the community will not be split between the two 's . Most likely it will be in the same client as SC2 , but we will see . All it means is that us that play it now will just have to DL it in the client . Nothing biggy . I think the only thing that is redone is the grapichs . Doubt they would put the money into new cutscenes , as it is very expensive and they do n't expect a huge income probably . There are also not that many cutscenes , so we are n't really losing out ( the old ones still look great IMO ) , however , as it is so few , so why not ? But my quess i no .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I figured it was a shading issue , but it 's probably in it 's polishing stages . Yea , I hope what they got now is kinda what they have `` build up '' themselves , and now they will look at their models , compare it to the BW models , and then shade/change to make it look more alike , but keeping the new style .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Along with the dramatically improved visuals , StarCraft : Remastered will also bring modern connectivity to the game , including full Battle.net ( now Blizzard App ) support for matchmaking and chat , enhanced ladder functionality , and support for friends lists , streaming , and cloud saves . The new matchmaking feature will automatically connect players of equal skill based on their chosen race , but the game will also continue to support the original matchmaking system—which is to say , no matchmaking at all . & gt ; '' If you remember , the original StarCraft didn ’ t have a button like Warcraft III , '' Stilwell said . `` Players threw down a gauntlet in chat channels or hosted open game lobbies for other players to join and discuss terms . We ’ re retaining that style of interaction as an option . That is an essential element of the game ’ s culture . '' What they are saying is that the game will get a new matchmaking system like that , but they will also keep the old style for those who wan na do that , and it basically keeps custom games as they are . So we get both , but I do n't think the lobby-based system will count towards your rank .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I do n't think it can be any bad outcome for BW , more people is always better for a game . SC2 had it 's chance , and it `` lived '' for a long time in an era where games you pay for do n't have any longevity . But if people rather wan na see BW , BW will grow . Both can exist at the same time , but the SC2 scena has already been going downwards for a while . Do n't think BW will be big again outside of Korea , but I rather have a big BW scene , thank a half-filled SC2 scene .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What OP do n't seem to understand it 's all about exposure and maintaining a fan base . There are some that currently enjoy both SC2 and Brood war , and some that enjoy neither . And also those who enjoy SC2 only , and those who enjoy BW only . Blizzard know there are many people in that BW-only category , fans of Blizzard games that have left SC2 . Giving that category of people a new and fresh start will make them continue use a Blizzard product , which is important and will allow Blizzard to produce new product in the future because they have a big fanbase . Ignore the current BW fanbase , and you might lose out on people who will be excited for new products . OP also dont seem to see this is a rare phenomenon , a 19 year old game having a huge fanbase and a viable market . Only other thing that comes close is Age of empire 2 HD . BW HD wo n't make huge sales , so it 's not a `` greedy company '' thing , I think they truly love SC1 at Blizzard , and this is something they want to do for the game . Also , maybe they will get some feedback and ideas that can apply to SC2 on how to make it a more longevity game .",Germanic,Norwegian

The eldians that fight for Marley ( Reiner/Bertholt ) know their attack was a horrible thing to do , but thet view it as a necessesary thing to do , so the marley change their view on the eldians in the Marley nation . Also , the marleys need to titan powers to fight back other nations . And other nations are probably scared of the Marley because of they hold the titan power . And the Paradise Island inhabitants now view Marley as the enemy , because of the attack . But isnt Marley 's action reasonable consider what history say ? A people all capable to become huge titans should not hold much power and control others . But what if that history is fake ? I think we will end SNK without having a `` good '' outcome , and many lives were lost for no good reason , just like real life . History is written by the victor after all . Hopefully we dont have to view back and think that it would all be better if Eren lived his whole life inside the walls and ignorant to the world . But consider Eren did n't focus on the ocean and more on `` the enemy beyond the ocean '' , this might get dark soon ...

But , it would be a `` fake '' life . Is it better that they know about the outside world now , than what life they could have ?

So when I found the streams showing Proleague and Jin Air OSL I was catching pro-games again . That Jin Air OSL finale , plus Proleague finale during the same period , were amazing . And now , many years later , I 'm able to catch every pro-game played . Truly amazing having BW come back during a time period where streaming is so accessable and I 'm older and not just a kid sitting on youtube listening and watching koreans play video game ( I discovered the english casters later , like 2010 time , and continued watching people like Sayle after the korean scene disappeared ) BW have been such big part of me growing up , despite I 've never been good at it , and I do n't know anyone else that play it .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"& gt ; But , physical harm should be punished to higher degree than verbal abuse . But it is . Verbual `` harm '' to the refree will get you banned for 4 games , physical harm will get you a life-ban . Verbal harm towards other players get you nothing , elbowing them gives you 3 or so . If elbowing a player is 3 matches banned , then dangerous tackles should be atleast 3 too . That 's my whole point . You cant compare the situations and justify that the dangerous tackles should have bigger bans . Because Messi did nothing to another player . He was disrepecting over the match officials , and that stuff is taken seriously by every FA in the world . Which is why OP 's title is just stupid .

And the player gets a red card . & gt ; It 's a horrible tackle and Taylor disregarded the safety of Coleman when made that tackle . At no point did I defend Taylor , and I think that is a tackle that is way beyond what should be allowed in the game . My main point is that you ca n't compare a ban given for something one did to a refree , and something that a player did to another player . Refree-punishments will always be harsher . No matter what .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Terran has the easiest way teching up , as you need just barrack - & gt ; factory - & gt ; starport and you have pretty much teched up as far you need ( need add-ons tho , and if you are getting vessels , science facility ) They have a pretty alright build and not difficult to build up an army , however , they need a big force and that tech to be able to go out on the map , without just having vultures running around . Toss and Zerg pretty much overrun them early without their tech . Protoss you got many options . Teching to dragoon is just one mineral-only building , and then you can just pump zealots and dragoons . They also do n't need that much tech , however , you need to kinda choose if you want to get reavers , or get templars . So you got kinda a choice there , before late-late game when you will have pretty much everything . Fast arbiter tech has been popular lately , which mean you get templars . The most important thing for protoss really is just expand , atleast vs. Terran , and just get that income to create lots of dragoons and zealots as you will most often not do favourable trades . Zerg got it the hardest . You kinda need everything . It 's popular to either get just hydras/lurkers or just mutas , but you also kinda want a zergling/lurker/muta tech . And late game tech you also need everything , like ultras , defilers , lurkers , zerglings . Mutas are too expensive to keep building tho , but they are really good to have mid game . Need to expand far away from your main base is your key , as it will take longer time for the other races to attack you , and you can just out-swarm them . As far as the play styles go , Terran is a lot turtling , Zerg is very swarming and Protoss is a middle-thing , can do alright on 2 bases , but unfavourable trades on 2-bases loses them the game . It 's really hard to compare them at all . Only thing you can really keep in mind is how units a relativly the same strenght , as in how much hp one zealot have or a zergling or a marine .

Not too crazy of a build . What I meant with `` all tech buildings '' is that as terran , you can hold stop when you get factory for a while . Armory you wan na get later for upgrades and vessels because they are crazy good , but you do n't need much more . Zerg build induvidual buildings just for the tech , still create from hatcheries . So it 's like , a terran can just build to factory and stop for a while , protoss can skip stargate tech for a while , but zerg , you just really wan na get to that late game tech because it 's useful .

Like , I know I 've seen pro games where you get both mutas and lurkers , so you do n't need to tech to defilers so quick or something . Mostly because 3 hatch-muta is more an opener to get the 11 mutas to harrass , and then you still need to get lurkers . Hydra-bust is kinda seen as cheesy tho , is n't it ?

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,First OD pick from IG in 3 months ( if anyone wondered ),Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"They did have a winning condition ; Get ahead early , get all the roshans and use aegis/cheese to push highground with Bristle and lifestealer in front and Bloodseeker aghs Rupture forcing the cores on IG to having to stand and fight . By that time your line-up should be far enough ahead to win the team fights . What failed was the lifestealer , and somewhat bloodseeker , being underfarmed despite the more towers/map control from Secret , because they farm so slow compared to IG 's cores . When you farm slow , it does n't matter if you got both jungels open . Lifestealer spending time infested in a Rubick is never a great idea . Maybe if they had a faster farming carry they could have closed it earlier , but what other carry can you send alone botlane ( since they played CM jungel/RubickBristle off ) , when IG has n't picked their offlaner yet ? Probably just life .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"And the more melee cores that get popular , the stronger he gets . The hardest part about playing a melee core is if someone just run away with all the utility items . Having rupture on you make that not an option , and then the melee core on the enemy team just wreck you . Bloodrite is such a good spell too .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"It was a good pick for what they did though , they went Rubick/Bristle top with CM in the jungel , what other carry can you send bot alone there ? What really broke Lifestealer this game was the constant fighting . Lifestealer farm so slow compared to many other cores , and even though Secret was ahead and had the whole map , Life just farms so slow . You saw the same with Bloodseeker , they both were behind the cores on IG even if they had the full map . They are just slow farmers compared to Razor/DP/Void .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Their line up had 1 stun , casting cold feet and getting a 3.5 sec stun is pretty big actually . No AA player would expect Rubick to go for your ice blast , for the reason you mentioned . Why would rubick be in position to try getting iceblast from an AA in the back ... Just good plays from Yapzor really .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,He went in to use cold feet on a melee hero in a fight . That 's why it was stolen .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,AA used ulti and went in to use cold feet I think . Yapzor had uphill vision so he was able to catch it .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"DP has cast animations , if a rubick player know he is in range , it 's a pretty easy pick up as soon as you spot the `` exorcism animation '' The time window is short , but not instant as it is for Void . I would put the Void not using W as a , well , `` cocky '' move , as he throw down his ulti and see him catching the cores , thinking they are so far ahead in the fight and just dropped using W. But misplay by Void , but Yapzor being in position to steal it and then throw it down on 3 enemey heroes is big plays anyway .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Nope , Blood was essential to the win . Rupture forced DP/Razor/Void to stand still and not able to just run away from Lifestealer and Bristle . Blood was a great last pick .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"https : //www.dotabuff.com/matches/3234831963 Lifestealer picked after a Nyx , DP , AA . However , Secret played dual top/CM jungel strat , maybe they figured they needed a strong solo bot-lane carry , and lifestealer is one of the best at that .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Midone build him completly right now though , going for the spell dmg talents and just standing back with casting spells and ruptures . Atos probably is n't needed when you will just rupture a target and it will need to stand still . I guess in pubs Atos is a fair pickup because the lack of team coordination and TP reactions when a blood iniate .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"So secret pick a line-up that gets a 15k lead , but apperantly it 's a bad one ? If you were n't blind , you would see every time Secret wanted to push highground , IG 's ulties was off cooldown , and when even then it 's hard to push highground vs. non-ulti with 3 cores . IG had a superior team-fight draft , but they still lost the game because of the Rubick draft from Puppey . It 's so fucking stupid to say `` Secret won because of Yapzor 's absured plays '' , when Puppey drafted Rubick with him in mind stealing the team fighting abilities that Secret did n't have ... .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,Bloodseeker was almost as good as Rubick this game because Rupture forced IG 's cores to stand still and not being able to just run away from the Secret players .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Lol , see the 3k mmr player talking .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Christ , seeing highlights of the game and how rupture can just force a 20k networth core to having to stand still , it 's insane , probably an underrated spell by most people",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Are you shitting me ? The bloodseeker pickup was an incredible call , the rupture was as game winning as Yapzor 's plays .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,Probably imagined they would just have Rubick being caught inside the chrono .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Bloodseeker was an insanely good pickup , Puppey need credit for that . The rupture did insanely much for Secret this game , even tho Yapzor is obviously MVP this match .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,AND DP ulti . Just insane play .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"YAPZOR STOLE CHRONO AND THEN STOLE DP ULTI , WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS GUY ? !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"That 's why he is going the build he is . Aghs give him extra rupture , which force the cores on IG to stand still . That allows Bristle and Life to not be kited the whole fight by having razor/dp/void just run away . His silence deal pure dmg and is a huge AOE silence . And now he have dagon with his bloodrage , dealing lots of magic dmg vs. a armor-heavy line up .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"They ran a Rubick/Bristle offlane with CM jungel . Any other carry you would pick and send alone botlane , when the enemy team has n't picked an offlane yet ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Lifestealer is a slow farmer , and he spend a lot of time infested and participating in fights ( which they needed because of IG 's superior team fight ) Lifestealer and also Bloodseeker was behind IG 's core , even though Secret had the whole map . It 's because they farm slow . But what other carry do you pick to go solo botlane vs. a lineup that has n't revealed their offlane ? Secret played with CM heavely in jungel and Bristle/Rubick offlane . Lifestealer was n't a horrible pick ... If IG picked an offlane that would rape a solo-botlane , Life is one that can just go into the jungel to recover .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,IG came 3/4th at Kiev Major and won DAC this year . Meanwhile Secret had nothing to show for . The other 4 invites were also teams that had either performed at or won premier tournaments in 2017 . Secret invite would be an insult to the rest of the premier tournament winners that did n't get one .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Let me correct myself ; having Lifestealer/Blood trying to farm the whole map like they were a Sven/flash farmer , would not be the best soloution . Yes , lifestealer/blood could probably be 2k networth higher , but sharing the farm with CM/Rubick and having Bristle get a lot of it is a better choice than having Blood/Lifesteaer slowly farming . If it was a carry that could actually clear the jungel or take stacks , they would probably do it differently .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Seriously , EG 's players are some of the chillest dudes , True sight showed that . I really like Arteezy too . Many of the EG fans however , seems like horrible `` fans '' in the sense that they are horrible to be around whenever EG play .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"My point with that was that IG has had a stable roster since september , and all the wins/achivements/games since then was won and played by the same players . Why take Secret 's game 6-12 months back into consideration when they were a completly different team ? And by that , you need to have a shorter time period to take into consideration . That was just my point . If Secret win this + Summit , an invite can be justified over some other team . Because then they have actually won something , at their best . OG might have been shit this tournament , but at it 's best we know how good they are . That 's what people should keep in mind , what is the best result the current team has in recent history and what is their `` roof ''",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"What ? What result this year prove they deserve to be invited ? They even recently had roster change . They have no top finish at a premier event since winter last year . And that was with 1 of their current 5 players . Just because you beat a team like OG , that has a rough patch , does n't mean you deserve an invite . Invites should be based on a teams best performance in the current year . What result this year has Secret to justify an invite ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"So a team , that as it 's best achievement this year being `` cosistent top 10 placement '' is more worthy of an invite than a team at it 's best win premier tournaments ? Are you seriously saying a team is more worthy of an TI invite because of `` consisteny '' without showing ANY results or top placements this year , while some teams have showed they have the quality to win and compete with the very best and also actually has results to back it up ? Team Secret lost vs. fucking SG ffs . They do n't deserve a fucking invite .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Seems like they did n't want use CM/Rubick 's time to stack for Sven . Also , Lifestealer got a build in BKB , seems like they did n't fancy a carry that had to get BKB ( which was completly necessary that game vs. the lineup )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Secret won the Shangai Major 1 year ago , since then , they have n't had any great performance . Just some small tournaments win . They won that major with 1 of their current 5 ( only Puppey remains ) IG has had the same line up since September 2016 , and has the Kiev Major 3th and DAC win , this year . So who do you invite ? A team that performs well over a year , but change their line up completly , or a team that has alright recent results , and the same line up ? & gt ; A top team that places well throughout the year should get an invite over a team that only won a single tournament , I agree .

Real has done very well with bringing in young players and this send the message of `` we are not interested in keeping old players for a long time , so your time will come very soon ( max 1 year because of contract ) '' It 's probably for the best , the biggest reason Fergie was so great over 26 years for us was that he was a master at re-making the squad again and again with getting younger players and experienced players to mix and play together , eventually phasing out the old ones ( before someone say `` he left an aged squad for Moyes '' , yes he did , but the club and Moyes should really have pushed for that overall that first summer after Fergie , but seemed more interested in saving money and try to win again with a champion team than re-newing it .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Trying to counter point this : Despite having a lackluster season , 25 matches without losing is a feat in itself IMO . If we did n't have to struggle with injuries , and especially not having Zlatan completly out in one of the more important stages of the season , I 'm sure we would finish top 4 . We are obviously still a step below Chelsea/Tottenham this season , but I think we was fairly hanging on with Liverpool/City . We already had one of the best defense in the league , and with building on the team into the next season , we could probably get a top 4 finish fairly comfortable . Maybe , if the window was amazing enough and all buys fit in perfectly , we could go for a title challenge . Mourinho know how to win a league , and the team got the defense to do so , and with the right buys going forward , the team looked capable . However , obviously would need to improve in many areas and especially against top 6 . Is the team a decade away from winning ? Who knows . The best in the league are always so good . Transfer windows gets harder and more important , but all buys last windows turned out fairly good . & gt ; Throwing money at stars without having the right balance in the squad wo n't get you anywhere Also , what the fuck does this mean , because as I said , the buys were all fine , the team got great defense and just lacked finishing this season . I understand the point of view , but you are just writing stuff that is repeated again and again about teams that do n't perform . Right balance ? ? ? Liverpool finished 2 points away from the title some years ago with having 50 goals let in . Chelsea won it a couple years ago scoring only 73 goals . Chelsea this year had a balance and just performed every week , maybe due to not having to be concerned about European football ? How todays game work , it 's impossible to say how even next season is going to be . & gt ; And missing that many chances is n't bad luck but actual lack of quality .

It wasnt seldom Ronaldo suddenly was at the right side and Bale on the left . Meaning a LB would have to be able to deal with both Ronaldo and Bale , and at times Benzema . Terrifying thought . However , with Bale being that much injured the flow of the attack has definetly changed , and with Isco most likely starting , it will be interesting what game plan we will see Zidane goes for .

How can a young kid , say 6-7 , pick up Dota , when his hands are not big enough to get around the mouse or long enough to reach the right key ? Many adults even struggle to play Dota on a basic level . It 's a lot sub-3k that is horrible at playing , because they ca n't exectute while thinking . Dota is nothing alike chess .

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The game models are very , very different . Wow has steadly been losing players , and it rises up every new game . There are still a pull towards the `` longevity '' of having one character , leveling it up and so on , compared to a game like Dota or Starcraft or Battlefield etc . It 's not comparable . Dota is and will be a game that is always battling to keep it 's players interested , just like every other game ever . Games struggle always to stay fresh , to evolve , to be on top , and it 's even harder to do so when you have a game where you just play 1 match , and that 's it , compared to an RPG . Dota has and never will be a `` casual '' game . It 's not something whoever can pick up and enjoy . So go for most MOBA games , it 's just that some are easier than others . And Dota is the hardest . And when it battles with other Mobas , like LoL , which more plays and is easier to pick up , it will always struggle to get new player . 7.00 was n't a step to , how can one put it , `` become casual '' , neither to become a better and more interesting game . It was to refresh the game . And it did , for many people . For many people , it drove them away , but that 's because many , like me , was `` afraid '' of this change , when I see now that it was a great and interesting move to refresh something stale . I 've played Dota for many years . When 7.00 came out , I thought it was a hugely drastic change . But playing Dota now , it 's not that different from what it was a year ago . Those that stop playing the game , will stop playing the game no matter what happens . And there will be some new players , but just like Wow , the player base will go up and down . https : //www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/ Just look at wow , and look at any other games ever , and realise the facts ; A video game is always living at a limited time , and will always need to work and evolve to stay fresh , but no matter what it do , it will eventually die . All Valve can do is try to keep it 's player base now , and hope that enough young people are interested in MOBA 'S , but get tired or bored of the more casual ones . But the time of the Moba-games are slowly fading . We will see how long they can keep it up , but just like every other thing , it will eventually collapse by it 's own weight , and I think Dota is heading there . & gt ; No , not this old game horseshit again . Saying it is an old game is 100 percent legit . You know how many young people do n't see old movies because `` they are not good , they are black and white '' ? That is 100 percent legimate reason for them themselves to say . They do n't think black and white movies can be good , and why is that wrong to say ? If that 's what they think , it 's what they think and it ca n't be changed unless they activly watch the movies themselves and see they are wrong . But it does n't happen , because `` they are old '' Dota is getting old . Young people can look it up and see `` Dota 2 released 2013 '' and immediatly be turned off by it , because they want something released this year . And comparing sports to it is just ridiculous . Sports are sports , it 's the most casual thing and it 's also fun . There will always be sports . But do every person growing up take an interest in Basketball ? No , but lets say 5 or 10 percent do . That 's millions of people all around the world .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"I 'm a big Tom Hardy fan and have to agree , he played the character so good , and as you said , killed it ( it may be my favorite performance of his ) His character is really only the interesting one in the film ( even though as a whole I really like The revenant , watched it multiple times ) He is the main villian/antagonist in the movie , but he is one of the least `` villainous '' movie-characters I 've seen recently . He is a man , living in the 1820s , just trying to survive and get by . Obviously lived a very rough life . Some people might think `` oh , he treats Leo 's son bad , he is obviously bad '' , but this was the 1800s , where most people probably had a vile encounter with Indians and they were universially looked as `` bad '' , and it 's not like he was more racist/bad towards Indians than what a normal man would be . Especially after some flayed your head . Then , all he really is motivated by is getting some cash after a lot of hard work went to nothing , to see over Leo until he dies . Thing is , Leo do n't die , the Indians chasing them are getting close , and Hardy 's character try to save himself . And one things lead to the next , but never did I feel his character did something out of evil or something I would n't do myself . And what 's difficult for an actor is to portrait that , but every look and sound Tom Hardy made in the movie was leaning towards `` he is just doing this to survive '' I do n't know if the one that won `` supporting actor '' , Mark Rylance , did a good job , but if his performance was good enough to beat Hardy 's , it must have been . Because Tom Hardy just brought a character from the 1820s to life in a way I have n't seen before . Maybe he would have won if the movie was done a bit differently and did n't stretch out and focused more on the characters than showing Leo 's journey , but still a bit mad Hardy did n't get an Oscar .

When one of the players try to break the tank lines , they need to win the fight so overly , or else it will not be worth it and the losing player is still in it because the following push is too weak . When the dropships come into play , it 's just pure fun to watch . Only thing that I might compare is late game ZvZ , however , it 's such a rarity it 's not really a thing .

Because no game since it has managed to recreate it 's insanely addicting and loveable features . It 's pretty clear you have never put in much time to it . And let me guess ...

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"No one is denying it , it 's a reason many even tune in . However , last season had enough interested to have them bring it back for a S2 . Many of the players that entered military was allowed to play pro-games , they had the Air-force 1 pro-team , even tho they fell off . If the seasons ahead will follow the structure of ASL , a short period of time with some games a week , at the starts it can be a month apart , the players might be allowed to feature in it . It 's also the between the age of 18-31 . Flash is 24 , Jaedong is already 27 so he got ta go soon , and I did not know Bisu was already heading there . However , all we need are these players keeping it up for a couple of years maybe , and it might come a new generation of pros that people are interested in watching play . I would imagine 2-3 youngsters that compete with and even beat the old guys will harvest some excitment . The problem is that it 's not anyone it seem , however , with the pro 's returning to the scene , it will maybe make some young enter the scene . Many will say `` oh , but they were so young back in the day , all they play now a days are the new games '' , but I 'm a 21 year old Norwegian that was just a kid 10 years ago , loving to watch some koreans play video game on youtube . I imagine there is a whole generation of 18-21 year olds in Korea that played the hell out of SC1 , and are willing to try their luck in the greatest Esport ever , at a time there is a nice possibility . I imagine the possibility to play a live match on a scene with an audience against Flash , Jaedong and Bisu would have many pick it up again .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"As a biased viewer , Brood War is the most beautiful game ever made .

The units sound , the hotkeys , abilities , they are all burned into my brain . Brood war coming back when I 'm in my 20s is a dream come true . I hope it make more people spend some time trying it out , because it is , IMHO , the greatest game ever .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What you want to do is cut off reinforcements and give yourself a lot of time , haulting the push with lurkers and force scans and slow push into your base . Since the zerg force is very mobile , you can pick off reinforcements coming and eventually kill a push with bringing all your forces down on the main army eventually . You saw Jaedong doing this in the last game especially , however , Flash never commited to the push , and had his forces in smaller squads , but it did delay the push . However , for some reason Jaedongs lurker tech was very slow . It 's a bad thing when you go both muta and lurker and the muta harrass has done nothing . The bio stream is not as scary as it seems , because what you do as zerg is keeping your third alive , getting you tech to defilers . When you have swarm , a push is almost out of question from the terran before you have a lot of science vessels . What Jaedong lost on was the fact his muta 's did nothing , and Flash never threw away marines in his small squads .",Germanic,Norwegian

People pour hours into watching and learning timings and builds , but if they do n't get on the levels of the pro 's , not even close , because the execution is what is lacking . Day9 , being a former pro at one of the hardest games to execute , will just need to get what you mentioned down , and will not struggle with execution because of his abilities he already has .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Yea , true , and the sample size of ASL is too small to make a clear picture anyway , one way or another .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Also help the `` culture '' of having offline events , many qualifiers and group stages is online in the western world because of distances . And it all leads up to one big main event where players or teams come and play out some brackets . I do n't think any organization in the west would do like ASL and be over several months with games being played 2 times a week . Just is n't viable . And also , yea , SCBW is just too damn hard for most people to get into , but it can be a lot of fun to watch . But you need to understand the basics , and people wo n't care to install a 20 year old game . I 'm hoping for a comeback , but it 's more realistic that this will be for a couple of years and it will slowly die out at the same time of SC2 . What can be the saving grace however , is if SC2 dies and BW remains the biggest RTS and no competition is coming in . I watched some WC3 tournaments not long ago , so that 's kinda on the rise again too , but do n't think it will have the core audience BW still has . BW biggest hope is that every other RTS dies . And maybe some RTS people that got into MOBA 's want to watch some old school gaming too .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"It 's has it 's core fanbase that can still have some interest , if Team Liquid want to they could host a Liquidleague where people can sign up and it can be like some weekly online tournaments .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The beauty is that all mirror match up late game is amazing , it 's just a matter of the map allowing it . Cross spawn positions on the biggest maps allow for longer ZvZ games for example . The true beauty of BW comes in the late-late game . Just massive armies all over the map fighting . The mirror match ups late game always gets fun IMO . Even tho it 's a rarity in ZvZ and PvP , it always happens in TvT and it 's great .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Fighting spirit is one of the most balanced maps , it had almost 50 percent through all match ups . However , it suits the `` turtling '' Terran kinda . I do n't really know how balanced it is if Terran just go that style of `` 2 base turtling '' Flash is the king of responsive play , and it 's just really strong game style to turtle 2 base + respond to your opponent . 2 base Terran is scary , and can do pretty much anything when scouting the opponent . Arbiter tech , lurker , muta , the turtle terran has a lot of option because in all situations you will tech up to science vessel and you never `` lose '' out on anything going there . Some builds , like protoss for instance , when going arbiter , it 's pretty strong because you get Templars and storm with doing it . Zerg is in the roughest spot , since getting a spire wo n't help you get lair , nor will Hydralisk Den . And you need that defiler tech . So Terran is in the easiest place when it get to `` teching '' , Protoss can do it fairly easy , only bad thing for them is that they need robotic facility to get observers , as well as the stargate , citadel of adun , templars archive and then arbiter tribunal , and it 's the last tech unit for protoss . Defiler mount is n't that rough , but you still need to choose between hydralisk den and spire on the way , which stops you from straight teching . However , Terran just get barrack - & gt ; factory - & gt ; stargate - & gt ; science facility . And that 's all the tech they need ( + armory ofc ) With 4 buildings they have teched up as far as they need . All relevant units unlocked . Can even get dropships from it . That 's where the power of 2 base turtling Terran is . And why they seem so OP towards Zerg . Zerg need to choose lurkers or muta often , but the Terran will do the same build to counter both play style , which means they can practice the same build over and over again and master it , countering the 2 main builds ( which make it seem like Zerg need to do some cheese to win ) However , if the map makes for the expansion being vulnerable to aggression or harrass , the Terran ca n't turtle each game without being punished . However , take it too far , and the Terran ca n't get an expansion , and then it 's auto lose against both races . Of the three races , Terran seems like the most limited in options to go builds , however , they also got the easiest way to do those builds , which makes for practising an easy time for the pros . Throughout ASL , Tastosis/Rabbit wondered why Protoss had to do the `` awful arbiter rush build '' , but I think it 's the only way the pro 's can get enough arbiters and tech/energy to use spells and actually win fights , before the terrran have 10 vessels out and emp 's all your arbiters . Terran is in the easiest spot atm , but I do n't think they are overpowered . Just need the maps to have less chokes for all the tanks and just an harder expansion to hold .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 'm a huge fan of TvT , it 's a lot of interesting aspect to it that many do n't consider . Also , IMO , it 's the best of the mirror match ups , and it always feels like the one that played the very best wins in the end . I know a Bo5 gets long tho with TvT , it 's going to be tiring if it goes to 5 games ( I think it will be either 3-0 or 3-1 win for Flash ) , but consider we have n't had any mirror in the quarter , I do n't mind a mirror and especially not TvT in the final .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Effort went out in the Ro24 group stages , he beat Light ( T ) , but lost against Rain ( P ) , he then lost to Light in the decider . What 's funny with discussing TvZ taking Jaedong vs . Flash as an example , is that Jaedong was 4-0 through the group stages against Terran . I do n't think he had an issue to `` figure out '' Terran , I just think he had a tough time to play against Flash . Flash is also the best `` responder '' in the history of BW , and vs. Zerg that need to be the aggressor in a way , he 's dominating . It 's not weird he beat a Jaedong that has recently returned , and that is a big deal , Jaedong has n't as much practice as many other joining in , and he still went 6-3 , mostly because Flash is just so good . In the group stages , Zerg went 9-5 against Terran . Yes , it 's Jaedong and herO that make up most of the wins , but it shows it 's a quality thing rather than balance issue . With Flash vs. Jaedong , it ended 11-8 in favor of Zerg . I know it 's a too small sample size to use it as an argument in favor of balance being alright , but many here make it seem like Zerg ca n't beat Terran unless you are incredible . I think it 's all down to the two other races getting a huge return of very good pros , and zerg being kinda a bit `` lost '' on how to deal with the maps .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"TvZ has always been viewed on as the classic match up , and throughout my year watching it I have n't thought about it as unbalanced in favor of Terran . Even though when the turtling style of Terran became popular , taking a quick expansion , it 's put a lot of pressure on Zerg to do something , while the Terran can be pretty safe . You might be referring to Jaedong vs Flash too , but that 's more Flash doing right things and Jaedong ending up being sloppy in the last match . A big factor many do n't consider is the maps too . Zerg want to expand away from the terran , and `` unlucky '' spawns can make it easier for the Terran . I 'm not sure if the maps throughout ASL have been good on Zergs in that case . I 'm not sure how `` flawed '' I would called TvZ . The big deal is Zerg having to be the aggressor , and have pretty much only option of Mutas or lurker + fast tech to defilers . If the Muta harrass fails , you are pretty much so far behind and pretty much dead . If you go lurker , the timing push on the terran is just too strong . I think an `` answer '' to it is a better map pool , where the expansion ca n't be defended with 2 buildings from the Terran . However , that makes Protoss dragoon/zealot push strong , so it 's kiiiinda needed to be like that ... If a Zerg can hold on to get his bases and tech up , it 's a more even playing field . Dark swarm , ultras , taking out the terran 's vessel , and it 's looking good . But it 's getting to that point without falling too far behind that probably is the problem . I think if you want to fix some flaws in TvZ , you 'll need some better maps where getting an `` unsafe '' expansion can be punished by Zergs .",Germanic,Norwegian

On top of that , 2 more single zergs lost . Probably the quality of the players are a bit lacking , and the format of ASL does n't really favor `` balance '' aspect of the game . A bad day , and you might go out . Jaedong was n't far away from being eliminated either . Terran has always been the strong race , but OP ? I know you say it tongue in cheek , but it 's no denying Terran is in a strong spot , however , Flash is like the greatest player ever , and Sea reached the semi 's last year and been training a lot , so I 'm not suprised they both reached the finale .

But the fact he was n't one makes it more impressive that he had more PL goal than any of them have had in one season .

Surely it was , and it was actually a very funny snap to follow too . Turns out the girl is like an escort and had some sugar daddy ( or daddies ? ) somewhere , and traveled around the world , she being in Asia at the time . She talked about doing sexual favors for thousands of bucks and so , so she was like , living a comfortable and rather fun life , as she traveled around and smoked weed etc . most of her days , as well as having a decent following on snap where she posted casually her being naked in bath or in her bed or in her room and so on . Nothing sexual acts . Last week ( and I think this ? ) she is at one of her `` sugar daddies '' place , and it 's incredible beautiful , and her and one more girl is staying in this great place , having time of their life , eating comfortable , helicopter ride etc . I have only seen the mans hands , and it turned out he would be 60-70 years probably . But hey , she was having a blast it seemed . You might be wondering , `` Why is this nutsack going on about this , what has it to do with the comment he is replying too '' Well , hear now . Couple of days ago I would say , I check her snap story . She 's talking about everything being fucked . Turns out , some mother of a young teenage boy had seen her story , as the boy followed her snap . And this bitch contacted the girls mother . Mother ( and seemingly family ) was clueless to her lifestyle . And she was taking it rough , as her parents found out , saying it was fucked , but `` sorry mom , but I dont want to work at a starbucks making shit all '' So she got hit with reality , and as you said , `` paid the social cost '' , but checking her snap afterwards , she seems like she 's taking it alright . Still , ca n't believe someone ( the mother telling ) felt like she could contact this girls parents over what she was doing , because her little shit of a son was following her snap ...

Sweden is taking in a shit ton of immigrants , and Migrationsverket ( The Official Immigration Agency ) is too understaffed , and overwhelmed with immigrants . **Fees : ** Non-EU students have to pay a huge fee , which would come around ~22L . But the catch is , these guys give a ton of scholarships for fees . There are 4 100 % Scholarships issued by Volvo and Ericsson , and 80 75 % Scholarships . Among those 80 , around 40-50 goes to Indians . With such a scholarship , you shell out just 5L for your Masters Degree , which is cheaper than what you pay for your undergrad in some parts of India .

Trading and teamplya is vital . If you see a teammate peaking or that 's about to peak , ask if he needs a flash or something . Be ready to step out and trade ; a 4v4 will help you a lot , a 4v5 is quite a disadvantage . You do n't have to take positions at the beginning of the round . It is perfectly OK to let the CTs have banana & amp ; apartments and to take it later in the round , when they have spent most of their grenades . Try to bait out as many nades as possible . Holding off a retake : if you 've played by the book , and no shenanigans have happened ( they will happen , trust me ) so it 's a normal 3v3 retake , both bombsites ( especially A ) are very hard to retake just due to the sheer amount of angles a CT has to check .

1008oh,battlefield_one,"I have n't touched it since before the release of TSNP , exept for a 6 hour session 3 weeks ago . Then I realized that this game was in a way different than BF3/BF4 . Nowadays I rather play BF4 than BF1 . These are the reasons I can think about why I left this game : 1 . Customization . I was a big fan of all the attachments/weapons/camo/gadgets that existed in BF4 . Even though most attachements had the exact stats , I liked the ability to choose between different weapons , and changing them according to the map and the faction I was playing ( US on Siege of Shanghai - & gt ; Run M16A4 w/o any attachments and UCP camouflage for example ) . This is the biggest point for me , and probably the # 1 reason I left BF1 . 2 . Conquest . Ever since I first touched the BF3 beta in 2011 ( wew , was that really 6 years ago ) , I 've been breathing and living conquest . It combines infantry , armored , aerial , and with BF4 also naval combat into one gamemode . What more can be asked for ? With BF1 and the changes to conquest , almost all my joy for that gamemode has been lost . I feel like vehicles have less of an effect on the objectives , and that it 's more infantry fighting infantry . The points system is also a step down from the previous one , where it is usually very easy to tell who is going to win only after a team reaches 200 points . This point also leads nicely into the next one : 3 . Map design . The maps are all so linear , leading into both teams clashing down 25vs25 on the central objective . This makes the fights way more chaotic and means that the first team to capture the central point goes on to win the match . 4 . The trend towards a more `` casual '' game . I guess this is more of a personal opinion , and that DICE had to make the game more casual in order to appeal to a larger audience . I do n't blame them for this . This does n't mean that I did n't like the game ; it 's just that I enjoy BF4 a lot more . BF1 did have some really nice stuff to offer : * Behemoths . I loved the concept , I just think that they have a little too little HP , as they are easily destroyed by a team that makes destroying the behemoth their primary goal , where it does n't have the time to have a significant impact on the game and help the losing team recover and come back . * Sound design . I could mention graphics , but I feel as if we could have had BF1 level graphics in BF4 , but that the average PC/console ( XB1/PS4 released in 2013 ) would not have handled it . The sound however has less to do with specs and more with what of a great job DICE has done in BF1 . The guns , the screams , the steps , the vehicles and the ambient sounds are all just so much better . * Limpet charges . No one ever sees them coming : ) Edit : formatting",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake Inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with Inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until Inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could Inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty . Instead , i see many benifits with bringing in Inferno without removing any map , effectivly increasing the map pool to 8 maps . Firstly , it is the only logical move to do . As I ’ ve said multiple times already , no map deserves to be taken out of active duty . Inferno was remade to make it more viable in professional matches , and will make its way back into the pro scene . If no map can be removed , just expand the pool . Secondly , it allows for other maps to come back to CS : GO , or evn for brand new maps like overpass to be born . Before overpass was introduced , no one would have thought that Valve would create a map from scratch to then force it into professional play . With a bigger map pool , the addition of a new map has a lesser impact on the current professional scene . One new map in a map pool of eight maps in total is going to stagnate the pro scene a lot less than the swap of a map in a pool of seven maps . A valid point to make is the burden placed upon the professional teams . As the number of maps increase , the amount of work required by the pro teams also increases . This may seem like a concern , but this is only due to the bad map draft cutrrently used at major events , where the last map is always selected randomly which requires a team to be very sharp on at least four maps : their own pick , and all three that remain in the randomizer . By increasing the map pool to eight maps , the pick-ban system can be redesigned to work in a very favorable way . Valve ’ s argument for the random third map has been to increase the diversity of maps played , while in CS 1.6 , the maps were banned down until one was remaining . With eight maps , the system could look like this : -First , both team get to ban a map , their “ permaban ” . -Then , both teams pick a map out of the six remaining . -Now , both teams get to ban a map again , reducing the remaining amount of maps to two . -The last map is selected randomly . Technically , by putting in the same work of studying four maps , a team can learn an own favorite map , the favorite map of their opponents as well as both the maps in the randomizer . This should lead to much more interesting BO3 series with closer games , since the teams are given more opportunity to study each other . **Conclusion** The current CS : GO map pool is fairly balanced , with all maps , exept nuke which still should be given time to grow , are quite enjoyed by the community as well as the professional scene . Before the reintroduction of Inferno to competitive play , it is worth considering the possibilities surrounding the active duty map pool . As no map has a real valid reason to be taken away from professional play , a good alterEnglish is to add Inferno without removing any other map , effectivly increasing the map pool to eight maps . In the process , the pick-ban system at major and minor events should be changed in order togive the teams more control over the third map whilst retaining the randomizer for the purpose of variation : let each team ban once , pick once , ban once again and randomize between the last two maps remaining . This should lead to teams being more capable of preparing for events , as well as giving the spectators a better viewing experience , as a consequence of closer map scores . TL ; DR : Reading a TL ; DR is not enough to participate in a discussion I feel like , but if you want to just quickly realize what my thoughts are , just read the conclusion .",Germanic,Swedish
1008oh,pitchforkcrafting,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty .

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"Valve does n't go after these sites because they are using bots . They go after them because they use the steam services commercially .

123yo123,sadboys,"I did it . Every \___ is a song . Apparently Tiger came to be by him re-recording a verse on a really bad , old song of his and then having Whitearmor making a new , `` less serious '' beat to go with it . He says Tiger 's sound is unique on his mixtape . He says it 's his one of his own favourites and that he does n't care about people who say they do n't understand what he 's saying in it . _____ After Migos he says he loves their flow , that it 's like Future 's but more on-point , also enjoys their lyrics . They are real trendsetters with their flow . He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording . ___ After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much , like Hard in da Paint and Versace . He 's apparently called Sweden 's Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone ( Sad Boys manager ) , and Thaiboy himself agrees on that . ___ He loves auto-tune , it makes things better . Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who ca n't sing are able to by using auto-tune , like Chief Keef . People hate auto-tune because they 're conservative and need things to be `` real '' in order to enjoy it , and that you need talent to be able to sing . Auto-tune allows you to be creative in a new way and it 's modern . The interviewer asked if he ever feels like he 's crossing boundaries when he makes music , and he says he feels like he does that a lot , examples being Fuck U . The lyrics make no sense , the melody makes no sense , but the song 's feeling makes sense and that 's all his music is about , the feeling . ___ He started making music in a serious way last summer , people started hating because it sounded pretty bad . Last winter he decided to add auto-tune and now you can catch him on podcasts . Started from the bottom now he here . He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out . First he thought they 'd be like Migos , everybody featured on every track , but now it 's more like GBE with Chief Keef , everyone doing their own thing and occasiounally helping each other out on tracks . ___ Nothing really happens after the Kevin Gates song . ___ Describing boppin , he says it 's an easy dance where you just go low with them knees and go left to right . There are several levels of boppin : the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right , the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around , and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff . She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin . Yung Sherm is very good at it , but Ecco2k is the best one , Bladee and Whitearmor are probably the worst . ___ Conclusively , he says the mixtape will be finished when Whitearmor returns from the tour .",Germanic,Swedish

16dollars,SuicideWatch,"This reply is intended for you OP but I hope that some other lurker out there as well will benefit of it . 1 . In a relationship , be it a love , friendly or family one , there is a minimum of two persons . What a lot of us tend to forget is the amount of responsibility you have to take , or should *not* take , to maintain one . If you 're the one who is always calling your `` friend '' , maybe you should reconsider your friendship with this person ? Move on and try to find someone who cares for you . It may be a cliché but look at it from another perspective . You 're not boring - the people who do n't want to spend time to get to know you are . Basically - **if they do n't want to be your friend - fuck 'em . Their loss and not yours . ** Try contacting someone you have n't spoken to in a long time . I can almost guarantee that they 'll be happy that you reach out . Just have a chat and if it feels good take it a step further and meet . Just have a beer together , play some xbox or whatever you enjoy . And then you repeat . And repeat . And repeat . And then you reconnect with another person . And repeat . 2 . Have you tried internet dating ? It may sound a bit cheesy but it seems that a lot of people get something out of it . And if a date does n't work out , maybe you 've at least made a new friend ? 3 . Do you play any video games ? Voice chat is a minor social interaction but it still makes you connect with other people . Plus you 'll have something to talk about . A big warning though - excessive amount of playing video games can send you down an evil spiral ... Use it as a compliment and **not** a complete substitute for social interaction . 4 . Get out and do stuff . Take a cooking class , learn how to scuba dive , join the local bowling team . It 's the small things that keep you from killing yourself . Just think of it for a second . Suppose you actually took a cooking class . Ok , so you have to get there . You have to meet a bunch of new people and you get to cook something . Talk to some of the people there . Try something like `` hey , we should team up next week since our meatballs were so damn good '' . This means that you have to show up next week . Or one person will wonder what happened to you . You learn how to scuba dive . Sign up for a day trip with your club . Your [ buddy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_diving ) is going to ask you to pick him up at 11am . If you do n't show up two people will now wonder what happened to you . You join the local bowling team . Next sunday is your first game . If you do n't show up 10 people will wonder what happened to you . Maybe you feel that you have nothing in life that is worth living for . But try filling it with *something* and some good may come out of it . I 've been trying to live like this for the last couple of years and it does make a difference . I think you should give it a try , what do you have to lose ? Yes , I 'll admit that some days I still just want to put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger . But knowing that *someone* will miss you if you die can be a comfort albeit a small one .",Germanic,Swedish
