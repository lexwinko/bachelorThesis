My opinion is that they started KP just to try new things and make some money ( I 'm not calling them sellouts , just that KP is a more easy way to make money ) but they have lost the passion to the project now like it happened to them with pend in 2010 . The difference is that seems like they 've lost the passion from KP because of the scene they 've been moving now ( Electro , Dubstep , Big Room ... genres that are saturated rn ) , and this is different way to `` lose the passion for the project '' like it happened to pend and for a creative mind the EDM scene is too much restrictive in terms of originality . Just look how Rob has been bitching to the EDM scene and doing songs that are just jokes about the scene , because KP is just a project to have some fun . IMO , I think that they are going to do more Pend stuff this 2016 , but the lives are going to be in the biggest festivals ( less glastonbury ) so they can win money and not lose it like it happened in the past , and if this works they will continue with pend or do pend and kp at the same time like Jon Gooch with Spor and Feed Me this 2015 .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think the same as you . Luffy already unbalanced the balance of power by defeating three shichibukais and as we have seen he did not need to efeat them all so that it will now be clear that it is possible for the system of sea warriors to be overthrown . With the emperors in spite of being presented as possible final bosses , it is quite unlikely that Luffy face them all because it would take too long . In addition , when Whitebeard was defeated , we saw that there was an imbalance in the balance of power in the New World . Right now as the story progresses , Luffy is not ready to beat an emperor himself alone or with the help of his crew and is unlikely that he will have a power up large enough in an arc to reach the level of an emperor . I see more possible that the first emperor to be defeated is Kaido after a great confrontation between him and the worst generation . That will cause an imbalance that will cause both Blackbeard and the Marine to gain more power in the new world . Shanks may be defeated by Blackbeard towards the end of the story given the fact that Teach said in the paramount war that he was at that moment not ready to fight against him , about Big Mom I have no idea although it may be the same as with Kaido . Anyway the only 1 vs 1 that I see possible is between Luffy and Teach .

Japan was under a civil war during that time and alot of the feudal lords could n't afford to trade with China or Corea during the XVI century because the sea was under the pressure of the Wako pirates ( and even the chinese government prohibited to trade with Japan because of that ) plus they did n't had enough money to spend it in trade since the focus was on the mainland and by the way the merchants in the japanese society were even under the peasants in the social pyramid . That 's why some feudal lords wanted to trade with the europeans , because it was a good way to recive both european and chinese products without having to move from their own possetions in Japan . The europeans were also tolerated because they came in a period of war bringing with them a new religion that said that everyone was equal to god view . Some feudal lords adapted the christianism because they wanted better relations with the europeans so this could make them have priority in the trade in Japan against other daimyos . The thing is that in the christian territories there was less xenophobia ( if we can call it like that ) against the europeans because those japanese christians sometimes felt more related to the europeans that with the rest of the japanese society . Some of these japanese christians married portuguese merchants so when the sakoku was established all of them had to move to other places like Macau , Malacca or even the spanish philippines .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I 'm so intrigued about Lola 's fiancé . That guy needs to be either a huge influential character or a truly monster . Knowing that , it ca n't be one of the past shichibukai members because they do n't have enough power or influence to change the balance of power between the four emperors . The only ones that could change a bit the balance are Doflamingo and Mihawk , and any of those would want to be under a Yonko even when they were related to Kaido and Shanks . It ca n't be either one of the supernovas because they were n't in the new world back then and they are becoming a new power just now . I highly doubt it was a member of the world government either . Why would they even want to become allies with a Yonko ? If she became pirate queen then it would be a huge problem for the Gorosei . Also , it 's kinda impossible that it was a celestial dragon . I mean those guys do n't care about the pleb and they feel that they are gods . They ca n't mix themselves with normal citizens and even less with pirates . The only possibilities I believe that are viable : 1 - Teach : He betrayed Whitebeard . It can either be possible that he wanted to create an alliance with other Yonko to scape of the rage of WB after he killed Tatch , or just to betray both of them at the same time . Trying to ally himself with BM with a political marriage would have been the best way to do it . Also , we know that his current hability allows him to be the perfect counter to every DF user . 2 - Weeble : It would be the best way to introduce him to the plot . He 's really strong so maybe he could have been a determining character against the other emperors . 3 - A new character , which imo could be a strong member of the underworld : We already saw some brokers back in Punk Hazard and I doubt that all of them were working only to the emperors .

Maybe he wanted to marry Lola so he could enter into his family and thus dethrone Big Mom from the inside of her own kingdom . Is not like he could n't do that , in truth he did something similar when he became Shichibukai . He just wanted the tittle so he could recruit some new crew members in Impel Down . Also , we already know that Capone is married with one of BM daughters but he 's going to betray her . Having blood ties with Big Mom makes her vulnerable against her own family . She does n't expect that one of her family members could betray her . Teach could have lied to her saying that he wanted to become part of her crew .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think that he is pretty much a complex character , just like Law . He 's known for killing civilians , but looks like he kills people that laughs at his dreams but he respects Luffy and Law even when he wants to defeat them . Also , he stated in Sabaody that even when he was a pirate he had his own standars compared to the celestial dragons buying slaves . The thing is that surely we need to know him more before we start to judge him . My personal opinion is that like every other important character we 've seen so far , he had his own sad backstory which surely changed him . Maybe someone related to him ( in a similar way to Shanks and Luffy ) taught him about fighting for his own dreams and he took it the wrong path . Maybe his family died , or his words in Sabaody about the slaves are some kind of foreshadowing , we already know that he was poor as a kid thanks to one of the SBS . I 'm sure that it will be really important to know more about his past and how his relationship with Killer started .

I think that Oda is setting up the worst generation in a way that they would end needing each other to defeat a Yonko .

In the space of 2 hours there 's too few things that you can do with these new characters . Tesoro could have had more build up in 15-20 episodes of the anime and we could have knew more about his backstory . Also , Sabo and Lucci were there just for fanservice and we did n't knew what happened with Sabo after he and Lucci shared some punches , tho I need to recognize that I love to see both of them again . The only thing I did n't liked was that there was some inconsistences with kairoseki and sea water : Luffy moved underwater and he technically was tied in kairoseki but then moved like nothing .

All the Yonko had their own crews long before the worst generation arrived to the new world , so it 's logic to think that Kaido did have 3 calamities before X Drake arrived there .

The more important thing here : He has been defeated by a Yonko , one of the strongest characters of the OP world ( if not the strongest one ) . In contrast , Luffy was defeated by an army of BM pirates and he needed Nami and the whole forest of homies to defeat a commander . With this I 'm not saying that Luffy is weak , but against an emperor and his crew the supernovas are like ants . And I have the feeling that Kid being destroyed by Kaido , Cracker and the whole army of BM defeating Urouge and Luffy being captured is just to show that they are not at the same league as the emperors , And to be fair I love it . We will have 4-5 supernovas fighting together against 1 Yonko instead of just the main character , which imo would be boring af .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think that the first one will be explored with Marco 's story later . & gt ; the thing I would love the most , is Oda doing `` filler '' arcs with the Strawhats in beetween the story arcs we normally have So you 're talking about having something like , let 's say , the Davy Back Fight arc ?",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think that with him there 's just two possibilities : He joins or he dies this arc . What I like of him is that he has an interesting backstory , he is serious and does n't live in the clouds so he could become a great adviser for Luffy and also a good contrast with the rest of the crew . Maybe this will make them mature a bit , do n't get me wrong , I like the regular dynamics of the crew but now in the new world and after two years it would be great to see them maturing a bit ( we 're seeing it with Sanji already ) . On the other hand , I think that having an experimented pirate would kill the feeling that they are a group of young ( mentally speaking in Brook 's case ) pirates that have been building their experience from the start of the series . Also , I find Jinbe 's fighting style pretty bland .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I believe that there 's not a huge gap of power between Luffy and the other members of the worst generation as some people say . In truth , Luffy and Zoro stayed 2 years training , but the other supernovas have stayed the same amount of time in the new world dealing by themselves with strong pirates and they have survived . Even Urouge , Kid , Apoo and Hawkins have stayed that amount of time without being under an emperor and they have survived . By the way , Luffy is as close to defeat a Yonko as Urouge or Kid have been in those two years , less for the fleet and the alliances . I mean , do you guys really believe that just because they trained 2 years they are at the same level as 4 pirates that no only control the new world by themselves but instead one of them is enought to deal with the 7 warlords and the marine hq at the same time ? It 's like , seriously guys , they are the fucking four emperors . Is not like other strong pirates have tried to defeat them before . Without a huge alliance between the supernovas and other strong allies no way one of them is going down .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I get what you 're saying but that does n't make Luffy able to defeat a Yonko nor does him way stronger than the rest of supernovas . In fact we have the case of Urouge , who defeated Snack , presumibly by himself due to his raw force and his devil fruit . Luffy needed Nami and the whole forest to defeat Cracker in 11 hours , if it was n't for them , Cracker would have attacked him till Luffy were tired enough to finish him with pretzel . That 's why I hate when some fans underestimate the other supernovas .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"There 's a difference tho , Akatsuki members worked together even if their ambitions where different . the warlords had a deal with the WG but not between them , and as we know they had some tense moments in the marineford arc . As a team , akatsuki members have more opportunities to win . At the same time if you compare akatsuki with the shichibukais , it 's fair to say that the weaker shichibukais are stronger than the weaker members of akatsuki and viceversa , the strongest shichibukais are weaker than the strongest members of akatsuki . * Deidara vs Crocodile : Imo Deidara is the weaker member of the group , and even when he is truly destructive , the fact that Crocodile can skip the explosions thanks to his devil fruit makes every move of Deidara a waste of time . Crocodile would win imo . * Hidan vs Law : In that specific fight against Law he does n't stand a chance . Law can literally split Hidan 's body from a far distance and given that Hidan needs to injure someone in order to make the Jashin ritual , he ca n't do anything against Law . * Konan vs Hancock : Hey , I doubt that Hancock 's DF could work on Konan . Also , Konan can become paper like if it was a logia . Imo Konan is stronger no doubt . * Kisame vs Jinbe : Both are on par imo , Kisame has a gigantic amount of chakra that could overcome the gyojin karate of Jinbe , but Jinbe has proved like he can resist a lot of damage . So who knows . * Nagato vs Teach : Due to the fact that the Yami Yami works specifically against devil fruit users and Nagato does n't have a DF , I 'd say that Nagato wins . Even if Teach had the Gura Gura , Nagato can control gravity so he can attract Teach to himself and then steal his soul . * Sasori vs Moriah : I do n't know , Sasori looks like a weak version of Doffy but Moriah is Moriah ... * Kakuzu vs Kuma : Kuma no doubt , pretty much the same that Hidan vs Law . * Itachi vs Mihawk : I know that Mihawk is possibly the strongest shichibukai , but hey , Itachi can defeat him just using tsukuyomi imo . This without talking about if he used amaterasu . * Obito vs Doffy : I love Doffy buuut Obito 's hability to move into different dimensions makes him a serious problem . Also , If we count that moment when Obito had both the rinnegan and the mangekyo sharingan , Doffy is fucked even if he used his awakening . The interesting fight here would be Madara against the Yonko . Imo , Madara 's power is so fucking ridiculous that with just one of the emperors he would be bored .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Sorry I missed Orochimaru , in that case I think that he could win against Moriah . After all , he can use edo tensei which is like a strong version Moriah 's df and can handle a fight by himself while Moriah was defeated by Jinbe just with one punch .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"As far as I recall every creature had chakra , even animals but they could n't use it . But let 's say that genjutsu does n't work with Mihawk .

He is the most op character ever written in a shonen imo . I believe that if Madara ended in the OP world , he could easily kill everyone without sweating . * Kaguya was kind of a deux ex machina character but surely she could defeat Big Mom . * mmm I do n't know , it depend in how the dust ability of Onoki works against the Yami Yami and the Gura Gura , but I would say that Teach had it better to win because the Yami Yami absorbs everything so I suppose that he could neutralize it like that .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,Gintama,"I do n't like to ship characters in any manga/anime because a lot of them are so forced and unnecessary that I ca n't even want them to happen . In this case is the other way around . The build up has been so slow peaced yet so well done that it needs to happen . Even if Sorachi said that he does n't like romance , like you said Gintama has a lot of it and it 's so well writen that it does n't feel forced . This also happens with Oda in One Piece . He said that he does n't like to write about romance but if you are a manga reader the current arc has some romance in it and it does n't feel forced . Sorachi has make us see that Gintoki is the kind of guy that thinks that he does n't deserve to be loved . But at the same time , every moment he is with Tsukuyo it feels different . In the Courtesan of a Nation arc they even acted like a couple of 15 years old brats that do like each other but do n't want to admit it . There 's not really any other character that could be with Gintoki : Otae is pretty much like a sister for him , Sacchan ... well in this case is just comedic relief and to be fair Kyuubei never felt like she looked to him in a romantic way . Tsukuyo is the only one that could happen and it 's even more evident in every new arc with both of them as main focus . Also I said it in the other post , but in the manga it looked like he liked her even without the effects of the incense . Specially when he said `` I ca n't even look at the woman I like like I usually do '' , because it was implified that he knew that the incense was surting effect in himself but anyways he stated that he liked her . Sorachi is that kind of writer that builds up the story in a way that things that happened at the beggining of the series have a meaning and transcendence now . Maybe the main reason why Sorachi created Tsukuyo was to have someone to teach Gin that he can be loved and also love someone and the better way to do it is if both end together .

Also , there is a saying in my country that says `` More knows the devil for being old than for being the devil '' , and it fits pretty much with Big Mom .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't fucking know what to think anymore . I liked her being the ally in this arc ( even if she was the stereotypical princess that helps the SH 's , I liked her way more that the past ones ) and her memories about Lola , the moments she shared with Sanji and all that looked so real that I ca n't really believe she was bad from the beginning , plus the moment when Brook and Pedro saw her choosing a wedding dress she looked like she really wanted to make it to the seducing woods to help Luffy and the rest . Yeah , it looked too good to be true but let 's be honest , there 's a lot of characters that acted kindly with the SHs in every island since they meet them . Just remember Skypiea for example . Also , the way it 's been builded up it looked that some daughters of Big Mom felt like tools and wanted to get out of that ( not just Pudding and Lola , but also Praline and Chiffon ) . If she 's been working for mama since the beginning then she 's such a psychopath specially because Sanji was already tied and he could n't scape . Where is the point into making him falling in love for her then ? Also , why she said it to Luffy and Nami whispering if Opera was the only one there and he is also loyal to Big Mom ? So ... I not 100 % sure that she 's evil . Maybe she wants to make both parties fight each other so Sanji can scape . Maybe even if all that she said was true , it could be that she has two personalities or even that she started all this like what Big Mom planned and then it turned that she ended liking Sanji . After all why Big Mom wants to kill the Vinsmokes ? She would gain not only the technology but also the royal family as allies which are strong warriors . And why she wants to kill them in the ceremony ? I mean , she can kill them now , as we know the Germa kingdom is there so there 's no point into waiting to the wedding . Anyways , it is interesting to see how Oda has introduced us to the Vinsmokes as a kind of arrogant Nazi family which a lot of us hated or wanted Sanji to clean the soil with them and now it turned that I am even afraid that something bad could happen to them . Maybe this will be the path to make them see that Sanji deserved to be treated better when he saves their lives . At the other hand if she is evil then it would be really interesting , specially since it would be completely unique and different compared with the princess in distress we 've been seeing for years now . Having a manipulative and psychopatic female character is one of the things that would make this arc even better , plus it has some logic since with Anana we 've seen that Big Mom teaches her kids into being as cruel as they can , and for the rest of siblings it looks like they are absolutely loyal to her mother . Seriously , this arc is right now the most matured one we 've seen so far . The complexity and diversity of characters , the amount of `` What if.. '' moments it has with every chapter and the way Oda is showing us that the Yonko are at a different league in comparison with the rest of characters we 've seen so far makes this the best arc of the new world and pretty close to Enies Lobby as the best arc of One Piece .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I like both equally so I get what you mean . Like you I think that One Piece has a better world building no doubt and the story is full of amazing lands , mythology , races , kingdoms , cultures and organizations . Also , if we compare both mangas , I personally find more interesting and unique Oda 's style of drawing . Gintama on the other hand is funnier , but people tend to think that is all about dick jokes and parodies when in truth the serious arcs are no doubt at the same level as the best arcs of OP and that is because Sorachi does an amazing job building the relationships between characters in the funny arcs , so when we reach the serious ones all has been builded so perfectly that you can feel the motivations of the characters . & gt ; The Shogun Assassination arc is the best story arc I have ever read and seen . And it 's largely because it contains my favorite fight of all the media I 've experienced .

You have some interesting designs like Gladius , but then you have grotesque and annoying ones like Buffalo , Machvise or Jora . The problem was n't that they had just weird designs , but that their personalities felt too flat and their powers were , as I said , the same as the agents of Baroque Works .

That 's why I personally like the more simple ones . Zoro could have a pretty boring past compared with other characters , but his backstory feels real . The same can be said about Usopp , Luffy , Whitebeard , Jinbe , Capone or Coby .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I think considering that there are 4 yonkos , it is quite likely that Oda will do some kind of intermediate arc . I say this because I doubt that Oda want to face the SH with the 4 yonkos one after another . I believe that he will focus in Big Mom and Kaido ( both have been hyped yet ) , then a small arc in which other characters are included and then return with Shanks and Teach . He showed something similar at the beginning of the series , when we were introduced to Mihawk . Many thought that the SH would fight with all the Warlords one after another , especially after seeing the confrontation with Crocodile . But this did n't happened because Oda knew that it could have been too cliche . At the same time , the yonkos are possibly the strongest individual characters and Oda will lengthen the saga of the four emperors as much as possible so that we can see in detail their skills and motivations and what made them the most powerful pirates . A little break between the emperors could be good not just for the pace of the story but for reintroduce old characters or other ones that are not really related to the yonkos . Obviously we do n't know what will happen with Crocodile , Moriah , Buggy , Weevil , Mihawk , Jewelry Bonney , Urouge , Enel , CP0 , Vegapunk , the revolutionaries etc . Maybe some of them will be part of one recent arc ( my hopes are in Crocodile , Bonney and the CP0 in the BM arc , Moriah in the Wano arc and maybe Mihawk and Buggy with Shanks ) but there 's a lot of characters that are like wildcards right now . They can have their shining moment in a small bridge arc after BM/Kaido arcs and before the other two yonkos . I think that if this is the case , my bets are with an arc related to the moons and sky islands involving Enel and Urouge among others ( maybe Monet ? ) . That would be a good way for Oda to explain some of the history surrounding the moons .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I always see theories about possible new members for the SH crew , but I would like to see new member in the other important crews . These are the ones I woul like to see : **Bellamy** : I know that this will not happen bc Bellamy is more an ally than an enemy and after everything that happened with Doflamingo is quite unfeasible to him being under the rules of someone again , but would love to see Bellamy being part of Crocodile 's band . The current design of Bellamy reminds me to a member of a mafia and Crocodile at the moment except for Mr 1 seems to have no one under his command , if Crocodile ends up being an ally or even a revolutionary , it would be really interesting to see Bellamy with him . **Caesar Clown** : Kid Pirates . It has been said in some occassions and is something that I think it could happen and indeed it **should** happen . Caesar is not going to be redeemed and it fits perfectly with the way that the Kid Pirates act , he has no remorse about killing people . At the same time , it would be a good way to create an alliance between enemies of Luffy as happened at the beginning of the series with Buggy and Alvida . In this case , it would be much more logical , because Kid represents a greater threat than Buggy . I know there are people who think that he will end in the Law 's crew but I personally doubt it , the Heart pirates now are 20 members and I assume that we will know more about them in Wano . **Caribou & Coribou** : From the moment they were introduced , these two characters were shown to have skills to finish under the orders of Buggy . After all we know that Buggy has a great reputation and most of the funniest villains end up in his band . It would be amazing to see that these two act with him like Bartolomeo with Luffy . **Monet** : Yes , I know many of you believe she 's dead , but I 'm really optimistic , specially since there are some things about her that Oda did n't explained . If she comes back , I think it would also be possible for her to end up in the Kid pirates . Monet is an harpy , one of the most brutall creatures of the greek mythology and at the same time she would be somewhat of the more human character within a sanguinary group of pirates when ironically she is not completely human .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Since we know the identity of Ichiji and Niji , the theory of Killer or the two brokers that we saw in the Punk Hazard arc being them had disappeared completely . At the same time it has also virtually disappeared the possibility that these characters are siblings of Sanji ( in an SBS Oda already said that Killer was greater than Sanji and the other two characters also seems older than him ) . Based on what we know about the Vinsmokes ... Could it be possible that those characters are kind of a second branch of the family ? I mean , we saw that in `` Sora , the warrior of the sea '' there was 2 Vinsmokes with the numbers 1 and 2 in their capes . This history was really old like Vito said , it 's possible that those two characters are different from the Ichiji and Niji that we 've seen yet . So it could be that there is a second branch of Vinsmokes who follow the first branch , just like what happens in the actual mafias . In fact , it is possible that the names of the Vinsmoke could have the premise that they are `` immortal '' ( not literally , of course ) . Something similar to what happened with the 10,000 immortals of the persian army ( always the same number of soldiers , so if one of them dies other one replaces him ) , but in this case with names . Thus , the idea that even if you kill `` Ichiji '' or `` Niji '' there will be other ones with the same name being their successors , so the leader of the Vinsmoke always would be `` Ichiji '' and the second will be `` Niji '' , suggesting that they are an immortal family . Talking again about this second branch , I do believe that Killer and those 2 guys are part of it . Let 's focus on Killer . We do n't know how is his face ( so he could be hiding the typical eyebrows of the Vinsmoke family ) and although this is only like that because perhaps Oda likes the design with the helmet , even when his face was shown when he was a kid we could n't see it well ( all his face was covered by his hair ) , besides there are many things between Killer and the Vinsmokes ( especially Sanji ) that look alike : we do n't know his full name since Killer was a nickname that Oda used because he was lazy to think about something , his mask is based on one of the members of Daft Punk ( two french artists , Sanji would be french for what Oda said ) , their culinary tastes also have something to do with France and Italy and his fighting style is very bloody , so that not only fits into Kid 's crew but also would do as a member of Germa 66 . I know there are many points that do not fit if we think about Killer being one of the brothers of Sanji : He ca n't follow the pattern of the names for what we 've seen so far ( He is greater than Sanji , so there is no number for him now ) and if he was a Vinsmoke , how he ended in the South Blue ? Well , what if he has a similar story that Sanji in that sense ? it might even be that both escaped together and finished in different Blues . Killer is 6 years older than Sanji so it could be a cousin , member of that second branch . For the two brokers , I think that it 's difficult to know but for their looks ( blonde hair , their faces are hidden and one of them carries similar headphones to those of Reiju ) it could be possible .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,feedme,"Until a couple of years ago I always tended to compare Jon with Rob Swire . The two come from similar backgrounds , starting at the Drum & Bass scene and passing a few years ago to new genres with a secondary project that in both cases has become the main project .

Since Calamari Tuesday was released and specially since he created his own label , each new release of Feed Me is more versatile and original although still retaining its characteristic sound , even in EPs with more commercial songs it stills sounds great .

Remember that half of his crew was on the last level of Impel Down , so maybe someone there could read them and that 's why they were there . Also , what about Big Mom `` collecting '' Poneglyphs ?",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"**Note** : I doubt that everything that I will expose here has been done by Oda explicitly , some things are surely simple coincidences . No need to be very smart to realize that the band seems to be based , among other things ( cuz you know , Oda loves to mix a lot of different things ) , in tribes of Central Asia : - During ages and until China was invaded by the manchus , in China , India and Europe the tribes of central asia were considered authentic beasts or demons : They moved like nomadic hordes , ravaging all its path . As an example , the Huns were considered sons of demons and witches . Quite possibly Oda has played with this and specially the fact that they are a band formed mainly by Zoan users . Also , a lot of members of this crew have horns . It was very common in Europe and China to represent the Huns and Mongols with horns , as if it were demons . However , the main point of connection between the theme of Central Asian tribes and the beasts pirates are at the moment , its known members : - **Kaido** : For his design , I think that it 's obvious that a lot of his traits are based on the classic look of the great Khans of the Mongol Empire , but mixed with the red Oni ( a japanese demon ) . He is consideres the `` world 's strongest creature '' , a curious fact that his main inspiration seems to be Genghis Khan , title of the first and most important Mongol emperor . At his peak , the Mongol empire stretched from Korea in the east to Hungary at the west , and from Mongolia in the north to the northern India in the south , so their rulers were the kings of the world 's biggest empire . The term *Genghis Khan* has two meanings : *Lord of all oceans* and *immovable / universal king* . One of the most famous phrases of Genghis was `` *The greatest joy for a man is to defeat his enemies* '' . Well , it seems that Kaido is no slouch in this regard *cough* Kid and Moriah *cough* . In turn , alcoholism was quite common among many Mongol rulers . On the other hand , his name resembles that of Kaidu , emperor of the Chagatai Khanate , a division of the Mongol Empire . It 's funny because during the time when Kaidu was a ruler there was a great war between the successor states of the Mongol Empire that led to Kaidu 's death after being wounded in battle . The fact that Kaido has occupied Wano is a clear reference to the two attempts of invasion that the emperor Kublai Khan did to Japan in 1274 and 1281 . Although it has nothing to do directly with the Mongols , Kaido has three trusted men , the three calamities . It 's funny because Oda recently began to see GOT and among the Dothraki there is a tradition of having 3 men trust known as bloodriders . Although the Dothraki are fictional , they are based on the nomadic tribes of central Asia , too . Let 's talk about the calamities . We only know **Jack** , whose name like in the case of Ace , Joker , Pica , Diamante , Trebol , Ginrummy etc is a pun on a card game . At the same time , shares its name with Calico Jack , a famous pirate of the XVIII century . - Jack was introduced by Sheepshead as `` the Drought '' and he said that if Jack is in a place all the land stays dry as if it had suffered a drought ... Too much coincidence : He 's based on another famous tribes who came from Central Asia , the Huns . More specifically in Attila . It was said that the grass did not grow where Attila had passed . His appearance seems closer to that of a viking . Even when this just does not means anything , Attila is an important part of some Scandinavian chronicles . - Again talking about the invasions of Kublai Khan to Japan , the attempt of Jack for bringing down Zunisha and his easy defeat is possibly a reference to the *kamikaze* , a typhoon that destroyed the entire Mongol fleet before they could get to step on Japanese soil . **A small side note** : Obviously we do n't have information about who are the other two calamities . However , if Oda continues the pattern of Central Asian tribes or just Asian emperors / generals , my bet is that one of the two remaining calamities will be based on Timur . He was the biggest conqueror of central Asia after Gengis Khan and he had his own epithet ( *the Lame* ) . Some people thinks that the other two calamities will be based on famous japanese samurais but I doubt it . This will be saved for Wano . Also , looks like the Shogun is not a calamity so he does not count .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,feedme,"He answered loads of questions ( even mine about the sample on Cyberpunk ) so maybe i 'm missing something but these are the more interesting answers : Seems like Jon has three or four new vocal tracks and the new EP will have ten songs . He 's working on something especially for Mau5trap ( maybe a song for a WAF compilation or a collab with d5 ? ) and maybe we will see the collab with Skrillex done . Seems like Snort & Leasure ( his new project with Kill the Noise ) will have new songs coming and maybe a tour , and Teeth 2.0 will be a thing in a near future . Regardless of all the Feed Me stuff , he 's trying to finish the Seventh Stitch album but seems like it will take time . He said that originally Schizoid was started with Gareth McGrillen ( from KP/Pendulum ) on an all-night studio session . Someone asked him about producers who follow trends and he said that he does not think that it 's something bad , but anyways he makes music for him . Caligo will be released on vynil and maybe CDs . Also Philip K Dick and Robin Jarvis are huge influences for him , something that does not surprise me tho , it 's kinda obvious in early Spor and in Seventh Stitch respectively .",Romance,Spanish

Their ability to feel emotions was taken away , and their childhood was robbed to make them weapons . Do n't get me wrong , what they did to Sanji was terrible . But what makes Sanji different to his brothers is that he can feel emotions and thus emphatize with them . He could even feel sorry for them . Maybe I 'm the only one that would want this to happen , but I think that it would be great if he could forgive them at the end of the arc so we could see them working together and Ichiji , Niji and Yonji recognizing that Sanji is strong enough to be respected . After all what we 've seen , defeating them would be just an eye for eye , and Sanji 's way better than that . Also , we already know that he 's more powerful that Yonji and Niji and possibly Ichiji . Sanji wants to save his sister , so he would need to tell what 's going on to his brothers in the case that Luffy and the others do n't show up until the wedding day . Surely his brothers would not believe him but sooner of later they would end working together . How could this end with the brothers respecting Sanji ? Easy .

I started a campaign with the Visigoths today and I was ravaging the entire map from Greece to Tarraco but once I settled in Carthage the income began to fall again . I am doing something wrong ?

At the time , India was under the gupta empire government , tho there was some other empires like the Pallava dynasty , the Kamarupa kingdom , Chalukya or the Kadamba dynasty .

At the same time , he put a 10 to Batman V Superman and has voted positively in all the negative comments for Civil War . The worst is that he is not the only one who has done this , a lot of people that is saying bullshit about Civil War are DC fanboys and you just need to go to their profiles to see it . I think it 's really curious because when BvS was released , a lot of DC fans were like `` all the Marvel fans are punctuating negatively the film bcuz DC is better and for adults , Disney buys the critics bla bla bla '' and now , it 's truly ironic that a lot of them are doing just this , punctuating negatively the film even when I 'm sure that a lot of them did n't saw it .

They can not enjoy a film of Marvel , even if it was the fucking best film ever made because for them this is like a match and they just follow their team like hooligans .

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"Why Rob said a lot of times that the Live thing was dead and now it seems that he want it more than never ? Let me explain it point by point . First of all , I do n't think that Rob hates Pendulum but rather there 's a set of factors that have made that him ca n't feel comfortable when someone asks him about Pendulum and sometimes simply he let us see that he really does n't care about Pendulum just because he thinks that doing this these people will stop asking . It 's normal that when you 're working on a new project such as Knife Party , it will bother you that an amount of fans will ask you non stop about your previous projects and in their case they had to endure many fans asking again and again or saying things like `` Knife Party is shit , go back to Pendulum '' . I think that is the main reason . The second reason is that as has been said several times , lost interest in the project but I do not think he did it in his creative phase , that is , I do not think he lost interest in producing more music as Pendulum when he started the Knife Party project , but rather he wanted to try new things , just like Jon Gooch when he started Feed Me . He lost interest in Pendulum because the lives assumed a great economic cost and because pendulum started to become more `` Mainstream '' , considering that they acted in the same scenarios that well known bands and Pop artists at the same time that the expensive tours for Lives sometimes had to deal with a bland public ( See Glastonbury 2011 , although according to Rob there were more moments like that ) . So I think that Knife Party was clearly the most natural and logical path for him , because in the beginning he had a great interest in producing things that sounded too far of what Pendulum could have release , especially the first three EPs in which we can note that certainly they put a lot of effort into producing something interesting and though they say that Knife Party is not a serious project I think that was initially planned as something serious . Besides that Knife Party allowed them to earn more money thanks to the DJ sets and releasing music for a sector that grew as much as EDM . Until 2013 it is clear that they have enjoyed Knife Party , but the bubble burst : The Dubstep saturated soon and within the Electro House sound , they released his last interesting songs in Haunted House . From 2014 we saw that Rob was pretty tired of EDM , because he could not offer anything more to it and as he said `` it 's time to produce Drum & Bass '' and I was like `` after Abandon Ship came again the turn of Pendulum '' . For the album name and the lyrics of Begin Again I must say that I saw it as a clear statement that Pendulum was coming back and it was time to leave Knife Party and thus the EDM boat . This 2015 they have been virtually absent except for a very shitty and generic EP until they announced the Pendulum Live . This leaves me a very clear - perhaps too optimistic - idea but is what I think . I think that Rob and Gareth now are more interested in Pendulum that in Knife Party and this may be something that has been dragging on since Abandon Ship , because is likely they are not longer interested in Knife Party as a project ( this is why Rob said that he wanted to do a new project in the AMA ) but they have been unable to return because if they return to Pendulum - at least in the case of Rob - will be for Lives alone , and considering how expensive the Live are ( I 'm sure UMF has paid a lot of money ) they have decided do it in a big festival and in the perfect moment . Now they only are not going to lose money , they know that UMF is the perfect place to make a glorious return , and this is what Pendulum deserves . On the other hand , I think that when he said in the AMA that he was not interested in producing Drum & Bass , it was a lie because if they are not interested in Drum & Bass , why they are always playing Neurofunk at the end of the KP sets ? He said this because if he said that there was another album , the pend fans would not have stopped asking him about it . Finally , I remember two tweets that were deleted but that are interesting : First when Rob responded to a girl that the album would begin to be produced in September 2014 ( although maybe he deleted it because the Knife Party album took them too long and most certainly they were exhausted after it ) and the second when someone asked Gaz and he said something like `` We are with Knife Party for the moment until Pendulum is organized again . '' This tweet it also was deleted if I remember correctly and although maybe it was just a joke , might be the drunk Gaz ( it would not be unusual ) saying the truth . I do n't know if they are going to release a new album soon ( at least I do n't think that we are going to see it until the end of the year if they produce it ) but what is clear is that they will do it sooner or later , I think that everything depends on the response they have with the crowd and if they feel confortable , we will have as soon as possible , in fact I do n't think that will be weird if they include some demos on the Ultra Live . Well what are your theories ? P.S Sorry for my english , is not my mother tongue and btw I 'm drunk now so",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,askseddit,"This is my first post here , but I 'm going to go full detail bc I really need help with this girl . Well , the past month I was in a bar with some friends , just drinkin as usual . At the other table there was a group of girls . That being said , two of my friends tried to talk with these girls , but before doing it they went outside a minute ( you know , smoking and other shit ) and I was alone for a couple of minutes . My friends know how I am : I 'm not a shy guy , but I do n't really talk to random girls bc I 'm very cold and selective , and there 's a great difference between me and my friends . They see girls like if they where meat or a trophy , while I see them as what they are : persons . That 's why for me , if a girl is just pretty but she 's dumb af I do n't really want to talk to her at all , and these girls seemed like that ( yeah I judge people without knowing them , I 'm a bad person you can hate me ) . But then , one of these girls turned and she invited me to a couple of drinks when I was alone . At the moment I saw her , I became stone . I was like hypnotized , I do n't know if it was just for how she looked at me but it was weird . My friends came and then they started talking with the friends of this girl . One of my friends was kinda jealous , and he said some bad things of me to her but she brushed him with his hand and kept talking to me . Then she took my phone and wrote his number ( I did n't asked it ) , and after this all his group went outside bc it was very late . So without doing anything ( just being myself and without wanting it ) I was sure I liked her . After that , I 've been talking to her for a month , and she said to me that I was a really special guy ( and not in a kind of LJBF way , she had said to me a lot of times that she does not have boyfriend without asking it ) . She has been really interested on me . I 've been with her and it 's the first girl that only with his presence makes me feel really special , adding to this how intelligent , funny and interesting she is . But then there 's something bad with this . It 's the first girl in my whole life that I think I really like and that 's the problem bc at this point I always do shit . Last week I was with her and we were like 15 seconds looking at each other just straight in the eyes and smiling like idiots .

It 's been a week and since this moment practically we have not spoken ( and that 's rare because when I do n't talk to her , she does ) . I 've tried to talk to her since then but I think that something is happening . basically I talked to her the wednesday and she said `` I 'm studying '' . Yeah , I can believe it bc I do it too but it 's weird because when she does it at least when it ends always talks to me for a while . On thursday she said that she had two exams the next day and we talked some more , so I thought she just not had time to talk to me and all was ok.

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I have a theory that the Kaido-shogun alliance has something to do with the black boats of Matthew Perry , so first of all , I 'm gon na explain it : Imagine that you are the governor of a country that has been closed to the rest of the world for practically 200 years and it starts to grow the discontent between citizens and some political and military . Then some very powerful foreigners come to your shores and threaten you to open the doors to trade . You do it , but it 's obvious an unequal treatment and you go terribly disadvantaged . This happened in Japan in 1853 , and this obvious lack of strength against the `` nanban '' was one of the causes of the fall of the shogunate . Kaido is a Yonko , one of the four pirate emperors of the new world . A country that is not into the world government has a great disadvantage in the new world , because the world government ca n't help you in front of these huge pirates . Then someone like Kaido can just reach Wano and sit on the throne . After all , it is a closed country and quite possibly **what happens in Wano , stays in Wano** , so if he is recruiting an army , obviously there 's no better place that a country with a closed door policy . No one will know what is he doing in there , or even maybe he wants to have some samurais in his army . However , it is sure that Kaido know that the samurais are proud warriors and that they would not accept a `` foreign devil '' being their direct ruler , so he preferred to be allied to the Shogun . In truth , I believe that more than a ally , the Shogun is a puppet for him , something like an intermediary between him and the samurais . This Shogun obviously does have some Daimyos against him , So he needs Kaido to maintain the order in his own country . It is a symbiotic relationship in which however , Kaido wins . I believe too that the beasts pirates are really annoying to the looks of the Wano citizens ( holy fuck , they are called `` beasts '' for something ) : Drinking , breaking things and causing continuous fights . So , you have the conflict here , a Shogun who leaves a bunch of annoying pirates do what they want , while defend him in case there is a revolt of samurais . Btw , obviously he wants someone who could read poneglyphs and Wano is the country of the family who invented them . tl ; dr : Kaido has his entire zoan army in Wano bc the world government has no way to get information of what happens there , he wants the samurais joining his army bc he know how strong they are so he needs the Shogun to control them and he is wanting for someone to read the red poneglyph he has .

2stepsfromglory,oddworld,"Tho I love every place in the games , these are my two favourites . Stockyards / Free Fire Zone : Every Time I arrive at this part of the game gives me some weird feeling similar to what I have every friday when arriving at home at the afternoon , then realizing I need to do loads of things before being entirely free . The stockyards are like this part of your town that you do n't like to visit , because it is practically abandoned . The first `` enclosures '' of scrabs have some orange / yellow lights coming from the factory himself , and it 's kind of depressing if we mix this with the shadows of the scrabs . The gates are rusted and it shows that no one had review them in a long time . As further you go from the factory , most obvious is that Glukkons have little interest in the creatures used as merchandise : The cages are more broken and you can see how quickly the limits of the factory end between a huge sterile rocks . The huge smell of dead animals goes off , the two or three pesky flies that were annoying you in the stockyards disappear . Then a intense cold goes through your body , a feeling of moisture that gets into your bones . You are in the Free Fire Zone .

On the other hand I also imagine that the area in which Abe passed are a group of hills crowned by sharp peaks of black rocks . In the NNT conceptual art it shows something that seems long fields with dead trees . I think that these are the lands that lie just beneath these hills , and were once large savannas . ( Note : Of the three versions of the stockyards , my favourite is the original from Oddysee , because it has this old , abandoned and depressive look . Btw , I like more the old motion sensors that looks like Glukkon heads , they give a sense of authority . I like some things from the New N Tasty version tho , specially the orange lights on the floor and the end , when you can see the true contrast between the Stockyards and the Free Fire Zone . The Nowtun 's version has some great additions by adding the feeling that the stockyards are separated by nodes that are much more extensive than what we see in the original games ) . Slig Barracks : Polluted and desert , I do n't know why but I believe it has a strong smell of dirty water . I imagine it as a place where it is not hard to go unnoticed , because you just have to hide among the huge number of bags of artillery around you . A place in which it is easier to fall into the void to be fired . It 's like a cross between a giant landfill and a post-apocalyptic land after a great war in a retro-futuristic world . I love the looks it has , and the green / yellow lights gives this place a cold and distinctive atmosphere . So ... what is your favourite Oddworld place and why ?",Romance,Spanish

Ultra is good just because it arrives to a bigger crowd . the Main Stage was truly beautiful but , besides that , I believe they could have done this live in other place .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Since we 've seen all the plot with Kaido , a lot of huge characters are going to be part of the alliance against him : SH , the Heart Pirates , samurais , ninjas , minks , zunisha ... even maybe Marco with the WB commanders , some members of the SH great fleet and who knows , maybe Jinbei . Seeing all this amount of characters being allies of the SH , I start to think about the role of Kid in all of this . In Sabaody and the new world , he was like the Kurgan from the Highlander . He kills everyone who gets in his path and does not receive orders from anyone . So , I always thought that he was going to have a paralel history aside of Luffy , doing his own thing . I want him being the guy who creates his own alliances , like what I thought it was going to happen with Hawkins and Apoo , but now it looks like we are going to have a new Law , at least if these legs we saw in the last episode are his own . And if this is the case , I 'm sure that I 'm not going to enjoy it . I mean , I do n't want every supernova being an ally of Luffy ( less in this specific case ) , and even if we saw a Luffy-Law-Kid alliance just to take down Kaido ( something that I can understand seeing how powerful Kaido is ) , I want Kid creating his own thing and not being the `` new powerful character that joins the SH cause '' . Btw , lately I 've seen characters that could really fit in his crew but all of them are kind of wasted : Caesar , Monet ... even Moriah could be an ally of him knowing that both hate Luffy and both have a `` dark theme '' . What are your thoughts on Kid and his crew ? What do you guys think that he will do in the future ?",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"A lot of people is talking a lot about Kaido and the beast pirates but seems like no one has a great interest in Big Mom . Some people figure that she is the weakest of the Yonkos while we do n't have any proof of this and even if she is the weakest , she is the fourth stronger pirate of the world . What we know about her is that she has a huge obsession for candies , she controls a lot of islands and extorts their citizens : If they do not offer a monthly amount of candy , she does not only stops to protect these islands but also she will destroy them . In fact , she does not even have to do it personally , and if her crew members can destroy countries , it 's obvious that she can do it too . Even more easily . We 've seen that she is a huge monster and she ate some of his crew members . She algo has some kind of corrosive saliva . Some people says that this is some kind of DF . But after all of this , I believe that the interesting thing about Big Mom is her theme . If the theme of Kaido is a mixture of the animal brutality and the mongol mythology ( the strongest creature on earth , the beast pirates , his army of zoan users , he is enemy of minks and samurais and has a Gengis Khan look ... ) , Big Mom theme is the mafias . She acts like the leader of the italian mafia , her epithet also sounds like it ... also , the whole thing about the alliance with the Vinsmoke ( a family of assassins ) and his family concept really looks like the one in the mafia films . She has members of her crew working in the underworld ( Tamago , Pekoms ... ) and Capone Bege ( a character obviously based on Al Capone ) is working for her . This is why , without doubt , I 'm even more hyped about BM that with Kaido . With the BM arc we are going to see not just fights with a Yonko , mafias and assassins , we are going to learn more about the underworld . And I believe that in this arc we will see some of these characters of the new world that we know that had to appear again : Crocodile , Mr. 1 , Moriah , Bartolomeo ( his crew was part of a mafia before they were pirates ) , Jinbe , Caesar ( both are related to BM ) and maybe Bonney ... Btw , if the girl with three eyes is Purin , seeing how she looked kind of sad I hope this ends with her being an ally . What I 'm saying with this is ... BM arc will be epic and I believe it will have a lot of information about how things go in the new world .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,oddworld,"Well , as we all know for AO and AE the Mudokons were the prominent race of Mudos ( or even Oddworld ) for centuries being the top in architecture , religion , art , philosophy , politics and the art of war . They were a English people , so allegedly they maintained the lifestyle we 've seen in the Monsaic Lines . I mean , something similar at the Mayan / Egyptian architecture , even some tribes were more like English american tribes . Then they discovered the Moon and it became all the slavery era , being the industrial species the new big thing surpassing the Mudokons . But did the Mudokons started to be a industrial people at some point before the Glukkons / Sligs / Vykkers ? In the Monsaic Lines , we can see this http : //vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/oddworld/images/8/80/Mud_evilSold_inverted_colors.png/revision/latest ? cb=20121227041611 It 's a Mudokon holding a fire gun , something that may well lead at the idea that the Mudokons were going to be an industrial race before they were the slaves of the Glukkons and Vykkers . It can be very possible that they were growing to a pre-industrial life style , seing how they were the best in a lot of things they could n't be living as a stone age type of civilizations for such a long time . I think that this could have been possible in the way that at the first time Glukkons and Mudokons worked together just before they were slaved . Maybe Glukkons just robbed the pre-industrial Mudokon technology and they used against them , or it might be that some Mudokons were forced to drop their ancient culture deceived by Glukkons , thus betraying their fellow who refused to work for the industrial world ?",Romance,Spanish

Doffy at least was creating slaves , gathering devil fruits , and making his own . Not really true .

But you need to understand that not everyone in the OP world is as lucky as Luffy to have a crew member who can read them . Also , she 's been making alot of alliances thanks to the arranged marriages . The problem with Big Mom is that she 's a terrible mother and a lot of her child could switch sides at the first oportunity . & gt ; Like just from a story perspective if the Big Mom pirates suffer any major defeat from this point on ( Katakuri , Smoothie , or Big Mom ) There is absolutely no reason she would deserve the title yonko . The Yonko are said to be in a stalemate right now . And people kept bringing that up whenever others said that yonko is just a title I do agree and that 's why I doubt that any of them will go down . Maybe Mont D'Or ( causing a similar effect to what happened with Sugar ) and some other second sons like Galette but no way the strongest ones will fall . There 's a lot of sons and daughters that we do n't know yet , plus other characters that were introduced and surely will come into play the next time that the Big Mom Pirates become relevant after this arc ( Amande and Opera for example ) .

Victoria fits with the fact that it 's a period that they 've never touched before ( if we do n't count FotS ) and it could add a lot of new content and mechanics for the campaign , including trains like FotS did . If they do this game , it needs to be a map of the whole world , or at least Europe , Africa , Asia and north america . It would be then the biggest map they 've done to date , also it would add greater naval battles since it was the time of the pre-dreadnought battleships and there would be a huge diversity of factions . Diplomacy and politics should be more important that in the previous games and religion should become something important again . It could even add some different campaigns like the american civil war , the crimean wars , the opium wars ... - XVI / XVII century : That also could be a good option since it could be a like a mixture of Medieval 2 and Empire , adding the wars of religion in Europe like the 30 years war or the conquest of america as a subcampaigns . - China : I loved Shogun 2 because it was refreshing after a lot of games about Europe . China has had a lot of periods of war but the period of the three kingdoms it 's no doubt the best one for a game , and since China has more diversity in cultures and religions than Japan it 's sure that it will have more diversity between factions .

We know that Elbaf is a country based on viking tales and that honor is a big part of their culture , so I imagine that it could have something to do with that . Then she became an orphan and ended up under the protection of Mother Carmel .

In fact , Law and Capone have spent years preparing their plans . Urouge could definitely be stronger than him in a brute force contest . Law is on par with Luffy ( Doffy knew about Law 's style of fighting so he was prepared to face him ) and his devil fruit is at the top 3 of the strongest ones . Heck , the fucker sliced Vergo in half . Hawkins tanked a kick from Kizaru like it was nothing before the timeskip ( even when Kizaru defeated him after that ) and his devil fruit seems to give him the ability to resist against severe damage . Apoo must be able to kill anyone from a distance and X Drake stopped Urouge and Killer at the same time pre-timeskip . He was a Rear Admiral ( that 's the fourth highest rank on the Marine ) before that , so I guess that the guy should be pretty impressive now . And Kid . Well , all the shit he 's taking now is not a proof of him being weak .

Also , they are not a main threat anymore since the story right now seems to move into the next level ( the emperors ) , and also all seems to root to their abolition since it 's been proven numerous times that the shichibukai are not stable enough : Jinbe helped an emperor , Moriah was too weak to hold the title , Law and Teach only held the title until it stopped being from utility to them , Crocodile tried to own an ancient weapon and Doffy tried to mass murder the population of a country .

He knew about awakening and he has mastered his devil fruit to the point that he can even suck the moisture of the people and objects . - **Jack** . Maybe he is just that strong , but the fucker did hold himself against the two strongest mink warriors for days . It has been stated that awakened zoans gives the users the hability to recover rapidly even after suffering high amounts of damage . So being one of the three strongest pirates from Kaido 's crew , it 's possible that he has an awakened DF . - **Kuzan and Sakazuki** . They changed completely the landscape of a whole island . - **Dragon** . We do n't really know if he has a DF , but the fact that everytime that he shows up there 's a storm it 's a huge indicator that he could very well have an awakened DF . In case that they have it , all of these should have had the awakening naturally . But ... what I 'm saying with `` naturally '' ? Well , it felt kinda odd that the Jailer Beasts had their devil fruits awakened . They were n't that strong to begin with , and after the timeskip there was even a new member ( which felt odd , specially since he is also a zoan user ) so my headcanon is that they can also be awakened artificially , and Vegapunk knows how to do it . Smoker has been shown to be way behind Luffy , so to catch up and since he 's going to see Vegapunk , it would n't be weird that his next power up would be an artificial awakening .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I want to point out some things that I find to be really interesting in this chapter : First , the cover story shows us that Cavendish was a prince from a kingdom called Bluejois . I 'm just speculating here but it would n't be weird that his personality switched back then , so Hakuba was born and then he was exiled or maybe he fled by himself . Second , we have a bit of extra information about the giant warrior pirates . It seems like after a time , the captains leave their title to the next generation , thus the oldest captains become some kind of respected elders for the tribe of the giants . ~~That 's really interesting , because this is the first pirate crew that seems to be inherited from one generation to another~~ . Also it seems like there 's always two captains at the same time . If Hajrudin 's dream comes true , he will be the first one to be captain in solitary unless we meet someone else in Elbaf . Another thing that I find interesting in Big Mom 's backstory is that at the beginning of this arc it was stated that she wanted the formula of giantification so all her sons could be at the same height that her when they were eating . It felt like a flat excuse just to have a full on army of giants , but now I think that it either could be part of her dream . I mean , this chapter talks us about the fact that she felt happy that everything around her was of her own size . Edit : I forgot about both the Kuja pirates and the Happo Navy , my bad .

Like /u/BamBamBob said , Buggy fits both categories . Kid does it too , specially if you see how much the opinion about him has been changing since he was introduced .

I feel the same but he 's the main character so obviously he will take the spot always . Someone could argue that at least Law is on par with him and that Urouge should be close in raw force since what we know of him from now . We will see in the future but nonetheless the different members of the worst generation have different advantages and disadvantages over one another . Regardless of his powers , people tend to mock at him because he 's a cocky guy that tried to defeat the Yonko and he could n't . I do n't get why some people says that he 's a weakling for that .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"& gt ; The white horse representing the victory of Christianity was a creation of one mans interpretation in the second century . You could even call it his personal `` head canon '' . True , yet is was the main interpretation given by the roman theologists then and that interpretation survived to our days . Sure , originally the white horse was a representation of the romans since they conquered Palestine but that does n't mean that the other interpretations are wrong since we 're talking about a religion that has splitted a lot in different creeds since it was born . Luther and Calvin diverged from the point of view of the catholic dogma , same happened with orthodox , the coptic church or the ones that followed the arrianism . Religion is always opened to interpretations , and that 's why it has split so much over the centuries . Hell , do n't forget that christianism originally splitted from juddaism . But anyways , if we take into account the fact that the white horseman 's main representation was conquest like you aptly said , Shanks still fits with the concept : 1 - He 's known to have conquered the new world since he was part of Roger 's crew . 2 - He 's been shown to be the strongest user of Conqueror 's Haki till now . & gt ; You 're also wrong about big mom being introduced in the current arc .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"Capone Bege : Although he is an ally of Big Mom , I think it all boils down that the theme of Big Mom are mafias , assassins and the underworld in general , something she has in common with Bege . I think that although he may not be considered an ally ( and indeed is a declared enemy ) , is a character who probably is only allied with Big Mom for interest . Its aim is surely control the underworld and therefore I think the most likely be an enemy in the arc with Big Mom . At the same time , I hope we can see some kind of confrontation between him and Crocodile , since both characters have the same theme of the mafias and it would be interesting to see a fight between two characters that are so cold and calculating like these two . Or even that they became allies . X Drake : Given that he has changed sides between the Marine and pirates and that seems like a pretty honorable character , I think it 's the only one who does not intend to betray the Yonko who he 's working with , I even hope he is one of the two other calamities . He just wants to fuck the world government as much as possible , so it is understandable that joins the most destructive Yonko . I predict that when Kaido is defeated , perhaps he will join the revolutionaries . Jewelry Bonney : I never understood his true motivations but I see quite possible that she will have a recurring role in the arc with Big Mom . Not only because I think it 's his daughter , but because it 's the only woman of the supernovas . In addition , I see many parallels between these two : Both have an insatiable appetite , the same colour of hair , similar lips and a cake-shaped ship . However , I think it will be an ally , especially because we saw her crying when Whitebeard died . Kid : I think it 's the supernova that we should really pay more attention , considering that arises as the main enemy of Luffy of the worst generation . After all , he intended to dethrone the only Yonko that Luffy admires , and even if I 'm honest , I 'd like to see it happening . Would be too absurd that Luffy and his allies defeated a Yonko and the other characters were not able to . I think the alliance with Hawkins and Apoo is now allied with Kaido , or at least Kaido decided to ignore them considering that they intend to deal with Shanks , who ultimately is his enemy . Killer : The Kid 's Zoro is perhaps too mysterious from my point of view . He is intelligent and calm but at the same time , a fierce murderer . I think it has something to do with the Vinsmoke and I would like to see more of him besides him being part of Kid 's crew , maybe in the arc of Big Mom . After all , both Kid and Killer have contacts in the underworld . Basil Hawkins : I do not understand very well the need of allying with Kid and Apoo , especially considering that he conquered Foodvalten . But after all , I think it 's a very interesting character who will show his full streght in a possible arc with Shanks . Scratchmen Apoo : I must say that is the supernova that interested me the less , but I think it will act as a mix between Usopp and Brook in this alliance between the three bands . I guess that will be the enemy of Brook if the two alliances fight each other . Urouge : I think its function is completely neutral and that perhaps was introduced to face some character from heaven . Given that their wings are similar to that of the Birkans and his band is called `` pirates of the fallen monk '' I think it has something to do with the destruction of Birka . Does this mean that we may see Enel again or something that has to do with him ? I hope so . Otherwise , I do not see Urouge will intervene in the events of the new world in a great way . maybe even we are going to learn what is the other way to arrive to the sky islands .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"For me each of the three albums is special in some way but Immersion is Pendulum at its finest . In Silico was a test and as they often say , they suffered something of an identity crisis . Immersion is a mixture of what they learned on In Silico and Hold Your Colour with new sounds and influences . I agree that the album tells a story about love , depression and death . But I do n't think all the songs follow the same line or have to be connected together . Watercolour : For me it was always a song about a person who is suffering from depression and people around him notice it , he need help . Crush : Perhaps the song with a greater number of interpretations . For some it 's about a jealous or possessive man who killed his girlfriend , for others he is a man in love with a woman who ignores him ... Based on the lyrics and the video , I think it 's either the first option or a man who did much damage to a girl , she committed suicide and he tried to justify erroneously that she flirts with other men when in truth she was just kind with everyone . Under The Waves : Someone who ends surpassed by the bad events of his life despite fighting all the time . The Island : for me this song is about two people who just met and they feel some attraction between them . However , this does not go beyond something casual and although one of them start to feel something for the other , everything ends in nothing . Witchcraft : It 's about domestic violence . Self vs Self : The struggle between good and evil in a person after having lost everything . The Fountain : Someone who feels that nothing is enough for him , nothing satisfies him and lives in a state in which he feels extremely lonely despite being loved or with lots of people in his life . In other words , he does not feel himself complete . Encoder : Rob said that this one was about dealing about the loss of a friend , but for me it 's about the last moments of a relationship in which one part begins to realize that the other does not feel the same and although at first tries to fix it , later discovers that instead of suffering it 's better to let go . The title of the album I think that refers to being `` immersed '' in bad feelings ( loneliness , sadness , depression ... ) . When you 're passing from one of those feelings , it 's like you 're drowning . Indeed at the end of Encoder , you can hear some waves and someone walking between them , as if he has managed to stay afloat , it 's like all the bad feelings are gone .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"Well , it depends . In my case , I liked KP from 2011 - 2013 . Then it started to be a generic EDM act that I did n't liked at all . I think that there are artists that can work with different alias well , like Jon Gooch . I like Spor , Feed Me and Seventh Stitch because he puts a lot of effort in every song . KP it 's different , it was planned to be a non serious project , at least this is what they have been saying recently . And I do n't like when a talented producer goes to the easy path , doing generic music like their last EP or some songs of their album . If it turns back to the originality of the Rage Valley EP times , then I will enjoy it again . This is why I believe that this project needs a long break in production terms .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,trance,"The mainstream Djs always follow trends . That 's how they still relevant . Armin was mainstream in Mirage times but that was when only the good electronic music was mainstream . Then Guetta & amp ; SHM arrived and all started to be shit .

Some went full mainstream ( Tiësto , Sander van Doorn , W & amp ; W , Ummet Ozcan , etc ) , others went to the cheesy path ( Dash Berlin , Tritonal ) and others moved to new sounds with trance and EDM elements ( A & amp ; B ) . In Armin 's case is different . He really likes Trance , and at the same time he knows that he ca n't switch bc is what makes him big . I mean , the day that Armin leaves the Trance scene , his career will be literally dead . IMO , Trance is what makes Armin big , not vice versa ( at least since Intense ) . At the same time , he is a really important figure in the Trance scene because he helps a lot of producers of different subgenres , from progressive to uplifting and from trouse to tech trance . Thanks to him a lot of `` non trancers '' starts to look at the genre . As a DJ/Producer , he goes to Big Room and crappy pop house bc he needs to draw the attention of mainstream audiences . In current times , trying to separate yourself from the rest in most cases does not end well . Most of the public are like sheeps , music interests them very little , they go for what they think it 's the new trend . That 's why Armin mixes shit in festivals .

This gave me the idea that there will be English pirates from Wano , something like the wako pirates ( maybe this will be the way to the SH to enter in Wano ) . I believe that we are going to see a mixture of Sengoku Jidai / Tokugawa Bakufu period and the Meiji ishin , with the Kozuki clan taking down the Shogun like the emperor Meiji did ( Meiji Ishin ) with a huge war between clans ( Sengoku Jidai ) . In this context , I see Kaido pirates like the Mongol Empire , being Kaido some sort of Genghis Khan . He looks kinda like the old drawings depicting the Mongols and the Hun tribes as Oriental demons or `` beasts '' . Btw , Jack was introduced with a very similar quote of what people said about Atila in the last days of the Roman empire . The beast pirates are absolutely bloody and destructive , something related to all the nomadic tribes of central Asia . they are attached to Wano country now , and this is really interesting bc in 1281 , the Mongol empire tried to conquer Japan and then there was a huge typhoon called Kamikaze ( divine wind ) that destroyed the mongol fleet .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,trance,"Btw , this is what Eco said about why the album has been delayed for so long : '' I know a lot of people will be disillusioned by how long you have waited for this album and maybe moreso now , realizing there is still 6 months to go ; I fully understand . There are many reasons it has been delayed , many reasons it has taken so long to produce this record , so I feel the need to explain to my biggest fans why . Understand that I am not a full-time musician . I think that may be one of the biggest reasons you love my music ; but it 's also the biggest reason my music has taken so long to get out to you . I made a choice a long time ago ( even before `` M ( you ) sic '' was released ) to be a working man , to not fall into the trap of becoming a full-time trance producer ; to not do it as a `` job '' . It is not some magical coincidence that many of the artists you used to love have made that leap , and then felt the pressures to change their sound into something that could sell ; something that could pay their bills and put food on the table and keep their lights and plumbing on . It is not some magical coincidence that the pressures of the music world turned their music and live performances toward styles that you no longer enjoy , styles that make more money , money they need to survive . I made the decision to avoid that , and that decision is what has fueled me in making music that my fans continue to enjoy , music that has its roots fully embedded into the styles I produced before , styles you enjoyed from the start . That decision also means I go to work Monday-through-Friday , put in 10-11 hours in at an office , and go home . I go home tired like everyone else in the office world . Most people go home , microwave their dinner , watch TV all night or play video games ; but I do my best to find rejuvenation in writing the music , mostly , writing the music that you will hear in this album . I sit there , writing music until 2-3AM , sometimes 4AM . I get 2 hours of sleep , many times do n't even eat dinner , and then I go back into work the next morning ; like you . I do n't mean this as a complaint ; quite the opposite , it makes me unbelievably happy . I find a certain zen in not feeling the endless stress and pressure in NEEDING my music to pay my bills every month . That kind of pressure would have made me go the EDM route lightning-fast , like many many of my peers . Like the first cavemen who produced nature-inspired cave drawings , I go out everyday to hunt for my food , and I come back every night to produce my art in the comfort of my home ; doing it to please no one but myself . I would n't have it any other way . So days turn to weeks turn to months turn to years . Target dates I set out to meet previously go unmet , but my life goes on , and so does yours . It may seem like I 've been creating an endless hype train for the release of these songs , and while that may have happened , it was not my chief intention . As months turned to years , my intention became to put out the best product that I possibly could . If estimates and promises ( about completion dates/ranges ) were broken , that 's because I felt that the art needed more work and more attention ; more sleepless nights , more tired days at work , more weekends saying `` no '' to friends asking to hang out . If you think the wait was annoyingly hard for you , imagine how hard the process has been for me . Hard , but worth it . And then when it 's almost done , the daunting AND LONG task of finding the right label with the right vision and the right resources begins . An agreement is made , and even then the album can not be released right away . Singles , music videos , press , etc. , need to be planned out . These are the realities of the process . Some people will download for free off torrents or whatever , give it a 15 minute listen and say they `` do n't really like '' my 4 years-worth of work . That 's fine , it happens . But I hope all those years of work will inspire even just some of you and be an album you remember for the rest of your lives . When the album comes out in 6 months , I promise you it will all be worth it . ''",Romance,Spanish

From the problems of Iron Man with terrorists in the very beggining of phase 1 to wars in space in phase 2 , it happened in a good pace . It not looked forced . Btw , for Marvel is easier to explore more superheroes in films bc they are more versatile . I do n't know how to explain it , but a lot of DC characters are really boring . I was absolutely disappointed when I saw that j'onn j'onzz was not going to be part on the Justice League film . Other problem they have is how they compressed all the DC universe in a very few number of films . This is something that they are going to regret in the future . But on the other hand , there are things on the DC films that I want in the Marvel Universe . First of all , a more darker essence . I like light films like Ant Man for example , but the continuous dose of humor I think is increasingly absurd . I mean , a film like CA2 or just a little bit darker could be great , specially for the more important characters . Other thing I like from DC is how they really do a great work with the villains .

When I saw the film I do really liked it though my expectations were very low with the trailer .

2stepsfromglory,marvelstudios,"& gt ; the movies that marvel really wanted them to be successful like GOTG . with a laterally middle finger giving to audience the movie was accepted by the studio and James Gunn humor was well handled and treated that it melded beautifully in the movie That was because no one knew GOTG and they needed to introduce them . IMO the film had some good scenes but the amount of cliches , jokes and the anticlimactic ending made this film the one I less like tho I am a great fan of the GOTG comics . And well , all depends of the film . I do think that every film needs to have a different pace , otherwise it could have been absolutely boring . I mean , for Ant Man you can see how the whole movie is based in the premise of thieves with a great number of jokes and it absolutely works . Why ? Because it 's Ant Man . A superhero that can change his size . For a solo film about him , it really worked . For TWS they wanted to reveal the darker side of the MCU but without being excessively dark , it was on point . Most of the films of phase 2 were just preparations for the Phase 3 or development of some characters . That 's why Iron Man 3 , Thor 2 , GOTG ( just in my opinion ) or even some parts of AOU seemed so unbalanced or with too much fillers . Because technically , phase 2 is the filler of the MCU .

In truth , Trance has evolved with Armin and all his Big Room Trance crew for one side , and Above & amp ; Beyond / Andrew Bayer and all the Anjunabeats team for the other one , but I think that in both cases is more like an involution . It 's more EDM that Trance and has become in both sides pretty boring in a very few time . On the other hand you have the people that claims that the trance sound needs to stay pure .

I 'm a great lover of the true Progressive House , but Prydz is not a reference anymore and I ' more interested in producers like Andre Sobota , Gai Barone , Fehrplay , Grum , Jeremy Olander , Philthy Chit or Tinlicker .

I agree with you about KP , for me their peak was Rage Valley and their glory period was between the first and the third EP , but you need to understand that KP does n't exist to be such a thing , it 's an EDM act that they have called alot of times that they do n't take too seriously .",Romance,Spanish

Kurohige maybe will fight with him before , bc he said in Marineford `` I 'm not ready to fight him ... at the moment '' . But this gives my theory of Kid dethroning Shanks less value , after all Kurohige was planned to be that kind of character that we all need to hate , and if he kills Shanks there will be more hate for him after all . So I do n't really know what will happen to Shanks , but I 'm sure that he will be the last of the Pre-Marineford Yonkos that we will see fighting .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"You get confused about several things . For starters , there is no racism against moroccans , that 's a medieval topic because in the Middle Ages the arabs conquered 3/4 of the Iberian peninsula after the christian reconquest is evident that muslims became second-class citizens like christians were second-class citizens when they were under the control of the arabs . The arabs brought a lot of innovations to the Spanish culture , especially in the field of medicine , philosophy , art , architecture and agriculture . There is no real racism , although there are racist people everywhere . Dressrosa has nothing to do with this , but it is based on the dictatorship of Franco . Doflamingo and their officials are like Franco and the bando nacional , while the king Riku represents the second republic . the toys represents the defeated republicans . Dressrosa is based in a mixture of the typical Andalusian folklore ( a lot of people thinks it 's the typical spanish culture , like flamenco and the colosseum that in truth it feels like a bullring ) with some buildings that are more like the ones from Barcelona ( and all the Gaudi style ) .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,seduction,"For me eye contact is one of the most important things , bc is how we express how we are and what are our intentions without words . Eye contact it 's something personal that we do n't do the same way to a friend or someone which we are interested of . I usually look at her eyes all the time while she 's talking . That gives you the impression that you 're interested in her but at the same time that you 're listening to what she 's saying . This avoids the feeling of the `` guy that just wants sex '' ( believe me , a girl can feel this just as the way you look at her ) . You need to look at her eyes like they are an artwork , but without looking like a wasted dude . If she can do the same or she avoids it but smiles , then it 's a good sign . It means that she 's interested too , but maybe she 's shy . Never look at loads of directions . That gives you an impression of insecurity that it 's not going to help you .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"For me it 's not about what it 's more hard to do or not . It 's more like what sounds more emotional or original in other way . What I was trying to say is that loads of structures from the Anjunabeats releases are pretty similar and that make them boring , because it stands in a point that they want to do a banger with a good melody and it sounds kinda forced . I 'm not talking about Grum for example , he 's a Progressive House producer so I do n't count him . I 'm talking about S8 & amp ; T , Genix , Fatum , some Sunny Lax songs , Bayer when he does clubby songs ... I do n't really see any feeling in loads of recent tracks of them . For Bluestone , I do have Sinai and Big Ben . The rest he has done has exactly the same drop ( yeah , it 's kind of his signature sound but come on you ca n't change the drop between different songs ? just look at All These Wounds and you will see ) so I 'm not a fan of him anymore . Less with him tweeting `` Trance '' all the time and doing such a pretty predictable songs . I 've been following this label for a lot of time and it has lost quality . It 's not that I hate electro sounds mixed with trance melodies ( I 'm a great fan of some old Heatbeat songs ) , it 's that for me Anjunabeats had stuck in the same thing for 3 years and has sold themselves to be part of the EDM ship , like Armin has done ( maybe not that hard but they have done it anyways ) , and it hurt that every release was pretty similar . I do n't count Anjunadeep because it 's a completely different thing , made for the Progressive / Deep House releases . From Boom Jinx and Super8 & amp ; Tab , I 've listened their last albums and they were bland for me . My though is that A & amp ; B are actually like Eric Prydz . They have more popularity than never but their music is not as good in quality as it was in the past , the thing is ... I 'm not the only one who feels like this . And after all , you ca n't deny that some of the tracks they have made for WAAWN are radio friendly . I do n't really see Satellite or Miracle being radio friendly songs . Yeah , they have a Radio Mix but both are pure OceanLab . Good vocal songs with a pure trance sound , the other ones are absolutely radio friendly . Maybe for promotion at the rest of the album but they are . For Atkinson ... my thoughts are that we do n't really know what he can do .

They have been releasing the same kind of tracks over and over again or even switching to Big Room ( yes , this is big room with a good break , but still being big room https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Xfxkrhsg1kg ) The 90 % of the releases taged as Trance in Anjuna sound pretty similar : You have a kind o Electro intro , then comes a drop , then comes a piano break , then the same electro drop again ( This being a perfect example https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=YLmu-IhmHgM ) . So what 's the difference between this an the Uplifting being the same ( intro - long piano break - explosion - outro , all with the same basslines ) ? . For you Atkinson is repetitive ? I could agree in alot of trance producers doing the same over and over again , specially in the Uplifting subgenre ( which I 'm really tired of ) . But Atkinson is one of the few that is still being original and interesting even doing Uplifting / Tech Trance / Prog Psy lol By the way , I did n't said that A & amp ; B did not produce their own tracks . They have been doing music since 16 years ago , not even talking about their solo projects which are from the late 90 's . What I say is that since GT they NEED Andrew Bayer to work with them , and that being said , all what A & amp ; B does is follow what Bayer does in his solo work . Bayer did in 2013 some songs like England , Perth , Mirth Mobile etc and then A & amp ; B did Hello / Mariana Trench , which sounds pretty similar . These Electro / Progressive estructures mixed with Progressive Trance breaks are Bayer 's imprint sound in his solo releases since then , A & amp ; B just are following his style . Why ? Because Bayer does a great part of the work . I 'm with you that Bayer can be fucking epic when he wants ( his albums speak for him ) , but alot of his `` club work '' seems pretty banger-ish and repetitive . And yeah , I called them boring because they are . Armin is boring too when he does shitty Trouse and he has connected with a lot of people over the years , I ca n't really figure how much people did started listening to trance or just electronic music thanks to Armin . Or fuck , what about Tiësto ? Of course they have gone Mainstream . Not even in the way Tiësto or W & amp ; W did , but they definitely have gone to a more radio-friendly sound . In truth you said that I 'm not hearing them getting played on the radio but this is not truth at all , bc Blue Sky Action has been played LOADS of times in the radio and i 'm not talking about the States . I 'm from Spain , a country that does not pay ANY attention to electronic music if it 's not Martin Garrix or Hardwell . And I did hear it just after Sun Is Shining on the radio . Loads of times . That being said , I respect different tastes . What pisses me is that some people ca n't see that some of their favourite artists are humans and ca n't be on the top forever . I accepted it long ago with loads of artists I loved which began to be less and less creatives .",Romance,Spanish

I do n't think they need to come back to Trance bc they ca n't do nothing more that what they have done yet . And how you can say that they are trying new things when they just follow what Bayer 's does ? The 90 % of the Anjunabeats catalog the last three years has been boring af , the same prog trance melodies w/ trousy drops . Same with their releases . WAAWN it 's a follow up of GT and it 's not near to their quality , they tried to do the same thing with a more poppy sound in some tracks and it was very bland .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"ASOT has being good for years and years and I 've been listening to it for a long time , but as much people knows it has changed to just a radio show that brings the usual Armada catalog . It 's not about finding new talents , is about the same artists over and over again . Years ago the first hour was interesting progressive stuff and the second one hard straight Trance , now tho it has the same formula has changed way more with the first hours usually being a mixture of Prog house / Trouse . I need to be clear that I do n't listen to ASOT anymore but just because I was kinda tired that just 5 or 6 songs of the whole 2 hours were really interesting ( not just good ) , and the last episode I really LOVED was 666 . ABGT for me was good in the beginning but I do n't really like it . Not because I think it 's bad , just because it 's the same way ASOT does with Armada but with the Anjunabeats / Anjunadeep artists , and that being said , I 'm not that much in Anjunabeats anymore because they are repetitive af in terms of releases . Specially in what they catalog as `` Progressive Trance '' that is just a trancy break with trousy drops and structures . The whole ABGT has a more familiar vibe with the audience , the tracklist lies to a mixture of progressive , deep , some EDM stuff and usually a couple of more trancy records but the other way it 's not that good as people says . So , my opinion is that if you want Trance go for ASOT tho is kinda redundant with the same artists and Armada releases . If you want more diversity in sounds go for ABGT tho it 's about Anjuna producers the 90 % of the time . If you really want Trance podcasts go for FSOE ( all about Uplifting ) or Outburst ( Tech Trance mainly ) or just search things like the Damaged Radio Show of Jordan Suckley . [ EDIT : Just my thinking about the permanent comparison between AvB and A & amp ; B ] I do n't know why everyone always try to compare Armin mixes / releases / labels with the A & amp ; B ones . Both are in the doldrums , so I always look at these comparisons like if the anjuna fans are trying to bash Armin because he sellout when A & amp ; B have done it too at the same way lol Both did a radio-friendly album the past year ( Armin one 's was practically made as an SHM album while WAWN has songs that sound like Cash Berlin ) , both have good labels that have become boring shit ( Armind for Armin and Anjunabeats for A & amp ; B ) , both have gone to the Mainstream EDM ship and both of them need someone for make their tracks ( Armin needs Benno as much as A & amp ; B ca n't do a track without Andrew Bayer )",Romance,Spanish

The problem here is that Kaido wants to fight the Marine , not other Yonkos ( or at least this is what he wants for what we know just seeing how mad he was after Mingo 's defeat ) .

2stepsfromglory,feedme,"What I meant at first is that this EP is still more relaxed , and it has a more `` familiar '' tone so to speak , and this is why this was meant to be an album and it ended being an EP . It is something that is clear in songs like What It Feels Like or Life Raft especially . You are right that this one has bangers like Trouble and Schizoid , but apart from that , the EP is generally only a journey through different genres and sounds , Also , it has reminiscences to other EPs so it 's like a fusion of the Post and Pre-Calamary Tuesday Feed Me : High Speed Weekend Survivor ( it follows the style of Feed Me 's Psychedelic Journey ) , Stay Focused ( which is something like a follow up of a Giant Warrior Descends on Tokyo ) and Red Clouds ( after all it 's a different version of Cloudburn ) . I sincerely believe that his previous EPs had many more bangers , but compared to this EP , they have grown in us more and they have his classic sound ( Look at Escape From Electric Mountain . Unless Embers all are bangers . Or AGWDOT , all the songs are bangers directly and is still my fave Feed Me release to date ) .

2stepsfromglory,feedme,"No worries , we all have different approaches about music . For me Jon is one of the few producers that are leading art in everything they do . What I do like about him is how he has created a whole world around his characters ( Feed Me , Spor and SS are way more than alias to him ) that revolves around his tastes in painting , literature and cinema among other things . It 's something I have not seen in any other producer so far ( least for maybe Franck Rivoire aka Danger ) , in fact is something much more common in writers and painters than in musicians . Also , there 's a rework of Spilt Milk ? I 've heard the old demo version and I 'm sure that he used some parts of it in one of the IDs he dropped not long ago in a mix ( the mau5trap one I think ) but I ca n't remember a different version of the track rn . Of the VIP versions he has of his own tracks , I like the one for Trapdoor ( even when sounds more like an unfinished Spor remix ) , the vocoder edit of Ophelia and specially the VIP version of Fiasco .

Kaido cleans the soil with some of them , Moriah comes up , boosts G4 's Luffy with shadows , Luffy defeats Kaido in a much more balanced fight even with the help of other characters . This shows us that Luffy is definitely a threat to the emperors even when he is not at their level yet , because how Mihawk said , his truly power is to make allies anywhere .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,Pendulum,"Wait . Maybe I 'm reading too much into this but think about it : The last song they played in Miami was Begin Again and now they want to go back to their beginnings with this DJ Set . So technically , they are `` beginning again '' . Does this have some kind of weird meaning or something ? It 's obvious that we are not going to have new Pend material this year , but maybe this would be the spark that runs all for the next year . Miami was more like `` hey we are still alive '' , and this as a exclusive DJ Set seems like it 's a way to keep the hype alive , specially since seems pretty much like it will be Paul , Rob and Gaz . I believe that this will be a set full of old dnb tunes from all the artists that have been an influence for them ( Noisia , Desimal etc ) + old pend material , maybe even some demos or unreleased songs like Ca n't Feel .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"The point with the celestial dragons is that they are a closed group of fat and ugly nobles that believe that they have the right and obligation to be above others . They believe that the rest of people is there just to serve them , so they treat everyone like objects without any remorse about it . CDs are the representation of the vanity , the abuse of power and the egoism of the nobles . There 's anything good about them and they ca n't even redeem themselves for what we 've seen . Also why Oda would want to create a good celestial dragon when we already have what you said but with normal nobles ? I mean we 've got a lot of good nobles like Sabo , Sanji , Reiju , Vivi , Neptune , Viola , Rebecca ...

However , I think that Homing and Corazon were the closest thing to the exception that proves the rule . Why ? because the CDs are pretty much like a circle jerk of arrogant nobles . They are living with the idea that they are descendants of gods and therefore everything they do is right . Is like if the world owes them a favor . They do n't even need to change their way of acting or change the world because it favors them . That 's why I do n't believe that any other CD could diverge that much from what we have seen of them .",Romance,Spanish

Also , even if her devil fruit works only on people with fear she can just steal Nami 's soul and blackmail Luffy with it , pretty much doing the same that the Vinsmokes are doing with Zeff .

Btw , Kaido is on Wano ( Japan in the OP world ) so obviously , the Oni fits perfectly . If he does not have this fruit , I believe that then he has some kind of fruit based on a dragon . For Big Mom , there is a legend in Japan about something similar to a witch called Yama-uba that fits a bit to the appearance of Big Mom .

2stepsfromglory,trance,"Yeah they announced it the past year but do n't forget that they did the acoustic album too , so I suppose that if they release new OceanLab material it will be next year . The thing here is , we really want or even need more OceanLab material ? Even if it was an A & amp ; B Mix , Another Chance was truly a poor track . The OceanLab essence has been dragged by the new ABGT era , so I doubt that new OceanLab material would be something interesting now . Also , since A & amp ; B moved to slower bpms , 2016-A & amp ; B and 2016-OL would sound pretty much the same , or at least that 's what I believe . What I feel is that It will be more marketing that anything , because there 's a lot of new ABGT fans who do n't know anything about pre-2011 A & amp ; B , so if they do new OL material it will be just to please the old fans that have been moaning about more OceanLab material , just like what Armin did with Rising Star . Not that I 'm complaining if they want to do that , but then it would be better to have a Tranquility Base EP with some proper Trance than more vocal songs that hardly will be at the same level of Sirens Of The Sea .",Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,trance,"The A & amp ; B Mix is mediocre at best while the original mix compared to other OL tunes sounds kinda meh . I know that OL is all about truly soft melodies but in this case it does not bring anything , it feels pretty simple , at least for me . Little Something is a good song , but is a clear example of what I said in the second paragraph : I doubt that if OceanLab comes back will be different that the current A & amp ; B vocal tracks . It will be something along the lines of Counting Down the Days meets the Acoustic album . That 's why I think that a return of OceanLab would be disappointing . It will be for the sake of doing so , if they do a full album with songs like Beautiful Together I would be happy but that 's not going to happen . With this I 'm not saying that I just like 140 stuff but after 7 fucking years without producing trance of high bpms , it will be better if they release some Tranquility Base songs , I mean 2 or 3 just to diversify after those years without doing so . Even Super8 & amp ; Tab released not long ago a 138 tune on ASOT , why A & amp ; B ca n't do it ?",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,trance,"& gt ; So you 're saying it does n't sound like an Oceanlab song , but instead an A & amp ; B song ? I 'm saying that if they do a new OL album a lot of songs will be pretty much like that track , which is a good song without doubt but then why do you need to release it under OceanLab ? & gt ; I think the problem is many people like you think of Oceanlab as Beautiful Together and Satellite , the faster BPM songs with that energy . I think that 's fair to an extent , but it 's not the entirety of their sound . OceanLab was all about downtempo stuff , there 's like 2 Uplifting Trance songs in their entery discography . So no , for me those two songs are amazing exceptions , but not what it would come to my mind if someone ask me about what OceanLab is . Tbf , my fave one from them is Secret . Is obvious that A & amp ; B have more elements of the OceanLab sound now than ever . After 7 years doing a lot of vocal work with slow bpms with their A & amp ; B moniker and also 2 acoustic albums , OL is not going to have the same impact or the quality that it had back then . The same happened with Group Therapy and We Are All We Need , even when there 's some good songs in WAAWN , it 's the same formula and it felt kinda bland . The quality was there , but the first we got was better because it was something new and fresh and it had more iconic songs .

Seriously they fucking killed and destroyed loads of neighbour tribes , they did blood sacrifices and rape and slavery were common in their cultures .

Also , I believe that 'Wildlife On One ' from Art Of Trance is underrated , a lot of people just pay attention to Octopus bc it 's a classic but the whole album from Kaleidoscope to Cambodia is a masterpiece .

I think that he is the strongest tho he is the laziest of the 4 . His brute force at the same time must be overwhelming given that was able to stop a punch of Sakazuki and a blow of Whitebeard despite having only one arm . 2 - Kaido : Currently I think it is quite on par with Shanks in power , but I think Kaido is called the strongest because has the advantage that it is much more resistant ( or at least it is said to be immortal for something ) , and destructive . At the same time I think that he has a mythological Zoan and quite possibly he will have the strongest fruit of this type . His strength seems based on his brute force . In this , I believe that he is stronger than Shanks . 3 - Big Mom : We do n't really know his abilities yet , but maybe she will be related to witchcraft or some kind of weird paramecia ( black magic , acid or some ability to turn people into sweet ) . His power tho seems more based on his great influence in the underground and she seems really relentless and tactical . Not a first line fighter like Whitebeard or Kaido but someone who can fight in the distance and win easily , sort of what Doflamingo did . 4 - Teach : Yes , he has the strongest paramecia and the most op logia BUT he is like Enel or Crocodile . A guy that is overconfident on his devil fruits . I think that if his power was in the hands of other character or if he was more serious , it could be the strongest of the 4 . By the end of this new saga I believe that he will be on par with Shanks or even stronger , but now he is the weakest . 5 - Whitebeard : Yeah , he was on par with Roger back in the days but in Marineford is obvious that he was shit compared to the rest of the group .

Btw , the speech about gods of Wisplash is brilliant . It 's not a great movie compared to the first one , but at least imo is better than IM3 . The Dark World had good moments , specially expanding the world of Thor , but otherwise it 's one of the weakest films of the MCU . Forcing the appearance of Jane Foster which was not necessary at all , in the first film was a need for the development of Thor , but in this one it could have been better to give more protagonism to the Thor - Sif relationship . On the other hand , if it is true that Wisplash was wasted in IM2 , in TDW I never felt that Malekith was part of the plot and even Kurse had more importance than him . I mean , he deserved much more space on the tape that they took to add the stupid plot with Jane and the ether inside her . To make the things worse , even when Loki does not have a huge importance in the film apart of helping Thor arrive to svartalfheim , he steals all the attention from both Thor and Malekith .

In fact just used a little logic in the fact that these `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' from the Sora story are not the same ones that we have seen .

IMO he will have at least 2-3 supernovas to help him ( Law , Kid , X Drake etc ) and even maybe Moria can help a bit .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,So ... Big Mom is Nona ?,Romance,Spanish
2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't have a solid proof , but let 's join the clues that we have about Kaido 's power . 1 - Mingo was afraid just thinking about what could happen to him if he could not supply more artificial fruits to Kaido . He was n't afraid of Whitebeard , who was the strongest pirate before the timeskip . At the same time he was n't afraid of Kuzan , who was on par with Akainu . 2 - Jack was going to save Mingo from an admiral , the past fleet admiral and some VA . Even if he was defeated three times since we meet him , he 's still alive and he has been fighting uninterruptedly since then . That means that , at least , Jack is as stronger as Mingo . Maybe even stronger . And he is just one of the three right hands of Kaido , so there are other two guys with practically the same strength that Jack . 3 - Jack was rapidly defeated by Zunisha . But then , Kaido is called the strongest creature alive . So that means that he is stronger than Zunisha and the rest of creatures of the OP world , at least in a 1 vs 1 . 4 - Kaido said something like `` these supernovas who defeated some shichibukais think that they are the great thing '' , and do n't forget what he said to Kid . So , for Kaido the Shichibukais are like what VA 's are in our eyes . We must not forget that despite Whitebeard was the strongest pirate in the world before the timeskip , that does not mean that his destructive power was comparable to what he was years ago . Although we know practically nothing about Kaido , his apparent immortality and the fact that before the Marineford war he was going to face Whitebeard and had to be stopped somehow by Shanks make it clear that he had enough confidence in himself to face the world 's strongest pirate.What is clear is that among the Yonko there is not a big difference in power . They are the 4 strongest pirates in the world and that means that although Kaido is right now the strongest , the other 3 emperors are fairly close to his power . This is why I do n't believe that Kaido will be defeated just by Luffy . Kaido will be the one to show the supernovas the gap of power between the yonkos and the rest of pirates ( Kid has it clear now , after all ) . After Kaido , Luffy will have to defeat the other yonkos , so it will be more realistic if the first one was defeated by an alliance of supernovas and after what he learned with his clash with Kaido he will defeat the other ones alone .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Sad in a way , there will never be another operating system , the barrier to entry is just to high . That 's thankfully wrong . We 're not at a terminal stage . This barrier you 're speaking of does only apply to systems that offer the same ( i.e . : Bring nothing to the table ) . However , there 's much going on in OS fundamentals , including designs that give the ability to provide features which Linux simply will never be able to without a fundamental redesign and rewrite . A clear example of this is `Minix3` with its [ fault tolerance and self-repair ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_3 # Reliability_in_MINIX_3 ) features , most of which are tied to a design that uses the pure µkernel multiserver approach , which is opposite of what Linux does have . Similarly , [ Dragonfly ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonFly_BSD ) is a fork of FreeBSD done by the best lead it had ( Matt Dillon ) after he was removed due to a revert war over dealing with SMP . Matt wanted to sit down and discuss design , while other developers just wanted to push their random , misguided code . The result is that while FreeBSD implemented a lock labyrinth closely modeled after Linux ( thus providing nothing new in that front when compared to Linux ) , Dragonfly became a hybrid kernel design , implementing `LWKT` and splitting the kernel into `system servers` , benefiting from the message passing abstraction in place of locks , and [ doing quite well scalability-wise ] ( https : //www.dragonflybsd.org/performance ) , while FreeBSD , unsurprisingly , does pretty poorly in the same test . Besides fault tolerance and different approaches to multi-processor scalability , there are some fronts in which Linux is n't doing very well . One of them is `hard realtime` . The sheer complexity of the Linux monolith kernel makes it really hard to guarantee times , like , how long it will take for execution to return to userspace after switching to supervisor mode and entering the `lock labyrinth` , or whether this will ever happen . There 's the out of tree linux-rt patches , but there 's only so much they can do with this design ; particularly there 's reliability issues to the approach taken ( which involves doing very funky things with locks ) , and it does also kill throughput ; no one-size-fits-all is possible with the monolithic design .",Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,"It runs a lot of Free Software . It can be used day-to-day like Linux . The design ( with the ports ( ipc ) , the kits and the datatypes ) is also very refreshing . And it 's quite responsive and lightweight .",Romance,Spanish

So if you would , please give your reasoning . Thank you After what happened with `Reiser4` , the only ( general purpose ) FSs that I know of which are actually delving into new territory are `HAMMER2` and `Tux3` . `Tux3` is about high performance , low-latency ( ever suffered from stalls ? ) and guarantee of write order . All of that without using a journal , and while still behaving well in case of power outage . `Hammer2` is about ZFS functionality with better performance than ZFS and without the RAM overhead . `XFS` is an old design , `EXT4` is an even older design on steroids . `Btrfs` ... Oracle , emphasis on feature-checklist against ZFS and little thought put into design and corner cases . Furthermore every use story I hear from my acquaintances does end on a bad note a few days or weeks after . My own ended with me going back to XFS after about a week , due to extreme performance degradation over time . Last friend had dataloss instead ( without hw failure ) .

Probably not much change ... the Dragonfly release in the graph , 3.2 , is from late 2012 . We 're only in 2015 and OSs do not move at that fast a pace . I do know that `Matt` did shift focus to `HAMMER2` after that , which is interesting on its own right . However , in other fronts , namely drivers and userspace , it has made leaps . & gt ; Some months back I noticed that Linux constantly shuffles threads around among cores , even when there is only 1 heavy thread , and forcing that thread to stay on a single core , had a noticeable impact on performance , not so much in a percentage way , but in the way of removing some regular stutter of some milliseconds occurring , that were clearly noticeable in execution . Yes , this is known as the `bouncing cow` problem . I remember reading on `LWN` about some improvements made to the scheduler recently ( months ago , not sure if merged ) to try and improve the situation . & gt ; It is interesting that Matt Dillon is taking a different approach than Linux on this , and it is remarkable that what I suspect is a tiny team , can keep up with the huge powers working on exactly this kind of thing on Linux . Matt is a very capable and experienced developer ; during his time at the helm at FreeBSD he turned what was a shitty system into a serious contender in performance . It was even better than Linux for a while . Then the whole SMP deal happened , Dragonfly was born after he was revoked access to FreeBSD 's repository , and Matt managed to do it again with Dragonfly , while having such a fundamentally different approach . It 's remarkable , indeed . And other than that , he wrote the C compiler everybody was using in the Amiga era , `DiceC` . And also contributed to Linux at times .",Romance,Spanish

Hardware support in BSDs ( specially NetBSD ) is much better than you seem to think it is . For a real world example , a few weeks ago , OpenBSD 5.7 was released . I installed it , ran startx and within ten minutes I had a nice desktop environment , chromium , firefox and mpv as music player . Sound and 3d acceleration worked right out of the box , without requiring any setup from me . Another example is my recent experience with an Allwinner A20 based board . NetBSD does have basic video support ( framebuffer ) , and a driver for the DMA engine , which is necessary for decent I/O with a lot of the SoC 's functionality . Linux has neither of these yet . A good portion of the drivers Linux has have actually been ported from the BSDs . As for software to run , most of what runs on Linux does run in the BSDs and the other way around . Just [ pkgsrc ] ( http : //pkgsrc.se/statistics.php ) already has over 10k packages . For perspective , Debian has some 15k source packages .

But I remember that it was n't enough to just adjust the bitplane pointers with the copperlist . But I do n't think I have the diskette anymore , although I kept it for many years , I never got the chance to get it onto a more standard format . IIRC copper had 3 instr , they were to wait ( for desired position ) , mov ( chip ram only ) and to end . The mov could be used to raise an interrupt on the CPU , however . & gt ; Today with UEFI BIOS and SSD disks , boot times are becoming almost tolerable . Still slower than my A1200 boot-to-wb time . The PC would still be detecting hard disks and not yet loaded the bootloader by the time Amiga finished . & gt ; systemd has also been a huge step forward for Linux IMO . Agreed , best thing to happen in a very long time . & gt ; The thing I hate about Linux , is the Unix legacy with obscure names for everything , and nowhere to look for what might be the command to do what you want . If you need to pipe something to grep , then how the hell do you figure out it 's called grep , the Amiga had a command directory , and that 's where basic shell commands resided . and the names made somewhat sense on what the commands were for . There 's still $ PATH , which behaves like the C : assign . Sure , there 's a load of crap in there ... but then there 's `info coreutils` . Documentation wise , the BSDs are just superior though ( The manpages and the handbook each BSD has , plus actual kernel docs ) . & gt ; Another thing I miss is that on the Amiga you could access storage directly through sensible names . On Linux you need to know the location of the mount point , which varies among distros and if it 's automounted , it can even vary between what kind of drive was automounted . IMO Linux/Unix really need a standard for accessing devices directly , and not just through a link in a directory which is the minimum if you follow any accepted standard . LFS should cover that ( mountpoints for external media ) . But FS labels just are n't taken as seriously in the PC territory , so even if they 're exposed as mountpoints , they are useless . Also , there 's the Amiga `assign` command , which has no real equivalent in UNIX . And of course , there 's no standard way to try and access a disk that is n't there ( `type WHATEVER : test` ) , and get the user to provide it . ( Please insert volume WHATEVER : in any drive ... ) & gt ; I do n't generally have problems with latency & gt ; when I had it was mostly because of fglrx proprietary drivers . I remained with AMD for a long time , hoping the open source drivers would become good enough , I still think it 's great that AMD has open specs and improve on the open source drivers , and I hope they can make a comeback financially , to give both Intel and Nvidia more competition . Me too ... but my policy is to use the free drivers , and if that does n't suffice , just boot Windows to play the game . & gt ; I want my system to perform well on graphics , I 'm still a bit of a gamer , and games must be smooth , if it is n't , either the hardware or the game is insufficient . Last I heard , the alterEnglishs to Linux you mention , do n't have good 3D graphics support , which Nvidia fortunately provide for Linux , but unfortunately only with proprietary driver .

He 'd pay a real high performance penalty just fine if he got a reliable system in exchange . & gt ; If it was n't they 'd be shouting it from the rooftops and we would all be using micro-kernels today because there would be no drawback to doing so To even get into benchmarks , they 'd need to have a real , working system first . Guess what ? There 's no such thing . And sadly , MACH ( and its horrid performance ) is still what comes to mind for most people when microkernels are brought up to the table . Non-dead , non-ancient , free , there 's just Escape , Genode , HelenOS and Minix3 . They 're at different stages of development , but none of them is ready for benchmarks . If you 're interested , I would say Minix3 is the closest , as they 've chosen to leverage a lot of netbsd headers and userspace , and they use pkgsrc . Still , the current release ( which finally has dynamic shared libraries ) only builds and runs a small portion of pkgsrc . HEAD finally has a version of Xorg working . Assuming Minix3 gets there soon in terms of running software , it will still take some time for the development focus to shift from getting things to work ( software and hardware wise ) to performance . And only after years of work in performance will having benchmarks be meaningful . So all these devs can do performance-wise is just high-level architecture decisions , and write articles like the one I linked above to try and remind people that , while really bad , MACH is thoroughly obsolete , and computers ( particularly ever since they come in multicore packages ) have shifted to SMP , where the multiserver design does hold unexplored potential .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,linux,Thanks for the overview !,Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Sorry but this makes no sense , anything done in this space could easily be replicated by say the Linux devs in a monolithic setting . It could be done in a hybrid kernel setting , it absolutely can not be done in a monolithic setting . The reason is simple : Without boundaries ( as imposed by modular structure , which could be enforced or not at runtime via running the modules in userspace ( pure microkernel architecture ) or not doing so ( hybrid kernel ) ) , everything can call everything , anytime . Therefore , locks are unavoidable if they 're to support SMP or kernel preemption , the latter being a terrible hack to prevent userspace from suffering the latencies of the very long and unpredictable paths the kernel can get into , and an example of how terrible monolithic kernels tend to eventually get . & gt ; Just because the kernel is monolithic does not mean it 's subsystems ( components ) are n't logically separated . In other words they could mimic any ' SMP / avoiding locks / messaging ' ideas in their monolithic kernel and perform better than the micro-kernel design due to avoiding overhead by running all it 's components in a single process . As I 've explained above , this would make your kernel a hybrid kernel . Of course , there 's also the school of thought that hybrid kernels are marketing bullshit and do not exist , but I do not subscribe to it ; even if the hardware does n't enforce the boundaries in runtime , they are still enforced at compile time and are very clear from a design perspective , allowing for design decisions that depend on the modular design and are otherwise not possible . Perhaps someday we 'll actually have a decent such system to do benchmarks with ; if system servers run fine in userspace and the microkernel allows for them to run in kernelspace as well , then we can do both in an otherwise identical system and compare . & gt ; in fact what would give it the 'hybrid ' moniker to begin with ? https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonFly_BSD # Kernel Looks very hybrid to me , and benefiting from a lot of non-locking multithreaded system servers already . They 're even advancing towards moving many of these parts to userspace , and getting rid of systemcalls and wrapping them into messages instead , which could eventually lead to pure microkernel multiserver architecture . & gt ; Also a large part of the performance increase ( in this test which the author admits does not mirror realistic work loads ) seems to come from a technique called 'swapcache ' which is also in no way bound to micro-kernel design . That 's described in a separate section of the performance page dedicated to it . That 's grasping at straws if anything . & gt ; But those real world performance costs are n't going away , and unless the stable monolithic offerings It can be argued that pure microkernel ( with system servers running in userspace and therefore supervisor/user context switching ) will never be as fast as hybrid kernels ( same design , but allowing for servers to run in kernelspace ) . Then it 's a compromise between reliability and performance , as many [ reliability features ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_3 # Reliability_in_MINIX_3 ) do depend directly on the pure architecture . The exact practical numbers of the penalty the pure design implies are still unknown , they could turn out to be very acceptable . We wo n't know until we have a reasonable pure microkernel multiserver system , only then tests as the one described above will be possible . But what 's already established is that the user/supervisor context switch overhead argument is not valid against monolithic kernels , as monolithic kernels are n't hybrid kernels , and thus many potentially awesome optimization strategies are unavailable to them .",Romance,Spanish

That 's not comparable to `Genode` , `HelenOS` and `Minix3` , which have 10-30 active devs , many of which paid , and are actually advancing their systems to some direction . Even systems like `9front` , `ReactOS` , `AROS` or `Haiku` have way more activity than the HURD .

But the important part is it 's about pure microkernel vs hybrid kernel , not monolithic . & gt ; What is this magical message passing , you can send messages ( data ) between processes through plain old POSIX if you so wish . Sure , but you ca n't pass messages between kernel components if the kernel does n't have components , and that 's what separates hybrid from monolithic kernel , which instead resorts to direct calls . & gt ; And I do agree with those who say 'hybrid ' is a nonsense label That 's been implicit from all your conversation so far , but thanks for coming out clearly about it . & gt ; the closest thing to a 'hybrid ' I 've come across would be the original BeOS , because it actually moved a performance critical component out in user space ( networking ) , but then moved it back into kernel space due to the poor networking performance it resulted in . [ A hybrid is about having clearly bounded components ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel ) , there 's no requirement for any of these to be in userspace , but they can be .

I even recall some Intel Linux gpu driver developer that had serious doubts about Gallium3d left Intel , then implemented an ARM SoC GPU driver ( was it for the rpi ? or something else , I do n't remember ) using it as an experiment , and changed his opinion , now favoring Gallium3d . & gt ; They were common .

From what I 've gleaned from previous BSDNow podcasts , FreeBSD people generally conceded that Dillon had the right idea , and fixed SMP accordingly . Dillon 's approach is to go `multiserver` ( like XNU , Minix , BeOS , AmigaOS and so on ) . FreeBSD 's approach is to go `lock labyrinth` ( like Linux ) . My main concern with Linux is that once the CPU enters the kernel , there 's no telling when it 'll finish , or if it even will even return to userspace at all ; kernel stalls are n't uncommon . BSDs seem to do better somehow , as kernel 's generally structured and order is enforced ; they would n't take layering violations like the one with `ext4 and dm-raid` interactions somehow causing a data loss ( what a pile of hacks ... ) . They also somehow manage to feel more responsive than Linux when using them on a workstation . But they still have the same issue . A multiserver approach forces modularity , which in turn makes the relationships between components become defined , and the nonsense avoided . I cringe when I run latencytop on any random Linux system , leave it a minute or two and typically see latencies over 15ms ( typically filesystem related ... `Tux3` , please hurry it to the kernel somehow ! ) . It 's a shame Matt did n't implement it on top of some generalized message IPC like `Minix3` , but it 's still a major step in the right direction . Dragonfly is making BSD suck less progressively by transitioning from monolithic to hybrid architecture , whereas Minix3 took a more radical approach of rebuilding itself from scratch and with pure µkernel architecture ; They stripped `Minix2` and moved everything to userspace while adapting the system as necessary , so technically it 's not from scratch , but almost .",Romance,Spanish

Actually , I think they do have a point . It 's so unfair `btrfs` got special treatment , whereas `Reiser4` and `Tux3` were treated very harshly , despite not having that *little* `known to lose data` issue . I 'm also sad at the state of filesystems on Linux . Right now , the only FS that I know wo n't just eat my data is `XFS` , which barely any distribution uses as default . `Btrfs` is too young , `ext4` gets data corrupting bugs every now and then , such as the present one , and the other filesystems do n't see much usage so they ca n't be trusted either . They have the solid [ UFS2 ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_File_System ) as the default in most BSDs . It features [ soft updates ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_updates ) rather than the archaic journal most Linux filesystems use , and does n't have a corruption bug every other week . In fact , I have never heard about a data corruption bug there .

The reality was : Microkernels were n't ready and Linus did right to go with a mature and well-tested design . This is why it became important quickly . Tanenbaum was n't wrong either : The pure microkernel approach is superior . It just was n't the time yet . But time passed and microkernels matured . Mach happened , then L3 , L4 , and then things really got exciting . But this is after Minix3 , which first release ( very barebones , not even virtual memory ) is n't even 10 years old , and only picked up the pace 4 years ago . & gt ; Really though , LFS may actually be more challenging in some respects Yeah , bootstrapping Minix3 from another system ( eg : linux ) is very exercised ( particularly ever since ARM port ) , understood and documented .",Romance,Spanish

Recent improvements ( headers from netbsd , libc stuff , dynamic libraries , threading and so on ) will make X actually be useful for something ... a few versions ago we had X , but it was useless because X stuff just does n't like to build/run static .",Romance,Spanish

IOMMU requires OS support . Linux support for IOMMU is poor . Ideally , drivers would be isolated as userspace processes , and the hardware they drive would be able to address virtual memory ( thanks to IOMMU ) of the driver , rather than physical memory .

Linux implements neither .",Romance,Spanish
3G6A5W338E,visualnovels,"& gt ; Hard to say when a fair number of Japanese VN studios are using proprietary engines . It 's possible - probable even - that the people you are referring to making OELVNs are using Ren'Py , which works on Linux . Some Linux VNs were Ren'Py , some were nscripter ( for which onscripter exists ) , some were kirikiri , others were different engines or even custom . The strategy when no Linux version of the engine exists has been , as far as I can tell , to port to an existing engine . A popular choice lately has been some sort of VN engine that 's implemented on top of Unity . & gt ; So I would say that it 's less that Linux is n't good for visual novels and more that visual novel development has n't streamlined enough that multiplatform releases can be seriously considered by most without a probable financial return on the effort . Precisely because we 're talking about VNs , which are n't technically rocket science , only a little extra effort ( when compared to the costs of licensing , translation , QC , marketing ... ) is necessary to port to a multiplatform engine . Which is why so many of the VNs available on Steam do actually run on Linux . I think that , at the level of success this Muv-Luv kickstarter already has , working on a Linux port is only a matter of willingness ; it 's not like it 's going to make a significant dent on the funding . As such , it 'd be massively disappointing if a Linux port does n't happen .",Romance,Spanish

3G6A5W338E,amiga,"First of all , confirm it 's `A500` and not `A500+` , as that 's a different beast . Also confirm what expansions you have and the specific model for the board , the custom chips and the kickstart ROM . This should help : http : //sysinfo.d0.se/ & gt ; My main concern is playing some games and I have looked at the HxC ? but also see drives by Gotek , can someone explain what is good/bad or is it worth it ? Look into `whdload` , if you have an HD and some `FAST RAM` . I know about floppy emulators , but I 'm not fond of them ; I consider real floppies to be a part of the experience , and I 'm sure you got a collection of floppies with your Amiga which you probably want to still be able to use . Worst case scenario , you can survive ( for now ) by writing cracked versions of games ( from eg : TOSEC ) back to floppies with your Amiga , as needed , and reusing floppies ( standard floppies , do not defile originals ! ) . Only your favorites deserve dedicated floppies : ) . Other than that , you 'd definitely want : * `1MB Chip RAM` , which is achieved via `trapdoor 512K expansion` , and a small mod ( A500 board has a solder-based jumper ) . This is only possible with relatively new A500 boards . The oldest models ca n't . Most newer games do need this . There 's plenty of benefits to this . Trapdoor expansions typically also provide a `RTC` , so your Amiga can keep time even if off . * Some `FAST RAM` ( 4-8MB ) via expansion slot on the LEFT of your Amiga ( typically attached to the hard disk controller ) . Having FAST RAM at all means your Amiga will run considerably faster , as without , CPU will have to share RAM bandwidth with the custom chipset , for programs and data the chipset needs no access to . * A `serial null-modem cable` . This is the cheapest way to connect to another computer . Besides file transfer , software development/debug and other handiness , thanks to `SLIP` or `PPP` you can connect your Amiga to the internet . Here 's some transfer instructions : http : //www.boomerangsworld.de/cms/vc/amiga_transfer.html * Look into getting an HD controller . Something modern with `compact flash` in place of an HD would do . These typically are `accelerator boards` and also provide a faster CPU and other conveniences . I 'd throw some recommendations , but I have n't looked into what 's available in years . I 'm personally waiting for `majsta` 's FPGA-based accelerator board . & gt ; Also do I need a mouse or can I get by with keyboard commands only ? sorry been a long time since using one ! You definitely need a mouse ( to use Amiga software without going insane , else play with Amiga key + cursors for movement , +alt to click , +shift for faster movement ) and a joystick ( most games need one ) . For the mouse I 'd recommend getting any of the modern clones available in Amiga-specialized shops . As for the joystick , I 'd try and get some adapter so you can use modern known-good gamepads . I favor the PS3 's dualshock3 , and I 'm sure adaptors exist , but I have not looked into it ; I just use a crap old joystick for the Amiga , and have been meaning to look into this for a long time . & gt ; as well for putting in an amiga 600 when I get chance to pick one up . A600 has a built-in HD controller , to which you can easily adapt a compact flash card . `whdload` is the way to go on A600 . The `Vampire A600` is the accel board to get .",Romance,Spanish

But , even if you do n't want to do that ( I do n't think I 'd open the case just to look at that , to be honest ... I love my Amigas too much ) , you can still check what the LED color is for the POWER and FLOPPY LEDs . Knowing that would narrow down possible board revisions . & gt ; There is something in the underside trapdoor but not sure what yet , need to dig around online and get a picture of an open board laid out for me to reference . still has all warranty seals intact ! Most likely the expansion I mentioned ( an `A501` or a clone ) . Mostly everybody had one , as not having at least 1MB is very restricting . What your father might not have done is the solder jumper thing . What this means is that the RAM is considered `SLOW RAM` , which is RAM that ca n't be accessed by the chipset but still shares the bandwidth with actual `CHIP RAM` . & gt ; Did n't want to spend massive amounts or have stuff dangling out the side etc hence the interest in the HxC/Gotek . Not using the slot on the left is a lot of potential wasted ... I say this , but I do not have an expansion there . I do intend to get the `Vampire A500` eventually , but that might still take years to be released . It 'd be a different story if I did n't have an `A1200` like I do . As for the serial cable ... that should cost about as much as a beer . & gt ; Did n't get any disks with it as father in law just gave me what was laying around but I think a few may eventually turn up .

If it has the mod done , I believe this `` disable jumper '' is necessary so that the RAM gets mapped as CHIP RAM . & gt ; I appreciate the advice but this thing will only be fired up once a week or so ca n't really justify spending massive amounts .

3G6A5W338E,linux,"Ok , so disk has no physical issues ( no click of death , failed sectors , SMART complaints , etc ) , therefore I should n't need to point you to `gnu ddrescue` as you thankfully do not need it . Otherwise , you 'd be imaging your harddisk with it first , and then working against that image . This is the approach I would take , considering you just want to take your data elsewhere : Boot some other Linux and use `qemu-img` to create an overlay image over your entire problem hard disk ( or ddrescue dump of it , if there were hw issues ) . This gives you a `qcow2` image ( actually a very small file ) that shows your whole disk , and you can write to it ; changes only go to the qcow2 file , not touching the disk . Now you 're free . You can play as much as you want ( as your disk ( or image ) is physically fine ) with this qcow2 file and `qemu` . But you probably just want it exposed to Linux somehow , without running qemu . `qemu-nbd` can help you with that . Your `/dev/nbd0` or whatever does , however , have partitions . Wrong ones ( in the partition table ) , and correct ones ( where your actual data is ) which you do n't know the boundaries of . You never wrote to your unallocated partition , so it should just be right there **untouched** . This is where `testdisk` can help . It 'll analyze your `` disk '' ( the nbd0 backed by the qcow2 overlay of your actual disk or image ) and find through understanding of filesystem header structures where the actual partitions are and their sizes . It 'll then create a partition table correctly : ) Then use `partx` to get Linux to understand that partition table . Mount your partition and happily access your data .

FreeBSD copied Linux , whereas Dragonfly took a different path . It 's notable that it can keep up with Linux whereas other BSDs fall short , and that it is doing so while having such a small team of developers .

In eastern countries ( poorer ) it is normal for people to often migrate between cities and just build barracks with whatever they have or find and start over , They will often find water and things to burn just if they spend enough time for one day , Also food is often cheaper , and poorer countries are often warmer incidentally , requiring less food , clothing and shelter . also working a month for the first paycheck is also a thing that prerequisites already having a place to stay in many times , the stories I read in the comments show incredible resilience , but the people who were homeless would have it much easier if they were living in a poorer country . One thing is that in many of poorer countries people can often have the option of getting paid daily , either by request at a normal job , or just participating in any kind of work that is day-to-day . Assuming you are there in the morning at some place and you manage to get the job , for example carrying stuff at a construction site etc .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Turkey,"1 . He must drop the army barracks thing in taksim , that is entirely a revenge seeking mindset , most young people dont care if you build a kışla or not , just dont do it on one of the last green places in central istanbul 2 . I believe most people in Turkey revere Atatürk and are for secularism in government , but are at the same time muslims of various degrees . 3 . If I could for a moment believe that all the AKP were sincerely seeing themselves as Turks and were working for the betterment of the nation , without any influence from neither west or east , I would also support them as I did in the beginning of 2000s . But I have trouble with those things because since 2000 many things have happened , their people have taken bribes and they still are not punished , I have realised that their version of ADALET is not KANUN , but more like 'Revenge ' for past happenings . Some of them keep bashing values of Atatürk and his person . Also I was personally gassed during the park riots and that was considered 'rebellion ' and we were 'çapulcu ' , instead of making things right they continued and still continue to calling those who were trying to defend a park as mischief makers , that shit is still fucked up and they have not remedied the situation . And they still want to remove public access to a large part of the park ( the kışla plans were when I last saw them four walls encapsulating a large part of the green area ) . Also another philosophical perspective is that when the sun rises it will overshadow the Atatürk monument in taksim square , I do n't know if they really think that far symbolically . Also the guy said he was BOP eşbaşkanı , so how can I trust him who said he supports plans of dividing the country ? AND WHY HAS NO ONE PUT AN END TO THIS DISCUSSION BY EXPLAINING OR APOLOGIZING ? If I believed they loved the country as I do , I would support them , but the distrust they have has been initiated by themselves , and is still fueled by their own efforts . Sadly . One reason is they may really want to keep the population divided for a future purpose , if they really are into the BOP thing .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Turkey,"Not too long ago I was gassed for sitting in a park along with women and children without warning , RTE supported that action and since then I view his actions with suspicion . People were not apologized to . He is also still looking for more power and he doesnt like Atatürk one of the main inspirational forces for building a strong Turkey with or without islam . I consider myself a muslim and I research islam , according to my views there is no place for dictators or monarchy or people with absolute power . Along with many other issues that I have come to my own conclusions . RTE does in my opinion not like democracy , he has even said it is a means not a goal , I assume for him it is to acquire power . RTE has said he is BOP eşbaşkanı , that alone is a big mystery that can not be forgotten , nothing has been said to address this issue and put an end to speculations . RTE has said when he asked his father whether or not they were turks , his father reportedly answered say we are muslims . RTE likes to take stances against Atatürk and his values , and he has used this many times to excite people he thinks are his voters , he has also in the past along with many others from his 'team ' had ugly conversations and accusations against any and all opposition . He is a part of a team that has paid trolls to actually get into arguments with different minded thinkers . He likes democracy because in his mind it means he gets to do what he wants I have trouble seeing how his mindset changed from 2 months ago until today . His deputees have taken bribes , and so often has he been blind to such things , the investigations in usa at the moment should have been here . There are tons of corruption around him and he has not tried to do the right thing and put an end to it . He should have told his family to stay a way from extravagance and excessive spending . Just recently his mate bought stuff from poland for over 5 000 euro . Including three 7 armed chandelliers which are jewish things , not that I would normally care but he says they are muslims , and there has been tons of conspiracy theories and information that they are actually jewish . Did I mention he is still trying to acquire more power ? If he uses this coup for gaining power and control over the TSK , even if it now contains 100 % Ataturkish people , who are NOT threats to the country , how will we explain this ? If he does then the coup has been positive to his aims ! And what about all the Ataturkish people he has removed in the past from governmental institutions ? also : he is STILL the head of the party that thinks it is fun to vote down any kind of proposition from the opposition . Also they have minimal democracy inside their party itself . Yet he loves democracy because it has given him the powers he has and he is now doing his best to concentrate that power into even fewer hands . Typical dictator mentality or he is a puppet .",Turkic,Turkish

An islamic country would be an ideal country if it wasnt for mindless masses who do and obey what dictators and clergy tell them , and they are too powerless to complain about their situation , they all try to balance modern living and amenities in dictatorships with the ideas of islam of which most muslims deem unimportant , while they are the most important parts of the religion .

1980sumthing,AskEngineers,"I had calculated that if all humans were vegans , meaning they would require 600 m2 for food production , ( vegetarians and meat eaters required 1400 m2 and 2000+ something m2 if I recall correctly ) we would all fit in Australia , every human having a plot of land the size of 1000 m2 for vegans and so on . The problem with big cities is that transportation of necessities and such become increasingly wasteful the bigger the city gets , because the transportation of food from outside the city becomes a large burden , including the energy required for refrigeration of food products . A large concrete area , in worst case scenario also creates increasingly large distances from oxygen producing vegetation . Increasingly large centralized production of food water and electricity creates an incremental increase for the need for maintenance.of the facilities . My idea of an ideal symmetric and low waste structure of the living spaces of humans is that small city-villages are created , each village houses 100-1000 people and produces it 's own electricity , water from wells and food , each village has a large amount of land around it 's central village that is used to primarily support the needs of the people in the village .

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"compared to other websites the capacity used would be marginal , today even small sites or businesses use tons of 24/7 online servers . Whichever project I choose I could start small , with one laptop so I guess procrastination plays a role here . one project is downloading vast numbers of websites and let people search in them aka search engine , another is less resource using , letting people just organise information / website items I have had some theories that the electromagnetic pollution is actually harmful to less dense creatures , maybe that is why they prefer to approach people in desolate areas.. I believe that the search engines and even fb has built in flaws , and they certainly dont allow for more advanced usage of their collected data , publicly . And they dont allow for knowledge gathering , only posting which gets buried in newer posts , this whole thing makes people addicted to posting in my opinion , one of the projects I want to do is a place where you can gather information on certain topics , all sorts of media from all over the web , like wikipedia but with external links instead , letting people organising the content . another reservation I have about this is , what if this will make people use their minds less , like using easy access to search engines making people use their own minds less ?

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"In my experiene , there are two types of services available today to humans , one that gives full control , lets you *browse* contents shared to a site , and the other that only allows you to search the contents based on keywords you already know . These are called filter bubbles and lets people sit in their own comfort zone and does n't let them know about things they do n't already know the concept about , all the major sites shows you content that IT thinks is important for you , and whoever does n't know about filter bubbles will possibly never know about it . https : //www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles ? language=en fb CHOOSES what it will show you , having 200 friends with 10 new posts each makes 2 thousand posts , and your newsfeed only shows a fraction and that based on what they see relevant , the founder made a video ( which I cant find now ) about how some local news would be more important to the person than a child starving somewhare . And when you search for groups it shows the list of groups and pages without sorting for popularity , sometimes showing the most popular groups several pages later , tell me if I 'm wrong , this was how it was when I was last using it . Youtube does not let you browse channels , vimeo does . The deliberate crippling of services are done by details and very subtle , but they effect a whole world of users benefiting from the services . AND without the immediate resources to produce a replica of such a site are forced to the limits of publicly available services . When a youtube video is removed , they also remove the comments section and the list of recommendation videos . Ironically there are few major alterEnglishs to faceb . and the current major search engine . And ironically the alterEnglish websites that could have potential somehow never get the breakthrough or are forgotten . the search engine also only shows sites in recommendation based on your personal profile . And somehow the services that are to benefit the world do not allow for alterEnglishs to what is shown to you . Small details would provide huge power to the users , perhaps that is why . My ideas are in principle 2 separate ideas , the searching and the social media parts should both be open and allow 3rd party services to access data and provide information , INSIDE the primary service if it is the wish of the user . That is how we could move to more transparent world , I believe . The making of a search engine and a resource gathering services is very different , Search engines require a lot of resources , my intention if I make such a service is to make local for my region , and that would be a large task enough , or to limit the services to websites relevant to preconceived subject such as topics relevant to this subreddit . Trying to make it all-encompassing from the beginning would be it 's own deathblow . The other site of resource gathering would require less resources , because it would rely on the input on the users , such as reddit . People adding links and relevant information to specific topics . Unfortunately not even reddit organizes information based on the topics besides the subreddits , it relies on people finding relevant posts with links to other subreddits or posts , at least reddit has websites that lists all the subreddits . But reddit does not list the subreddits from its own site and it doesnt even search within the contents of it 's own posts , only the titles . the search engines and the social media site have internal tools for sure that lets them view and categorize content , but the tools are not available to the public . . I believe the electrical lines are barriers on the earth put on specific locations that prevent less dense beings from travelling through . In egypt there is a electrical grid along the large part of the desert , next to the nile , basically cutting off a large part of the desert which you can even hear the humming when walking under it . Electromagnetic waves increase the dna damage which constantly requires more food for repair . This is the dilemma . I think humans have capabilities of sensing higher truths through their body and hair , and this is hindered by the electromagnetic waves in our surroundings , especially AC electrical fields , which most of the electrical grids use . I think telepathy and other sensory perception is only a matter of being in a suitable environment . I was inquiring about a scooter with a 70 panel on it the other day , but I cant find the link now , making a solar car requires it to be much lighter than an ordinary car , ideally under 400 kg of weight . And that means no luxuries but I think it is possible , making it light and having a large surface area could make it possible to make it driveable with only sunlight . There are similar cars built for the solar challenge competitions in the world , but they have specific restrictions and look funny , making it larger would make it easier to have surface area for continual powering with solar energy .",Turkic,Turkish

There is no “ smoking gun ” linking the Government of Turkey or Erdogan directly to ISIS oil sales . It is apparent , however , that Turkey turned a blind eye to ISIS oil trade . Turkey failed to seal its border , facilitating ISIS oil exports . Turks have profited at stages of the supply chain . '' when russia provided satellite images of lots of tankers getting oil in the region , regional kurdish authorities said they were **theirs** Oil and other things has been smuggled for decades in the area , and until borders are entirely closed all sorts of people will profit from buying oil from many actors in the region and attempt to sell it in other places . As said , yes there probably are Turkish citizens who have profited from it . This does not mean Turkey is actively aiding ISIS , and the `` terror groups '' mentioned in the original post is not ISIS but **other groups** who are fighting assad and or ISIS . The situation is chaotic in the area , and Turkish borders are not perfectly sealed and they have not had perfect control over the oil trade , although it has diminished seriously . 2. says `` Turkish reporters who exposed how the Erdoğan government has directly armed Islamist rebels in Syria `` this is **not ISIS** either . But other groups . Germanys latest shipment of weapons to north iraq peshmerga are already being sold on the black market , ISIS is using american weapons and vehicles , and many of their leaders were people let out from iraqi prisons after the us invasion . 3. says `` Smuggled fuel came from oil wells in Iraq or Syria controlled by militants , including ISIS , and was sold to middlemen who smuggled it across the 900-kilometer Turkish-Syrian border . Analysts estimate that the Islamic State group gets up to $ 3 million a day in revenue from oil fields seized in Iraq and Syria . Western intelligence officials have alleged that Turkey is turning a blind eye to a flourishing trade that strengthens ISIS , and Secretary of State John Kerry has called on Turkey to do more to stem the trade . Oil smuggling was a booming business until about six months ago , when Turkish authorities cracked down in response to media reports . New checkpoints and border controls were set-up in Hatay Province .

1980sumthing,Turkey,"making a jet engine is not that difficult , plans and instructions are available on the internet , but to mass produce it you need buyers first , ie TSK . But if you want reliability and standards you must have much larger investments . small companies are already making and selling small jet engines in europe and you can probably buy one from Turkey , they are for model airplanes , and not many people in Turkey have a need to buy such a jet engine or a larger one , so TSK makes it happen . we already produce all parts of car engines in many brands , i think but to be able to sell it , you need to make the rest of the car , making a car of 20-30 year old technology is easy , making a Ford model T is a piece of cake but people dont want to produce it because it would not be liked by customers . Because the rest of the car is what interests most customers . And you can probably build a whole car engine minus some electronics ( or the entire car engine with carburators ) from car parts already produced in Turkey . But with 100s of car brands most people wouldnt know what to do with a car engine , Fiat Aegea has reportedly required 1-2 billion dollars for investments and it is doing well now , but the factory already had lots of experience in carmaking . in other countries , like us , people build own stuff all the time , own cars , dune buggys etc , even airplanes , in Turkey there is not much of a market to build own stuff , we even pay people to put together furniture from ikea . Most people just dont have place and time to build their own machines , or money knowhow and time to invest in building engines , So to produce any working car in serial production you need some babayiğit , because if you want it to be competitive it needs to look good and be comparable to other brands .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,freedomearth,"( i 'm not the author of this text which is the first chapter of a book ) The Trap System is a complex cage based on spiritual and technological tools . The purpose is to keep people trapped in their physical bodies on Earth , even through many different incarnations over thousands of years . In fact , the whole purpose of reincarnation is so you stay trapped in this physical realm where you are unaware of how to connect with your soul and thus do not experience ones True Self . New Agers completely misunderstand this concept . Most of them believe that reincarnation is `` necessary '' for a persons spiritual development and that Earth is a `` School . '' It is not . Earth is a prison planet . If Earth is intended for spiritual development there are some major flaws . A large percentage of the western world for example do not believe in God and think religion is a waste of time . Also consider the fact that between each incarnation people are put into amnesia thus forget everything they ever learned in their last life therefore we are forced to start all over again century after century . I guess you could say its the `` devolution of the spirit '' rather than the `` evolution of the spirit '' . This alone proves that reincarnation can NOT serve the purpose which New Agers believe . It is the complete opposite . Most people do not develop spiritually from one life to the next because they are stripped of everything they learn . Basically we are `` reset '' at birth and are memories are wiped . The reason for this is to make sure mankind stays trapped and lose all knowledge of our higher selves , therefore we can not develop properly and reach the levels of Self Understanding , or Experience our Higher Soul and 10 True Being . We simply remain here in lower planes of the astral realm , ignorant , blinded and brainwashed . But as we shall discuss later , there are ways to avoid getting trapped in the system . The Trap System Explained I know what you are thinking : ” Who created the trap system and for what purpose ? ” The answer to that is other beings that retained their knowledge of the higher astral planes . Don´t think that these other beings are some kind of evil aliens because they are not . They are just like you and me , after all , we all came from the same place and we are all One . However , a long time ago these higher beings decided that mankind would become trapped on Earth to serve as slaves and act as a source of money and food . We are slaves to powerful elite families the control legal and banking systems together with religions and are indeed part of the Trap System . Because these higher beings feed off our etheric energy we are also a source of food for them . These entities , or as many people call them , `` Reptilians , '' are working in both the astral planes and the physical world . They have their representatives here on Earth and have infiltrated the physical world and taken over the planet by controlling Governments , banking , religious institutions , media , food chains and various other leading corporations . As I mentioned above , the Reptilian entities that keep us trapped here feed on the etheric body energy . What I mean by this is the energy we give off through our thoughts and emotions . They particularly thrive from negative energy , which is why world leaders cause so much pain and suffering by creating wars , terrorism , crashing banking systems , disasters , inventing laws that are designed to restrict people´s freedom , and creating paranoia and fear through media . 11 These entities can influence the minds of people through different means in order to create specific thought patterns , behaviours and emotions . This influence is done from astral telepathical connections with victims , to various technologies that alter a person´s state of mind . The powers that be are doing their best to keep their designs uttermost secret , which is why you will hardly find any information on this in any publications , especially not the mainstream media which they control . Very few know about the this part of human existence and even less want to accept it . However , there are people on Earth now who have chosen to reincarnate here to let people know the truth about their existence . We have done so at great risk , which is why we are few , as we too can be trapped into the complex construction of the Trap System . Even the initiated can lose their knowledge and insights of spiritual connections and Higher Souls from one life to the next . The reason for that is because the human body is manufactured to be very limited and is not generally capable of accessing its soul to any significant degree . However , a Soul Fragment must be in place in any Human Body for that body to live and function , and it is this soul fragment that holds the key to us unlocking the doors of the trap system . The Origins of Man and the various Gods and Entities In the beginning existed only the one Mind , the Creator , the Cause of all existence . Let´s go with the scientific idea and say it was the big bang . Whatever it was created powerful energies that manifested and designed other forms of existence . But these other forms of existence , what we call Gods , spawned from the Minds of the Creator . In turn the Gods created life which is how we have this physical existence on Earth . 12 The Gods had different ranks and representations together with different polarities and functions . Our ancient ancestors understood this and believed that by concentrating on those ” Energies ” you can ultimately enable the idea or desire to manifest . When The One , the creator , split into different fragments it caused duality – nothing can exist without an opposite . Therefore we have negative energy and positive which in turn causes Good and Evil . Since Creation has evolved through countless levels of manifestations and different life forms , it has created Beings who are different in nature from other Beings – simply because their origins of polarity are opposite . Therefore we get good and evil . It exists all over the Universe , not just here on Earth in the human race , but on many levels in other spiritual planes . This has lead to some Beings being termed here as the Good Ones , and some as the Evil Ones . It goes on at many levels between the Gods themselves , and indeed all the way down here between people of the Earth . Some of the Gods believe they are the True God because of have forgotten , or not truly realized , their true origins . It is the same for us in the physical World – we have forgotten where we came from and ultimately we do not know who we are or what we are actually capable of – and believe me , our capabilities are more amazing than you can imagine ! In essence , all Life is One , simply due to everything existing within the One Mind , the First Cause , and thus all and everything is connected to each other . Therefore all life has equal potential , meaning that even you can be a Creator , a God with the ability to manifest whatever you desire in your own World and reality . It is a complex topic , and there is a lot of confusion between Mankind and other Beings which has caused many problems for many lifeforms . 13 It is the programming of the Mind that keeps you in the physical body , yet this also is true for the astral body , as the astral body is not the Soul or your True Self any more than your physical body . Nevertheless , you are still a spiritual being trapped in your physical body because your mind has been programmed to belief you can not not exist outside of your physical body . There will always be some people who agree with what I am saying , and some who do n't . Others want it to be true , but dares not believe it in case other people think they are crazy . It is impossible to convince anybody they can explore other dimensions of the Universe if they simply choose not to believe it . And it is your choice whether you want to accept what I am saying or dismiss it . However , I must say that if you choose to ignore your gift , you will miss out on many amazing experiences ! For me it does n't matter if you believe what I say or not . This book is not intended to force you into believing anything , but to make you aware of the possibilities and to give you the tools so you can experiment . What you choose to do with this information is entirely up to you . One thing I do hope you believe is that the most important thing you can ever study is yourself ; and the best person to listen to is You . This is something that you do instinctively yet are sometimes unaware of . One word of advice : Don´t listen to your head , listen to your heart . You feel that something is right , you don´t think it ! This is something you can develop and learn to trust through spiritual work and rituals like the ones at the end of this book . But in the meantime let me tell you more about how the Trap System works and how we are controlled . The Illusion of the Lower Astral Realm In the lower astral realms we know as Earth , good and evil is an illusion . It has been created to keep us here . Yet , you can say they are real , as they do exist in your mind even in their illusional form . In a sense , it´s the same way as a fantasy where you make something up in your mind that does not exist 14 in your physical world - yet at the same time it does exist since you just made it up in your mind in the form of said fantasy . On Earth we are part of someone else 's fantasy , but one we all contribute to because of the soul fragment that ultimately came from the Creator – The One Mind . However , you are controlled through programming and the illusions that you live in , even though the people that control us are also living in the illusion . Therefore , they have no more right to control you then you do to control them . Some of the people that control you are often referred to as the ” Elite ” and some of them are the ones working with the Elite because they too have been controlled by the Elite to oversee the illusions that are designed to control the rest of us . In essence , the Elite are abusing the system . The original system that was created by ” God , ” the original Creator , was to allow the soul fragments the chance to explore the Universe and experience different forms of life . However , the Evil Ones decided to abuse the system for their own gains by manipulating and controlling other soul fragments . And so we have the Trap System . But there is a way out and I truly believe that eventually everyone will be free . Thankfully , some people on this prison planet of ours are already free and are doing their best to teach others . These so called enlightened beings can explain what is happening simply because they have observed the Good and Evil from many points of view . However , it does not come without its dangers . Spirit guides , angels , ascended masters etc are more often than not within the trap system themselves and thus also `` prisoners . '' The difference is they believe they are from a higher plane of existence and are free . But as long they are individuals in a human body , they are not true Selves , as only Oneness is True Self . 15 Such beings are only to be found within the lower astral planes , however , they are aware of the higher trust can help guide people towards their True Self after death . Regarding your imprisonment in a physical body , I 'm talking about matters that took place in the very distant past before your first physical incarnation . It was at this moment you allowed your soul and your True Self to enter the physical world in the body of a human being . However , you were lured and blindly believed what you were told by the Gods of those times . Fortunately , some souls recognised the trap and escaped , but continue to return to help mankind understand the true nature of their origins and abilities . We find example of this in the ancient world , such as the Pyramids in Egypt , Mexico and Peru . Some of you will know these original peoples as the Atlanteans . With these amazing structures they left clues and more and more people are slowly beginning to realize that there is more to our existence than this mundane life we experience on Earth . More and more people are learning of their True Origins and returning to the Source of All One . When the evil entities created by the fragmented original Mind eventually came upon Earth and discovered how mankind is programmed , they realised that it would be easy to manipulate us . Although the rulers have changed from time to time , they have always been negative energies , power-hungry and sinister . That is why war and murder of the innocent exists right the way through recorded history . The agenda of the ruling Elite is to gain more power and control by making people work for them without even knowing it . Some are even worshipped by us as Gods which further empowers them because we give them more energy . On Earth they mostly use religious and spiritual institutions , politics , media and money to suck up our energy . Their God in a sense is money because 16 everybody relies on money to live . Yet in reality it has been created by the system and is actually worth nothing . With religions you are worshipping them under the pretence of you worshipping the Creator God . They also run the larger industries , governments and such which they can manipulate to their advantage and keep control by feeding the rest of us suggestions and lies they know we are open to believe . But these lies are merely a distraction from understanding your True Self . As I have previously explained , I disagree that we were physically incarnated here to `` learn '' anything at all . We could learn very well without these physical bodies as the astral realms of the lower levels are so close one can hardly tell the difference . So there is no need for a physical body other than to limit the True Soul so that it can not obtain or retain spiritual knowledge . If you consider the fact that most people live their present live without any memory or knowledge of their previous lives , then reincarnation is a complete and utter failure . Learning comes from Higher Consciousness and is independent of Physical conditions . We are all eternal beings with limitless knowledge and power than enables us to explore the endless areas of existence – something we are all capable of if only we learn how to separate break free from the physical body we are trapped inside . The only lesson to really learn here , is that we are failing to find our true selves , and that true knowledge comes from much deeper aspects of our Being than blindly wandering around on Earth . Simply living does not teach you anything about your true power . They Elite entities are smart and have many ways to distract us so we don´t discover the truth . They manipulate and control us in many ways ranging from spiritual means to school education , news & media , foods and the mind altering substances they put in them , vaccinations and health institutions that hand out harmful medicines made by pharmaceutical companies . They control us with technology such as sound frequencies , radiations , water systems , anything they can alter and pollute . They manufacture products to 17 make your mind dull , filled with apathy , more open for suggestion , and trustworthy of the media , leaders and so on . I applaude those of you who do not blindly believe everything we are told . In fact I highly praise people who follow their own intuition and encourage people not to listen to what they are being told , but to conduct their own research . I would even advise you to conduct your own research into what I am telling you in this book . Some of the things I have told you , such as how we are controlled by a corrupt Elite is easy to discover . All you need to do is type into Google the name a major company , bank or politician plus ” corruption , ” and you will find numerous news items that demonstrate the dishonesty of these cheats . Other things I am explaining to you are not as well written about and thus will have to be a matter of opinion and discovery . Therefore , I suggest you take some of the things I tell you into consideration and listen to your inner guide . Over time , if you go looking for answers , you will be surprised what you will learn and the insights that you gain . This world has its share of gullible people . And many of them write about what they are told for other gullible people to believe . During your research read widely and don´t just take one person´s opinion as the truth . To get on the right spiritual path you have to decide what is right for you and follow you instincts . Eventually it will all become clear and you will re-establish your contact with the All , your true Oneness . Evil is a lower level reality , indeed , but because of the lower level God wanting to have the powers and control of the Creator God . The lust grew , and as his power grew he took advantage of mankind in every way he could . You are NOT here for any ” purpose ” - you are here because you are TRAPPED , in the ILLUSIONS and PROGRAMMING . The only time you will '' ascend '' or go `` further '' is when you realize this and manage to keep your 18 awareness with you at the time of death . The only thing you will learn here is what deception , lies and illusions really are - not because you are `` supposed to '' , but because you have been forced to . Yet your true purpose is in a higher realm of experience , your real selves are cleaner and more pure . here you are just a small grain of your own selves , if even that . You barely know even the slightest thing about yourself and your origins - and the few things you do know are mostly lies . Remember , in your current understanding of life you are in one of the lowest forms of existence . The good news however is that you can learn how to achieve higher realms of existence and create your own reality . As the Greek playwright Euripeds wrote , ” In each of us is a God. ” You do have these powers within you because in the end you are all One and part of the Ultimate Source , thus you can control and dictate your own lives if you want to - as long you learn how to . The first thing you have to do is accept you live in a world of lies and deceit . The second thing you need to do is to commit yourself to finding your true self , even though it takes some time to get to the core . I would expect that most of you reading this book are already aware there is '' something '' beyond your normal waking reality otherwise you wouldn´t have been drawn to this book . You already know there is something beyond your `` dreams '' but perhaps you don´t know how to look further than the realms of the physical world and experience a completely new aspect of yourself . There is no need for me to ask you to believe anything , nor is there any need for me to ask you to disbelief anything , that is your free will . I am here because I have experienced the many layers of the astral world and have visited other dimensions and want to pass on my experiences and knowledge to help make you journey somewhat easier . 19 My purpose here is to serve you , bring you that spark of inspiration and self- realization that you all have within . I will teach you how to connect with yourself and come into balance with your being , harmony and Creation . Personally it is irrelevant for me if you believe me or not . I have nothing to gain from the decisions you make , nor will I lose anything . Only you have something to gain and something to lose . I am not here to make you believe a single word of what I say , but for those of you that I do resonate with , you already know what you need to do . When I say there is a lot of deceit out there , I am sure most of you would agree . Am I a deceiver ? That is something you will decide for yourself . It is good to be skeptical because when you look within yourself you will find a combination of tools that help you discover great things without ever needing help from others . However , especially in the early stages many people do benefit from some guidance . I , and many other spiritual teachers are here to help you on the way towards learning about yourself and understanding the divine laws that empower you and allow you to live in accordance with them - and thus reach higher levels of insights and understanding , as well as improving your own condition in every way . In the Trap System you are designed to work against yourselves , not because you want to or chose to do so freely , but because you are manipulated to think in a certain way . You are a prisoner sitting in a dark cell with a key to unlock the door in the corner . You don´t know the key is there because you have never looked for it . I am here to help you search for the key and unlock the door . There are many other spiritual teachers like me who have gained true knowledge . But there are also spiritual teachers you offer guidance with the sole gain of making money . Be cautious who you work with and what you believe . Do not believe that anything is the Truth unless you feel it is the Truth . Learn to trust your instinct and you will know the truth . 20 Even if something ” rings true ” it does not make it true . In fact a lot of what seems to be true on the surface has been constructed that way for you and is often the complete opposite of what can be considered ” truthfulness. ” Some people look up to spiritual teachers as if they are Gods , when in actual fact we are all Gods . What we understand to be God does not come here or '' visit '' you to help out . When the Bible says that God is omnipresent it is a veiled meaning to suggest you are your own God . We are all co-creators , but there is what you can consider the Creator of the physical world , as well as numerous other Creators upwards on many levels in the higher planes of existence . There are also many out there who want you to believe they are your Creator or God , higher beings such as angels and aliens . But many of these non-physical beings and forms of consciousness from other planes are ” negative energies. ” That poses us a slight problem and is the reason why there are so many failed predictions and disinformation coming from so-called ” gurus , ” ” masters ” and ” new age channelers. ” Most people will blindly accept whatever they are told by ” higher authorities , ” – but so do people who come into contact with entities – and like I said , some entities have negative energy and should not be trusted . This is of course is unfortunate , and those among you whom may be in contact with other entities should show extreme caution . At this level of existence everyone who is in this physical world is confronted with lies and deceit . The same is true of the spirit world . There are exceptions to this of course . You will find spiritual gurus in the physical world and spirit guides in the astral planes that are here to help and guide you . Very few people existing in this level of existence are in contact with higher beings or the Source , but there are plenty who are in contact with lower beings that pretend to be `` higher '' and thus give you false ideas of 21 what they are - and what YOU are . And that is how you can identify negative entities . The same goes for your so called after life - in fact most people who find themselves free of reincarnation after death are located at lower levels of existence and are very close to the physical world . In most cases they live their lives there almost identically to how they did when they were here . The surroundings and landscapes and structures of the lower astral realms are very similar to those of the physical one . Here too the deception and lies runs deep . This can be useful to have in mind both for your remaining time here as well as when you cross over to the next experience of existence - if you will just be able to keep yourself aware when doing so and remain conscious . In essence , to put it simply , Life is a preparation for Death . To break free of the Trap System when you die and cross over into your next stage of existence you should request yourself to experience your True Form , your Real Spiritual Essence , and immediately fly as far away from Earth as you can . In order to do this you need to practice spirit travel in this life on a regular basis . By practising spirit travel you will be able to retain awareness and consciousness of your true Self at the time of death . What you need to avoid is falling into an unconscious dreamy state of being and go through reincarnation again . You also want to avoid being trapped in the lower levels of existence such as the lower astral planes which serves the purpose of keeping you trapped until you once again get reincarnated . You need to venture away from all familiar forms , towards realms of only pure consciousness where no being has any form and no form exists . Though , a being that is self-aware , can maintain himself in a state of freedom even in lower astral planes , and avoid the cycle of reincarnation , there are people living in astral realms that are wonderful and beautiful in every aspect , and have been so for thousands of years and longer . But these planes 22 are still part of the lower level illusion of existence and not the True Form of Self . It is not even a merging with ones Higher Soul . You need to merge all your soul fragments with your Higher Soul , the real True Self that exists on a higher plane which is outside of the system that keep people trapped here . Then you are truly free , then you are truly One , and Yourself , ready to explore the real existence and freedom beyond all the deception and lies , and move on towards the Source itself . You can retain memory of past lives , of the spiritual realms , of your Higher Soul , and so on even here in your physical body . There are meditations and exercises one can perform that puts you in direct contact with your true self so that you will be able to explore and understand yourself and gain great insight on reality and illusions . Many of these exercises can be found on my website under the Topic ” Meditations , rituals & self development. ” The famous `` light '' at death also seems to be part of the trap system . There is no need to enter any light to go anywhere . When you die , simply tell yourself you want to experience your true spiritual essence , your real higher self . Tell yourself you want to merge with the Source , or experience the true God above all Gods . Remember also that your loved ones are always with you as they are all part of you and All , so you can always reunion with them for a while on the lower astral planes where you still find yourself experiencing life . Now you know about the trap system you can start to take your first steps to freedom and connecting with your Higher Presence . And I will explain more about that in the next chapter .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,Gnostic,"https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocryphon_of_John ... . Despite the fact that Yaltabaoth possesses only a single parent and was created without the consent of the Spirit of the Monad , he is powerful enough to mimic the creative processes of the superior Aeons . He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither “ light nor dark ” but is instead “ dim ” . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad ’ s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the “ waters ” that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the ‘ plenoria ’ or the ‘ Epinoia ’ , and later as the ‘ pleroma ’ , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth ’ s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth ’ s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish

Food and action is the thing that delays the experience of living on earth . All particles around and in us are individual particles that have individual intelligence , they all origin from the universe above , with sufficient energy each particle can take any shape or form Each particle is a shape that is physically connected to the shape above in the chain , the connecting thing between all is information coming down from above , the original source of all . The particles can in the above universes be any shape and form , when in sufficient numbers , they are physical matter in our world . These shapes form universes and are chain-connected with every other part . Each part is connected to the previous link , and the only thing regulated is the connection between each part which delays the information . Once upon a time the human form , the earth form and the tree form was created When we ate the apple , we disrupted the flow of energy from the source , forcing the whole system to enter into an avalanche of random events causing disruptions and forced rearrangements from the source , this was because we opened our eyes and started sending light through our eyes to parts that were not designed to handle it . Each time a disruption happens , it may cause separation somewhere , needing time for the system to readjust . This entire earth is a glob of connected universes that once entered an avalanche of chain reactions that found another solution to the system , which eventually and continually is this world we live in . All the time as we open our eyes we continue to reiterated the disruptions . I have witnessed something that is very interesting , since the most efficient structure for this connected-particle-universe is a chain of beings , perhaps you can guess what the being subsisting of such beings can be shaped like . There are such beings that consist of many individual beings , they are chain linked , dreaming the many collective dreams with eachother and this being is at the same time capable of interacting with the world below it . So it is both individual and many . When this kind of being is communicated with it can alter , modify your world and make changes to it according to your wishes , and because it has a higher perspective , it can make it easier . If you have noticed , dreams can be random , or designed , and there are beings that can design your dreams here and in the worlds above . If you have seen it , dreams or lives in higher energy seem to be cartoon-like , this is because there are less particles that make up the same objects and they seem to be intelligent , this is because they are .

He is filled with ideas which are imperceptible to the senses , and with all-embracing Knowledge . Atum is Primal Mind . He is too great to be called by the name ‘ Atum ’ . He is hidden , yet obvious everywhere . His Being is known through thought alone , yet we see his form before our eyes . He is bodiless , yet embodied in everything . There is nothing which he is not . He has no name , because all names are his name . He is the unity in all things , so we must know him by all names and call everything ‘ Atum ’ . He is the root and source of all . Everything has a source , except this source itself , which springs from nothing . Atum is complete like the number one , which remains itself whether multiplied or divided , and yet generates all numbers . Atum is the whole which contains everything . He is One , not two . He is All not many . The All is not many separate things , but the Oneness that subsumes the parts . The All and the One are identical . You think that things are many when you view them as separate . but when you see they all hang on the One and flow from the One , you will realize they are united - linked together , and connected by a chain of Being from the highest to the lowest , all subject of the will of Atum . The Cosmos is one as the sun is one , the moon is one and the earth is one . Do you think there are many Gods ? That 's absurd - God is one . Atum alone is the Creator of all that is immortal , and all that is mutable . If that seems incredible , just consider yourself . You see , speak , hear , touch , taste , walk , think and breathe . It is not a different you who does these various thing , But one being who does them all . To understand how Atum makes all things consider a farmer sowing seeds ; here wheat - there barley , now planting a vine - then an apple tree . Just as the same man plants all these seeds , so Atum sows immortality in heaven and change on Earth . Throughout the Cosmos he disseminates Life and movement - the two great elements that compromise Atum and his creation , and so everything that is . Atum is called 'Father' because he begets all things , and , from his example , the wise hold begetting children the most sacred pursuit of human life . Atum works with Nature , within the laws of Necessity , causing extinction and renewal , constantly creating creation to display his wisdom . You see the things that the eye can see are mere phantoms and illusions . Only those things invisible to the eye are real . Above all are the ideas of Beauty and Goodness . Just as the eye can not see the Being of Atum , so it can not see these great ideas . They are attributes of Atum alone , and are so inseparable from him . They are so perfectly without blemish that Atum himself is in love with them . There is nothing which Atum lacks , so nothing that he desires . There is nothing Atum can lose , so nothing causes him grief . Atum is everything . Atum makes everything . and everything is a part of Atum . Atum , therefore , makes himself . This is Atum 's glory - he is all-creative , and this creating is his very Being . It is impossible for him to stop creating for Atum can never cease to be . Atum is everywhere . Mind can not be enclosed , because everything exists within Mind . Nothing is so quick and powerful . Just look at your own experience . Imagine yourself in any foreign land , and quick as your intention you will be there ! Think of the ocean - and there you are . You have not moved as things move , but you have travelled nevertheless . Fly up into the heavens - you wo n't need wings ! Nothing can obstruct you - not the burning heat of the sun , or the swirling planets . Pass on to the limits of creation . Do you want to break out beyond the boundaries of the Cosmos ? For your mind , even that is possible . Can you sense what power you possess ? If you can do all this , then what about your Creator ? Try and understand that Atum is Mind . This is how he contains the Cosmos . All things are thoughts which the creator thinks . from The Hermetica , attributed to Thoth translated by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,AskEngineers,"I thought of the idea of making a very small and simple transmitter that would send a signal and the GSM network would register it , but no handshake , no simcards , no encryption and no other communication in other frequencies , just send a specific signal at a specific frequency that would register in the GSM network but with no further interaction . The idea is to make a tiny transmitter much smaller in size and less complexity that can be put in many places very discretely . If you had cooperation with the GSM provider then this could become a service and perhaps even triangulate the position even if not it would provide a extremely simple and crude positioning detection from the gsm side . Perhaps for implanting such a device in a shoe or other items undetected . What is needed for the GSM system to register a minimal signal ?",Turkic,Turkish

So the illegality of smuggling ( not trafficking ) is where people try to enter a country , never when then they try to leave it . Besides endangerment ( lack of lifevests etc ) and tax evasion I can not think of any other reason for it to be illegal in the west coast of Turkey people travel to Greece by paying some boat captain money , and this is done legally all over the coast for tourists . and https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights Declaration of human rights article 13 states Article 13 : Right to freedom of movement Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State . **Everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own , and to return to his country . ** Thus I conclude it must be legal to leave a country and no country has any right to stop a person if they are not committing a crime . **and I think that if Europe pays Turkey money to prevent people to enter Europe , then they are both committing crimes .

'' But their question was foreign I could not understand When then suddenly I 'm ripped up and placed into a mouth And it swallowed me down at which time I head south So I said Hey ya e ya Hey hey hey Well I woke up to see them , these two mighty steeds With their mouths grinning wildly expressing my needs As they stood there above me , being flanked on each side I felt no need to fear them , no reason to hide So I reached up to touch but they faded too soon Yet their mouths still remained and stacked up towards the moon How that ladder of mouth waved so soft in the night And I looked up in awe at that beautiful sight And I dreamt about climbing into the night sky But I knew had I touched them they 'd mouth back 'bye bye' So I got up and walked down the path in the dark And there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark Of a crab twice my size with incredible strength Oh it greeted me kindly and then we all drank And we drooled out together right onto the ground And the ocean grew up quickly right up all around And the earth looked at me and said `` was n't that fun ? '' And I replied `` I 'm sorry if I hurt anyone '' And without even thinking cast me into space But before she did that she wiped off my own face She said better luck next time do n't worry so much Without ears I could n't hear I could just feel the touch As I feel asleep softly at the edge of a cave But I should have gone deeper but I 'm not so brave I said Hey ya e ya Hey ya e ya Hey ya e ya Hey hey hey",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,freedomearth,"Each unit of live intelligence receives what it needs to survive while it is alive . This energy beam follows all beings and nourishes them , it makes them wake up from sleep . People eat because the light that nourishes the life they consumed , attempts to awake it , inside the being that consumed it , but which is now in the belly . This new energy beam is added to the existing energy that the consumer already receives , thus seemingly `` helping '' temporarily because the being feels more energized . A problem is the being consumed does not dissappear , that unit of intelligence still needs to come back to form and life eventually . And it will have to come out of the mouth of the being that consumed it . A plant is the same as a fast animal , it is a unit of intelligence , the only difference is the amount of energy received to make it alive at a moment and other beings consumed and thus also energy belonging to other beings . The energy required to revive a being that is consumed is increasingly difficult because it can only properly be revived outside of the previous consumer . If it is not ejected properly , it remains in the domain of the consumer which falls into a cycle of consumption , every needing increasingly more energy for each awakening after sleep . When an entire system is in a consumption cycle it consumes more energy than it produces , it is seen as a black hole . In tales , the underworld . In heaven no one consumes while creating chaos which is the nature of hell , black holes . In black holes , systems race to create light in the world of all beings , which paradoxically is so many beings that make up the world . All units of intelligence either choose to come to a system or fell down to it without choice . After certain revival it can be assumed they are given the choice to either leave this system which requires constant consumption , or exit . The interesting thing about these systems is that beings have the option of experiencing physical sensation , the less they spend it on physical movement the more they can use it in other areas , such as dreaming which is astal projection and experiences in other realms . Even thinking and imagining visually , is another experience in astral instantaneous experience . Each being does what it can to follow the light , and if it in an instant means harming others , that is what occurs . If the light of a dream is stronger than real life , the person may choose to stay dreaming . If you catch my point . The systems that strive to liberate units of intelligent beings from this black hole to the realms with no consumption do exist in this world , they are widely known , some less liked than others . A unit of singular intelligence that can decide and experience life and situations , on its own is the smallest unit . The residue of its experiences the units have is contained in it 's individual vibration . The experiences as entire bodies are only happening because the individuals are attached to eachother . Their ability to experience in this world and above is regardless of size . But their ability to reach above worlds is dependent of size because of the energy required to excel it beyond this one , and some other factors which is seen as gravity .",Turkic,Turkish

When an entire system is in a consumption cycle it consumes more energy than it produces , it is seen as a black hole . In tales , the underworld . In heaven no one consumes while creating chaos which is the nature of hell , black holes . In black holes , systems race to create light in the world of all beings , which paradoxically is so many beings that make up the world . All units of intelligence either choose to come to a system or fell down to it without choice . After certain revival it can be assumed they are given the choice to either leave this system which requires constant consumption , or exit . The interesting thing about these systems is that beings have the option of experiencing physical sensation , the less they spend it on physical movement the more they can use it in other areas , such as dreaming which is astal projection and experiences in other realms . Even thinking and imagining visually , is another experience in astral instantaneous experience . Each being does what it can to follow the light , and if it in an instant means harming others , that is what occurs . If the light of a dream is stronger than real life , the person may choose to stay dreaming . If you catch my point . The systems that strive to liberate units of intelligent beings from this black hole to the realms with no consumption do exist in this world , they are widely known , some less liked than others . A unit of singular intelligence that can decide and experience life and situations , on its own is the smallest unit . The residue of its experiences the units have is contained in it 's individual vibration . The experiences as entire bodies are only happening because the individuals are attached to eachother . Their ability to experience in this world and above is regardless of size . But their ability to reach above worlds is dependent of size because of the energy required to excel it beyond this one , and some other factors which is seen as gravity .",Turkic,Turkish

'' up to how many bytes you want and then you can do a `` read drive x pos y '' since the buffering and commands are instantly sent out to the switch the network hardware takes care of the rest , all you have to do is put it out on the network with this you can have literally thousands of SATA drives connected to a single computer What do you think ? someone should make it . edit : ok this wont be the fastest system but I aim for cheap 10 usd per drive + 1x4 gbit ethernet adapter ( 45 usd ) + 2x48 port ethernet switch ( 200 usd each ) + cables +the drives themselves would cost I think very little edit yes this is Ata over Ethernet but I have not found a single product on the net that goes between a network cable and a sata interface edit : thanks for the comments",Turkic,Turkish

Ie they were shown the teachings after they lived righteous lives . They were Muslims before the quran came in the year 600s . Therefore one can be Muslim without even knowing it and following some instructions but forgetting the rest is not guaranteed to make you defined as a Muslim . Islam is for the thinking man , according to the quran . It is said children are born Muslim , why because they most often follow their hearts and try to be good , they are often in the state of purity of the heart before often being distorted by life and teachings of others . If you live with the intention of being good and true and do those things then you follow the category of Muslim not the other way around This post may be controversial for all sides but so be it . Islam is for the thinking man who is not supposed to accept or reject anything in an instance anyway . Not all Muslims will enter heaven according to the quran . But there will be those from other religions like Christianity who will . It means they will be Christians when they enter . I believe this means they are not supposed to be converted . See : there is no compulsion in Islam . It means : there is no compulsion in Islam . Ie there is no compulsion in Islam . Also you can not in the right mind do something unmerciful and ungraceful in the name of the merciful and graceful when you often do Things in life of Muslims you recite that very thing .

1980sumthing,answers,"disclaimer : this may have errors . Most is correct to my best knowledge . tl ; dr : Without the decoding executable or a codec it would be very difficult , unless it has visible similarities with known codecs . A sufficiently 'home-made ' pack of data would be indistinguishable from garbage , but with the program or codec that decodes it , it would be possible . It all depends on what the worlds have in common , language , common ancestral tech etc . Pulses of commonly visible light may be a common base , even if there are no common cultural/scientific heritage , but that is slow and a codec also requires many underlying systems that can build it up , and all need to conform to same standards , even the bit byte system must be same assuming you assume codec as in video stream on earth pcs , and also the ascii and such . I remind you that most of the tech and codecs are invented by individuals , for a really common base of communication something much simpler should be considered . End tl ; dr. A datastream with radio adds other issues , requirements for checksums , error correction and even registering the start and end of streams , unless of course it has known elements inside it . Also they can have amplitude and or frequency modulation each with limiting characteristics such as distance and bitrate , on earth the radio signals often have underlying systems such as manchester encoding and more than one 'symbol ' per bit . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_rate Varied pulses like from a pulsar star could imagiEnglishly be interpreted as morse code If they were controllable . Even the issue of the stream being base 8 or other system is open for variation if the other system uses unknown characteristics . Although for sake of simplicity if you can assure a basic mutual base , and character set , say ascii , then sending streams that are easily recognizable by the other side is not so difficult , but this requires that it has little to no compression or other algorithms , it would still be a stream of a video but instead of compressed it would be actually inflated . I am talking about a stream of x by y squares of ascii characters , that can be put together to form a video if briefly investigated . IF the video has characteristics of continuous frames and or frames for synchronisation . http : //www.romanm.ch/ascii-movies without 2 directional feed for resending data ( like the protocols the internet uses ) , assuming losses , each frame would benefit from a constant signature or logo for attempting recalibrating of losses ( actually if it is time stable it may be unneeded but still may be beneficial in some cases ) notice that datastream over radio will send individual bits instead of bytes so that will be even more difficult than having a byte feed . given your comment you may want to consider several streams the most basic describing the structure of the one more advanced . **question : do the civilizations have common past , common science , language , letters , order of letters in alphabets , number system , same base number system , same symbols for numbers and letters and mathematics , artistic wording structure ( haiku poems for example ) , etc ? do they have similar technology , are there computers on both ? ** instead of codec/digital , analog transmission may be even preferred because each more advanced set of standard requires the ones below to be known and common . theoretically assuming no issue with losses , a very fast and clear stream of pulses that can be interpreted as 0/1 may be decoded into usable data such as video if investigated , this assumes the base of communication is non existent and the intention is for the transmission to be decodeable with no / minimal ( initially ) compression . **A very clear source of electromagnetic pulses could be decoded , if the frequency was distinct/known/visible and if the stream was slow enough for the decoding system and fast enough to provide valuable transmission , but this isnt codec as we know it and perhaps no underlying subsystem , this could be interpreted as a b/w video feed** As far as I know , even visible light may be preferable over RF . This communication thing gets very complex very quickly if the two parts have little in common . Codecs add a HUGE amount of complexity to the stream . And it assumes it must first even be visible , if like earth computers it would require a bit/byte structure to be common to both worlds . And as it is used on earth , and digitally it would require many many underlying bitrates to be able to achieve that . disregard the rest . Im now fascinated by this subject . There are so many variables , one must assume a base for common communication , for example if this is ascii , this can give a structure that is obviously visible in 2d if decoded properly but again this is not compressed at all in fact inflated , so it would require a much higher bitrate and long distance requires lower . /_/\ / /\ \ / / /\ \ / / /\ \ \ / /_/__\ \ \ /_/______\_\/\ \_\_________\/ would be like /_/\ / /\ \ / / /\ \ / / /\ \ \ / /_/__\ \ \ /_/______\_\/\ \_\_________\/ but as said this requires ascii being known/ achieved . but most pure digital ascii transmissions on earth are based on systems that have 2 way error correction which requires underlying systems and 2 way communication .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,darknetplan,"we need to separate the real content from the formatting and other overheads like javascript , scripts and excessive html / css",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,darknetplan,"1 M users creating 1k letters makes 1 GB new content uncompressed , yes there is normally no way to keep up with all new generated content anyway , just like a 2.4 kb/s internet connection should be enough for most humans as that makes already ( 5letters+space ) 400 words per second . But one could have a offline copy of the generated internet minus all the extras , including litterature , it can include simple svg graphics for informational purposes perhaps on websites like wikipedia for example . I believe the Internet is very much smaller in reality when you remove all uninteresting websites and unessential content , graphics , sound and video media . And many sites just generate webpages for the sake of it . I dont think a copy of ebay would be needed in this system right ? I think we can start right away with building an essential library that can be put in drives with different capacities where the users can select themselves their starting capacity ie 64 gb / 128+ gb etc , and at the same time demand all sites give an alterEnglish fetching system like accessing raw relevant data , like m.wikipedia site gives a minimum page but even less then that alterEnglishly we can change it with scripts . I disregard email , any realtime interactivity ( unless syncing ) , practically all graphics ( except svg ) , all music ( except midi ) , all spam sites link farms and empty sites , and all the web must be reduced until the bare minimum is left . Instead we 'd have a system that can carry the rest . Basic messaging may be added later but skipping that initially will make it faster . I cant give numbers because it is difficult calculating , me giving any is very speculative . when reducing a 1 gb site it may end up as 1 kb perhaps , when disregarding what I listed . Adding the entire net , including pictures and all media indiscriminately is unfeasibly I believe many sites generate graphics all the time and many may simply be duplicating",Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,darknetplan,"With current capacities I think users need subscribing and selecting what they want and need in their drives , spare space can be filled with the rest . If we can agree that each site is reduced and just text and basic very simple html remains , Im speculating , perhaps 1M sites can be fit in 1 TB drive ... apparently now `` The average web page is 2.4 megabyte big and has over 200 requests .

1980sumthing,solipsism,names put boundaries it is only in your nameless self we are one .,Turkic,Turkish
1980sumthing,darknetplan,"I see , I think primarily a library must be created , if it is less than say a 64gb drive then there isnt an issue , if all drives are 64 gb . The syncing manually can be with regular wireless mechanisms in handheld devices and simple script , the db can be a filelist , and a large dir with text files ( practically all files may be ascii text , html txt svg files except perhaps the midi ) the db can have a each file 's checksum and check that against the net 's db when available . This isnt difficult in making either , managing the library and gathering the relevant data is what may take time , and in the future accessing sites ' text data directly will help naturally , and that needs persuasion skills . this type sneakernet may be perhaps different but I think 2 sync mechanisms are needed . If a sneakernet with many capacities and they meet they will simply sync what they can and skip the rest , the largest disks carrying the entire library .",Turkic,Turkish
