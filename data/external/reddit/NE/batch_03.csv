100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough . But when an entire coal pit closes , and hundreds of people loose their main source of income all at once , the town wo n't recover for generations .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Those that sympathized with DPRK would have aided the North in its attempts to conquer the South . 3 .

100100145,syriancivilwar,The reason why the war there was ended as quickly as it did is largely because both sides there fought ( mostly ) competently . In the Syrian conflict on the other hand the most we armed side is absolutely unable to conduct even the most basic operations . If Syrian government was able to do something as fundamental as maintaining a tight siege the war would have been over by now . But as it stands now the Ghouta pocket seems quite well supplied . In that sense the experience and knowledge the Ukrainian army got from that war is probably more valuable than whatever the various Syrian paramilitaries got from the five years of civil war .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; There was no will to continue the fighting in any meaningful way . There was . The reason why the fighting reached stopped was because it became abundantly clear both sides were unable to achieve their aims . By the end of the summer of 2014 it had became clear that at the present moment the Russian government had no ability to create a Russian state in the Ukrainian south and east and if such state were to be created it would probably collapse in less than a year taking the Russian government with it . By the end of the autumn of that same year it became clear the Ukrainian government could n't retake the areas the separatists already controlled because the Russian military would deploy their full forces if they tried ( and of course the gain from retaking those regions has always been questionable ) . & gt ; There are tons of operations done successfully but I think you are minimizing the situation . You 're right . Sorry for exaggerating . & gt ; 1 they do n't have the man power because of the reasons I stated to hold a full seige for an effective amount of time and still tend to all their fronts while maintaining multiple offensives . IS is fighting more opponents than the Syrian government , yet they somehow maintain the siege on Deir ez-Zor . & gt ; The second issue is that there is just to much lucrutive black market deals going on in Ghouta I 'm sure it is looked the other way because of the amount of money involved , difficulities combating the black market , corruption , and the need not to piss off his local population further . Ghouta need only be contained for now . Also I fail to see how failing to deal with a pocket that undoubtedly ties in a non-trivial amount of troops helps one to deal with his manpower shortages . Well , here it is . The Syrian government is not capable of conducting a siege because of it 's own corruption and incompetence . And pissing off the local population is no excuse . If they wanted they could have blocked all supplies apart from basic necessities . The rebels there would have still surrendered because of lack of munitions . You see my point is that the length and intensity of a conflict is rarely proportional to the skill with which it has been fought . In modern wars rarely drag on for very long unless the major adversaries in it fight in a defective manner . And there is much more military skill to be gained from fighting against skilled opponent with good soldiers and officers as compared to fighting against poor soldiers led by poor officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , on one hand you are right , that the treaty 's common name seems to be the `` Dual Alliance '' .

The full text of the treaty is available [ here ] ( http : //www.firstworldwar.com/source/dualalliance.htm ) . The relevat part is : & gt ; Should , contrary to their hope , and against the loyal desire of the two High Contracting Parties , one of the two Empires be attacked by Russia the High Contracting Parties are bound to come to the assistance one of the other with the whole war strength of their Empires ...

So the situation is completely unrelated to the present one at hand . I guess you are right . I should have looked into the situation more carefully . Though I still maintain that the main reason why Germany went to war was it 's obligations to Australia . & gt ; Oh and the text of the alliance mentions other great powers as well : It says that the parties should maintain benevolent neutrality in case one of them was attacked by a country different from Russia .

If the president wanted to go somewhere dangerous he 'd simply be told `` You ca n't go there . '' rather than be able to rely on his guards being able to secure the area and make it safe .

Every attempt to force them to tow a line trough threats and force in the last 30 years , be it by Iran , Iraq or anyone else has been met with nothing but backslash and escalating hostilities .

From what I gather the computer game `` King of Dragon Pass '' where the peasants could n't marry without the approval of the clan 's government is a pretty accurate representation of bronze age society . On the other hand once capital starts to accumulate the inherent limitations of collectivist systems become intolerable as wealth increases . Living in submission to a higher goal and forcing others to do so is not something most people would do if they did n't think it was needed for the good of the family/nation/race/humanity .

The reason these different groups are included in the decision making is to ensure as much pertinent information as possible is available when decision , such as the chip fabricator are decided on . They groups would have the same goal , yet different information , such as the elected consumers would have the information on demand for the projects . The supplier and would have the information on the necessary resources , and labor .

Why would an economic democracy behave differently ? & gt ; The effects of most decisions would be almost negligible .

The most successful guy in finance is Warren Buffet who advises to ignore all economic factors . In this case Mr. Thiel has completely failed to consider that businesses compete for investor 's money . No bank , nor fund , nor a rational person , will ever buy a 5 % bond over a 7 % one ( assuming both issues are equally sound ) . Nobody in their right mind would buy a share with P/E of 20 over a 10 ( assuming similar growth prospects/soundness of business ) . Businesses that fail to provide adequate return on investment wo n't be able to raise the money needed to keep up with the competition and would eventually be given over to some corporate raider to liquidate if that continues . Competition for customers will be moderated by competition for capital . This guarantees that capital gets accumulated and companies ( as well as investors ) have the money to innovate and try new things .

Of course that ca n't continue forever . And when the system collapses the capital base would already be exhausted and unable to maintain the same quality of life as in the good old days , at least for a good while , even under a new system that does n't suffer from the contradictions of the old one .

By end of Brezhnev 's reign such claims no longer seemed plausible and by the time Gorbachev came into power it was clear to everyone that communism could n't last much longer .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Many regimes have been criticized for engaging in campaigns of brutal suppression against communists and communist sympathizers . From as far right as Chilean dictator Pinochet to as far left as the German social democrats , many regimes have found it necessary to suppress and sometimes even cull their communists , under the pretext that if communists were to take power many more would die . Among the left of center commentariat , the cruel logic behind such actions is either roundly criticized or outright rejected as intellectually dishonest and self serving . ( This in stark contrast to left wing governments which do quite often consider communists a grave danger to the interests of the working class . ) Yet there is one such regime seems to be largely forgotten . South Korean ( semi- ) autocrat Syngman Rhee suppressed communists with extreme prejudice , first sending them to gulags and then killing them when DPRK forces were about to liberate those camps . Estimates of the death toll put it at 100000 to 200000 . But we all know what he was fighting against . Even conservative estimates of state killings in North Korea are usually above 200000 for a mere decade or less . No one can deny that the South Korean proletariat lives much better than the workers in the North . Given all that , the question arises , as to your opinions on the actions of President Rhee . The Northern state is , from what I 've heard , not considered socialist , but rather closer to fascism . Yet it is certain that the Southern communists would have aided this fascist regime in its numerous attempts to conquer the peninsula . Reunification was , after all , one of the goals of the South Korean Workers Party . So was their destruction justified or not ? Or were those agents of fascism that marched under the red banner somehow different than the ones that marched under the swastika ? Perhaps one could argue that the amount of people killed was too large or that mass killing as a method is counter productive , but would n't that be a tacit admission that slaying South Korea 's communists would have been ethically sound and in the interests of the proletariat , if it were an effective suppression measure ? And if you were to say that Rhee 's actions were justified , questions arise about all those other regimes in the history of the world . Was Pinochet wrong ? Should the Social Democrats have murdered Rosa Luxembourg ? Was the CIA justified in overthrowing what could very well have been another fascist regime hiding under the red flag ? The CIA is a spy agency after all , they should recognize a fascist tendency in a government even before it is known to the general public , should n't they ?

Thus we can assume that an economic system can only be designed so that it 's levels of production follow some probability distribution . But if the expected value of production is the exact amount society needs , you 'd suffer from occasional bouts of underproduction . It would mean that every crop blight starves some people . Thus in order to ensure that people are supplied with necessities a system should produce more than it needs . Hence why , for example every year the EU collects and throws away mountains of tomatoes . An argument could be made that luxuries are different , but the distinction between necessities and luxuries is rather arbitrary . Motor vehicles are vital necessities in some parts of the world and luxuries in others . There were points in history where a diet with enough calories to sustain an adult would be considered a luxury .

One important limitation of the above studies is that they have focused on short-term exchanges of meat for sex ( i.e . within the estrous phase of the female ) .

Say a 90 % of the workers in a car-making cooperative want to revamp the entire production line to make electric vehicles and 10 % believe that this is a fool 's errand which will bring bankruptcy to the cooperative . As the car industry is capital intensive a significant amount of the worker 's wealth will be their share of the cooperative . Those 10 % ca n't leave for a cooperative that believes in the future of internal combustion without major disturbances to their personal lives . Suppose the 10 % ca n't be persuaded in the future of electric propulsion and are willing to strike to prevent their cooperative from behaving in what they believe is a self-destructive manner , bringing production to a virtual standstill . It 's their wealth that 's tied into the cooperative 's capital after all . Then the only equitable way to remedy the situation is to separate ownership of the entity from employment by it . So , cooperatives are n't viable in sectors that require high capital expenditure like most manufacturing . Other sectors may have different reasons to avoid the cooperative form of ownership , but this is one of the most significant . There 's also the matter that wealth from those sectors would start pouring into the rest of the economy in order to aid companies in expanding . The 10 % , having sold their shares , would want to put their money in something . For obvious reasons wealth is not going to pour into cooperatives but into limited companies .

Then I tried to point out that cooperatives are incapable of attracting investments from the sectors dominated by limited companies , since they ca n't sell equity . ( Whereas , as one can easily note a limited company would not have any problems attracting investments from a cooperative . ) Thus the superiority of joint stock companies in certain sectors of the economy would by necessity translate into the dominance of joint stock companies not only in those sectors , but also in most of the rest of the economy . ( In fact it would mean that joint stock companies would dominate all sectors of the economy where output can be improved by injecting capital . ) I 'm sorry if any part of that was unclear . Also are you under the impression I somehow believe in socialism ? Sure , the question is addressed to socialists , but most other people who answer are n't socialists .

Thus every intervention is a trade off between multiple undesirable outcomes . ( Take for example deposit insurance regulations . It ensures that ordinary people do n't loose their money , but also makes them more likely to put their money in a bank that behaves recklessly . ) Add to that Lucas ' argument as to why policies ' economic effects are n't really predictable and you can see why many believe that economic policy should be `` Do n't touch the damn thing ! `` .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

The crux of it is that while 2 variables may be correlated , an economic policy that uses the knowledge of that correlation may destroy it in its attempts to exploit it . To quote Calaghan on the correlation between inflation and unemployment which is quite important in Keynes ' economics : & gt ; `` We used to think you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by boosting government spending , I tell you , in all candour that that option no longer exists . And in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion… by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step… ” In general people are n't stupid and if they figure out the government will raise inflation they are going to demand higher wages , making the inflation raise ineffective at lowering unemployment . Likewise any economic theory that does n't base it 's sweeping observations on the study of small scale economic interactions ca n't survive prolonged contact with reality . It should be obvious how Lucas ' critique lead to more advocacy for more laissez-faire . As 30 years of economic theory were proven to be wrong , lots of people thought that we do n't have good enough understanding of an economy to conduct beneficial government interventions . Who knows what would people be saying in 30 years about current theories , after all ?

Calaghan ( hardly a proponent of laissez-faire ) admitting that this theory no longer works , I can give you the American [ misery index ] ( https : //inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/ ) .

These days inflation targets are low and boring . Thus under current FED policy we have a Philips Curve . When inflation targets were higher and more interesting workers and more importantly union bosses would actually start looking at them and the Philips Curve will disappear . And even if workers were illiterate brutes who could n't read the inflation targets , they 'd have to notice that prices are rising considerably and they can no longer afford to live as well as they did before .

Whether government 's are naturally inclined or disinclined to choosing to listen to surplus value believers is irrelevant to my argument . My point is entirely based on what happens once a capitalist country acquires a government that is inclined to listen to surplus value believers .

You deserve to loose if you make strategic errors , not when you fail to prevent your enemy from making strategic errors .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , from what I can remember of my knowledge of the First World War even trenches are an effective enough method to deal with artillery . Another effective strategy would be deploying only very few troops on front lines . When fighting an intelligent opponent ca n't always rely on the textbook solution for everything he throws at you . Military commanders should thus be aware of multiple ways of dealing with a problem and apply the one that is appropriate . If the rebels ' dealt with the government 's artillery the same way the government deals with the rebels ' ATGMs , the war would have been over by now .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Do you really think that is because of popular support rather than due to conscription ? Need I remind that the government 's forces have recently suffered from several major routs , and they do have always suffered from a significant rate of defection and desertion .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"And what happens if the government wins ? Do you really believe Bashar al Assad is the man who can lead Syria out of the ashes and into stability ?

100100145,syriancivilwar,You made a post with the exact same arguments as a post of mine 4 minutes after I posted it .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Can Assad do that ?,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I find both assassination and coup extremely unlikely possibilities , since in both cases the perpetrators would have to be people that owe their privileges and positions in society to Assad . Most of them stand to loose both if he were to be removed , in many cases simply because no other leader would tolerate their incompetence . Thus they probably wo n't act against him until defeat is imminent . Furthermore both Russia and Iran are likely to obstruct a removal of the President rather facilitate it . You see , war devastated Syria is likely to need a lot of money to recover from the war . Thus a different Syrian leader might succumb to the temptations of the famously wealthy land of the House of Saud and the practically limitless wealth of the free world . As for the terrorists , if the object of their hatred was removed and the policies that caused it were to stop , I think there is hope . If nothing else it will stop the number of terrorists from growing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , the government controls by far the largest share of Syria 's population , yet it suffers from a well pronounced lack of reliable soldiers . This would imply that most of the population in government controlled areas is hostile or at least unsupportive to it . By contrast both the various rebel militias and the Islamic State control very little population , but do n't seem to lack men willing to risk and even sacrifice their lives in the name of the faction that they join . I do think that strongly suggests both the various rebel groups and IS are more popular than the government . As for the rebels being split into a multitude of separate groups , each with its own political designs , I 'm want to remind you that the Solidarity Citizen 's Committee was a quite disorganized political group , that consisted of people with many different ideologies , united only by their desire to see the communists gone . It still won elections by a landslide . EDIT : Clarified some things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,I do n't think that many support the government 's enemies . They just could n't care less about a government that could n't care less about them .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't know . Should n't government soldiers believe they are fighting for their lives and families ? At least when they are fighting something like the Islamic State ? That should be a good motivation . Furthermore the Nazi Volkssturm never had problems with making heroic last stands . The Red army never had problems fighting in far worse conditions and with far worse survival rate than the government 's troops now . And in the first world War nobody had problems recruiting pilots in spite of the ridiculously low life expectancy . I do believe people in general are quite willing to sacrifice their lives for their countries , it 's just that nobody would want to sacrifice himself on the altar of his superiors ' incompetence . Thus I strongly suspect if the commander in chief of the SAA was someone people believed in , the government 's manpower/soldier quality issues would go away . They control by far the largest share of the country 's population , surely they would be capable of finding enough decent soldiers . Edit : Fixed some unclear stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , as to the point about about islamism see my other reply to that other post . History is full of examples of men throwing away their lives for secular causes with the same lack of concern for themselves as suicide bombers . All that is needed is a cause soldiers would believe in and trust in their high command . Those things are , I think we can both agree , severely lacking in Syria , and nobody is going to really support a government he mistrusts . And if a government is going to allow corruption and nepotism to propagate in something as critical to its survival as the military , do n't you think the other spheres of government activity would be affected as well ? How do you think a corrupt and incompetent police , secret police , agricultural authority , industrial regulator , health services , regional authorities , etc . would affect civilian morale ? & gt ; EDIT : to be honest I had no idea what the solidarity citizens committee was , but a quick wikipedia read mentioned that the committee did n't even last a year ? That is precisely where I was going . Even if separate groups have different ideologies , they can be very popular together when they defend a common popular cause . I do n't think most people that support JaN would go home , if the group were destroyed . They would just join another one . Thus it is not meaningless to talk about support for the rebels , in spite of the fact that `` rebels '' is a category rather than a coherent group . Edit : I 'm bad at grammar .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It seems it is necessary to repeat myself . They `` fight '' for the government because they were forced to . SAA conscripts are directly forced into the armed forces . NDF volunteers are often indirectly forced into the armed forces by the threat of becoming SAA conscripts . That is why many of them desert at the first sign of trouble rathet than fight , just like SAA conscripts .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , if the only reason someone lives in government territory is that rebel territory has been ruined , in a large part because of a deliberate government policy , I might add , can he be said to support the government ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is n't the NDF one of the best ways to avoid fighting for the government , though ? If you live in a relatively safe area and join the NDF , you 'd be patrolling the streets , rather than dying on some distant front . I do n't think we have any reason to believe NDF members are more committed to fighting for the government than the SAA 's rank and file . As far as I can see , they get routed just as easily . And further while the rate of defections might have slowed , I do n't think the rate of desertion has slowed down significantly . Furthermore , seeing how the armed forces have recently suffered a rout on 2 separate fronts , I do n't really see any indication that the government 's soldiers , both SAA and NDF , are willing to fight and risk death in the name of the president .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

And beyond that the criticism in the article just feels weak . The whole tone is like `` Ha ha , Corbyn '' rather than `` Corbyn is terrible and here is why '' .

100100145,syriancivilwar,It could but would it be better to ensure it becomes a big mistake rather than to stop them from entering the conflict altogether ? As I see it now it 's easier to ensure the Russian intervention goes badly rather than to stop it altogether .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"For one you could make sure that everybody hears about the intervention . That way when IS or JaN suffers a defeat , it could lead to terror attacks in Russia . This is quite likely to force the Russian government to escalate it 's involvement beyond the point it would be comfortable with . Beyond that the coalition could make it clear that it 's bombing campaign will no longer interfere with IS operations against the Syrian Government , as now the government can rely on Russian air support . This is likely to turn ugly very quickly as al Baghdadi directs his entire strength in the SAA 's direction . And finally if the Russian government has provided the separatist forces in Ukraine with a certain level of support , the allies of certain rebel groups wo n't have much issue , at least diplomatically , with providing them a similar level of support as well . And even a lower level of support could do a lot to counteract the effects of the Russian involvement . Those are of course clearly just some propositions I thought of just now . There are probably even more subtle as well as even more effective methods to make sure the Russians suffer the costs of their actions .

Cutting diplomatic ties is just pointless and military force is unnecessary , considering that the events in Ukraine are currently developing in a favorable direction . As of now the only result of the Russian intervention in Ukraine is that most of the pro-Russian population in that country has been practically quarantined , while the Russian economy has become much more vulnerable , since even though the sanctions might have been weak on paper , they have proven sufficient to scare off western banks from giving loans to Russians .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , if I understand you correctly the main reason for the military conflict is that the Russian government wanted an ideological conflict between the Russian and Ukrainian people . Interesting perspective and also probably correct to a significant degree , though I do think there is some evidence to suggest that it is not the main reason for the whole affair . For example Putin would have never used term Novorussia unless he was preparing for conquest . And Alexander Dugin 's infamous textbook for the Russian Geneal Staff Academy advocates the destruction of Ukraine trough splitting the country , as well as the style of warfare that is now often called `` hybrid '' . I 'd say they genuinely wanted to succeed and seize half of the country , but feared that a full scale invasion and a subsequent occupation would end pretty badly , and thus relied on the `` hybrid '' strategy .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is the Iranian military structured differently than the SAA ? They both have a large conscript army , and a smaller `` pretorian '' corps that tends to receive far more attention and resources from the government somewhat to the detriment of the conventional army . While Iran has n't been engaged in major conflicts in recent history from I do remember troops commanded by the IRCG being deployed in Syria a some months ago . Back then their commanders did show the same lack of regard for the lives of the men under their command that the SAA is known for . While I do n't doubt the Iranian armed forces are much better than the Syrian , I suspect it might not be because they lack the problems the SAA suffers from , but because they have them but to a far , far lesser degree . Thus I 'm not sure if Iran could really help with an army restructuring .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"There is a doctrine of international law called odious debt , that allows for the nullification of debts by dictatorial regimes .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"I 'm certain the Iranian armed forces are much better than the SAA . What I 'm things is that they might suffer from the same problems , it 's just that they are far more pronounced in the SAA . Think of the way Saudi Arabia got it 's over reliance on air power from the US though the US is far less reliant on the air than KSA is . Even most of the SAA 's problems have a lot to do with the Syrian military being set up with a lot of soviet aid , even though the Soviet command structure has never been as top heavy and inflexible as the SAA . Edit : Fixed the mistake in the last sentence .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see . I assumed that just because the structure of the armed forces is similar they have to work similarly , but the more I think about it the more I see I 'm wrong . Since the Iranian government is far more accoutable to it 's people and Iran is n't very rich the military is probably underfunded while the Syrian is overfunded . And overfunding leads to overstaffing at the top , while underfunding helps keep it under control ( from my experience with large organisations it rarely leads to understaffing ) . Though I still think they suffer at least from some of the same `` dictatorial army '' problems . Iran is no dictatorship but de facto the only thing stopping the supreme leader from becoming an absolute tyrant is tradition . And while tradition is a powerful force at least some features of the autocratic system will be present across the state .

As for Iraq , I feel Maliki 's ousting had far more to do with his extreme military failure . Calls for his removal were first issued in Iraq and then echoed in Iran as it became obvious he could n't remain a prime minister . To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders , but then again Yankovic did n't follow Russian orders either . Instead his associates describe Moscow 's men making their way to his inner circle , driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him . Or it could be something even more innocent , like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"200,000 Syrians are in the army . How many of them fight and how many desert at the first opportunity is debatable .

So , as you can see even those arguments , that you think are totally unreasonable , might be based on a reasonable line of logic .

The area around the city is mostly open desert , where they would be at a major disadvantage , against a conventional army with airplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , `` state terrorism '' exists as a term . Whether the government engages in it , if it does to what degree , and how important is it for the government are all open to debate . And I do n't think the view that state terror is critical for the survival of the government , or at least the government in its present form , is absolutely devoid of arguments in its favor . Again , it could be wrong , but it ca n't be just be dismissed , it has to be proven wrong . Furthermore , if someone makes an argument that seems to you weird , bizarre or totally wrong , ask him about it . If his position is totally without merit , this shall become self-evident .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"From what I 've seen , my impression is that IS never really tries to defend what they ca n't defend . Rather , to keep the narrative , when they loose something important , they quickly capture something else instead . For example their force in Tikrit did n't seem to me as one built to repel the Iraqi forces converging on the city , but rather as one built to delay them . Yet after they lost Tikrit they captured Ramadi and Palmyra , and thus the narrative was kept intact . Now I think they have some chance of defending the city , so they will try to defend it . Also one should keep in mind that though IS 's lack of concern about it 's soldiers ' lives makes it seem otherwise , the organization is quite flexible strategically , thus meaning a general rule about what they do ca n't be true all the time .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed it did n't . My point is not that the lack of defensible terrain around the city makes it easier to defend . After all common sense dictates rather the opposite is true . I instead claim that , because of the terrain any attacker would be capable of reaching the city , since the defender 's best strategy would be not to resist an offensive to a significant degree , until the city itself . So IS 's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself . This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed . Thus being 3.5 km away from the city does n't mean much . The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided . As I mentioned so far it proceeds as SAA planers would want ( and expect ) it to proceed , yet it probably proceeds as IS planners would expect it to , as well . Edit : Fixed the repetition in the last sentence .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , keep in mind that the strategy I described would have been adopted ( if indeed this is the actual strategy of the IS ) because coalition air power would mean IS would not be able to use large concentrations of troops in battle .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , looking at the Donbass war , I feel like every Ukrainian or separatist brigade and artillery battery has like 10 drones with it , most of them bought by fundraisers , so they ca n't be that expensive . And even if aerial reconnaissance is out of the question , would n't ground based one work as well ? I assume a group large enough to capture tens of soldiers would be large enough to be visible .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see , you are right . I still do n't see why the SAA does n't use more drones , since they seem quite an artillery heavy military , though I suspect that this question belongs to a dumb question thread more than it belongs here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't see how a guy 's beliefs damage his credibility . Who is to say it 's not his experience in the air force that turned him against the government ?

Yet there would be no civil war , especially a civil war as brutal as this one , if he was n't utterly hated by another part . Almost by necessity those 2 parts of the population must have been treated in a vastly different manner . And need I mention , there have been very few Alawi rebels .

Also I doubt the blame for turning this into an ( kinda ) existential war for Alawites and other loyal demographics , can be said to rest entirely with the rebels .

Having little military experience I have no idea how it balances out . I think the actual reason might be in the last point you make .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Yeah there is . Counter-propaganda . All it would take is one tech-savvy guy with a laptop connecting to some wifi in Olgino and spamming a few hundreds/thousands searches for `` reddit '' . It would n't take too much of an effort really , seeing how Reddit is not terribly popular in Russia anyway - even /russia has only 16,497 followers . Generally , english language social websistes are incomparably less popular that domestic ( russian ) alterEnglishs , such as vk.com to facebook Not really . Google does tend to notice attempts at manipulation does it not . It 's not like advertisers do n't try to manipulate google to make their products look more popular .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Those are two different things . You are probably thinking about manipulating adsense ads or something . You ca n't have it both ways - paid trolls operating from a office in Olgino boosting the ranking of a search term , and discounting the option of someone doing counter propaganda from the same area . All I 'm saying is that if google data was manipulated , it would probably require a greater level of sophistication than some guy with a laptop running some kind of script . It is reasonable to assume it would require the kind of internet service used by a medium sized or maybe large business for example . At this point you begin to wonder whether the whole effort do discredit Russia is n't too risky and too costly to be really worth it . & gt ; If paid trolls do exist , I would tend to argue that both sides cancel each other out . Not really , the ones with more resources at their disposal would be more noticeable , would n't they ? And considering that Russia is known to spend much more money on propaganda than Western countries ( There are no less than 20 national TV channels in Russia controlled by the government . ) , I 'd say Russian ones are quite likely to amongst the best funded out there , would n't you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Why not ? It 's supposedly an organisation that houses hundreds of people , is it not ? It 's not like someone would go to Olgino and hire hundreds of people in a plot to discredit Russia . & gt ; Nah . Search queries are not bandwidth intensive , on the contrary . Still , I assume you are going to need some amount other traffic in order to impersonate a lot of people . And the question remains , why has n't the Russian government or anyone in Russia uncovered this plot to discredit the country . You 'd expect they 'd someone in their security services to uncover such a needlessly complex and expensive plot to discredit their already unpopular country . & gt ; As I have shown , western trolling campaign is being conducted even by the official military units . Knowing the huge discrepancy between Russian and western military budgets it is the West that has the upper hand by a wide margin . Once again , even the Russian military puts much more importance on propaganda than western military . The Russian defence military has it 's own television channel . Neither the American nor British not French military have the same thing . It is reasonable to assume that those that put great importance on propaganda , will spend much more on it , compared to those that value it far less . & gt ; Also besides direct media ownership you should be counting in the the myriad of non-governmental organizations and projects funded by the West , as it is a form of propaganda as well .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I do n't think that impersonating an organisation with hundreds of people on its payroll is a simple task . It would require an effort large enough to be noticed . And it that is what had really happened , at least someone in Russia would have noticed . Since plotting to make it look like the Russian government hires internet trolls ( trough some company in St. Peter in that case ) is a plot to discredit Russia , regardless of what you say , someone in the Russian counter-intelligence would have done something about it . And once again , there is no reason why anyone in the west spend so much effort , and risk so much on a harebrained plot to discredit Russia . It 's already a highly unpopular country in most of the world . Most of the countries where Russia is popular are autocracies or oligarchies anyway , and popular opinion in those kinds of countries does n't really matter . And there is nothing you can say to convince me , or most reasonable people at that , that the country where the government controls 20 TV channels , including most of the major ones , spends less on propaganda than countries where most TV channels are private . The american military might have made a game , or hired a sports team , the Russian military , apart from maintaining the TV channel I mentioned , organises massive annual parades , and events like Tank Biathlons , designed to promote it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As far as I can remember , the Houthis have been loosing territory and cities , have they not ? & gt ; What is more likely to happen , even if KSA really starts shipping in heavy weapons , is that RuAF will simply have a more target rich environment . Because Russian airplanes are practically invincible to air defense , are they not ?

If NATO countries do nothing in a war between Russia and Turkey ( so long as the war escalates to the point where Russia counterattacks on Turkish soil ) , do n't you think that every headline of every newspaper in the western world would consist of nothing but sardonic puns on `` Peace of our time '' ? Let us be honest here , the only reason why we have n't seen a major western military engagement recently is because the Western world has so far been , strategically , on the offensive ( an extremely imprecise term , but unfortunately I can think of no better ) , in both Syria and Ukraine , with all of Russia 's recent actions being a reaction against pro-Russian governments collapsing or being at risk of collapse .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Here are the main problems with that . In order to achieve a lasting peace , the current Syrian government ( or any Syrian government that has come as the result of a `` reform '' of the present one ) would need large scale , persistent economic and military aid , provided over an exceedingly long period of time . Thus if FSA commanders have any reason to doubt that foreign support for the government will continue for the next say 10 years of conflict and recovery they are better of continuing their resistance . Throwing one 's lot with Bashar , a peacetime leader whose only major achievement is plunging his country in a civil war and a wartime leader under whose command the Army has required persistently larger foreign support , is just too risky . To put it simply , supporting the current Syrian government is to bet your and your family 's life on Iran , and now Russia being always there to help the Syrian army . As a corollary to that the Al-Nursa Front is far more valuable of an ally . While outside governments dislike that organization , it does n't depend on the fickle support of foreigners for its continued existence . Finally , there is no reason why the Coalition should support the Syrian government . The word terrorists does not make all the major rules of strategy and policy invalid . As of now Russia , Iran and Hezbollah are fighting those terrorists . Since the coalition governments consider Russia , Iran and Hezbollah enemies and in case of the last one terrorists , there is no reason why the coalition should try to end the fight between their major enemies . It is far better to let them fight each other and sap each other 's strength .

100100145,ukpolitics,"Then , do you think a society should sacrifice it 's ability to advance in order to increase social mobility ? Because high inheritance tax will only encourage old people to spend money on luxuries ( and probably tax avoidance schemes as well ) rather than invest .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; That 's not society sacrificing it 's ability to advance , it 's the rich sacrificing their ability to give unfair benefits to their lineage . The economy of the country is not a game . It 's the source of the people 's quality of life . Efforts to make it fair should not lower the standard of life it provides to all people , from the poorest to the richest . & gt ; Personally , I believe the elderly should be free to enjoy themselves rather than be so focused on making life easy for their family . We also have an economy based on spending , it 's not a problem if they spend on luxuries instead . When a company receives money from investment it spends them mostly to research and develop a new product , usually a product for the lower strata in a society . When a person buys a luxury product he only benefits himself and the usually quite few people that made the product . It 's also a matter of what we value as a society - would you rather we had a new line of microprocessors or some old guy had a yaht ? & gt ; If they did n't inherit it , they earned it , why should n't they enjoy it ? And why not have them give it to whomever they wish . & gt ; Also , people owning houses and passing them onto their children does ensure that there 's a gulf in society between those who 're lucky enough to have a home from their parents , and those whose parents were poor . Not really . A house is not that difficult thing to construct . Where I come from people would often build their own , sometimes just with the help of their families and extended families . Why would the poor have problems getting accommodation of their own ? & gt ; Tax avoidance is obviously going to happen , but refusing to do the right thing because of criminals is ridiculous , you just keep closing the loop holes . Because when you give people the choice of either loosing hundreds of thousands or becoming criminals the choice they are going to make is clear . And if you try to stop their criminal activities , they will simply offer a good part of the sum to your tax inspector , and he will make the same choice as well . & gt ; But anyway , this is just ideology . If you believe that your place in society should be entirely based upon your actions , you need inheritance tax . If you want people to be born into being rich , and never having to do anything themselves simply because of their luck to be born rich , and on the flip side with so much old money you accept the fact that those from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to succeed . If that 's fine with you , social mobility is n't for you . I 'd rather not sacrifice everyone 's quality of life to make everyone 's quality of life closer to everyone else 's quality of life , would you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; It 's hard to lower someone 's quality of life once they 're dead . I 'm talking about inheritance tax here , lol . Yes and my argument against inheritance taxes is that they affect the way old people employ their money , in a way that ultimately hurts everyone , though mostly the poor . & gt ; And then the yacht company buys metals , woods , and plastics . They all employ people down the chain , who then spend on other goods and so on . It 's a chain , and you 've got to keep the money moving . The more transactions the better , this is why deflation is so bad , once people feel products will be cheaper in the future they stop buying luxuries and hoarding cash and the economy grinds to a halt . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts , but it 's affected by it . And far more poor people will benefit from a rich guy spending money on shares , rather than yahts . & gt ; Because all land is owned , and if you 're lucky enough to own any land , permission is hard to get . If you go ahead and build something anyway councils then threaten to demolish it . We do n't have anywhere where someone can turn up with a positive attitude and a handful of tools , chop some wood and build a home . It 's against the law . Do n't you think that messing up with inheritance taxes is a poor substitute to addressing the actual issue . If permits are hard to get , there will be a housing shortage one way or another . If there is a housing shortage , quite a lot of people will be screwed up . If it 's not tenants paying exorbitant amount of money , it 's going to be people driven to homelessness because the new owners of the house , free from the burden of rent , have no incentive to share it with anyone else . The only way to deal with a housing shortage is to encourage the construction of more houses and that includes stuff like easing permits and allowing a procedure the legalization of illegal buildings . Where I come from , in some ( admittedly rare ) cases the municipality has been known to offer legalization of homes built on their property if people just agree to buy the land on which the home has been built , and at the ridiculously cheap rate of 0.61 euros per square meter at that . & gt ; Is n't corruption awesome ? It is not . It is a fact of life though , and if a policy of the government encourages corruption that has to be accounted for . & gt ; Yeah , fuck the poor . They should stay poor so that rich people can inherit everything they can from their families and never have to work . People should know their place in society and stay there . Well yeah , fuck the poor . Who cares if their lives get better ? Nah , they should be forced to live in pain and misery , just for the British people 's sadistic delight . As long as occasionally we force a rich guy to swap places with a poor one it 's all ethically OK ... Now do can we please refrain from making turning each other 's statements into a mockery of themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"That would be an unnecessarily aggressive course of action , but even that is not impossible . For example Russia might *bomb* the group participating in the train and equip program . If the whole thing has to be made more convincing to corpses are not that hard to acquire in a country in the middle of a civil war . Both NATO and the Arab countries posses significant numbers of soviet era aircraft , that could make a bombing run or two if that proves to be necessary . And of course there is the matter that the government of the Russian Federation has been screaming false flag left and right recently , so few will believe them . The times when the Syrian government bombed rebels that were fighting IS could be pointed out as well . If the whole thing is executed well enough Washington will be very outraged indeed at Russia deliberately sabotaging their efforts . Since the groups in the train and equip program were already forced to sign documents stating that they would not fight the Syrian government , only IS , there is no way to interpret Russia 's action but as a deliberate attempt to support the Islamic State , in the hope that this will help Assad politically . The American government will have no option but to declare that any Syrian or Russian military aircraft that enters or approaches rebel airspace could be shot down . If executed carefully and intelligently , there is no reason why the whole thing ca n't go as smoothly . But of course it 's probably not necessary to go that far . More subtle methods definitely exist as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

You see in general it 's the weak that have to fear escalation rather than the strong . Because escalation will only allow the strong to bring their might to bear against the weak .

It is extremely unlikely that those systems were not taken into account when designing their stealth aircraft . & gt ; Secondly , if you think Russians wo n't follow orders , you are delusional . The Russian army consists of conscripts and professional soldiers , not fanatics . They could follow suicidal orders , but they might choose not to . & gt ; Thirdly , even if the coalition wipes out this force which they wo n't , Russia can commit to a full ground invasion through and with Iran . Of course , right after they conquer the south Caucasus that is . As well as Iraq , as well . It 's not like Abadi is going to forget the reason why he is not fighting Islamic state armored and mechanized brigades . & gt ; Or they can just secretly pass a ballistic missile tech to NK putting the US under nuclear threat from NK .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's funny how Putin used to talk about Novorussia and how the South and East of Ukraine should n't really be part of that country . It 's funny how the Russian military academies have textbooks that say that Russia could not remain a great power if Ukraine continued to be an entity with its own independent desires . It 's funny how they recommended that Ukraine be divided into smaller states that Russia could control . And yet once it became clear that there is no way they could ever take and hold the South and East , once it became clear that the country could n't be divided , the goal of the Russian operations in Ukraine suddenly became much more limited . If you observe how the strategic situation has changed as a result of the Russian military intervention , you will see who won and who lost . Because now , with major parts of the pro-Russian population in Ukraine quarantined in the People 's Republics , the government in Kiev has never been more secure in its power , and could only be replaced by even more Russophobic forces . Now Russia has been effectively been cut of from Europe and it 's likely to remain so foe the forseeable future . Because now , Russia has a determined enemy right at its border , ready to use any moment of Russian weakness against Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I have to ask , given that back in the days Putin personally questioned why should the Ukrainian south and east be part of the country , do we have any evidence that he ever had such limited aims ? It 's interesting how goals can retroactively change , in order to make sure they were achieved successfully , is n't it ? And the whole using the Donbass to destabilize the country only makes sense if the Donbass was under government control . Now that it 's not pro-western forces are more secure in their power than they have ever been . Before the war the Donbass was , due to subsidies secured by the Party of Regions , a major drain on the Ukrainian budget . Nowadays Russia pays for it . The difference between annexing the region and splitting it away from the country is quite minimal . And I 've been hearing about the sanctions being lifted for the past 6 months . There is simply no reason for them to be lifted . They damage Russia and no one else . Finally , Russian pipelines being announced with a lot of fanfare happens quite often . Russian pipelines being built is a much more rare occurrence , to say the least . Another pipe being announced does n't indicate anything .

Even mildly hostile acts towards those 2 will require the approval of Congress , and I do n't see Obama getting that . The kind of air defense systems that could plausibly be captured are designed to be operated by conscripts . If the Russian paramilitaries in East Ukraine could operate a Buk TELAR then I do n't see why the Syrian rebels ca n't .

That group could appeal effectively to the party 's members , as compared to the party 's establishment , but failed to appeal to most of the party 's voters . The groups ability to win primaries and loose actual elections costed quite a few congressional seats to the Republicans . Recently Labour switched their system of selecting a leader from the rather complex system they had before to a primary election . The result is that Jeremy Corbyn won and the party establisment lost . And there is a lot in him that most Labour members are positive towards or do n't care about , that will evoke an extremely negative reaction amongst the Labour electorate as well as the public at large .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"I 'm just going to note something . During the course of the civil war there were points when it was still possible for the Syrian government to win.Nowadays nobody seems to believe in that possibility . Even on this sub most supporters of the government 's hopes are directed towards somebody else winning the war for the government , first - Iraqi Shia militias , now it 's Russian troops . This is where the leadership of Bashar al-Assad has led his army , his supporters , his side in that war . In a normal country such a leader would have been removed for unsatisfactory performance and for good reason at that . In most wars both sides would be ready to do whatever it takes to bring them victory , and no foreign army could ever bring you a real one in a civil war . But the Syrian government seems to have greater priorities than that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"My Russian is not very good but I think I think I could give you the gist it . The soldiers refuse to fight unless given written orders as required by military law . The military prosecution refuses to answer inquiries by the Presidential Human Rights Council on that matter . They military prosecution has instead given the case to the FSB . The FSB is threatening the soldiers with convictions for felony . For one reason or another they avoid mentioning articles of the criminal code , but informally mention `` state treason '' .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I can understand the article the source of Gazeta seems to be the lawyer of the soldiers and officials from the Presidential Human Rights Council , rather than the soldiers themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Do you have a source for that ? A link to the articles in question ?,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see . But at least in the article , it 's the lawyer that describes the situation to the press , so I would guess someone connected to the case has already contacted him . Though it probably does not matter . Since the orders were given in clear violation of the law , the soldiers probably ca n't be charged for disclosing them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed , and the internet researchers have come with them . I just do n't think they were here before , or , if nothing else , at least they used way more subtle methods in their research .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The end of Bashar al-Assad probably wo n't be the end of fighting , but it 's likely to dramatically turn the government 's fortunes . If the president were to be removed in a tidy way ( like an military coup for example ) quite a significant amount of rebel fighters would probably stop fighting or defect to the government 's side . Furthermore the government will no longer be intensely hated by large sections of Syrian society , which is an important prerequisite to long-lasting peace in the country . More importantly , in order to secure victory , the government desperately needs to conduct an army reform , and an enormous amount of the measures the government has to undertake are obstructed by the mere existence of the current president . If he were to be removed the SAA would at least have the chance to become a decent fighting force . So Bashar al-Assad 's probably wo n't end the war , nor will it guarantee that the war ends at some point in the future , but at least it would create a way out of this mess . This would be quite a massive improvement as compared to the present situation . The SAA being destroyed , right now , on the other hand is more likely than not to lead to unpleasant situations . The SAA being destroyed over the course of multiple years , is a more complex matter .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,UkrainianConflict,"The thing is that special operations can hardly stop real armies , if it comes to that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Of course they might increase the amount of planes they send , but doing so will tie up quite a lot of resources . And Russia needs to have quite a lot of resources prepared to deal with potential emergencies on more important fronts , seeing how the Post-Soviet area is mostly filled with hostile countries awaiting the moment to strike and disloyal allies that have to be kept in line . Both could probably rely on powerful allies outside of the post-Soviet space , in case of hostilities with the Russian Federation . Because in spite of all the talk about the Western World abandoning friendly post-soviet countries , they have so far received all the help they needed . Military procurement plans have already been cut , so Russia ca n't afford to spend too much on large scale campaigns on faraway fronts . It is my strong belief that in order to have a lasting effect on the course of the war , the Russian military 's involvement will have to be continuous . Because of that , and because of everything I said above , I believe the Russian government will not be willing to direct significant amount of resources towards Syria 's battlefields .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Maybe , but if they `` deblocade '' it trough means of an armed attack , legally that would not be an armed attack against just Turkey .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,UkrainianConflict,"The thing is that times change far less than most people think . For example , ever since the mercenary armies of the Italian city states it has been well known that in professional armies the most prestigious part of the force has the tendency to swell to the point where it hurts the army 's ability in war .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russian tactical doctrines , unlike American ones , actually advocate putting helicopters in harm 's way , though . From what I undetstand in general Russian helicopter casualties have always been much higher than American ones in comparable conflicts .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The SAA is worse . In fact I 'm going to say that the Syrian Arab Republic is more corrupt and in general worse for its people as a regime than fascist Italy . Autocracies that proudly proclaim themselves as such are in generals much less corrupt as compared to autocracies that claim they are democratic . In that sense the Syrian state has more similarities with imperial Rome than with the dictatorships of the first half of the 20th century . It is certainly more unstable , worse economically , and more self destructive than any of the fascist states ever were , with the major exception of Germany . And it goes beyond mere personalities . Fascist Italy managed to depose Mussolini , the German generals made like 5 attempts on Hitler 's life , yet the SAA 's generals just stand by while Assad leads the SAA and the entire Syrian state to its doom .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Vietnam was a different terrain , had significantly larger population and most importantly communist forces there had a government that controlled territory and cities . It 's in no way comparable to any of the other wars your mention . And as you mention the US and their allies managed to incur less helicopter losses in 2 wars , than the Soviet Union in 1 .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Its kind of sad , really . Before the Russian support , the Syrian government looked like it might adopt a reasonably good defensive strategy , they even seemed to reach some kind of stalemate with Jaish al-Fateh in the Al-Ghab plain . But the moment they received foreign support , they reverted back to their usual ways .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"In Afghanistan there was an Afghan Military as well . And while the idea that the US should just support the South Vietnamese Army , rather than to fight the war on its own only gained traction when the Vietnam war was coming to a close , the idea that Soviet troops are there to assist and nothing more was an integral part of Soviet strategy in Afghanistan from the start .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russians may not have supplied MANPADs to the Taliban , but from what I understand at the point of the American invasion of Afghanistan such rockets were readily available in the region , which was not true during the Soviet invasion for the most part . And once again we are comparing 2 separate wars with just one . As for Vietnam , once again I 'm going to say that the conflict is not comparable Afghanistan . North Vietnam was a country with an actual army , armored troops and air force . In Afghanistan the USSR fought militias . The wars can not be compared .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If they really cared for that , they would have been ready to do whatever it takes to bring victory to the SAA . By now it should be obvious to everyone that the commander in chief is a massive liability . Yet no attempts to remove or kill him have been made . Yes , in event of a rebel victory there is a strong possibility of sectarian violence . But that is not going to be a problem for the SAA 's senior officers . Because sectarian violence is something that will happen to other people . High ranking officers and their families , meanwhile , will spend their time in comfort and luxury somewhere far away .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I remember the definition a republic is a state in which political power does not stem from the private matters of a single family . So any single form of government apart from hereditary autocracy . Thus the Syrian Arab Republic can not be called a republic , since it 's rule is in practice hereditary and autocratic . You are right though , contrasting autocracies and republics is incorrect . I should fix that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"There might not be another option I 'm afraid . In recent years Russian foreign policy has been driven more and more by populism . Because of that I believe that the Russian government is going to be extremely hesitant to undertake any action that may hurt it 's popularity . That limits the courses of action they may choose . Giving up now is n't going to be perceived well by the Russian public . `` It seems that the side in the civil war that we have been supporting for 4 years now as stalwarts of stability is actually incapable of fighting , so I guess we 'd have to give up . '' is a statement that could be very difficult to sell . If the Russian government does not step up its intervention and does not achieve any significant effects on the ground it risks looking weak , probably out of touch as well . So that is out of the question as well . So unless there is another option , it might be the case that picking up the SAA 's slack is the only way they can proceed from here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"People in the Russian government have suggested the use of the same mercenaries and right wing paramilitaries they used to send in Ukraine , so that is a way to go around the unpopularity of sending ground troops into Syria . Granted this would be reinforcing an under-performing army with another under-performing army , but nothing is perfect . It may not turn the tide in the war , but most likely would result in periods of temporary success for the Syrian armed forces . The Russian government can reasonably hope , that in the time it takes for the rebels to adapt to the new threat , there shall emerge a way for the Russian government to disengage from the conflict with its popularity intact . Edit : In practice things are quite likely to go bad , but they are unlikely to go bad immediately . Since I believe the Russian government is quite shortsighted , that would be acceptable to them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"They would get far less volunteers , probably only the most dedicated among the religious fanatics would go to Syria with nationalists staying away , but the Russian Federation can draw ample amounts of mercenary soldiers from among its population . Because of conscription there is no shortage of trained men . Because of the economic and social system , there are enough poor people willing to risk their lives for relatively small sums of money . They would probably be sufficient to compensate for the lack of volunteers . And it 's not like the Russians has to or could afford to send that big of an army in Syria . In Ukraine they send tens of thousands of men , sending ten thousand men to Syria and supplying them there would be a major logistical challenge .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The Syrian army has been receiving training and advisers from Russia/The Soviet Union since the nineteen-sixties . If the Russian army could have helped , it would have done so decades ago .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I find that kind of arguments interesting . It 's so typical of Russian foreign thinking . Those oppressed people have no agency and no ability to act on their own . Instead they are mere tools to be used by other nations . I will tell you this , those Shia in Saudi Arabia either will rise in rebellion or they wo n't , it 's their decision to make . And the only country that could do anything to change their decision is neither Russia , nor Iran but Saudi Arabia itself .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The thing is they ca n't just switch from throwing armor at the rebels to throwing bombs at them as they seem to want to . The rebels and their allies will just adapt to that . Instead infantry and armor doctrines have to be altered in order to become viable in this war . Unfortunately to implement such a strategy is likely impossible without an overall army reform . And good luck getting that with this president . Edit : To add upon what I said I want to add that the Syrian government seems to think that the solution to any problem it encounters is more stuff . First it was more soldiers , which is why we got Hezbollah and the Hazas . That worked for a while , but eventually advances ground to a halt . Then it was more generals , which is why we got the IRCG generals . But more generals does n't equal better tactics and strategy . Now they seem to have decided they need more bombs , hence why the Russians are here . This too shall fail .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So there was some kind of riot in Najran , but it was defused relatively quickly and with very little bloodshed . My point still stands . And beyond that , considering that the only sources of information I 've been able to find about those events are wildly conflicting second hand accounts , the earliest of which seems to be from [ 2008 ] ( https : //www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0908web.pdf ) , I suspect that the events that transpired in the province in 2000 might have been much less serious than they are presented as in your article , and maybe in HRW 's document as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Ukraine was hardly backed by the west in the battlefield was it ? Anyway , the answer to your first question is yes , but not for military reasons . The Donbass rebellion had no chance to last simply because it was n't a rebellion . The most striking feature of the whole separatist movement there is just how unnatural it was . The Ukrainian government could send its army to quell the unrest , simply because a great part of the unrest involved armed men , often times hailing from foreign countries , seizing police offices and municipal buildings . It 's not so much that the Donbass people could n't have fought against the Ukrainian army , as much as that they would n't have risen up in the first place . To illustrate my point I will note that there was a point where the whole pro-Russian unrest designed to form the state of New-Russia looked like it might succeed , but after the events in Odessa it became clear that supporters of the new government , already battle hardened in street fights with Yanukovich 's special police , were neither intimidated , nor incapable of dealing with an enemy equipped with firearms . In an organic unrest the events that transpired in that city would have only inflamed tensions further . Instead the entire pro-Russian movement in the Ukrainian south east seems to have been recalled , from all regions except the Donbass , where the Russian government could dispatch an overwhelming force and thus ensure the pro-Russian side succeed . Ironically enough if the Russian Government had never resorted to creating a pro-Russian `` revolt '' the Ukrainian government would have now faced the possibility of an actual pro-Russian revolt . Such an event would have been much more difficult to suppress as it would have been politically difficult for the Ukrainian government to send the army against a genuine rebellion . When Yanukovich tried to do that the general staff simply refused his orders . Also pro-Russian protests would probably have been more effective if they involved large groups of people , rather than small ones , trying to compensate for their size with violence and occasionally with firearms . But instead of allowing a genuine revolt to form , and then supporting it , the Russian government decided to organize the revolt all by itself . As for Syria , the rebellion had largely been successful , without any significant foreign aid , before the point when the Syrian government got foreign aid of its own , in the form of Hezbollah troops . And I 'm going to say that rebellions can sometimes succeed without foreign aid , and sometimes they ca n't , but in any case , the a revolt can only hope to be successful , if it develops naturally , on its own , trough the grievances of the population . A `` rebellion '' raised by some foreign country , ( if you can even call it that ) is by bound to fail to achieve it 's goals , and it 's mere survival would require enormous amounts of foreign support . ( The post I was responding to was responding to was suggesting that Russia should raise a revolt among the Saudi Shia , in retaliation to Saudi Support for the rebels . No idea why it was deleted . )",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The fact remains that we have no first hand accounts of the events , no documentary or material evidence to point us at what really happened , and both the author of your article , as well as his sources are likely to exaggerate the extent and the level of success of the whole thing . And to be frank , the series of events described in the article hardly make sense . All Saudi security servicemen in the town ran away in the face of the armed rioters around the governor 's residence , yet the governor was unharmed , and the whole incident ended incredibly peacefully and incredibly quickly . That sounds incredibly unlikely . And nothing that happened in 2000 indicates that the people of Najran have any desire to rid themselves of Saudi rule . Iran and Russia may provide all the weapons they wish to anyone they wish , but without a real rebellion they would achieve nothing , except anger the Saudi Government .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Regardless of what people around here may think , refusing a call to arms by a NATO member would have consequences far more serious than going to war with Russia . A war with Russia risks escalating things to the point where nuclear weapons are used , refusing to defend a NATO member would guarantee that . And no , the Falklands war is not indicative of anything . It 's just that Britain never requested military aid , mostly due to political reasons . Nobody refused Britain any help it requested , or needed . And in spite of that American carriers were sent to assist the British if they met any resistance they could n't handle .

In my view , it would almost certainly be denied military assistance from NATO and perhaps even expelled from the alliance if regulations permit doing so . You suggest that direct military action is the only possible response that NATO members could take , despite the NATO Call to Arms ( Article 5 ) specifically leaving that decision in the hands of individual members to do what they deem wise and not necessarily thorough armed force . I think if Turkey happens to be in a war with Russia , the necessity of the use of armed force would be obvious , would n't it . & gt ; When keeping in mind the rational distinction between defending an ally from aggression and aiding an ally 's aggression . No western politician will have legal , moral or political difficulty justifying their lack of military response in such a scenario . Once again , this scenario involves the leadership of Turkey losing their minds and committing an intentional act of war against Russia . It is not a realistic scenario . Do you think the general public in America , or Britain or France cares about legal technicalities . The way they are going to see it a NATO ally has been attacked , because they refused to let a Russian ship trough their seas . Western politicians can ignore that only at their own peril . & gt ; I am afraid that I do not follow your logic here . How does a Turkey losing a skirmish or limited regional conflict with Russia guarantee the use of nuclear weapons ? More so than an actual war between NATO and Russia , where Russia is the party being attacked ? ? ? If Russia can attack a NATO country because of some legal technicality and get away with it , the question becomes can Russia do the same because of some vague moral statement or something . It 's not like the Russian government has shown itself to care about international law . To stick to the letter of the laws in that case would be interpreted as a sign of weakness . And the problem with showing signs of weakness , is that soon after you do it , you will be forced to prove your strength . & gt ; What makes you think that this hypothetical scenario would be called anything but a `` conflict '' or a `` crisis '' . We are not talking about a full land invasion of Turkey . Only about limited naval and aerial skirmishes with potential for bombing of military infrastructure such as ports , airbases and SAM sites . The Turkish government would have nothing to gain and everything to loose from refusing to call this conflict a war . Thus , there is no reason why they would not acknowledge the state of war .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As I have said , if a NATO country looses a war like that , it would be the end of way too many western politicians . Thus they would involve themselves directly .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If the only response we see from the western powers is nothing but impotent condemnation , do you honestly believe that the leaders of the western powers will remain in power ? I 'm sorry , but I simply do n't see how an American president could retain his post if Russia , of all countries , imposes it 's will militarily upon a NATO country . And furthermore , how exactly is letting enemies impose their will upon your allies in any way pragmatic ? The way words like pragmatic are being used around here would make a man wonder if the meaning of that word has somehow changed to `` extremely shortsighted '' .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The general public in America , Britain or France does not care about Turkey or Russia or Syria or NATO . The public however does care about joining in on unnecessary , bloody and expensive wars . Doubly so if this war when taken to its natural conclusion carries a very high likelihood of the apocalypse . I 'm sorry but I just do n't see anyone standing idly by while the Russian government imposes it 's will upon a NATO country . And if someone stands idly by , I assure you , that 's not going to be popular . & gt ; The Western media has found itself to always be closely aligned with the current foreign policy decisions of the respective state . It would not be difficult for the media to convey the government 's position to sway public opinion on their side . The western world is not Russia . Media around here would rather attack a government than support it . And abandoning a NATO country would give them ample opportunity to attack . & gt ; That not `` some legal technicality '' , its international law . The basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states . Its purpose is to avoid needless wars . An illegal naval blockade being an act of war is not some obscure technicality , is one of the oldest and most fundamental laws of the sea . I 'm sorry but what are you talking about ? `` Blockade '' ? ! The only thing Turkey would have to deny Russian ships passage trough it 's territorial waters . Need I remind you that the only reason why Turkey does not use that right is because of some document signed almost 80 years ago . Thus a legal technicality . Though come to think of it , I doubt said document would authorize an armed attack against Turkey , if the Turkish signature under it were withdrawn , so it might not be even that . And need I remind you how laughable the whole `` basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states '' is , when you realize it 's we are discussing Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Because sticking with allies is something so fundamental that everyone understands the need to do it . If you stop doing it , you loose all your allies , it 's elementary common sense . The public does n't care about conventions , the UN , international law and all that . They understand international relations in simpler , yet far superior ways . They divide the world into friends and foes , and realize that foes should not be allowed to impose their will upon friends . I assure you , few would like a war , but that does not mean people are unaware of the consequences of betrayal , born out of cowardice and weakness . And because nowadays , in a moment of Russian weakness unlike any we have seen in a century , it 's easy enough to crush Russian attempts to impose their will upon NATO allies . It would be easy enough to hold of the Russians at Turkey 's borders and in the black sea , while coalition air force ends the Syrian government , thereby depriving the war of its purpose . The Warsaw Pact being dead makes the situation worse for the Russian government not better .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"You could array civilian ships around the passage and have them move on a collision course with any Russian ship that tries to cross . Either the Russian ship turns back , or it 's all just an accident , nobody can prove anything . *Considering that the Russian ship was sailing trough a busy waterway , without following proper protocols , it 's not even surprising that the accident happened . *",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I assure you people care nothing about international law . They do understand strategy , however . There is a reason why the most warlike countries in the world are democracies . And none of the examples you used involved an armed attack against a NATO country .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I simply do n't think that western public opinion would ever consider canceling the Montreux convention as an act of war . Same applies to western politicians . As for the second point , in the scenario I described , would there be a way for the Russian military to use nuclear weapons , except offensively ? Because I 'm pretty sure if any nuclear weapons are used offensively , the only correct course of action is a strategic first strike . I mean , there is a reason why Russian military doctrines say nuclear weapons are to be used only when the existence of the Russian federation is in peril .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"No he does not . He does have the power to ban anyone he wishes from his territorial waters . All I 'm saying is that Turkey is a sovereign country , though that seems to be a cause of great controversy for some reason .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's not a concern with NATO 's image . It 's more fundamental than that . Once you start abandoning allies , you loose allies . Once you loose allies , war starts and in this case it 's likely to be a general war , at that . I assure you ordinary people realize that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"International law is little more than a code of conduct , is it not ? To expect that someone would follow a code of conduct when dealing with those that have shown an utter contempt for that code of conduct is just silly . And something tells me that if you only expect that the US would follow international law , in spite of having every justifiable reason not to , because the US is an enemy of a certain country .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,I disagree . Propaganda efforts are quite worthy of examination and discussion .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , the dispatch of an elite infantry brigade was announced more than a weak before the brigade in question actually engaged the enemy in the area . If that 's true , it 's downright insane . Whatever problems the SAA might have , it is a well established army that has fought in multiple wars . I find idea that they would disregard military secrecy in such a horrible manner unbelievable . Also , are SAA 's elite soldiers really so undisciplined as to post information about their deployments ? From what I understand even JaN has cracked down on that practice . Though I can certainly believe that might be the case if the elite brigade in question has lost an excessive portion of its officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Observe , for example , the difference between the methods the Islamic Republic of Iran uses in promoting favorable viewpoints as compared to their arch rival , the Saudi Kingdom . Iranian news outlets , including state news organizations , all behave like tabloids . You 'd expect that a state TV channel would try to maintain a good standing , since it 's reputation is intrinsically linked to the reputation of the state it represents . Yet PressTV has quite justifiably acquired reputation for being deceptive and obviously biased . Overall , Iranian propaganda is crude and amateurish . When people see a story by an Iranian news organization , they expect misinformation . In comparison with Iran the Saudi government deals with foreign media in a far more traditional manner . While Iran has 2 state news agencies and a government TV channel , KSA has only 1 official press agency . The Saudi equivalent of FarsNews would be Al Arabiya , an agency usually taken far more seriously . Saudi media , unlike their Iranian counterparts , rarely tries to deceive it 's viewers and when they do it 's usually done well . As a result any deception they engage in is far more likely to be believed . Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have censorship but in the Kingdom the censor is not the preferred way of controlling the media landscape . Instead the Saudi state encourages a cultural and economic environment hostile to criticism of government . A consequence of that is the fact that they are more than capable of influencing media beyond its borders . It is said that even Al Manar reporters are hesitant to attack the Kingdom . Overall , there is a lot to discuss about Iranian propaganda . It should be clear by now that I consider it to be terrible , and beyond that vastly inferior to the more traditional means of persuasion employed by their main rival . ( I avoid the term propaganda when speaking about Saudi Arabia , since usually the term is used to denote rather crude ways to get one 's point across . ) The reasons for that are something worthy of discussion .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I 'm afraid the course of the war at the present moment would contradict the idea that telling the enemy your intentions can somehow work to your advantage . Observe that the Syrian Army is vastly superior to the forces of the Islamic State in both manpower and weaponry . Perhaps the Islamic State may have some advantage in terms of fighting spirit but it is nowhere near enough to compensate for the superiority of the SAA 's forces . The SAA usually announces it 's offensives beforehand whereas IS does not . The SAA operations are sometimes successful but sometimes end disastrously . IS on the other hand has come to be known for their surprise offensives that catch the enemy off guard and thus capture large cities in mere days . In contrast to the SAA 's occasional great failures , the Islamic State achieves the occasional great success . The SAA 's failures have lead to a point where the government has been driven to searching salvation in foreign force after foreign force , first Hezbollah , then the IRGC , then Iraqi militias and now the armed forces of the Russian Federation . The Islamic State has been attacked by multiple foreign forces and , while it has been weakened to some degree , it still seems to remain militarily viable . You say that wars are won and lost by the calls of generals and their ability to exploit a situation . But the logical consequence of that is that the enemy 's generals have to be kept as ignorant as possible of the situation , because that way they are likely to make the wrong calls . Edit : Clarified some things . Fixed some other things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's not a matter of an ability to condemn . Whether you can condemn someone or not does n't really matter , condemnations are just words . What matters is that with regards to the Russian Federation and their allies , the US can now violate every article of international law , without this affecting their relations with other countries . When the US invaded Iraq relations with other countries suffered . When the Russian Federation annexed Ukrainian territory , the diplomatic damage was enormous , to say the least . Yet if the US declares a no fly zone upon Syria now , I assure you , few will care .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,It 's strange how all of a sudden some people started caring about international law when it could be interpreted as beneficial to a certain country . Some people that never seemed to care about it before . Weird .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Perhaps he has . The Russian Federation and it 's allies ca n't demand that international law be followed , if someone else is violating it . Or rather they could , but doing so would result in nothing but in their contemptuous mockery .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Deposing governments without UN approval , the US 's worst violation of international law , was something that both the Soviet Union and the Western powers would do occasionaly during the Cold War . Territorial expansion on the other hand was considered inconceivable . In practice the reason why the American government could violate international law and still cite it is that the US never violated it in a manner that shows an utter contempt for that law . Like it or not the fact is that trough its territorial expansion the Russian Federation has suspended the Cold War era rules of conduct between nations , to which the set of rules we call international law are a product of . American violations of international law were always conducted in such a manner that they would avoid a similar effect . There is a reason why the United States allowed Iraq to have an independent government of its own , and a major part of it is that they can now expect that other nations conduct themselves in their dealings with the US within the boundaries of international law , with the occasional acceptable violation . This is why you do n't see many people laughing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The idea that Russia would n't defend itself against a US attack is pretty ridiculous . In fact , they have every reason to escalate such a fight to a level where they have parity . The only way they could have parity is if things escalate to the point of use of nuclear weapons . And , to repeat what I said in another post , do you honestly believe that the billionaire rulers of the Russian Federation would risk loosing all they love and cherish for the sake of Russia 's pride and great power status ? Because I highly doubt this is the case . & gt ; The president publicly discarded his opinion . Yes , it 's rather humiliating . Rather more humiliating for the president I 'm afraid . Considering that the secretary of state is in agreement with most of congress , and most major candidates for the presidency from both major parties , I 'd rather say the president should feel humiliated that he ca n't even get people in his own government to support his policies .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If it were not a code of conduct but an actual law , in the commonly understood meaning of the term , it would have been enforced by something more than a gentlemen 's agreement between the great powers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"You do n't understand , do you ? Not every violation of international law is the same as every other violation . When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938 it deeply destabilized Europe . In spite of Germany having the muscle to get away with it , the diplomatic consequences were severe enough that a year later Germany found itself in a war with several major powers . When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 peace in Europe remained undisturbed . The diplomatic consequences for the USSR were far less significant . And you keep talking about weak and strong but you seem to forget that those terms are , by their meaning , relative . You repeat the whole strong and weak thing all the time , but you seem to forget that Russia is much weaker than the West in every regard except in strategic weapons . And it 's not like the billionaire rulers of the Russian Federation would like to loose everything they have in the inferno of a nuclear war , you can be certain of that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is there really little to gain from picking up a fight with Russia ? I do n't think so . Showing the whole world that the Russian Federation is no longer capable of defending its allies beyond the borders of what once was the Soviet Union is something the US should justifiably consider a gain , should it not ? All of a sudden , the Russian Federation would loose every ally it has in the Middle East . And beyond that Iran , for example , could reconsider it 's squabble with the Gulf monarchies , and that is something the US would benefit from greatly . I 'm not saying that a conflict with Russia would necessarily be worth it though . There are enormous risks involved in the whole thing . In this case the risks might be great but the reward is great as well . Whether the risks would be worth the reward is not a judgement for me to make , but rather for the people that read intelligence assessments and similar documents , but I assure you the choice is far less clear than you present it . So when the secretary of state pushes for a no fly zone , please do n't discard his opinion like that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Some of these countries were basically puppet states of the USSR . In 1977 the USSR changed its constitution to allow members to secede but that was not the reality .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,MapPorn,"Well , no not really . The Macedonians originate from an epicentre of different nationalities in the Southern Balkans . Its where the nations of Bulgaria , Serbia , Greece meet and have met for a rather long time with Albanians coming into the mix later on as well . Most demographics maps say they were mostly Bulgarians with Greek and Serb majorities closer to the countries ' borders . Bulgaria fought many wars with reuniting with Macedonia being the major desire . But after losing the second Balkan war which was completely fought because of Macedonia and WW1 which Bulgaria basically joined to get Macedonia there was a decrease in tensions and there were much larger problems in Bulgaria that it had to deal with . After WW1 Yugoslavia was created and I think that is where Macedonia as a nation really developed . So by 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia there was a legitimate Macedonian nation that wanted to govern itself . An issue with this though was that Macedonia had no real history as a country , and no national identity past the part of the people feeling Macedonian . So in order to create a Macedonian national identity the government started separating the language with Bulgarian ( which tbh had already developed differences ) amongst other things while taking huge liberties with history like making outright wrong claims like saying they were descendants of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great . So I would say that there is a legitimate nation of Macedonia , **but** a majority of that nation 's ancestors were Bulgarian .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

It was a protest turned violent by the police at certain points at certain places in Ukraine 's capital . Then the president escapes to Russia leaving a trail of corruption left to be discovered by the people . The whole protest was over by the time that Russia sent soldiers and tanks to Crimea and annexed it . At first they even denied sending any troops which is what they also did in Eastern Ukraine before even Putin admitting they had sent soldiers and heavy military equipment to aide the separatists and fight Ukraine . My country has done these things like in the early 20th century when such things were normal . But it is expected more of the modern states in fucking Europe . Plus I say again , just because other countries have done similar things it does not justify Russia in doing them as well . And critique of countries doing dumb shit is highly needed from the inside and the outside so it stops countries from doing such things .

This makes no sense . Plus why the hell is the war penalty harsher at the start of the game ? Surely war is much more despised now than during the medieval era .

I heard that they made it so that the more you have compared to the other civ the more they will want from you . This is completely illogical . At the end of my game people stopped even giving me anything and just wanted gifts , anything more would offend them . How is 1 luxury item worth 3 of mine because I have more than them ?

I have selected move order and the dumbass game selects the other unit while I am clicking . Why ? ! Just let me have the option to turn it off . 5 . Smaller things : Range of ranged units sometimes change . One turn I can attack a unit the next turn I cant . I cant understand why this is happening . Other smaller annoyances with the AI in diplomacy . Why dont I have move your troops away ? Sometimes they can say that to me if I have 1 unit 2 tiles away but I have not once been able to use it myself . Why are land units so strong when being transported over water ?

How can Riot give them another slot when one of the 2 seeds has never won more than one game ( won no games before this worlds ) ? I am also unsure whether LMS deserves a 3rd seed .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,leagueoflegends,"& gt ; PaiN certainly earned their spot last year , and won more games than TSM and Invictus Gaming in their group PaiN certainly earned their spot . What about the Bangkok Titans 0-6 ? ANX is more likely a miracle run than a sign that other IWC regions are on that level . INTZ won the first game due to EDG completely underestimating them and then they proceeded to lose every other game . If that game was a BO2 or BO3 INTZ couldnt have taken the series because it was a fluke . IWC has become better but only so that the pther regions cant beat them without a gameplan and some prep . Imo IWC earned their first seed last worlds and thanks to ANX and ANX only they have maybe gotten competitive enough to maybe be given a second seed for next years . But still I believe that its most likely that one of the IWC seeds will just mean one less competitor in one of the groups and easier quarters for the other teams in the groups which is rather unfair . About the LMS , I said I was unsure because I am not very familiar with the LMS so I cant say whether or not they would deserve another seed .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

They sent money to their families back home which boosted 'domestic ' income and thus Yugoslavia 's GDP .

Or you can check couchsurfing or airbnb options . But let 's consider the worst case scenario of even those failing ( and that 's very very unlikely ) I would suggest looking for places to stay just outside the cities ( Podstrana and Kaštela oustide Split , Mokošica outside Dubrovnik ; no need for Zagreb , it 's big and not as popular so chances of not finding a place to stay are practically nonexistent ) .

2ntle,travel,"I 'm going to try to make an list of places that have all the stuff you mentioned that you enjoy . However , you might run into crowds , since there are a lot of people that enjoy those things as well : D Zagreb - in contrast to ancient history shared by many coastal towns , Zagreb 's is more medieval . It 's similar to Prague and Budapest in that regard . It 's not so crowded in the summer . Has lots of museums . Has a nice vista overlooking the city . Trogir - a small town near Split , really pretty and historic . Not really must-see but it 's near Split so it 's convenient . Plus , by being so underrated it 's not so crowded . It 's connected to island of Čiovo where you can find some nice beaches to unwind . Split - has an ancient Roman palace , museums and galleries . Nice vista from Marjan hill overlooking the city . The beaches in the city are okay , but the main ones are likely to be crowded . The nice , more secluded ones are usually known only to the locals . Split is a port to the ferry that will take you to Hvar - both town of Hvar and Stari Grad on island of Hvar are worth visiting . They have their bit of history ( Stari Grad is the oldest town in Croatia , dating back to ancient Greece ) , nature and good beaches . Dubrovnik - beautiful town with lots of ancient as well as recent history . Has a great view from the hill outside the town ( you can get up there by a cable car ) . Downside is that is probably the busiest town on the coast , especially if you have the 'luck ' of visiting on the same day as three cruise ships . Still worth the visit , though .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I believe that Split merits a visit , however , it does tend to get somewhat crowded since there are tourists that are there to see Split and others that are there to catch a ferry for the islands or a bus further down south .

If they could run a story on the charity and give some info to locals about orange hooded people on the roads you might have a easier time getting rides ( esp . seeing that there will be almost 400 of you here ) .

That would be the bus that does n't take the motorway but state roads instead . If you take a route that looks something like Zagreb - Plitvice Lakes - Zadar - Šibenik - Split you should cover the scenery and the other cities part . The trip back , from Split up north is practically the same , so you can split the stuff you want to see between coming and going . There are a couple of other national parks on the way like Krka and Brijuni so if nature floats your boat give them a go ( even if it does n't , you 'll be here for 2 weeks , you have to pass the time somehow ) . Other than that , the usual touristy stuff you 'll find in the cities and maybe some hiking , kayaking , whitewater rafting , biking , etc .

2ntle,travel,"Your schedule is tight but not necessarily too tight . If you keep on track and stay organized you should n't have any problems . Try to make both Kotor and Mostar work if you can .

It 's a long ferry ride from Split and it 's a more of a relaxing , tranquil kind of place with nothing really to see . Bring the car with you to Hvar . That way you 'll be able to easily see both Hvar and Stari Grad and check out lavender fields more inland on your own . Unless you 're Scandinavian and used to swimming in frozen lakes you 'll find the water too cold . Maybe if the weather is really warm that week give it a go in Rovinj . The water currents are weaker up north making the sea a bit warmer . Although Plitvice are becoming hugely popular , I do n't think you really need to spend the night there . Yes , there 'll probably be lots of tourists but nowhere near as in mid July so you 'll have no problem going around and seeing everything . It 's a 3 hour trip from Split so if you get up a bit earlier you can get there early enough . While Rovinj is said by many to be the most beautiful town on the coast it 's also , as Vis , more of a unwind type of place so I suggest you use it as a base for trips to other Istrian towns and maybe a trip to the wine country inland .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,travel,"I was going to say that 5 nights in Hvar is a bit too much , but I saw your explanation and that 's good enough for me . However , I really do n't know what do you plan on doing in Makarska for 2 nights , if you 're using Hvar for your chilling back and relaxation needs . Makarska is basically a place that attracts two types of tourists : a ) families with children that just want to unplug for a week and do nothing , and b ) day trippers from the surrounding area , mostly BiH . As for seeing or doing anything there really is n't anything there . So your options there are literally a ) go to the beach and b ) go to a different beach .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Hmm , the coastal part of the country between Split and Dubrovnik is filled with towns and villages similar to Makarska - lots of nice beaches and apartments and rooms for rent , but lacking in anything that would be considered an activity . There 's a catamaran connecting Hvar and Korčula ( I guess that 's how you 're planning on getting to Dubrovnik , there 's no ferry from Hvar to there ) . So maybe stop there on your way down . Korčula has more to offer than Makarska ( it 's allegedly the birthplace of Marco Polo ) but it 's not extremely popular so you wo n't be caught in a crowd like you 'll likely to be in Dubrovnik .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Yeah , that be a great idea , Plitvice Lakes definitely merit a visit . Zadar is a bit closer to them so you might want to squeeze them in in the beginning , before heading down to Split .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Hvar is more known for it 's lavander and nightlife . Korčula ( and the peninsula connecting it with land ) are know for their wine so choose accordingly . I 'd say that at least one of them merits a visit , but if your schedule is tight and you ca n't make it then I guess you 'll have to leave them for the next visit here : )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"You can take the state roads in one direction and the motorway in the other . That way you can enjoy the scenery the state road has to offer ( especially the Split-Dubrovnik part ) and save some money on tolls . It will take longer , however . I 'd say , and that 's being as unbiased as I can , that there 's as much to do and see in Split as there 's in Dubrovnik . People that say otherwise usually fall into one of these categories a ) have only been to one of the two or b ) have n't been to either one . But I wo n't press you on this one , you can do your own research . Dubrovnik is more popular with tourists because it 's more , well , touristy . Everything is laid out for you and all you have to do is to follow your tour guide . As opposed to Split where I had a tourist ask me 'where 's that palace ' while being inside it . If you do decide to stay in Split for more than a few hours make sure that the place you 'll be sleeping at provides a parking space . As velynasha said , parking in Split can get a bit tricky , especially downtown , so if your accommodations are n't in the center leave your car there and walk and/or use public transportation to go sightseeing . Come on you Gooners",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Dubrovnik is easy , as in there 's only so much you can do there so you probably wo n't miss anything . I do n't know when you 're coming or what are your interests so I 'll try to keep it as general as possible . Things to do in Dubrovnik : Wander around the old town . Get lost in the small alleys . Push through the crowds ( Dubrovnik is 1 ) the most popular tourist destination in Croatia and 2 ) a stop on almost all Mediterranean cruises so it tends to get really busy ) . Take a walk around on top of the old city walls . Take a GoT tour ( Although I do n't know if they 're worth the money . You should employ some Google Fu to find some reviews . ) Take the cable car ( or drive ) up the hill overlooking the town for a fantastic view . Explore museums , galleries , restaurants . Make sure you 've exchanged enough Kunas for souvenirs . That pretty much covers Dubrovnik . Things to do in Split : The ancient Roman palace is a great place to get lost exploring , even if you 're local . People still live in it so it does n't have that 'museum-y ' feel to it . You can basically be looking at a 1700 year old ruin , turn around a corner and find yourself in someones back yard . So that 's neat . Check out museums and galleries if that 's what you 're into . Check out the palace basements where one part of the Split Got filming took place . I 'm not sure if there are any organized Got tours in Split , but even if there are I do n't think they 're worth the money , you can check out everything on your own . Take a stroll up the Marjan hill for a great view of Split . Check out some of the restaurants ( there are a lot of great reviews online ) . Grab a drink in the evening in one of the numerous bars in the palace and mingle with the locals and other tourists . Drive up to Klis Fort where the other part of the GoT filming took place plus enjoy a really breathtaking view of Split , the islands and surrounding area . Take a day trip to Hvar if you can squeeze it in . If you 're coming here in the summer : Check out Bačvice beach which becomes a party zone in the evening . It gets crowded during the day with beach-goers . There are other okay beaches in Split , but for really good ones you need to go outside the city . Luckily you 'll have a car . I would recommend somewhere south of Omiš ( probably an hour drive in summer traffic ) . There are good beaches in small villages in that area , just follow the southbound road . You can go kayaking in Split and whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Omiš . Probably other similar activities are available that I do n't know about , Google should know better . About the border checkpoint between Croatia and B & amp ; H on the Split - Dubrovnik route , there really is n't much to it . The Bosnians often are n't even there . Usually it 's just a quick passport check , you wo n't even need to get out of the car .

Forget about the trains , they are less comfortable ( inter-city type ) and slower than buses and only go as south as Split . If you do decide to rent you 'll be able to make stop along the way in other towns and national parks so that has it 's pros . If you want to take the slower , scenic route do n't take the motorway . However , keep in mind that finding a parking space in the ( relative ) center of Dubrovnik and especially Split can be either expensive or a pain in the ass .

2ntle,travel,"Some Croatia advice . The weather is usually nice in May but either way a week is enough to check out big ( ger ) cities and wonder a bit off the beaten path . Note that my suggestions could differ a bit from any other you may get here . That 's because May is still kinda 'off-season ' in Croatia so I took that into consideration . Seeing that you 're coming in from Italy and continuing on to Hungary , my suggested itinerary would look something like : * Istria ( Pula , Rovinj ) - cultural sightseeing . One day for both but if you 're stretched you can scrape Rovinj . It 's a nice quaint town but I found it as a unwind and relax kind of place , plus it could be dead in May so skip it if you do n't have the time . Pula is worth a visit , if only for the ancient Roman amphitheater . * Plitvice Lakes National Park - kick ass NP , basically the most universal suggestion ( besides Dubrovnik ) that anyone will give you about visiting Croatia * Zadar - a day or two . You might even come here before visiting Plitvice and using it as a base of sorts . Kornati NP is also nearby so check out if you find it worth visiting . Also Krka NP is en route when you continue down south so if that nature stuff floats your boat give it a shot . * Split - two to three days . Seeing that it 's May Split will be the liveliest city on the coast . Use the time for sightseeing and getting shitfaced . Split is also a bus and ferry hub for that part of the country so it 's convenient for island hopping and taking day trips to nearby places ( e.g . Trogir for culture/sightseeing or Omiš for whitewater rafting/rock climbing/paragliding ) . Island ( and town ) of Hvar is also advised . It 's famous for it 's nightlife but it could be dead in May . However it warrants at least a day visit . * Dubrovnik - two days . The most popular town on the coast . King 's Landing from GoT , yadda yadda , anyways you 'll want to visit . If you can squeeze it in ( ha ) go for a day trip to Mostar ( Bosnia ) . * Zagreb - two days .

There are other National Parks in the general vicinity ( that 's where Zadar as a base really kicks in ) . Google around for NPs : Krka , Paklenica and Kornati . Krka is the most similar to Plitvice , while Kornati is an archipelago of small islands . For scenery and old towns stick to the coast . Since you 're on a itinerary the bigger ones like Zadar , Šibenik , Split and Dubrovnik should do you just fine . Maybe throw Trogir into the mix if you find the time .

This is one of those things that 's not easily translatable and which you mostly pick up through immersion . Croatian uses `` na '' ( which would translate to `` on ( top ) '' in English ) when talking about sea , rivers , lakes , etc in similar instances . So , you would say `` Putujem na more '' ( I 'm travelling to the sea ) . `` Putujem na moru '' is still awkward as `` putujem '' would n't be used in this case but `` plovim '' ( sailing ) would . So `` Plovim na moru '' would be I 'm sailing on the sea . Commonly used is also `` Plovim po moru '' which would be more like `` I 'm sailing across the sea '' but not literally across . I 'd say that `` Plovim na moru '' gives emphasis to the sea while `` plovim po moru '' gives emphasis to the sailing . Hope this helps ! Feel free to ask anything else ! P.S . there are instances where you would use `` u more '' , but just not with `` travel '' . The most common one is `` Idem u more !

2ntle,soccer,"[ First Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=da_sLKLV97M ) [ Second Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ZjufkPw2wTE ) 1414 days have passed since the last Hajduk 's win over Dinamo on their own pitch . The tradition was broken by a unlikely hero - the 18 year old midfielder Mario Pašalić scored twice to bring Hajduk just 1 point behind Dinamo and keep the battle for the top going . The Croatian Derby welcomed two very different teams . Dinamo , reigning and 8 times consecutive champion with a healthy budget and new foreign players brought to qualify for yet another CL . They were knocked out in the playoff by Austria Vienna which cost the coach Krunoslav Jurčić his job . The new/old coach became Branko Ivanković , hoping his third run with Dinamo would be the charm . Hajduk , on the other hand , is on the verge of bankruptcy . The city of Split , their main shareholder , ca n't financially support the club anymore and are actively looking for buyers to take over . Accordingly , Hajduk 's squad is filled with youngsters , most of them with hardly any first league experience . The coach is Igor Tudor , former Juventus and Croatia NT CB , whose only prior experience was coaching Hajduk 's U19 team , where he got to know most of the players he 's managing now . The match was a classic Hajduk - Dinamo clash , with aggression , pace and hard challenges . The more experienced and individually better Dinamo side dominated the first half , bringing the ball in the final third with ease but lacked any creativity in front of the goal . Hajduk 's defense was under constant pressure , trying to close down Dinamo 's pacey wingers El Soudani and Fernandes . The half time score was 0-0 , but Hajduk 's game did n't give their fans much hope for the second half . However , the Split side came out of the locker rooms more energetic and filled with vigor . Although inferior to Dinamo , they seemed to want the win more than their counterparts from Zagreb . Their attitude was awarded in the 49th minute when the 18 year old youngster Mario Pašalić craftily converted a corner swung in by debutant Haris Bukva . The goal did n't seem to wake up Dinamo and their pale approach was punished after another corner in 69th minute . Same assistant , same scorer . The remainder of the match offered nothing of note . Dinamo still looked like they do n't really want to be there while Hajduk neatly defended and waited out the clock . The win brought Hajduk to 1 point behind Dinamo and keeps the dreams of bringing home the title alive in Split , although the young and inexperienced side will face many challenges throughout the season . [ I shoud point out ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3RluzYlZUBs ) the great atmosphere [ during the match ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h3C9bZPiUhY ) . The 25,000 strong crowd carried the youngsters during the whole 90 minutes and rewarding them for the hard-fought and well deserved win .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Another difference is that with soft tips you do n't have to worry about the angle of the dart in the board ( wondering will the one under the T20 cover the bed with the flight ) as soft tips stick perpendicular to the board . As far as the gameplay goes , some dislike the 'plastic ' sound instead of the cork 'thud ' , melodies and flashy lights .

When you add the factor that school teams are basically the only options for kids to train a given sport ( as far as I understand , there are no off-school football , soccer , etc . teams where a kid could just show up and sign up ) , these teams are practically mini academies for those kids where they pick up necessary skills to develop their talent .

People there do n't have a long tradition playing/watching soccer and more importantly , they have choices . Like a lot of them . So I think it will always be a 'niche ' sport , which does n't have to be that bad , 'cause a niche in such a big country can still be pretty huge . US soccer is rapidly moving forward , but it will be more noticeable via their NT and players in Europe than by MLS . Investing in youth academies and trying to popularize it among the kids that can pick any other ( more popular , lucrative ) sport should be priority # 1",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,CrusaderKings,"Thanks for the reply ! I 'll try to get into a bit more detail , 'cause I do n't think your ( albeit very helpful ) advice covered what I was aiming at . So here goes an example ( hypothetical , derived from many of the same outcomes ) : So , I have myself a nice little kingdom . All of my vassals ( of my and other cultures ) have positive loyalty ( as in rising , if it 's not at 100 it will be in a few months ) . Usually all from traits , friendship , prestige , the usual . When their heirs inherit them they are also very loyal . It says I have a ' ( very ) honorable reputation ' . Then it starts to get boring and I decide to expand a bit . And the Pope just called to arms . Excellent ! So I swoop in , let 's say , Burgos , liberate it and sue for peace demanding to be installed as a count 'cause that 's basically the only way to drive the heathens out . They accept and I keep it as a part of my demesne or give it to some of my kin ( the end result tends to be the same ) . I go for the next Muslim county , rinse and repeat . Then I see that my reputation is all of the sudden 'tarnished ' , but I do n't think of it that much because my vassals are still loyal . Then , let 's say , a new vassal ruler really does n't like me for my traits and he 's my rival . His loyalty has a negative trend . I 'm like 'Meh , if he revolts I 'll just send the army in , take the title back and give it to some one else ' . It happens exactly like that . Now I have a 'bad ' reputation . I conquer some more heathens . My reputation is now 'very bad ' . When I hover over the loyalty percentage over any vassal I see that the negative impact of my reputation is growing . Many more vassals are starting to revolt , and to emphasize since that 's the point of my question , practically only because of my bad reputation , and I have no idea how it got that bad ( I mean I know it 's from taking all those titles , but I have n't usurped them , I gained them through war/vassalization ) . So for example , a vassal is my son ( positive loyalty from family ties and succession order ) , is my friend ( another plus something % ) , likes my traits , scrutage , etc. , but ALL of that is n't enough to balance out the negative impact of my reputation ( it got to -10 % loyalty at one point ) . Same goes for my courtiers , my stewards have been know to get so disloyal that they robbed me blind and my martials fled from battle . That 's pretty much it . I do n't know am I going the wrong way obtaining these lands ( I thought that usurping them would be the shady thing to do , and I really do n't do I 'cause there has n't been a need for it yet ) , or is there something other messing with my reputation . I ca n't see what could it be , seeing how it does n't drop when I just stay put and do n't conquer heathens or when I let vassals go when they rebel . Appreciate the help ! P.S . Ca n't tell if my English is leaving something suspended in translation , I 'll try to explain it better if it 's the case",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Parts of the body mostly targeted in football are basically the most vulnerable ones : lower legs , ankles and feet . And while they 're not so graphic , they are serious and very painful - ruptured muscles , sprains and torn ligaments . Plus , you have to take into consideration that rugby players are much more physically fit to compensate for the 'contact-ness ' of the sport , but you ca n't buff out your feet and ankles .

Although I do n't have specific info you 're looking for , like the Plitvice camp one , I can give you some general transportation info : * If you do n't have/qualify for some kind of discount , avoid using the train . It 's slow , uncomfortable ( except for the overnight one ) and overall not very cost-effective . Seeing how you ca n't get to Dubrovnik with it ( the southernmost stop is Split ) , the bus is your best bet . It 'll cost you roughly the same as the train , it will be more comfortable and faster and you 'll have a great view from Split to Dubrovnik ( make sure you sit on the right side going to Dubrovnik or left coming back ) * As far as accommodation goes , the cheapest way is sleeping in hostels . For the best deal look into reserving them early . Google it up for best deals you can find . If you 're going to stick to your itinerary , you should reserve 3 nights in Split ( as it 's a hub for Dubrovnik and Hvar ) and 2 nights in Šibenik ( it 's closer to Plitvice lakes ) * Since you have n't told us where you 're arriving from , I 'll take a shot in the dark assuming you 'll be coming in from the north ( Zagreb ) , so correct me if I 'm wrong and I 'll update you : Bus from Zagreb to Šibenik is around 150 HRK ( ~20€ ) ; from Šibenik to Split 60 HRK ( ~8€ ) ; from Split to Dubrovnik 100 HRK ( ~13€ ) .

It looks like we could see the same scenario this transfer window again , but as Tottenham wo n't play in the UCL next season and could use the money , they 'll probably let him go .

2ntle,soccer,"sorry , no links , but as someone who 's been involved in football for all of my life , here goes : there 's no termination fee in a standard contract . so , in your exapmle , the club could keep him til the end of the contract . but that 's , as I said , in a standard contract . the better/more famous player is , he and his agent can negotiate better terms . some players have 'transfer clauses ' , for example , if the clause is 5 mil € then the club has to let the player negotiate a transfer with any club that offers a minimum 5 mil € ( Hulk had such clause at Porto for 100 mil € , but that was just a 'hands off ' signal for other clubs , they let him go to Chelsea for far less then that ) . some players have relegation clauses , saying that they 're free to leave the club if they 're relegated to a lower division ( this one is much more widespread ) . basically , it 's up to the player and his agent to negotiate as good of a deal as they can . in your expamle , the club can hold the player to the end of the contract , but clubs rarely keep disgruntled players on the squad and pay their salary just to have them mope around , so they usually agree to put them on a transfer list . however , if the club is n't respecting the terms of the contract ( usually regarding salary ) then the player can sue the club to the FA or FIFA and will usually get such contract terminated ( meaning he becomes a free player ) and the club still has to pay him what they owe . you wo n't find many links about this stuff as it 's a matter of a private contract and they do n't really let them go public . hope this helps a bit",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

As far as coaching goes , here in Europe national football associations have coaching academies ( and you need to have a degree to coach a higher division club ) so if the USSF has it 's own academy ( or wherever you 're from ) you should really look into it . As far as experience goes , your best bet is to go to your local clubs and asking youth coaches to let you assist ( you 'll be doing this for free and just to gain some experience , noone is going to pay you at this point ) . From there on it 's only up to how much do you want it . Your lack of a professional playing career is certainly a drawback , but you can definitely overcome it with hard work .

2ntle,soccer,"I have a mobile stream link for iOS and Android , it worked fine on iphone , but do n't know will it on ipad . and the commentary is in croatian . you can try it [ here ] ( http : //euro2012hrt.ht.hr/ ) ( or maybe someone else can use it )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"sorry , had no idea : /",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"WE DO N'T HAVE HOOLIGANS , IT 'S ALL A SERBIAN CONSPIRACY",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"glad to hear that .

2ntle,soccer,"ca n't agree more . but my point was , as far as croatia goes , noone needs to be concerned they 'll be attacked , insulted , etc . here because of colour of their skin . what 's the actual situation in poland and ukraine - my guess is as good as yours . but from what I 've read , there will be soldiers in addition to police patroling the streets during the euro so I hope there wo n't be any incidents",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"as I said , it 's really not an excuse or a justification . but when I witness such chanting , the guys doing it are n't even looking at the player they 're chanting at , they 're looking around the stands or at the cameras fishing for a reaction . odd times indeed",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"Looks like your dance card might be full , but anyway give me a shout when you 're in Split for a coffee/beer/whatevs",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,ragenovels,"thanks , my mission is accomplished if I can save at least one soul from the horrors I 've seen : D",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"as Koryanshea pointed out , buses could be a lot cheaper than renting a car . however , if you want a bit more freedom and like meeting new people , hitchhiking is n't such a bad idea . although croatians generally do n't pick up hitchhikers , you might catch a break . plus , Jadranska magistrala will be filled with tourists so odds are that some of them will give you a ride , especially considering your language skills . and as AnomalyAnn suggested , you should definitely check out Plitvice lakes",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"yeah , it practically follows the coastline all the way and most of the scenery is really breathtaking . note : I said it will be filled with tourists 'cause it 's the main route connecting split and dubrovnik ( north of split most tourists use the highway ( E-65 , E-71 ) )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I do n't think you can pull that off 'cause usually the ticket for the car only includes one person ( the driver ) but I could be wrong so check that out . p.s . if you stop by split give me a shout , we 'll grab a beer",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"well , the most common one here in Dalmatia is pretty simple : just cut up some prosciutto and cheese ( you can check online which of the cheeses avaliable to you suits prosciutto the best ) , maybe some tuna pate and olives . it 'll take you no time to prepare and yet will be pretty much authentic ( having croatian ingridients will be a huge plus , of course : ) ) however , these customs vary depending on the region so maybe someone here from a diferent part of croatia can give you a different suggestion . hope you have fun at the dinner party and especially when you come here",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"fair enough . as far as this case goes , in a nutshell , the prosecution ( and the police ) fucked up big time . they first charged the guy with misdemeanor ( no `` major '' injuries ) , then thoght they can get a criminal offense conviction just by seeing that medical report says `` dislocated '' nasal bone ( qualifies as a major injury ) and dropped the misdemeanor charge . but at the criminal trial the medical expert said it was only a `` slight '' dislocation of the nasal bone so it 's not a major injury after all . they could n't charge him for a misdemeanor againg 'cause of double jeopardy . that 's the main plot . the subplot is that the guy is a `` well respected businessman '' ( WRB ) , with obvious connections and political protection ( forget about all that independence of the judicial system thingy ) . there has been quite a few similar cases where a WRB , a politican or someone in their family would be responsible for an accident , even with fatal casualties , and got away scot-free or with a slap on the wrist . same goes for a range of other crimes **tl ; dr if you know ( or are ) the right people in croatia , you do n't need to be concerned with such technicality as the law**",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"duh , do you know what a pain in the arse it is to have your black beamer in the shop and you have to drive around town in your blue one ? hahah , I was just about to ask you `` Y U TROLLIN R/CROATIA '' ? : D hope you have fun here . stay tuned for more fun little stories : )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,AskReddit,what about the american joke ( belief ) that french women do n't shave their armpits and legs and that the french do n't shower and/or use deodorants ( heard it about all europeans as well ) ?,Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,aww,"he 's independent , curious and surprisingly brave . he walks up to our 4 year old cat that 's not too fond of him , arches his back and puffs up , acting all tough ( I 'll try to catch it on video , it 's adorable ) . he 's also very cuddly and likes our company ( already jumping up on my lap and taking a nap there , sleeping on the bed , etc . )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,todayilearned,"you should check out the movie , it 's really touching",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I have n't used rent a car here so I ca n't give you any first hand information , but here are some of the agencies in Split ( the links are to the price/search pages ) : [ Hertz ] ( http : //www.hertz.hr/index.php ? page=1 ) , [ Nova ] ( http : //www.rentacarsplit.net/index.php ? option=com_content & amp ; view=article & amp ; id=83 & amp ; Itemid=91 & amp ; lang=en ) , [ Avis ] ( http : //eixnbeweb03.rent-at-avis.com/avisonline/ibe.nsf/ReservationStep1 !

2ntle,croatia,"no , it just says that the airplane has been transferred Zagreb for a forensic investigation . it later refers to the bad legislation that does n't require custom made ultralight aircraft to have certified airplane engines , so most people install car engines instead",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"I think the problem with people who do n't perceive Chelsea 's recent play or any of the Mourinho 's teams , etc . as entertaining is that they just do n't understand football on a deep enough level . I enjoyed watching Chelsea last night ( and rooted for them ) , and especially Mou 's Inter ( Inter fan here ) by watching their tactical responsibility , off the ball movement , appreciating commitement and bravery and overall die-hard approach",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,Darts,I 'm ( pleasently ) surprised they did n't shoot for the bull instead of trip 20 as they do in world stage tournaments,Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,soccer,it starts at 5:03,Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"as a southern european fan ( Split , Croatia ) I can verify this . strange thing is , our fans ( luckily , fewer every day ) often 'monkey chant ' or whatever it 's called opponent 's black players , but home team 's black players are usually the most popular ones , even when they 're worse than home players . it 's not an excuse , but although there are racists among our fans , most of them do these things just for the controversy , not actual racism",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,the 'shipping ' and the 'FAQ ' pages do n't show anything . was it like that before or it 's just a glitch ?,Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"no , he signed a two-year contract with Wolfsburg so he 's still pretty much in it",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"you too , mate ! and I 'm not saying this just out of courtesy , but I 've always loved and admired the Irish , so my dream scenario would be with Croatia and Éire going trough ( even with Croatia being second in the group if that meant you would meet England in the quarters ) : D",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
