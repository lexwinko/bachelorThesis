These are the type of guys I usually do n't hang out with ( the edgy 14 year old vapelords ) , but fuck it . It was fun . Most of the time they just ride dirtbikes and ATV 's from cops , but when they are in bigger cities they ca n't use them because surveillance . The one time I joined them was in a bigger-ish city ( Tallinn ) . The thing about Tallinn ( specifically the old-town ) is that it has a bunch of older buildings and such . A lot of those buildings have really cool old courtyards kinda built in between them , some of which you can climb into if you can get over the fence/gate . So the one time I joined them , we were running from a relatively slow moving cop car and we climbed into one of those courtyards .

26FtW26,techsupport,"I have this problem here - yesterday , everything was fine . Today I boot up my PC and fix my graphics card ( it was a bit off in the PC ) . Then I open my PC and open Youtube . But there is no sound . It is not my headphones ( I tried different audio devices ) , it is not any of my computer settings either . It is not even my drivers . See , the PC is not picking up that there is an audio device in . When I check the page that shows you the current audio devices , it says that there are no audio devices connected . Also , troubleshooting says that the issue is that there are no audio devices in . Why is this ? I am thinking it might be my sound card or something like that , but I can not be sure . I am running Windows 8.1 Pro . My motherboard is H81M P33 . My GPU is GTX 950 . **EDIT : I tried wiring my PC to make the front panel do audio , did n't work .

Everything was fine in that time period . Then , I open Overwatch . I play one round ( about 10 minutes ) . Then suddenly , both my monitors go black and I hear an error noise through my headphones . I realize - oh shit ; it 's my PC ! I then quickly turn off the PC to avoid any damages . I check all the parts for damage , and there is none . Then I realize my GPU is rather hot . So I make the logical assumption that my GPU must have overheated ( ? ) .And because my monitors are hooked up to my GPU , that 'd explain them going dark . Also , that 's the first time that my monitors have done that . The GPU has no visible damage , though . I then boot up my computer . Then , I had the idea to boot up Overwatch again , and observe my GPU temperature through a program called HWMonitor . And would you look at that - the GPU is at 80C while I 'm in the menu . One thing I did notice , is that my GPU 's fans are extremely weak while they 're going off . When they 're going and I put my hand under them , I barely even feel wind . According HWMonitor , the GPU fans are going at around 2600-2700RPM . ***EDIT : *** I observed spec info while actually playing - temperature never goes over 81 degrees and fans stay at 2600-2700RPM .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"About the breed thing https : //terriermandotcom.blogspot.com.ee/2009/10/pit-bull-rights-verus-pit-bull.html ? m=1 I 've found this long article/opinion ( whatever You call it ) to be pretty much true . The problem is that people do n't make themselves clear what they 're getting into while choosing between breeds . The two extremes ( pits are killers vs pits are nanny dogs ) add fuel to the fire and people tend to pick a side instead of facing the truth . Every breed is different and each dog is different , but there are some things that you can naturally expect from any given breed in general . With a pit there 's a good chance that you have to put a lot more time in socialising the dog compared to retrievers . Ofc , you have to socialise the retriever as well , but it probably ( ! ! ! ) takes less of an effort . When the owner admits that truth , all is well . If he does n't - well , then he may have another example of `` my dog hates other dogs '' on his hands . Meanwhile every retriever owner must know that his dog may be that special one in its breed and either due to a very bad experience or due to genetics/illness/whatever reason be afraid or simply hate other dogs . What 's truly bad ? People following either one of these extreme opinions - pits are killers vs pits are nanny dogs . Edit : I own a golden retriever an while other golden owners I know are more or less ok , this one person sticks out . His dog is extremely well trained when it comes to following rules , but the problem is that the owner has put all his effort into training the dog to follow orders and zero effort into teaching him how to play with other dogs . The result is an agressive young male golden who has attacked a young female ( unprovoked ) , can not read other dogs and does n't know what playtime is . I agree , it 's not a breed thing - it 's the owner that has managed to create a bully . And to be clear , I like pits . We are currently helping a traumatized pit to adjust again . When I asked the owner why does she insist on socialising his dog with a golden and not a pit , the answer fit the stereotype . She has tried , but the other owners simply do n't limit agression , do n't teach their dogs to play gentle , do n't limit games with valuable objects , simply let the dogs fight . As her dog started to pick up these bad habits , she started to find friends from other breeds and it has helped her dog a lot . She 's a true sweetheart .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"& gt ; Well , I am very glad you are here to tell the story ! Well , I truly hope that people do n't forget how painfully stupid , ignorant and violent the USSR was . Nothing like this should ever happen again . & gt ; This makes more sense to me . In Finland they sell lots of reindeer ( not sure exact species ) or used to up to about five years ago , and in other central and southern European countries there is also controlled ( varying by region ) hunting of deer or hoofed animals . About the ban ... Hoofed animals are definitely on the menu , but I sort of doubted for a second about the hunting rules , but yes , dogs are allowed here as well . I 've eaten reindeer meat twice and once it was sort of `` meh , I 've had better '' , the second time it was glorious : P & gt ; Yes , especially if in Estonia there is no stray dog or overpopulation problem ( what is the situation there ? ) and you are importing dogs from shelters in other countries . The situation is far from good . We do n't have dogs ( or cats ) roaming the streets like we used to 2 decades ago , but not every dog is being adopted . People interested in getting a pet do n't bring dogs from foreign shelters . We have plenty in our own shelters and in addition to that there are a couple of people importing street dogs from Russia , Belarus and Ukraine in order to sell them to Finland . That does n't help the situation of our own one bit . The current law demands all of the dogs that leave shelters to be sterilized or castrated . I do n't like the idea of it as I think that most owners actually do manage to avoid unwanted litters and many of the dogs are far from fully grown , but at the same time we continue the endless battle of explaining why it 's not ok to let some random dogs make puppies `` out of love '' and then try to sell them as purebred without the evil FCI papers . Then again , I think it has gotten a lot better . & gt ; Spain is a bit far away for rescues I guess , though I can see an Estonian wanting to buy a Spanish Water Dog and getting it from a breeder in Spain , the UK or some other country closer to you . My dogs father is from Southern France , so that unethical puppymiller drove all the way and back to bring herself a champion and then start milling away . My friends friend bought a dog from Turkey . They both drove half way . & gt ; We drove to France over a couple of days ( with 4.5 month old Spanish Mastiff puppy in the car with us ! ) to collect our 8 week Beauceron . Wow ! I ca n't stand my kids in the car that long , but maybe a couple of dogs are ok : D I think that the mindset that You have is the correct one . It 's just a couple of days on the road , but You 're going to spend years with that dog later on . You ca n't risk a bad breeder . & gt ; What you say about the breeders there is awful . Sadly there are so many unethical situations in so many places . Ugh . Not all breeders are like that of course , but there are problems with goldens , labradores , german shepherds . The breeds are simply so popular and the demand for dogs is so high that the breeders have no problem protecting each other as they use each other 's dogs in breeding . I researched my dogs breeder for 2 months , called over 15 people . She was so nice and my dogs parents are actually with very good temperaments and looks . Yet the health ... Only after I gt my puppy did I start finding odd things about him . Oh , the lies , I was told ! ! ! The I accidentally met the doctor that had chipped my puppy . She immediately recognized the dog , told me horror stories and all the pieces started to fall into place . All thanks to one vet and 0 other breeders . I 've learned my lesson the hard way and can only tell about my story advising everybody to be EXTRA careful with the extremely popular breeds . & gt ; I am really sorry about all your puppy 's health problems . I hope you can keep her fit and healthy with the right food . Thank You ! It 's getting better : ) It was truly horrible and at times I did n't think he would make it . He 's such a sweet puppy , loves us dearly and we love him to the moon and back . & gt ; Often people make a mistake or do n't choose the best breeders with their first dog . I did n't know any better the first time I bought a dog , but by the time I got my second and contacted that breeder , it was very different . Really excellent in so many ways . You live and learn . : ) The thing is - I tried to pick the best one . She 's still spoken about as a very good breeder . I 've pointed out that she knew about the healt issues even before breeding and it does n't seem to turn any heads . She has males that everybody wants as they are the champions . And those everybody just keep their mouths shut . I ordered the ichthyosis test for my dog and after receiving the results , posted them to 3 different databases ( one local , 2 international ) . Who ever wants to will get to the info . I refuse to just sit on this and do nothing . Only after I faced some other puppy owners did they admit that oh , yeah , they are havng some major issues themselves . So sad ... I home goldens lose their popularity and then only the good breeders remain/emerge .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"Just like in most of Europe , Estonia has also banned cropping and docking . You can import a cropped/docked dog , but the procedures could not be done in Estonia ( and no , there are no clinics that might do it for any sort of money ) . People used to have personal protection dogs ca 20 years ago due to the rough times there were in the country , but not any more . Due to the climate , dogs that by breed standard are meant to `` guard '' homes AND are able to do so , need to have very thick double coats and are not in any danger of being cropped/docked . So no doberman is actually used to guard anything here . There are people who like the look of mutated ears and tails , but they are a minority and mostly just show-offs . Serious breeders and people who want to train their dogs to the highest standards do n't import docked/cropped dogs . As far as I know , our military , police and customs tend to use other breeds . There is no necessity to crop/dock anyone . Edit : Yes , u/SharpStiletto is correct . At least in Europe , personal protection dogs is either a thing of the past or has n't been a thing at all .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"It 's a non-issue . In Europe most dogs are intact and do n't break their tails . If an ear infection occurs , then medication is used and all is well again . Dogs communicate with their tails and ears . Why would you want to cut these things off just in case ? If you think that dogs with long tails and floppy ears is a problem then cutting them off is not the solution . You will be cutting every single dog and there is no end to that . The real solution is not buying these dogs and as the demand drops , only the breeds with very short tails and pointi ears remain . You do n't seem to want to do that . Somehow you think that cropping and docking is the preferred option .",Uralic,Estonian

Huskys , Malamutes , Samoyeds , Beagles , Jack Russells and pugs are also very popular . What about in your area in general ? Does it tend to tilt towards short-haired breeds ?

So no , a dog is legally not exactly the same as a car . The thing is that in most of Europe docking , cropping and declawing without a valid medical reason is considered the same as abusing your pet . In the US it 's not . It 's pointless to argue that the government should n't regulate it when you already let the government take away pets from people who do n't treat them right .

6unauss,dogs,"Ultimatums where a thing in the soviet times ... What can I say - I almost died because of the idiotic rules . You see , I was born at the end of the month , and the limit of that month 's caesareans had already been exceeded . The delivery lasted 42 hours , but that did n't matter . So , if it was told that each `` member state '' needed to create it 's own dog breed , then that became the new plan : D I read the second quote and looked into it as it sounded wrong . It is wrong . By 1934 , the number of huntable animals had catastrophically reduced . and new regulations were designed to prevent further decline . In 1937 a hight limit of 45 cm was set to hounds and in 1940 it was raised up to 55 cm on one condition - that the hound would not pursue deer ( do n't know the correct terms ) . To be sure , the dogs were tested for it . This favored the use of low growing hound hunting . Today there does n't seem to be such ban . Plus we have tons of deer , moose ect . You 'd be suprised how many rare breeds exist here . It 's absolutely possible that we have some dogs of your breeds . Short-haired breeds are gaining popularity mainly because the mindset that a dog has to live outside , has to endure -30 degrees celsius ect has shifted . I currently own a 9 mo golden retriever , but a year ago I was seriously considering KromfohrlÃ¤nders . There are still none of there dogs here . I managed to find some in Finland , but decided to get a golden due to some personality traits that would n't have suited us . Still - I almost took the leap and brought the first KromfohrlÃ¤nder to live in Estonia . There are tons of people like me here , who actually travel far longer distances and come back with a breed that nobody knows about . It 's a breath of fresh air . My golden truly has the best personality and suits our relaxed lifestile well , but I really regret feeding the popular breed market . I was severely lied to by the breeder that was fully aware that my dogs mother and dad should be off in terms of breeding , we 've left a hughe amount of money to the vet office , to the emergency room and now on top of the allergies , gastrointestinal problems , ichthyosis and food intolerance - I have a suspicion that all is not well with the puppy 's hips . I 've done tons of detective work and it seems to be the same pattern with all the popular breeds . As the country is small and all the breeders know each other , they have formed a protective circle . Even the better breeders do n't tell the truth about the unethical ones . And they know ! I 'm fairly sure that my next dog will be either a rescue mutt or some unpopular breed to avoid feeding these scumbags . The dogs are suffering and my heart just brakes .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"They say no , because the client wants it , is willing to pay and it 's not illegal . I already asked about it in another comment , but I 'm going to repeat it again . Do you all honestly think that it 's a final and absolutely ok solution to keep cutting dogs tails and ears off ? And let 's not even discuss the ethics , or the dogs feelings ect . Is it really the only way ? If you truly belive that the ears and tails are a medical problem , cut the damn demand on these dogs and the breeders will either start looking for a solution or other breeds will emerge . As long as there is demand for the dogs that are produced today , the breed will not change towords the direction where no cutting is needed . There are so many breeds that are not being cut . Saying : `` But I want this one ! '' while disregarding the fact that with the breed comes a problem ( according to you ) is simply immature . If the ears and tails are such a problem as you say - then there are truly defective dogs being bred in North-America . I do n't belive that , but if this is the case , then put an end to this and do n't support the production of deffective dogs .",Uralic,Estonian

The vet ultimately decides , but that does n't rule out legislation that : 1 ) gives the supervising organ ( animal services or whatever it is in your area ) the tools to take action if they suspect that the reasons are not valid ( ask the vet some proof , for example ) ; 2 ) gives vets the tools to decline from said procedure even if the owners insist , but there is no medical reason for it ; 3 ) gives clear instructions to your local FCI sub-organisations ( or what ever it is that is responcible for shows and other competitions in your area ) to ban dogs that have been `` modified '' from the shows .

6unauss,Documentaries,"I agree 100 % , but wanted to add that it 's always about pipelines , weapon sales , some zika funds to scam money out of ect . Never about democracy or freedom ! I 'm no flat earth believer , but have seen oh so many scams in my life that I do not consider everything that the government officials , `` star-scientists '' like Bill Neye and other well funded people with conflict of interest say as the pure truth that can not be challenged . The reason why it 's impossible to come up with a solution to the problem stems from missing dialogue . The opponents are extremes , the elite is either divided into two extremes or misrepresented by the sensationalist media . Pick a side ! Everything and everyone are either black or white ! All this talk about saving the planet while the war industry is on full gear ? ? ? That 's why most of Europe does n't believe what the USA has to say . What we see in Europe - The USA goes in ( as we 've seen multiple times , the `` last straw '' for the USA has been based on a lie ) to bring `` freedom '' ( read : sell weapons , build pipelines , expand its market ect ) , shit hits the fan , Europe gets to deal with the flood of refugees , the USA wipes its hands clean , shouts `` freedom '' , in comes McDonald 's and Starbucks . I 'm 90 % certain that even if you do n't consider racism , fear , lack of funds and other reasons , the feeling that the USA just shat on Europe and expects us to eat that shit now is a vastly underestimated feeling that lurks in the hearts of many Europeans . The feeling that we are no longer in control is something that is especially familiar to the ex-soviet part of Europe . We 've been there , we 've seen how it does n't work , we 're STILL trying to integrate the 30 % , some of which does n't want to integrate . It 's shitty even over half a century later . I 'm not against bringing in refugees , but order must remain and we 're not able to take in more than we can handle . For example the ultra liberal side must understand that each country has its laws and the refugees must follow them as well . There has to be a mechanism to send back the ones that do n't follow the law . Today , this mechanism is missing and it 's a problem . The far right side must look deep inside them and find compassion . The thing is that as long as the USA does n't taste the shit that it 's brought upon Europe , these wars will continue to take place . Old wars and lies will be forgotten and new ones will be started . If by any chance the USA is challenged by China or Russia and pushed from the world police position , nothing will change in terms of refugees . The place of origin and the destination may change , but not much more . The solution does n't lie in not letting everybody into Europe . The solution is to eliminate the initiative to start these wars . The one that offers a way to do that is actually worth a peace prize .

6unauss,DIY,"Smart lighting could help a lot , but if you do n't plan to keep the lights on all the time , you should still consider the amount of natural light reaching your room and bouncing off the walls . Depending on the purpose of the room you may consider a mirror near the window on the wall that light hits the most or on the wall opposing the window . The point is to capture all natural light and spread it in the room . It may not suit if it looks wierd or for example reflects light into the eye of somebody sitting on the sofa . If the room gets extra small amount of natural light , you can also consider painting the window wall lighter than the rest ( even white may suite ) . As the wall where the window is gets less light than the other walls , it seems darker in contrast to the window and other walls . You can brighten the whole wall by painting it in a lighter color . If you have perfect walls with smooth finish , you can pick a glossy paint that also reflects light . Avoid it if the walls are not that smooth .

Thirdly - because doing business with the Americans , Brits , Australians ect is impossible without speaking English yourself . They rarely know any other language . Granted - the British are slightly better at that and sometimes can at least understand French or German . In most of Europe it 's simply considered a sign of illiteracy to be able to speak less than 2 foreign languages . 3 is ok and above 4 is very good . English is more widespread as it is a very simple language to learn . Most of the other European languages are far more complex and require more time and dedication . I would also argue about French , German , Spanish and Italian people not speaking English . I have NEVER encountered negativety about that , but what I 've heard from my American friends , is that it depends on the accent . Variations of American accent might be frown upon . That does n't mean that the French do n't want to speak English . They might not want to speak AMERICAN English . I 'm not defending them , just noting the nuance .",Uralic,Estonian

The films , the foreign tv shows ect . It 's the law . Everything in the movies everything has translation . Considering the entertainment industry - English simply sticks , but You have a choice . There is ALWAYS translation .

6unauss,pics,"I do n't want to understate the contribution of these people in any way , but felt the need to point out that no one went there voluntarily . USSR picked people from it 's soviet republics and forced them to go . For example from Estonia alone 4833 men ( 20-39 years old ) where sent there . Many of the people had NO CLUE whatsoever that this `` mission '' was going to be somehow dangerous . They were lied to and in order for You to understand why they did not suspect anything ... There was NO free media , even the Ukranians did n't know exactly what had happened . Whenever there was ( is ) a catastrophe in the USSR ( Russia ) , the so-called media always belittles the impact , delays the news and avoids asking any help ( khm- [ Kursk ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kursk_\ ( K-141\ ) # Naval_exercise_and_disaster ) -khm ) . Few had somehow got the word that the `` emergency '' was actually more like a disaster . Those , who knew that and had ANY contacts in the system , used them and did everything to avoid going . 85 % of the men remained there 3-4 months although it was promised that no one should be in the area more than two months ( well , the USSR lied a lot ) . The main protective gear was cottonwool mask . Iodine was given to 30-40 % of the men and with such a delay , that it was useless . Altogether there were 600 000 â liquidators â . 50 people died shortly after the catastrophe and it has been estimated that another 4000 lives have been/are shortened due to the radiation . In addition during the 3 years following the accident 1800 cases of thyroid cancer among children was discovered . Reports claim that absolutely everyone survived the cancer , but still - not a walk in the park kind of disease . What we can learn from this is that many lives could have been spared if the plant had been in a more developed and less who-gives-a-fuck-about-human-loss country than the USSR . Or ... probably had n't happened at all . The people that were sent to Chernobyl are heroes , yes ... but most became that due to the terror of USSR . Edit : Fixed wording .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,DIY,"& gt ; peat Well , that was deffinately not the case as I have always grown my strawberries in the same peat-soil mixture sold in plantations and meant for containers . The thing is that some of the containers ( and the drainage point ) were too deep for most strawberry species ( probably not the right word ) that tend not to grow their roots as deep as other species . The others were too shallow ( roots constantly in water ) . Tried growing cucumber and tomatoes as well ( again special soil from plantation ) - neither liked the conditions . The containers worked with flowers though . Have used the same soil in the country yard ( dug a hole , lined with weed-block ( also blocks some smaller pests ) and in the new containers - everything grows like crazy . Edit : grammar",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,DIY,"Have used several smaller versions of this system and to be honest - it only works with specific plants . You have to choose plants considering the exact depth where the drainage point is . Even then You ca n't expect it to work when the plant is not fully grown . This makes the system pointless in case You want to grow the plants from seeds . As I already had the containers , I tried to make it work for 4 years and always got to the point where some plants with roots going way deeper or never reaching the point , where the water is , needed to be watered from the top . Last year I finally gave up and built wooden containers with a mesh lining in the bottom , plastic lining covering the whole of the inside ( poked some holes in the bottom ) and wheels underneath . As the conteiners are situated on a tiled surface , I added shallow plastic container pans that do n't let the water ruin the tiles . I grow strawberries in these containers and must say , that thanks to the proper watering and wheels I have managed to double the harvest . I turn the containers frequently and this seems to stimulate the plants to produce more strawberries . It also makes it easy to shelter the plants from heavy rain , winds and hail storm - simply push the containers under some shelter . I really advise to try this instead of messing with watering from below . It only works if You choose the `` correct '' plants . Edit : http : //imgur.com/a/bhNTI Added 2 photos taken with a potato , unfortunately did n't take a photo of the mesh stapled under the garbage bags . I plan to replicate the containers in my country house , but then make the containers larger and pick industrial sized wheels for easyer maneuvering .",Uralic,Estonian

If You had seen Your parents ' naked bodies and not just once , but up until say seven years of age , You probably would n't think of it as a wierd thing and there would be no false shame .

From what I 've heard it seems that North America is very conservative considering anything related to naked bodies AND children .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,tifu,"As I used to be a swimmer ( and here in Estonia most swimming pools have gender specific showers without any partition walls ) , I did n't have a choice and showering naked in front of 20 naked women was simply a fact . Then again I think that this boosted my confidence as a teenager . I learned that there are very few women with `` perfect '' bodies and most of us have some flaws . Ergo - most men must have just as imperfect bodies as women ! I suddenly realised that I had absolutely nothing to stress about . The fact that one of my breasts was a bit larger than the other or that I had a quivering ass did not matter at all . My husband has a similar bacground and used to shower after football ( soccer to You ) practice with 20 naked dudes . So , because of that environment and the fact that my husband also knows what the average female body looks like , we do n't feel uncomfortable being naked in front of each other . I truly belive that if we lived in a place where only perfectly filled breasts , butts and six-packs were exposed , neither of us would be as chill walking around at home naked and that would n't be a bad thing either . If the marriage is happy and full of love then hell - do n't undress at all or go naked all the time ! Other people should not have a say in that : ) Oh and about the part of You considering Yourself conservative ... A formerly religious friend of mine used to be extremely conservative and I really could n't imagine her finding a husband outside her church ( Estonia is considered the least religious country in the world and that limited her options ) . Well , today she is 32 years old , married and expecting her first child , but what 's more - she married to a man from another church and today they are flaming atheists AND nudists ! ! ! That 's far too extreme for me . So , be warned ( take it as a joke ) - You too may one day become a nudist : D Edit : typo",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,tifu,"You are right , probably there is a limit and it depends on both the child and the level of nudity that the parents are showing .

I am a woman , several of my friends have had abortions , I 've gone to the clinics with them , supported them , told them that it 's really going to be ok . I am pro-choice , but ... Am I missing something important about the law ? ? ? How the hell is 27 weeks the line in US , but in Europe many children are born on week 24 and survive ? ! ? ! An infant born on week 27 does n't survive on it 's own either . It needs immediate medical attention in order to survive and in order to develop further . Being pro-choice , I truly belive that drawing the line after week 12 is absolutely adequate if there are exceptions left in case the fetus has serious development problems . What kind of education system does the US have if there is such a necessity for abortions AFTER week 12 ? What are Your sex-ed classes good for if such a vast number of pregnancys are undetected before week 12 or so many girls and women know about the unwanted pregnancy and decide to abort it later and not sooner ? ! The later the abortion is carried out , the riskier it is for the mother . How is this not acknowledged ? You are comparing the 12-week ban with other states . What about the rest of the world ? At one point you have to accept that reclessness , stupidity and ignorance can not be tolerated and do n't deserve freedom . With freedom comes responsibility , especially if it involves other lives . It is not ok to do harm in the name of freedom . Yes , I too have been recless ( actually an idiot ) and just been lucky . I own up to it . After these incidents I took the SOS-pill and started taking pregnancy tests as the sex-ed classes had taught me that being an idiot does not exempt one from the consequences and responcibility .

In that way You can train the puppy to wait/follow You and teach him that You will not follow him . Changing pace and direction is a great and very mild way to do that . The more You show him that watching You is the most important thing , the easier it is to walk with him later . Bring the pace down , stop for breaks , let him run around while You sit down ( a simple way to see if he might be tired after all ) .

6unauss,dogs,"First of all - I agree ! You need a proffessional to teach You . There are many problems starting with lack of exercise and ending with aggression . I 'd say that the barking is the least of Your problems . Now , the thing is that exercise consists of two parts - physical and mental . It 's rather easy to take the dogs for a walk ( one dog at a time , once a day at least 1 hour , the other walks can be short ) , but their minds need exercise as well . As the outside world is intimidating for at least one of the dogs , You need to exercise them mentally it in Your own home . How food-motivated are they ? The base of most training is the fact that You own food . The dogs have to EARN food from You . Remember to practice these things with one dog at a time . You can replace any of these words with what suits You best . 1 . Take some treats ( or kibble ) . Put one piece in Your right hand . Let the dog concentrate on Your right hand . Show the dog that You have the treat and say WAIT . If it tries to take it , close Your palm and hold Your finger up as a sign . After the dog calms down , show him the treat again and repeat it until the dog waits at least 2 seconds . Then say TAKE and let the dog eat the treat . Do n't expect much patience at first . The purpose is to let the dog understand what WAIT means . That can be useful learning to be silent and wait in the cage , wait for food ect . TAKE is important so that the dog understands that he is under command and is realeased only after You say so . Try this with soft food as well . Hold some canned food in Your closed hand and order the dog to wait . If it does so , squeeze some food out saying TAKE and let him lick the food . Once in a while tell him to wait and stop squeezing . 2 . When WAIT and TAKE are clear , start practicing with a non-favourite toy . A rope is really good for that . Keep treats nearby and start practicing taking away the toy . How ? Take a treat in Your left hand , approach the dog and holding the treat offer a switch telling him THANKS . If the switch goes well , approach the dog with a treat in Your pocket , hold the rope from both ends , say THANKS and offer the dog a treat . If the dog is not ok switching , offer better/larger treats or start with something less interesting than a rope . Normally I would recommend teaching the dog to give away objects by putting Your index fingers behind the object inside the dogs mouth , BUT as at least one of them has agression problems it might be better to leave this for the future . 3 . Your dog Max seems to show food related agression . The exercises above are just babysteps in overcoming that . I would seriously suggest You to start feeding Your dogs from hand in order to show them who controls food . If You want to give Your dogs bones , let them wait and then give the TAKE command . As switching treats for toys becomes easier , You can start switching treats for bones . Do n't leave him hanging and give the bone back as You see that the dog has eaten the treat . Always use WAIT and TAKE commands . These exercises are something that You should first teach Your dogs and then let them do these with Your family members and boyfriend . The ability to trust Your boyfriend and give him the toy should reduce some problems . If You are not always able to feed the dogs from hand , You can also use toys that can be filled with canned food and then frozen ( Kong toys ) . If Your boyfriend arrives to Your place , give the dog a Kong toy filled with yummy food . It may help .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,puppy101,"This ! A 16 week old puppy needs 3 feeding times that should be no more than 10 hours apart . The pup is just hungry . It 's totally fine to feed the puppy , go for a 15 minute walk ( moving at a faster pace helps the puppy poop ) and then tuck him in for the night . It 's like with human babies - eating right before bedtime is absolutely ok .

The cribs are often given away for free and the parts are totally useable .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"You 're mixing things up a bit . Teaching Your dog to hunt for treats does not mean leaving a bunch of treats around . Te point should be mental stimulation and it should be done in a controlled situation under Your orders . For example making a trail of saucers leaving treats under some of them and teaching Your dog to find the ones with food under them . He should be allowed to eat the treat only after You give the permission . All is not lost , but You ca n't turn back time . You have to keep in mind that most retrievers are constantly hungry . Please forget the shock collar and mouse traps . You would simply be punishing Your dog for something that YOU teached him to do . That 's as wrong as can get . Instead teach Your dog two orders - WAIT and TAKE . I 'll copy-paste my own instructions from another post : You can replace these order words with what suits You best . Take some treats ( or kibble ) . Put one piece in Your right hand . Let the dog concentrate on Your right hand . Show the dog that You have the treat and say WAIT . If it tries to take it , close Your palm and hold Your finger up as a sign . After the dog calms down , show him the treat again and repeat it until the dog waits at least 2 seconds . Then say TAKE and let the dog eat the treat . Do n't expect much patience at first . The purpose is to let the dog understand what WAIT means . TAKE is important so that the dog understands that he is under command and is realeased only after You say so . Try this with soft food as well . Hold some canned food in Your closed hand and order the dog to wait . If it does so , squeeze some food out saying TAKE and let him lick the food . Once in a while tell him to wait and stop squeezing . By practicing it consistently , Your dog learns to hold himself back when it comes to food . At the same time look for mental stimulation exercises involving treats . The one with saucers is good , but Youtube is full of other good ideas . The point is that all these exercises should be done under YOUR control . If You want some fun for Your dog while You 're not around , find special toys that are meant for that ( Kong toys , puzzles ) . NEVER leave any food around or shit in the toilet ! You have to aknowledge what kind of breed You have at home and not fool Yourself . Retrievers live to eat . It 's what they love the most in life . Do n't punish him for that . Instead avoid situations where it might be a problem . If Your roommates do n't understand this , You can buy shock collars and mouse traps for them .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"Thank You for the clarification . To tell You the truth - I 'd move with the dog . If You ca n't trust Your roommates , It 's bound to end badly as it is an unrealistic expectation that Your dog smells some chicken bones on a plate left on the coffe table for 8 hours while You 're away and does n't react to it . You ca n't fill Your whole home with mouse traps . Dogs are opportunistic and even if he learns that eating from the bin ends with pain ... He will not associate this with eating from a random plate . Edit : spelling",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"I 'm just finding it very hard to imagine the traps working . Your dog is not an idiot and will soon pick up where the traps are and how to avoid them . Plus mouse traps can really do some damage . Most of them are designed to break the mouse 's neck . I do n't know how much You 're willing to invest , but there are garbage bins that are more difficult for dogs to open . There are sort of railings that prevent children and dogs from grabing stuff from the counters , there are toilet systems that close the lid after the person has stood up . Maby these might help , but still ... there 's the coffee table that You ca n't control . Edit : One more thing .

6unauss,AskReddit,"I think that there is a lot of money at stake on both sides and that makes people lie , manipulate , bend the truth ect . The things presented to us are rarely 100 % true . Think of any subject that You are an expert in and how much bs the ( social ) media produces about that subject . You can probably see the connections between the news sources and money when it comes to the fields You 're familiar with . Why would You think that it 's any different in other fields . I 've personally read a lot of scientific papers on the subject and it 's not that clear cut as the media presents it to us . The `` 97 % of all scientists '' claim is absolute bs . That alone does n't mean that the deniers are 100 % correct . The main problem is that it 's considered stupid and uncool to challenge the claims of the supporters . Now THAT is truly unscientific . Whenever someone tries to point out the serious flaws of research that does n't allow the claims to be definitive , he is targeted by blind believers that have stopped questioning . And that applies to both sides . Yet , questioning everything plays the most important part in the curious minds that we should be , but no longer are . I believe ( as there is no definitive proof ) that there are changes happening . We can not predict the severity of the changes and we are not able to pinpoint ALL of the causes . One of these seems to be human activity , but then again , there are other causes originating from out of space , from the Earth itself . The numbers vary A LOT depending on where and how the observation has taken place , who finances the research and what't the researchers ' bias before starting their work . The media tends to show us poor polar bears fighting for their lives due to melting ice , but fails to point out that the south pole ice breaks maximum records . It 's just called bad public relations . I 'd compare the whole subject with vaccinations . If the supporters ( and I 'm one of them ) would stop lying and stick to the whole truth each time , then the opponents would n't have as much ammunition . The problem is human nature .

6unauss,dogs,Wow ! I 'd find an other trainer ... I truly hope that You can find a solution . It 's not the dog 's fault that he has that kind of an urge to eat everythng . I have a golden retriever and believe me - I know the challenges . On the other hand You can see it as a plus . High food motivation makes training with treats super easy . Use that to teach Your dog things that some dog owners would n't even think about . Labs can be amazingly obedient dogs ( with some exceptions in the food department ) . By training obedience Your dog gradually learns to control his urges even when it comes to food and even when You 're not around ( it takes a very long time ) . It 's funny what You said about surviving in the nature . I always say that about goldens . They would die in a couple of days in the wild .

This is the only disrict in Tallinn that was designed to accomodate all services , living spaces and jobs within itself . The only two things that were not built were a cinema and a theatre . The plan was grand , but even then unrealistic as people still tended to work outside the district .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,UrbanHell,"What ! ? ! ? ! ? I had no idea ! My sister visited Romania a few months ago , but apparently visited the tourist traps and nothing else . I had no idea about this . She described Bukarest as one of the most interesting places she 's been .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,Children play around her home as well and yet she poops INSIDE her own house every day . Can You imagine !,Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"I never said that I oppose that . I have 2 children myself . I 'll explane You briefly how it 's solved in most of Europe , but specificly in Estonia . The standard procedure is that all girls and women register their pregnancies before week 12 . Local financial aid ( that absolutely everybody receives ) depends on that . If You register Your pregnancy before week 12 , You will receive that aid , if not , You wo n't . The number of pregnancies not registered before week 12 is truly very tiny . Belive me , the human body works pretty much the same on both continents . Up until the end of week 12 it 's possible to abort the pregnancy without any medical reasons . Most doctors perform ultrasound , blood and urine tests ect before week 12 as well , but the ultrasound during week 13 is mandatory for everybody . This determines some risks . During week 15 additional blood-tests ( here called the triple-test ) are done . These combined with the week 12 ultrasound determine if it 's necessary to take a DNA test on week 18 . As there are risks involved , an additional ultrasound is done before that and the doctor then decides if there is any risk of a severely unhealthy baby or not . After that up until week 24 another ultrasound ( called infant anatomy ) is done and that is really the most important one as by then it 's 99,9 % clear if the baby has serious abnormalities . Up until week 24 it 's possible to abort the pregnancy DUE TO MEDICAL reasons ( that means problems with the baby OR the mother ) . Of course all these and all other blood and urine tests , health checks are free .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"I wrote it in another reply , but how is this possible , that in Europe the % of women that do n't get to the doctor before week 12 is paltry , but in the US it seems to be such an issue ? There is something seriously wrong with the WHOLE system in the US and the ones that suffer are women AND unborn children .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"This is exactly what sex-ed teaches in Estonia . If You 're having sex and You would deffinately abort the pregnancy , You need to test yourself once in 2-3 months . If You do n't have regular periods ( I had my period once a year before my first child ) , You have to take extra care . It 's not an excuse ! ! ! Human body is not that different in the US . You can apply that regret factor to ANY period of time . That 's why there is counceling , that 's why it is taught from an early age to detect pregnancy EARLY .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"Well , Reddit is usually so very proud of the freedom of speech .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"No worries . I actually expected a far worse response : D The thing is that it 's really unexeptable that the US has it covered when it comes to so many other fields , but healthcare - WTF ? ! ? Why is this less important than police forces and firefighters ? Why is educating children a taboo in many groups and the government allows clueless parents to raise their children ignorant ? Each next generation is supposed to be smarter , have better access to more TRUE information .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"You DO understand that it was irony ? No ? You do understand that I 'm not American and do n't give crap about Your constitution . BTW , yes , it is possible in Europe to go to prison for Reddit comments . In fact it has happened in many countries for extreme manifests about Jews and I 'm fairly sure that this would also happen in the US if anybody felt that the comment incited violence against some group of people or one specific one . The medical professionals in Europe have decided that the limit for abortion in case of non-medical reasons is 12 weeks and in case of medical reasons 24 weeks . It has been suggested by the medical community and turned into a law by the parliaments .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,OldSchoolCool,"Do You have a link to any of the tests where these third row seats are involved ? I looked and could n't find any . The rear window is one issue , but there 's hardly any crumple zone and I truly do n't belive that the kids ' feet would be safe .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,OldSchoolCool,"Well , that 's the thing . The floor of the boot is intact , but the boot is collapsed ( probably due to the fact that it was a tractor , which makes the point of impact higher ) . Looking at the pictures nobody can say how far the boot collapsed right at the time of the accident . Of course it bounces back . Again - it may just as well be , that the additional structure works , but as long as there are no crash tests released ... It 's just a guess .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"It 's also about the principles that the Americans carry regarding abortion and personal rights . Instead of forcing Your local politics and congress to solve the shitty situation about inadequate sex-ed , inaccessible abortions and health care in general , You are cheering that it is possible to abort a pregnancy ( and I do n't mean for medical reasons ) after the fetus has grown significantly , the abortion has become a serious risk to the mothers health and the fetus might very likely survive if born alive at that time . Do n't You see where the problem is ? You do n't get what You pay for . This is not freedom for women . It should n't be a right to do more harm than necessary and while I agree that today , ( due to the inaccessibility of abortions ) it might be necessary for the limit to be at 24 weeks , at the level of economics , medicine , social capability ect that the US is today , there is NO REASON why it should remain at that . Other , and much poorer countries are able to do that . Why ca n't You ? ! The ones that are n't taught proper sex-ed , are n't even given a chance to decide for themselves . Where 's the freedom in that ? Freedom to drive 50 miles to a clinic to have an abortion during week 25 ? It 's bad . Really bad ! It 's like third world bad . You could make it legal to abort the fetus on week 38 . It would n't mean more freedom for women . Most would probably call it extremely selfish and barbaric . Well , for comparison - In Europe it 's considered barbaric to kill a healthy fetus during week 27 . I already explained why . I read these posts here and feel as if You 're simply being hoaxed . Hoaxed into beliving that Your freedom has been taken care of , while actually it 's not . I ask again - Why is it considered freedom to not educate Your children properly ? Why is it not considered neglection ? Why is it called freedom to not have access to proper health care ? Just do something about it instead of praising the authoroties for turning the situation even shittier .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,aww,"Question : I have a son with anxiety problems and we are currently waiting for a golden retriever puppy ( mother and grandfather are therapy dogs , father has the same personality , but as it looks rather stunnig , it 's a show dog ) . We are hoping for the puppy to have the same personality as it 's parents and therefore start training it as soon as possible to become a much needed help for our son . But ... I 'm thinking about what happens when the dog dies . I know that it probably lives a good 12 years , but what then . How is it usually handeled ? Is a new puppy introduced and trained before the old dog dies ( how might that be possible if the old dog still works and takes care of its owner ) or will the person in need of a service dog live without a dog for a while ? Edit : Do n't live in the US , but still interested in how it 's done over there .",Uralic,Estonian

You are trying to be scandalous , but that 's the thing - everyone can see that it 's just You TRYING Your hardest to make people talk about Your immature books once again . And no , posting an AMA on reddit is not proof in the media nor in court that some sort of international community is behind You .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"From me as well , thanks for the feedback . I 'll only go over the design of the sidebar as gyno already touched on everything else . The reason we went with the update in the first place was because there was an awful lot of text and I felt like the wall of text ( see the mobile version or disable CSS to see the length of it before ) would be discouraging for people and since we really do want people to read the rules we thought it 'd be a good idea to condense it , so we did â by a lot . We tested 3 different designs of expandable rules plus different variations of those as well . I wanted it to fit the overall default look of the subreddit while using the already existing colors from the sidebar . It does say `` hover for more info '' right under the rules , but it 's kind of small ( again to save space ) . We could just make it [ cycle through a rainbow ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/3YLwLUu.gif ) , but I 'm not so sure it would fit the style of the subreddit ^^/s . Feedback and suggestions are always welcome , though , and I 'll be taking another look at it to see how we could further improve and make it more intuitive .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Not exactly , though it certainly can look like it if you bump it all the way to the max . It seems to affect contrast in the mid-tones , making it look more sharp . You can also go into the negative values with clarity which will make your photo look muted and even blurry . It 's better used as an adjustment brush rather than globally across the picture . [ Here 's another dramatic example . ] ( http : //2.bp.blogspot.com/-2dXoEqP9iKk/VSGjsoBe1dI/AAAAAAAAWmc/WwBShJE1c2o/s1600/MitchDeClarifyed.jpg ) Saving both is a good idea , though it 's the option that takes the most space on your card , so only do that if you have a big enough memory card .

[ Here 's an example of what it does . ] ( http : //www.lifeafterphotoshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lightroom-hdr-03.jpg ) If you did n't shoot in raw , I suggest you look into it .

[ I 'd have gone with something tighter on top and bottom ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/dH4w7p7.png ) , even more than what I did , but I wanted to leave the speaker in . You should have also left some more room behind his back for better composition ( always shoot a bit wider , you can later crop ) . Second thing is the green tint . I think warmer tones would fit the old music a bit more , so I did a [ color balance fix ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/agMIl9D.png ) and later also added [ a slight gradient map ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/zEdaQRk.png ) - could n't tell which one I prefer . Since you used an f/1.8 lens , you could have gotten a bit closer to him ( since I cropped off a bit from below ) and achieved a bit shallower depth of field , which would make this shot even better . Not a whole lot , but just enough to blur the background and the TV a bit more . Lastly , [ I noticed this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/4QWQPbJ.png ) . Do n't know what happened there . Seems like you used an adjustment brush , maybe an accident , maybe a compression error , who knows . I 'm not the best at this so do n't take my opinions on everything ( or anything ) as the truth , but I feel like pointing out other people 's mistakes and trying to improve their pictures is a way of learning things myself .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Generally yeah , and yours should too . RAW files are essentially just the raw data that your camera 's sensor captures . JPGs are great for sharing , but if you shoot JPGs straight in the camera , you lose a lot of the detail and editing capabilities as JPGs are already compressed and edited a little bit by your camera ( usually a little bit of contrast and smoothing to get rid of some noise ) . RAWs are much bigger in file size ( generally if you have a 20 megapixel camera , you have a 20MB raw file size ) . Shooting in raw means you will need to do some postprocessing as it rarely looks good straight out of the camera . However , you do get a lot of benefits while shooting raw such as capturing a lot more detail and being able to bring it back even if you under/over exposed ( [ example ] ( http : //www.fastrawviewer.com/sites/fastrawviewer.com/files/field/image/FastRawViewer_ShadowBoost.jpeg ) ) . You can also change your photo 's white balance in a photo editor even after shooting ( something that gets locked if you shoot JPGs ) . I usually just use the automatic setting for white balance on my camera and correct it in post if the camera got it wrong . It 's great not having to worry about it . The downside of raws is that it adds another step to getting your photos out into a final stage where you can share them , because the raw file formats are generally not supported on any image sharing sites , meaning you 'll have to open them in your image editor ( the one you mentioned supports raw editing ) and after editing your photo , you 'll need to save it in a different format ( jpg for photos , generally ) .",Uralic,Estonian

I could have cranked the aperture two stops higher ( max it allows on that focal length ) and the shutter speed also two steps slower to 20 seconds , but given the lack of wind I do n't think the cloud would have moved that much more during those additional 7 seconds .",Uralic,Estonian

If you ca n't fix the lines by simply rotating it a tiny bit ( because of distortion or whatever the case might be ) , Photoshop has this one tool that lets you draw lines over things that should be straight and it will automatically correct it for you .
