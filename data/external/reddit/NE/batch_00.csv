3801,soccer,"In Australian rules football a few years ago diving became quite an issue . It got a lot of attention because a lot of people who follow and play the game like to think of it as a tough sport where anything like diving is a disgrace to the game , to the point where if you spent more than a few seconds on the ground , you 'd want to be going off on a stretcher otherwise you 're a softcock . Anyway , there is a 'push in the back ' rule where , strangely enough , if someone pushes you in the back you get a free kick . As the game has evolved into a fully fledged elite sport , some players began to go to ground at the slightest touch to their back to win a free kick and often a shot at goal . The league 's solution to the problem was not to punish the diving , but to make the rule black and white that any contact to the back would be punished with a free kick . At first there was a bit of outrage from supporters saying the rule was soft and too hard on defenders , but eventually they became used to expecting free kicks being paid for contact that once may not have been punished . More importantly , players soon came to learn that they had to learn to defend without making any contact to the back , and so play has now evolved so that it is no longer an issue . So whilst there was for a little while a rise in the number of 'push in the back ' decisions initially , and groaning from supporters when it happened , players eventually adapted and that rate is back to normal , and diving is no longer an issue .",Germanic,English
3801,soccer,"Yeah I 'm not saying the rule change could directly be transferred to another sport , because the issue , whilst related , is not the same . Goals are far more frequent in AFL and free kicks are taken from where they occur , not a penalty spot , so are less of a sure thing . My point is that a carefully considered rule change could help fix the problem .",Germanic,English

Which you build will depend on who you are and how much infrastructure you have to support a fleet . Generally Fleet Carriers are the best but need a complement of air craft built for them as well.They have much greater range than any other ship and can support land operations with their aircraft whilst other capital ships can only bombard a province adjacent to the sea . I believe battle cruisers are as fast as carriers with close the same firepower as a battleship , but do n't have as much Armour .

1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,http : //www.janes.com/article/54732/russia-to-defend-core-syrian-government-areas I think this is the source the article is using .,Germanic,English
1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,"On the face of it , the remarks made by Iranian President Hassan Rohani during a meeting with senior editors from media organizations on Friday should not have come as a surprise . `` I do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria , '' he said , seemingly contradicting a flurry of reports in recent weeks that Moscow and Tehran were tightly coordinated over the deployment of Russian forces in Latakia , Syria . After Rohani 's unclear statements , Putin 's laconic affirmative to the question posed to him by interviewer Charlie Rose whether his country sent its troops to prevent Bashar Assad 's downfall ( `` You 're right , '' Putin replied ) , was nearly refreshing in its simplicity . We ca n't , of course , accept Putin 's and Rohani 's statements at face value . However , they do show that , despite reports of Iran 's Quds Force commander General Qassem Suleimani 's visit to Moscow and the Fox News report on Friday that Russia and Iran are coordinating actions in Syria from Baghdad , reports by Western journalists stationed in Tehran and Damascus , that Russia 's latest maneuvers `` surprised '' the Iranian leadership and were n't to its liking , were fairly reliable . So far , Russia and Iran were considered to be allies , sharing the common goal of keeping Assad in power . Both supplied arms , lines of credit and military advice to the Syrian regime , with Russia also putting up a diplomatic umbrella by using its UN Security Council veto to prevent anti-Assad resolutions . Iran , through Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militias , supplied manpower to replenish the Syrian army 's thinning ranks . The abrupt entry of the Russian expeditionary force has tilted the scales in the Assad coalition : Russia turned from a distant supporter to an active participant on the ground , becoming overnight a much more influential factor , in a way which made her different interest in the survival of the Damascus regime plainly evident . For the leaders of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran , keeping Syria on the Shi'ite axis as a link to their proxy in Lebanon , Hezbollah , was almost an existential need . Without Syria , Iran 's regional influence and its ability to control what is happening in Lebanon – to direct , arm and maintain Hezbollah as a central force – would have been crippled . For Putin , however , leaving Assad to his fate would have , at worst , lost the Kremlin some of its prestige . The Russian president 's decision to take a chance and invest resources in Syria after all was primarily driven by a desire to take advantage of the vacuum created by U.S. inaction in the Middle East . Putin seeks to create leverage that would allow Russia to regain the place it lost in the international arena in the wake of last year 's invasion of Ukraine . Syria , Assad and Iran 's interests have now become hostages to Putin 's geopolitical goals . The Russian president could decide , for example , as he apparently already agreed to at his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week , to coordinate his steps with Israel as well and to permit the Israeli air force to continue to fly over Syria and attack Hezbollah weapon convoys ( as foreign reports claim Israel has already done in recent years ) . With the consent of Europe and the United States , he could force elections on Assad as well as cooperation with members of the opposition , including those who oppose Iranian involvement in Syria . Putin could decide that it would be better for Russia to involve Iran ’ s Sunni rivals – Saudi Arabia and Egypt – in a future solution to the civil war . Moreover , at any stage , he could also decide to bring the Russian forces home with their gear . Unlike Russia ’ s support for separatists in Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , there is no Russian national yearning for Syrian land in Aleppo and Homs province . In the event of a deal in which Russia would receive Western recognition for a portion of its aspirations in former Soviet areas in return for cooperation in finding a long-term solution in Syria that might stop the flow of refugees to Europe , and maybe even allow their return home , Putin would not hesitate to abandon the Iranians . Another angle in the relationship between Russia and Iran can be currently seen through the eyes of the masses of Syrian refugees flooding European highways . Among them are a considerable number of citizens who are actually from areas and population groups that support Assad . They recount that they decided to leave because they came to the conclusion that even if the Assad regime survives , it will only be as an Iranian satellite - an alterEnglish that in their view , as secular Syrians , is not much more appealing than being ruled by Islamic State . The entry of Russia into the region raises the prospect that areas in Syria that remain under the Assad 's control , or anyone who would replace him , could actually end up under Russian influence , rather than an Iranian Shi ’ ite province . In Western eyes , that may not be such a great deal , but for many Syrians , it would be a lot preferable than the other options .",Germanic,English

1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,"Depends on what Israel is striking . I do n't think the Russians would defend Hezbollah 's equipment or convoys , and this is all Israel has historically targeted . I do n't think Israel will try to snipe the leadership anymore given the risk for escalation at the Lebanese border . Now if Israel attacks the SAA I foresee the Russians firing back or at-least sending some sort of warning . I do n't see them as having much of an option if provoked to not escalate as it would remove the deterrence that the presence of these systems provides .",Germanic,English
1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,"I do n't think Israel is going to protest , but to do as you say and steer clear from each other which is what I meant by deconflictation .

1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,So why is Russia deploying an Anti Air Destroyer to Syria . From that I do n't think it has to do with this war and would be a routine stationing in Tartus . But when I take into account that 4 spotted fighters at this air base are Su 27 air superiority/ Multi Role fighters makes me wonder what the Russians are intending to do . Perhaps they believe that the risk of someone intervening against Russian intervention is real and therefore are deploying Anti Air and Air Superiority assets to prevent this . I found this [ article ] ( http : //www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/russia-sends-ships-mediterranean-syria ) stating that she was deployed to Syria in 2013 during the reaction to the Ghouta chemical weapons atrocity .,Germanic,English

Thunderhammers and powerfists like wise will wreck things in close combat if you want death company . Auto cannons are n't bad either but might have trouble getting through high saves .

A better response is to go to Washington with the shamrocks as usual , and confront him about his Muslim ban . Or even better - make a speech in America to the Irish Americans denouncing it . The problem , as far as I can see it , is that Enda Kenny wo n't have the stones to do that . Either way , I do n't see how either side would benefit from snubbing Trump like this .

The only thing that history has taught us about torture is that when you torture somebody , they 're likely to tell you whatever it is you want to hear , regardless of whether it 's true or not , just to end the torture . Take your nuclear bomb analogy as an example . Imagine that some government ( we 'll say the US for the sake of argument ) is torturing someone who they think may know which city is about to be targeted and when - and the man eventually has enough and tells them that the bomb will land in San Francisco at 4pm . So the US military evacuates everyone they can from San Francisco and they scramble their air force to cover the skies over it . 4pm comes , and nothing happens in San Francisco .

A world where Sherlock uses cold rationality to solve crimes or a fantasy world where people can control minds ? I 'm not trying to be an ass but I just do n't understand where the show 's going . You obviously enjoyed the episode , I did n't . For a detective show , so many things were left completely unanswered . How can Eurus control minds ? If she was building this elaborate saw-like complex in which to torment or test Sherlock and Mycroft why did she try to kill them with a motion sensitive grenade ? If she did n't understand anything about human emotions why did she spend so much time getting close to Watson after meeting him on the bus ?

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; If you accept that constitutional politics was always the only way forward , then I fail to see why they should get credit for being so late to acknowledge it . Especially when they were part of the problem . The cognitive dissonance that people have on this topic is nothing short of incredible to me . Constitutional politics was the only thing that could actually bring about peace in the end - but you seem to be drastically underestimating how difficult it would have been to convert an organisation as inherently violent as the IRA to politics . Adams and McGuinness could n't just get up one morning and say `` You know what , no more violence ! From now on the IRA are political '' . The IRA would have pushed back , and both of them might well have lost any influence they had with them to begin with . It took a long time because it 's not something that can be achieved overnight . & gt ; You praise their `` achievements '' . I do n't see what they 've achieved that would n't have been achieved anyway through politics and the ECHR with far less bloodshed . As far as I can see , all they did was knock a United Ireland back another hundred years . The Troubles was a completely predictable conflict . It became inevitable because of how the orange state was set up and how the majority ( Protestants ) reacted to the pretty tame demands of a minority ( Catholics ) . They reacted with violence , violence and yet more violence . To say that we could have gone from that to a power sharing government through entirely political means is revisionism at its worst . Political methods were already attempted well before the PIRA gained support - that 's what the civil rights movement was all about . It was the reaction of the Loyalist community and the RUC to that movement that led to the growth of the PIRA and the escalation of the conflict . This also began before Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness became involved with either the IRA or Sinn Fein .",Germanic,English

I wo n't defend the blowing up of pubs or the planting of car bombs in streets , because those are indefensible acts - but unlike you , I do n't start the clock in the 1980 's .

No ... that 's not my narrative . Not everyone in the IRA died for equality and not all of them joined because of civil rights . I did n't say that . I was making the point that it seems extremely unlikely to me that we could have gotten to the point where Loyalists and the British government would be willing to engage politically with Republicans and Nationalists without the latter resorting to armed action .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The `` Orange State '' - or Northern Ireland as it existed from the mid 60 's until the 70 's when direct rule was imposed , was a hugely sectarian state .

The civil rights marches that started to take place in the early 70 's opposing these injustices were met with state and , in particular , Loyalist violence . In one incident , entire streets of Catholic residences were burned to the ground in Belfast by armed Loyalist gangs . In reaction to this , the PIRA started to gain more and more support among the Catholic and Nationalist communities because they promised to fight back .

The PIRA in Northern Ireland were a reaction to a pre-existing situation . Catholics and Nationalists were , in effect , second class citizens . They organised peaceful civil rights marches to oppose this and the response of the good , non-terrorist police force of the Northern Irish statelet was to beat these marches off the streets . The response of the loyalist community was to orchestrate what can only be called pogroms against Catholic communities in Belfast . This is the environment that the PIRA grew out of .

Are you disputing that their attempts at civil right 's marches were met with violence on the part of the RUC and state forces ? Are you disputing that Loyalist gangs burned over a thousand Catholics out of their homes in Belfast and elsewhere ? Are you disputing that the PIRA therefore gained support from the Catholic community because of the latter 's treatment at the hands of their own government ? Nelson Mandela was the leader of the violent wing of the ANC ( MK ) . This group was responsible for bombings all over South Africa . These bombings often happened in public places like shopping centres , bars , bins in public streets , and inevitably led to civilian casualties . Sound familiar ? Mandela is ( rightly in my opinion ) remembered for his role in ending Apartheid and his role in promoting peace in South Africa .

Now , I 'm not trying to make these attacks any more palatable and I 'm not trying to justify them - but what I am saying is that you need to have a special kind of wilful ignorance to pretend that the people who joined the `` Old '' IRA were morally superior to people like McGuinness who joined the PIRA in the late 60 's . Both organisations were willing to use extreme violence to achieve their goals - and civilians were caught in the crossfire in both instances . More notable , in my opinion , is the actions of McGuinness after he left the IRA . He turned himself away from violence and he also turned others away from it with him . Northern Ireland is a better place today because of that fact . Plenty of people go down a violent path and never turn back from it .",Germanic,English

You ca n't just sneak into the most secretive , militarised state in the world and waltz up to a man who 's probably surrounded by hundreds of military personnel at any given time .

I happen to think that Brexit has made unification an inevitability . Maybe not in the immediate future but to me , it just does n't make sense to have Northern Ireland outside of the EU and the Republic inside it . Something will give , I think . The onus is really on the Nationalists to show Unionists in Northern Ireland that they have a place in a potentially united Ireland - and I think that with Martin McGuinness ' death , that just became more difficult .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,worldnews,"That 's fair enough , the Troubles affected a lot of people and they ruined a lot of lives .

I would never ask these people to think of Martin McGuinness as a hero because I have no right to . The same goes for the other side . With that being said , I think that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply would have been impossible without men like Adams and McGuinness . It 's pretty hard to describe the gravity of what was achieved . The IRA went from being an organisation that was violent to the core , to laying down their weapons in ceasefire , supporting the peace process and eventually decommissioning all of their weapons under international supervision . That 's no mean feat and it must have taken a lot of strongly willed people to bring that about . McGuinness was undoubtedly one of the main men in that regard , along with Adams . The Good Friday Agreement is probably the most important document signed by the UK and Ireland since the Anglo Irish Treaty .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"McGuinness grew up in a sectarian statelet that viewed Catholics like him as second class citizens and who responded to their demands for civil rights with extreme violence . The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit . Northern Ireland is a better place today because they managed to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Plenty of men go down the violent path and never turn back .

I 'm not going to sit here and try to defend planting bombs in public areas because that 's indefensible . But it seems to me that if your sole objective is to kill civilians then it seems odd that you would give warnings before you do so .

Pretending that the IRA targeted civilians when they planted bombs in public areas but that MK were only targeting industry and economy when they did it is ... well , ridiculous - especially when the IRA gave warnings before their bombs and MK did n't ( as far as I 'm aware , correct me if I 'm wrong ) . Also , McGuinness was n't second in command of the IRA overall - he was second in command of the IRA 's operation in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday .

He 's obviously served his time . /s I do n't , I just happen to think that peoples attitudes on this subject tend to be hypocritical . Mandela 's an example of someone who completely supported using violence to achieve political change , only to change in his later years ( but not a whole lot as that article I linked shows ) .

You can tack on `` according to Sinn Fein supporters '' all you like but it does n't diminish the fact that there was little to no public support for armed rebellion in the Republic until the British were foolish enough to execute the leaders of the 1916 Rising . Also , Irish people in the mid 10 's were n't treated as second class citizens in their own country - as was the case in Northern Ireland when the PIRA began to gain support . There was nothing glamorous about the way the `` Old '' IRA fought the war of independence either . It was bloody , it was brutal and it often led to the deaths of innocent people as well as British forces . That 's how guerrilla warfare tends to go .

I do n't know why you seem to think you 're being controversial here because you 're not .

Your point about the government is n't exactly accurate either . Look up the Arms Crisis . Two cabinet members ( Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney ) attempted to smuggle arms to the PIRA in the North .

Do you think he 'd be immediately assassinated after calling out Gerry Adams ? If everything he 's saying about Adams is true then that would be an incredibly stupid move because it would all but confirm it to the public . The point I 'm making is that it 's an allegation made by someone we do n't know anything about apart from what you heard on that programme . You 're saying it 's dumb for people to mindlessly defend Adams and it is - but it 's also dumb to completely believe what a TV programme is saying when they 've provided scant to no evidence to back it up .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,"I 'm not sure what you want me to tell you - what you 've said is right , but the prevailing attitude at the time was that France was the biggest land power in Europe . That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,Agreed . The problem with trying to portray the conflict as a simple religious conflict is that it completely oversimplifies the origins of it . The conflict was political . The Orange state was segregated - one side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of influence and power over the other and they abused it . The RUC ( and later the army ) responded to peaceful Nationalist protests by beating them off the streets and Loyalist gangs burned entire communities out of their homes in Belfast . That 's why the PIRA started to grow . Nobody joined the PIRA in the early 1970 's because they were Catholic . Painting the Troubles as a purely religious conflict is revisionism at its worst . It makes it seem as if this was something that was always going to happen in the North regardless of what the political situation was .

The ramifications of this war have been colossal - without it there would likely be no ISIS and the refugee crisis would likely be much less severe , if indeed there would be one at all .

The devastation you see there was the result of hundreds of thousands of artillery shells being constantly dropped in a single area for a long period of time . A single nuclear missile can destroy an area far bigger than that and irradiate the surrounding area for generations . That 's what makes nuclear weapons different - they present an existential threat to us and to other life on this planet . Conventional weapons do not .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Well , I 'd say there 's certainly an element of misogyny in it .

It does n't make it any less frustrating though , and I 'm sure there are bound to be members of Clodagh Hawe 's family who are really frustrated with the fact that the focus is n't on her or her children ( who she evidently fought with her life to defend ) , but is instead on the man who slaughtered them .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,My point is that I do n't think there 's anyone actively refusing to work because of the USC .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"What ? Who the hell actively decides not to work because of the USC ? Away with your shite .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ah now , you 're being even more revisionist . The ceasefire broke down mostly because the British Government were refusing to allow Sinn Fein to take part in peace talks unless the PIRA completely decommissioned all of its arms . John Major 's government was depending on unionists to keep its majority so they refused to back down from that position . It 's also complete nonsense to suggest that the IRA came to the negotiating table because John Bruton had no time for them . The ceasefire was resumed because the British Government eventually decided to include SF in the peace talks if the IRA reinstated it . Which they did . It 's why Loyalists will later accuse Blair 's government of being `` Bombed back to the table '' . Either way , and to get back to the point a bit , the 1994 ceasefire pretty much ended the majority of the violence . Loyalist paramilitaries announced ceasefires shortly after it . Reynolds played a very active role in achieving that and I think he deserves a lot of credit for it .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Also , Bruton set up the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement which Ahern finished off . Huh ? What sort of revisionism is this ? The IRA ceasefire broke down when Bruton was in power . That had more to do with the failures of the British Government than it did with Bruton but still . The GFA was n't the sole brain child of John Bruton , Bertie Ahern or anyone else . It was something that required an enormous amount of work , diplomacy and risk from all sides but mostly from the parties in N. Ireland itself . Ahern and Bruton before him might have facilitated dialogue between the conflicting sides in the North but they certainly did n't come up with the whole agreement ( and the plan to implement it ) all by themselves . Also , did n't Bruton ( while in power ) say he was fed up talking about the peace process ? I have n't heard another political leader from Ireland or Britain say that . Especially not when it was in its most crucial period . I do n't see why he deserves any additional credit for the peace process but I 'll gladly stand corrected if there 's more to it .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; It seems to me that a car bomb is not a good way of protecting your community . And shooting civilians who are taking part in a civil rights march is n't a good way of protecting a body of people either , what 's your point ?

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Patronising tone ? You just tried to tell me that I supported the killing of innocent people because I did n't agree with how you see the world . And how do you reconcile your last statement with reality exactly ? Without people like Martin McGuinness exerting influence on them , the IRA was n't going to just decide to stop its campaign because people in the middle disapproved of them . People in the middle always disapproved of them . It was the two conflicting sides that needed to make peace - you ca n't make peace if those who are n't fighting are the only ones doing the talking . That 's not a negotiation , that 's an echo chamber .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,Good idea . Feels like I 've gone down a rabbit hole .,Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Again ... it must be nice to be so single minded . If everyone in the North adopted the same attitude as yours then we 'd never have had a peace process . Also , at no point did I say that it was right to kill innocent people . At no point did I say that the IRA ( or the British Army for that matter - paramilitaries were n't the only ones who are guilty of this ) were right to kill innocent people . Take your head out of your ass and stop putting words in my mouth .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't think I did judge him , I made a sarcastic remark .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Of course there is - and you wo n't hear me defending an attack like that . That was terrorism . Does that mean that everyone who joined the IRA did so because they wanted to blow up pubs and streets ? Certainly not . I do n't think that men joined the Parachute regiment because they wanted to shoot unarmed civilians either - but that 's what conflict does to people , it desensitises them .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Having reasons for making reprehensible decisions is not a defense for those decisions . I did n't say it was , I just happen to think that it 's unrealistic to expect a community of people to be exposed to the sort of violence that the nationalist community in NI was without having a portion of that population resorting to armed action in return . I ca n't say with 100 % certainty that had I been through that at the time and had friends or family members ending up as victims of state violence that I would not be angry enough to want to do something about it . If you can , wonderful . I 'm happy for you . & gt ; I would further add that saying that someone who has more integrity than you is single minded and stupid is always a wining strategy ... I do n't see how anything you 've said shows you to have more integrity than me . Your argument thus far has been `` terrorists are bad '' - which is meaningless , because you know that nobody 's going to tell you they love terrorism . What you do n't want to seem to acknowledge is that there 's two sides to the story and the whole conflict ca n't be boiled down to `` the IRA were bad terrorists who started killing people '' .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; You way overreacted . If you say so . I do n't think I ever tried to imply that people who chose violence were in any way superior ( or even equal ) to those who did n't - but it 's completely disingenuous to pretend that prolonged state violence and violence from loyalist gangs against the nationalist minority was ever going to end in anything but reciprocated violence . It 's very easy to apply hindsight to the situation and say `` well non violence was clearly the better option '' . Any one of us can say that . In reality , if we 'd lived through it at the time and known or loved those who were the victims of state violence then we might well adopt a different attitude altogether . As such , I do n't think I 'm in any sort of position to judge .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,And nothing of value was lost .,Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; I am in a position to judge them , you know the position wherein I did n't join a terrorist organisation . I loath these people .

Gun crime will kill more people in the USA today than terrorism will kill in the entirety of Europe ( which has over 700 million people in it ) for probably the rest of the month .

It 's less democratic because citizens in the North have very little say in who 's governing them and it basically throws a decade of co-operation between loyalists and nationalists out the window . As for SF , they 're a republican party . They 're going to oppose direct rule as vehemently as they can - it 's not particularly surprising that they 'd prefer to remain in government with the DUP than have the whole of the North governed from Westminster again . The best outcome at this point would be for a new assembly election to be called and see how the chips fall . The DUP could lose a fair few seats to the UUP after this debacle .",Germanic,English

Also , as per the GFA , the Republic would need to pass a referendum on Irish unity too - not just the North . & gt ; I 'd argue that your involvement in hypothetical unity talks would actually hamper the whole process because you carry too much toxic baggage .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Your tinfoil theory is n't really all that tinfoiley - it 's mostly true .

Most of them know nothing about Churchill 's more controversial actions , for example , and yet they all but deify the man . This applies to their actions in Ireland too . What always irritates me about how the Troubles is talked about is how often it 's categorised as a religious conflict . That 's just patently untrue - it was a political conflict that arose because of the way the Orange state was treating the Catholic/Nationalist minority . It arose from the state forces ' decision to brutally suppress civil rights marches and movements .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Why ? I do n't get this argument . The public needs would still be there , would still be the same , all that would change is who pays for them . Because we wo n't be funding a legislature in the North ? As you 've said yourself , duplicated services will probably be merged or done away with . Surely that alone immediately means that we wo n't be paying the same amount as the UK government ? . Northern Ireland ca n't sustain itself because it was never intended to - it 's a part of the UK . It has never needed to sustain itself because the UK government was always going to fund it . The same as England , Wales or Scotland . We could slice Wales out of the UK as it is at this precise moment and we 'd probably find that the UK pumps a lot of money in there too and that Wales is n't a self-sustaining economy . That does n't show the full picture because it was never intended to be self sustaining . Policies are made for the UK in its entirety - they do n't make policies that are intended to make the nations within the union economically self-sustaining .",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Honestly , nobody really knows what the actual cost of unification would be . It 's universally accepted that there would be a significant short term cost . The long term costs/benefits are much less clear . I happen to think that in the long term , it can only strengthen the Irish economy because gaining two strong economic centres ( Belfast & amp ; Derry ) will bring growth to the communities surrounding them . This helps places like Donegal that have been pretty isolated ever since partition . It also removes currency as an obstacle - the Republic no longer loses trade to the North when the sterling currency is weaker and vice versa - the economic environment is much more consistent . Also , I agree that the Defence costs would be increased by a decent amount , but foreign affairs ? Ireland already has a Department of Foreign Affairs ...",Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It would n't be 9 billion , though . NI has devolved powers in the UK and as such , is responsible for its own legislation and a lot of its own governance .

There will be a significant cost to the republic if reunification happens , of that there 's no doubt , but I sincerely doubt that we would end up funding the same amount that the UK government does . Incidentally , reunification can only be a positive thing for the border communities that have been left isolated since partition . It would create a consistent economic situation across the 32 counties . It might cost us in the short term but in the long term , cities like Derry and Belfast can only bring economic benefits to the country as time goes on .",Germanic,English

He also stated in 2013 , before he even met with Adams , that he was confident he knew the identities of those involved in killing his father - and yet we 're led to believe that he would n't put those names to Adams when he meets with him ? Why meet with him then ? None of this sounds questionable to you ?",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I honestly do n't know who 's telling the truth - and the crucial thing is that nobody , apart from those who attended the meeting between Adams and the Stack brothers , can possibly know the truth . That being said , I still find it a bit hard to believe that Adams , after over 30 years leading SF ( and many would say the IRA ) has suddenly decided to start naming names . It would not only be political suicide , but it presents a real risk to his life as well , as we learned from the Denis Donaldson affair . I feel bad for the Stacks . It just seems as if they 've gotten themselves wrapped up in a political to and fro when all they really want is justice for their father .

08TangoDown08,ireland,This all happened in 2013 after Adams met with Stack . Adams claims that Stack gave him the names of 4 men he thought were involved in his father 's murder and Adams then passed these names on to the gardai . Stack now denies that he gave Adams the names .,Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,Stop the presses !,Germanic,English
08TangoDown08,ireland,"You 're applying your own perspective to the situation . The facts are that Adams facilitated a meeting between the Stack brothers and a senior figure in the IRA who supposedly knew who carried out their father 's murder . Adams has since stated that during the meeting he had with the Stack brothers , they provided him with the names of people they believed were involved with their father 's murder . Adams then claims to have given these names to the gardai . Stack denies that he gave Adams the names . That 's the controversy . Think of it what you will . As for me , I think it 's pretty damn unlikely that , after over 30 years in his position , Adams has suddenly decided to name names . Nobody seems to like to acknowledge the fact that if Adams did give these names himself without Stack providing them to him , then he 's likely to be in pretty big trouble - the IRA are n't likely to take kindly to it . Stack is likely to deny providing the names for the same reason . I do n't see how anyone can conclusively say who is telling the truth in this - because we have no real idea what was said at those meetings .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not being revisionist ... I 've stated facts . The truth is that most Cubans saw an increase in their quality of life since Castro came into power .

Their infant mortality rate is lower than the USA 's , their healthcare system is the envy of every other developing country in the world - they also have a better doctor to patient ratio than some western countries . Their literacy rate is approaching 100 % - which is pretty damn high even by western standards . You 've said that your cousin 's wife experienced some awful things under Castro and I 'm not denying that - but what you 're failing to understand is that for every Cuban who hated Castro and is glad to see him dead , there 's another one ( or more ) who is n't . Cuba spent the better part of 60 years under a crippling blockade by the most powerful country in the world - pretty soon after they overthrew a properly brutal dictator who made Castro look like Pope Francis . It 's too easy to say that Castro was an evil brutal dictator and just leave it at that . It 's lazy and it 's oversimplifying nearly 60 years of Cuban history .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,worldnews,I do remember reading a study that stated that about 1/3 of Seoul is within range of the North Korean artillery stationed along the DMZ - but they also supposedly have quite a large stockpile of chemical weapons . The contaminants in these chemical shells could spread a decent bit further away from where it impacted - depending on weather conditions and such . North Korea is a state that will be fighting for its own existence if war breaks out . I think it 's pretty likely that they will resort to using these kinds of weapons .

What will you say to the 25 million people living in Seoul , which is 35 miles from the DMZ and has in or around 10,000 North Korean artillery pieces pointed directly at it ? Artillery pieces that are also capable of launching chemical and biological weapons at the south too , by the way . Americans presuming that they have the right to decide the fate of a city like Seoul , or the fate of the millions of North Koreans that South Korea and China will need to house and feed when the war is over is one of the most fucked up things about all of this . Nobody else in that region wants this war to happen at all , nobody else is frothing at the mouth to get in a conflict with the North Koreans - the USA and North Korea are both unique in that respect .

Seoul , the South Korean capital , is a city of about 25 million people and it 's only 35 miles from the DMZ . North Korea has literally thousands of conventional artillery guns pointed directly at Seoul . They can kill thousands , perhaps even millions , of South Koreans without needing nuclear weapons . And that 's before you consider the fact that they can use artillery shells to deliver chemical and biological weaponry too . North Korea would definitely lose in a conflict with South Korea , the USA and Japan . But they pack a punch . And it 's South Korea who 's going to have to take that punch , and then recover enough to the point where they will need to deal with whatever comes after North Korea . Most likely , that would mean either reunification or thousands and thousands of underfed , malnourished and brainwashed North Koreans streaming into their country . All of this while rebuilding what 's left of Seoul . China 's still a huge unknown in this too . If they decide to intervene on the side of the North as they did in the first Korean war , then it 's likely to end the same way it did then and we 're all back to square one - thousands of deaths later .",Germanic,English

About 20 % of British Muslims either thought the 7/7 bombings were justified or they sympathised with the attackers . More than 20 % of British Muslims want Sharia law in Britain . According to [ this ] ( http : //www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ ) pew poll , about 8 out of every 10 Muslims in Egypt and Pakistan think that stoning is an appropriate punishment for adultery .

It would still be an absolute humanitarian disaster if they managed to land even one , but it would n't take down the US government or the US military , and North Korea would quite probably still fall to the US and its allies .

Fast forward a bit and the war is going predictably well . The problem I had was that even though my warscore was more than high enough , I was n't able to demand Neumark from the Teutonics ( presumably because it was occupied by Austria and not me ) and had to wait a stupid amount of time for them to make a separate peace with Austria before I could move in and take the province for myself .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Freedom of speech means that you can voice your opinion and your views without being imprisoned or persecuted for doing so . The exception is when you are not just voicing an opinion but inciting action in other people - specifically violence or prejudice . This is hate speech , which is , as far as I know , illegal in most western countries - but I 'm open to correction on that . Also , if you 're working for a company and you say something that could be seen as homophobic or anti-semitic , then that company has every right to dismiss you from your job because they also have a right to protect their own image . In this respect , free speech does n't mean you 're always free to say whatever you want without consequence - but what it does mean is that nobody should be able to have others silenced because they find them `` offensive '' .",Germanic,English

Free speech does n't mean you 're entirely free to suffer no consequences for anything that you 'll ever say . If I incite someone to commit violence against another , then I 'm guilty of hate speech - which is a crime . Voicing your opinion and inciting action against someone else for voicing theirs is two completely different things and I 'm honestly confused as to why you 're conflating them . Demanding that I change my behaviour because of how you feel when I say something to you is making me responsible for how you feel . I can choose to be offended or I can choose not to be offended - my choice is n't the fault of any other person but me . Feelings are n't a moral currency .

With all of that being said - there is a massive problem in the Islamic world and with the Islamic faith . If someone can kill dozens of innocent people and expect divine reward for doing so , and if their `` interpretation '' of the faith remains a pretty straightforward one as far as the original texts are concerned - then of course there is a massive problem within the faith . This is why this should be considered a war of ideas and this is why we need to empower moderate Muslims within the Islamic world . How do we do that ? Again , I do n't know .

Because the entire region ( ie . not just Iraq ) did not become what it is today until after Saddam was deposed . The schism between Shia and Sunni has existed for literally centuries - so that has always been a destabilising factor in the region .

These people are literally willing to die , as long as they kill as many innocents in the process . You might not want to accept that there is a difference - but there quite obviously is . These are people who do n't even value their own lives enough to give themselves pause . I did n't resort to any sort of mental gymnastics when I made that point . It 's wilful ignorance to pretend that there is no difference . At no point did I say that the IRA never intended to kill anyone either . Stop twisting my words .

SF are , by quite a margin , the biggest nationalist party in the North .

Unionists were convinced enough to go into power sharing with Sinn Fein . It 's people with your mentality that are the obstacles in this . We 're not living in the 1980 's anymore . Why would Unionists be any more willing to vote for one of two parties who never even attempted to run candidates in the North ? What hope does a party like Fine Gael , who have little to no connection with Northern Ireland , have of convincing a population from there to see things their way ? Unionism is still at odds with Republicanism in the North . The only way to bridge this gap is by having Unionists and Republicans in the North working together - that 's the pre-requisite . Sinn Fein have a large majority among the Nationalist community so the onus is arguably on them to convince Unionists that their vision for a united Ireland is one that includes them .",Germanic,English

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"& gt ; I really hope this does n't trigger a resurgence of the IRA . The last thing the UK needs is a repeat of The Troubles . Unlikely . Northern Ireland in the late 60 's and early 70 's was basically a sectarian shithole . Catholics/Nationalists were essentially second class citizens - they did n't have the same ability to vote , most of the land/businesses were owned by Protestants who refused to hire Catholics and when the Catholic community arranged peaceful protests to oppose this situation , they were met with state violence on behalf of the RUC ( police ) and later the British army , and also violence from the Loyalist/Protestant community who started rioting at these protests and even burned entire streets of Catholics out of their homes . The British army was actually sent into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect Catholic communities from loyalist pogroms and gangs . It was within this climate that the IRA gained its support among the Catholic/Nationalist community . They promised to defend Catholic areas from Loyalist violence and to push back against the state forces . As you can imagine , this was a popular idea among Nationalists and the IRA grew in support - particularly after Bloody Sunday . Northern Ireland is a completely different place today . Organisations like the IRA simply would n't gain the support of entire communities anymore because the political climate is so drastically different . Put simply , most people have no reason to resort to or justify violent acts anymore .",Germanic,English

Catholics are n't second class citizens anymore and they are n't having their peaceful protests being met with state violence - so there would be literally no public support for them today .

It 's good to actually investigate these things yourself before jumping on a bandwagon . This is basically the same kind of response that Sam Harris got from Ben Affleck on Bill Maher 's show . Affleck had clearly only read a couple of paragraphs about how Harris is a `` racist '' ( odd , considering Islam is n't a race ) bigot who hates all muslims - he did n't actually know anything about Harris or what his real arguments were . The same is true of how people react to the Bell Curve , broadly speaking .",Germanic,English

Encouraging women to participate in politics is good , I 'm still not convinced that gender quotas is an equally good idea .

Sinn Fein also increased its share of the vote - and they increased their number of Westminster seats by 3 as opposed to the DUP 's increase of 2 .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Most Unionists are n't burning flags and it 's not part of the main marches . There is also a lot more to Ulster Protestant culture than burning flags ( not that anyone reading this sub would know ) . That 's a bit presumptuous of you - not all of us are mouth-breathing idiots , we just do n't like seeing our national flag being burned as part of a celebration . You did n't really address my point either , you just waved it away with `` not all of them do it '' . It might not be a part of the marches but it 's a part of almost every bonfire that happens in Belfast and around the North . The point is that there is enough of them doing it to indicate that it 's considered an acceptable way to express their culture . I 've never seen a unionist leader directly ask them to stop burning flags - maybe you have , but I have n't . The problem I have with this celebration is that it 's carried out in a deliberately triumphalist and antagonistic way . You did n't answer my two biggest questions so I 'll ask them again . Why do they need to burn tricolours to express their culture ? Why do they need to march through predominantly nationalist areas ? If they just built bonfires and kept their marches to areas less likely to generate conflicts , then I 'd have absolutely no problem with what they 're doing . As it happens , they see fit to attack my nationality as a way to stubbornly assert their own .",Germanic,English

This is a group of grown adults who are under the impression that this is a legitimate way to express their `` culture '' . And yet , republicans are often described as the confrontational ones . There is nothing in the republican calendar that even compares with the twelfth . Irish people do n't get together on a specific day every single year and burn union flags or effigies of UK or loyalist leaders . It 's deliberately antagonistic . I have no problem with them having bonfires and marches - but why do they need to burn tricolours ? Why do they need to march through predominantly nationalist areas ? If this is a requirement of their culture , then it 's a culture that breeds hatred and conflict - and it should be condemned .",Germanic,English
