9Ghillie,photography,"I have a Sony a58 , and even though I have n't used the other two you listed , I do n't think I can recommend it . The plastic lens mount has worked just fine for me and one of the reasons I got this camera over other similarly priced cameras was the front scrollwheel for changing aperture/shutter speed/other settings . I do n't like the digital viewfinder , I do n't think it 's bad but the digital part is just something that does n't sit well with me . The camera also has a fixed half-transparent mirror , which makes shooting in low light a bit more tricky . Also there is noticeable noise already at ISO 800 . If you 're considering the 18-55 mm kit lens , then it 's not very sharp , and at 18mm ( mine at least ) has noticeable blue tinted vignetting .

9Ghillie,photography,"I always see people talking about formatting their memory cards and I do n't really understand the underlying reason behind it . It 's something I personally have never done and never had problems with , also I do n't see people formatting flash drives before every use , so why the difference ? Should I be doing it ?",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,photography,"Got a job at a photography gear and print store , honestly was surprised at how many people still use film . That particular chain only does digital development , but I 'm sure you can find a local store that has a darkroom .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,itookapicture,"That 's very true , used lenses are always an option . I mostly shoot landscapes and street photography at the moment , but I feel like that 's because of the limitations of my gear , as I do n't want to put down any more money on different lenses for a mount system I know for a fact I wo n't be staying at . For some reason I favor the D750 , even though I feel like I 'm more into Canon 's button layout and menu system . Tough call to make knowing that once I get one , I 'll probably need to stay on that brand in the future because of the lenses .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,itookapicture,"I wo n't be putting my mod hat on , since I also want to express my personal opinion , but this would n't go under the MLM rule and you could have posted it any other time as well , as the person is n't the main subject in this photo .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Ah yeah , that 's what I figured . Sadly I do n't get to shoot stars too much myself as my crappy Sony a58 gets noticeable noise at ISO 800 already . Honestly I ca n't figure out if I should go full frame with something like Nikon D750/Canon 6D , or get a crop Canon 7DmkII . High ISO noise performance is pretty much identical and I do n't know if full frame 's better DoF warrants the insanely expensive glass .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,pcmasterrace,"The term water retention ( also known as fluid retention ) or hydrops , hydropsy signifies an abnormal accumulation of clear , watery fluid in the tissues or cavities of the body . Water is found both inside and outside the body ’ s cells . It forms part of the blood , helping to carry the blood cells around the body and keeping oxygen and important nutrients in solution so that they can be taken up by tissues such as glands , bone and muscle . Even the organs and muscles are mostly water . The body uses a complex system of hormones and hormone-like substances called prostaglandins to keep its volume of fluid at a constant level . If one were to intake an excessive amount of fluid in one day , the amount of fluid would not be affected in the long-term . This is because the kidneys quickly excrete the excess in the form of urine . Likewise , if one did not get enough to drink , the body would hold on to its fluids and urinate less than usual . Imbalances in this system can lead to water retention , which can range from mild and unnoticeable to symptomatic with swelling .",Uralic,Estonian

Photos that are allowed on any day of the week : * Photos of multiple people * Photos of people with atypical makeup ( has to be quite extreme , think something like a joker makeup or face covered with glitter - something you would n't see in everyday life or at a formal dance . ) * People in atypical clothing ( This often goes together with the last point . Geishas are a good example ) * Unique studio setups ( Think Old Spice commercials . Does n't of course have to be so impressive , but something like a couple of speedlights with gels is n't enough .

A smile is n't enough to be considered under this ) * Photos with only one person in focus , but where the person is n't the main subject of the photo ( Something like a landscape with a person in it ) * People in action ( Playing football , dancing , etc ) * Photos of a person , using an interesting and unique photographic technique . ( Double exposure is a good example ) Photos that should be posted on Mona Lisa Monday : * One person looking at or away from the camera , with no interesting background or action Some examples of photos that should be posted on Monday : 1 .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Would be pretty hard with this particular photo as one subject is fairly close to the camera ( the person ) while the others are further away . Depth of field depends mostly on the aperture , so you could set it to a very high number ( means tiny aperture ) , like F/20 , or whatever the your lens and lighting conditions allowed for , to try and have as much in focus as possible . [ Here 's a good schematic for understanding how different apertures affect the DoF ] ( http : //cdn.cambridgeincolour.com/images/tutorials/dof_aperturediagram.png ) . Large aperture = small F number . [ Here 's another good picture of different aperture setting comparisons ] ( https : //www.ormsdirect.co.za/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Desmond-Louw-03.jpg ) Another option is to use focus stacking . This is a much better option if you have a stationary subject , because it involves taking multiple photos with the focus on a different point each time , and later merging the focused parts of the picture in post ( Photoshop , for example ) .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Thanks for your input . Personally I look past the gender of the model , and even though a bigger percentage of them are women , we do remove photos of men just as diligently . I can admit that the decision of removing a post ca n't always be 100 % objective and this rule is very hard to put into words so it leaves no room for ambiguity , but over the last 5 months that we 've had this rule , we have come to a mental line of where MLM starts and where it stops . You 're right about the reason for the initial push of this rule , and that was mainly photos of women staring into the camera with a blurry background , but this was the reason only because of the community 's feedback to these posts , and as you may or may not remember it got pretty hostile at times . Mona Lisa Monday as a rule was never about restricting photos of women , though . It 's a rule to limit the frequency of simple\* portrait posts to one day . \* - simple in terms of what 's displayed on the picture itself , rather than the effort it took or the photo 's production value .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,ModSupport,"/r/itookapicture uses Slack . We 're also nearing the 10k message limit ( /u/sodypop please send funds ) . Moved to Slack in February , before that we used a private subreddit , which we now use as an archive for the most important things like the new moderators startup guide . What reddit 's modmail 's mod discussions is lacking for us is the absence of channels . In slack we have 6 channels , we could do with 3 , with with all messages in one pile it would get very disorganized very fast . Plus no one wants to get a modmail notification because someone is shitposting or showing off behind the scenes footage of the Falcon 9 launch photoshoot . Actually I 'd be okay with that last one . We keep it as private as possible , using only usernames in chat . We realize that even signing up with a private email is a deal breaker for some . However , having been together for years the team has bonded and most of us are friends , so we know a thing or two about each other .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,ModSupport,"Private inboxes are definitely a better way to go .

Obviously harsh light has its time and place , but this is not it . Light is perhaps the most important part of photography and it 's hard to master . Your framing can be completely wrong but if you have good lighting it will still look good . Try practicing in natural light , in a situation where you ca n't control the light , but instead have to adapt yourself .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Every once in a while I see comments on ITAP , something along the lines of `` *this is what /r/pics should be about* '' and I do n't agree with that . Here we have a fraction of the subscribers that /r/pics has and that 's totally fine . Subscribers are photographers themselves , or are interested in it , art in general and the feedback surrounding it . Most comments are sensible , containing some type of actual feedback . Sure , there are still negative and off-topic comments , but I feel like a majority of these only ever get here when a post gets popular and shows up on /r/all . Sometimes you see quality photography pop up on /r/pics as well and people who clearly have no knowledge of photography just shit all over it . A particular comment I recently saw on /r/pics comes to mind : `` *set the aperture to 1/1000* '' , which in my opinion is a good demonstration of why /r/pics and /r/itookapicture should be , and are , separate subreddits .

9Ghillie,photography,"I also moderate ITAP and it 's certainly something I think about a lot . I think personally I 'm a bit too lax with rule 4 of `` A photograph that demonstrates an effort to teach/learn technique or artistic style , or which is being shared as an example of quality photography '' . In my opinion it 's difficult to find the balance between allowing beginner photographers to post their work without discouraging them from photography as a whole , and removing just lazy subpar photos , especially since it 's not that easy to tell the two apart sometimes . The main thing we 're trying to avoid is expecting too much from beginner photographers . Imagine if you were just starting out , worked hard to get your dog to sit still and took a photo at an angle you thought was good , only to have it removed because some decision makers thought it was not `` good enough '' . Now multiply that by 150 , or whatever number of submissions per day we get where this decision needs to be made on a case by case basis . Adding new mods like /u/johnkphotos here definitely gave us more time to deal with this , though . We do ask that submitters leave a comment on their posts explaining what they were going for , techniques and gear they used , the thought process , and so on , but right now it 's not too heavily enforced . Maybe that 's something we should focus more on . I certainly agree with what you 're saying . I 'm definitely not happy with many of the submissions we get . I 'll take your compliments on the Instagram . The joy of curating it is getting to ignore bad photos that get upvoted for something other than photography : )",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,fakealbumcovers,"I already voted , but wanted to give a bit more in depth answer than a simple yes or no . Right off the bat , I 'll come out and say that I think they should be limited , as well as other joke/meme/low effort submissions . While it 's fake , I think some effort should still be put into the submissions . There are plenty of funny/bizarre album covers , but no one is going to put [ a low quality cell phone picture of a TV screen ] ( https : //i.imgur.com/pLthztk.jpg ) on an album cover . Overall , I think the rules should more enforced and redefined perhaps . There are plenty of non-square posts that do not get removed - it 's possible that this is just a case the mods not noticing them right away , understandable . However , I do think the zero effort rule should be changed into low effort , possibly even limiting meme posts to a specific day as opposed to outright banning them . A square crop and a parental advisory label should not be enough to make a passable post .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,fakealbumcovers,"I agree , it 's very well made . I hate the meme/low effort/joke posts that always seem to get upvoted here , I 'm glad this is not one of them .

9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"Right , now I 'm a bit confused as well , let 's see . I might have been mistaken about them replacing slot 1 .

You can always lower the quality in post to keep the file size down . Also stay away from in-camera presets and filters . Raw+auto white balance is the way to go . Shooting in raw will let you adjust white balance later .

9Ghillie,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,"Out of /r/GTAV , /r/GrandTheftAutoV and a few other more specialized GTA V subreddits , I think this one definitely takes the cake from a PC gamer 's viewpoint .

9Ghillie,needamod,"Currently I moderate /r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC with full permissions and I have experience in pretty much everything you would need to do in a subreddit . I have intermediate skills in CSS and I 'm very active . Open to pretty much any offers , NSFW included .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,CasualConversation,"The following will describe what was going on in my mind in the last hour or so but the backstory will reach further into last night . I needed to share this with people and first I thought about tweeting about it but then I quickly realized there 's no way I can fit this experience into 140 characters and still capture my exact mindset during that time . So anyway I 'm notorious for getting my sleep schedule messed up whenever I have a break from school , be it a 1 week break in spring or an almost 3 month one in summer . So I 've been consistently going to sleep later and later every night , to the point where it ca n't be called *later* anymore - more like earlier . So for the few last nights it 's been around 6-7am when I 've finally hit the sack and woken around 4pm . Last night , however was different . I did n't feel tired whatsoever and proceeded to watch 3 episodes of House of Cards * ( amazing show , by the way ) * . After that I tried again , but still nothing . I got out of bed and went downstairs to eat breakfast . Weird things start to happen when you 're awake longer than you 're used to . Losing track of time , mild hallucinations , weird thoughts crossing your mind . You 've probably felt it yourself - even if you 're not tired , it still feels different somehow . Anyway back to breakfast . Opened the fridge and noticed there 's no milk . I was planning on getting cereal but that was out of the question . There was n't much else to choose from so I took out some lightly salted salmon . Some of the bread was moldy so I opened another one and plopped two slicer into the toaster . Fast forward two minutes , the toast pops out , I smear butter on the hot toast and start cutting slices of salmon . Now as I 'm eating these two salmon toastwiches , kinda ℳℯℎ in the nature , I have a revelation about salmon . The thing is , I do n't normally like eating fish - salmon I 'm okay with but everything else roasted/fried/marinaded/smoked kind of fish is really not my thing . I think about how is it that pretty much all the commonly spread edible fish here tastes so similar and then there 's salmon that looks , smells and tastes nothing like the other fish . It 's then when I realize that I do n't even really think of salmon as a fish - at least not while eating those thinly sliced salmon pink salmon slices . I know it 's a fish , but in my mind there 's no connection between fish and salmon when it 's not in one piece , swimming in a river . Now the thought of salmon being this pink fish on my toast , as I 'm eating it , seems almost revolting . I 'm eating a fish . This was inside a salmon , that is a fish , and it was once alive . I felt almost disgusted . I 've never been a vegetarian , or cared about a pig 's feelings as it was sent to the slaughterhouse to be made tasty tasty meat out of , but this whole salmon thing felt overwhelming . I took a sip of orange juice and all of the disgust perished . I kept eating the second salmon toastwich , finished my orange juice and my coffee and came back upstairs to share this experience with you . **TL ; DR - The salmon on my salmon toastwich is fish . **",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,GrandTheftAutoV_PC,"I 'll start off by saying that this is a repost of my own post from over a month ago and my reason behind posting it again is for people who are new here or if they missed the post last time . This post has been approved by a mod . [ Here 's the original thread . ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/2umfrz/ssd_users_with_low_disk_space_try_this_if_you/ ) _ *The following works for both SSDs and HDDs for those who are wondering , it 's just that HDDs have generally more space and freeing up a couple of gigabytes is n't that critical . Keep in mind that this only works on the system drive ( the drive that you have installed Windows on ) . * # # # What you need to do All you have to do is open the command prompt ( search for *cmd* ) **with admin rights** and type `powercfg /h off` . Once you type the command in and hit enter , nothing else will appear in the command prompt if you did it right . You should then go to *My Computer/This PC* and refresh the view to see if the space has been freed . This will disable hibernation , and in doing so remove a very large file from your SSD/HDD that is as big as the amount of RAM you have . In my case it was 16 gigabytes . _ # # # Description of how it works for people who are worried The command deletes the hibernation system file which writes the entire content of the RAM onto your drive so it saves the exact state of your computer . It always takes up that space on your hard/solid state drive , even when the computer is running which can lead to a loss of precious space . On many computers hibernation is disabled by default and people do n't seem to use it that much anyway so there 's no real point of having it take up so much space . Just to be clear , the space is always reserved on the disk in case you do need to hibernate . Otherwise there could be a situation where you do n't have enough room on your drive to facilitate the entire content of the RAM . `powercfg /h off`will remove the reservation . # # # TL ; DR : If you use hibernation , do n't do it . The sleep function will still work on your computer . _ # # # Additionally if you want to free up some more space on your drive , you should check out these little programs .

9Ghillie,PushBullet,"Thanks for the reply . These are photos taken with my android phone 's camera and they fail to transfer from the phone to Chrome every time . I transfer smaller image files , ~1 MB , in the opposite direction daily ( Chrome to phone ) and these work just fine .

As a last test I grabbed a 4k wallpaper about 7 MB in size and transferred it from Chrome to my phone , which worked . However , sending it back from my phone to Chrome failed .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Correct . From the US Copyright Office website FAQ : & gt ; **When is my work protected ? ** Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device . & gt ; **Do I have to register with your office to be protected ? ** No . In general , registration is voluntary . Copyright exists from the moment the work is created . You will have to register , however , if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work . See Circular 1 , Copyright Basics , section “ [ Copyright Registration . ] ( https : //www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf ) ” However : & gt ; **Why should I register my work if copyright protection is automatic ? ** Registration is recommended for a number of reasons . Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration .

Try to play around with the settings more and try using a wider aperture . You do n't need to be afraid of opening it up even all the way if you are far away from the subject , and if you 're unsure of which aperture to use , just open it up all the way and take multiple shots , each with a smaller aperture .

9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"True ! While it 's trivial to add the CSS class as well , your version is more useful if you do n't want to use any kind of tags in the title .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"That 's one way to do it , but I figured out a way to get it working by using the priority check on one of the rules [ here ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/5nhulh/automoderator_help_needed/dcc83q0/ ) .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"So I got to a computer and took a look at it again . Seems that setting the flair does n't work well with the removal rule , but you can add a `priority : 1` to the rule that sets the flair . Here 's both of them together , working , tested on both normal and mod accounts - will flair the post if a moderator makes the post ( also capitalization does n't matter ) and will remove the post if anyone else posts it : -- - type : submission priority : 1 title ( includes ) : `` [ Mod Post ] '' set_flair : `` Mod Post '' -- - type : submission title ( includes ) : `` [ Mod Post ] '' action : remove Make sure your rules are separated by three hyphens ` -- -` as shown above . Also make sure your subreddit has link flair enabled by going to /r/subreddit/about/flair and under *link flair position* select either *left* or *right* . Do n't forget to save . Edit : Change `set_flair : `` Mod Post '' ` to `set_flair : [ `` Mod Post '' , `` green '' ] ` if you also want to style the flair with CSS . Change `` green '' to whatever class name you want to use .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"Alright , I 'll get back to you later in the day once I get to a computer and figure it out for you if someone else does n't get here first . At this point I 'm not really sure what the problem might be .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"It might have been my bad as I 'm on mobile and ca n't test it out myself . It should be fine but it 's probably still not applying the rule to moderators , so try adding the following to the end of the rule : moderators_exempt : false",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,Would not make a difference in this case . For the auto flair thing you could use type : submission title ( includes ) : `` [ Mod Post ] '' set_flair : `` Mod Post '' You could also check against having [ Mod Post ] in the title which would probably work more consistently . type : submission title ( includes ) : `` [ Mod Post ] '' action : remove,Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,AutoModerator,"type : submission flair-text : `` Mod Post '' action : remove comment : Your submission has been removed - `` Mod Post '' flair is reserved for moderators . Moderators are automatically exempt from this , but it will only work if you have automatic flairing set up with automoderator i.e . by having [ MOD POST ] or something in the title and having automod automatically flair these posts . If you do n't have this system in place and someone makes a post and only then changes the flair to `` Mod Post '' , it will not work , because automoderator does not consider flair change as a post edit and will not register the change . Another way to do this without automoderator is to restrict users from having complete freedom to link flairs and only let them choose from the link flair templates ( found on /r/Subreddit/about/flair/ # link_templates ) . In that case you can just not list the `` Mod Post '' flair on that page and type it in manually on the posts you want to tag as mod posts .",Uralic,Estonian

Do they view catholicism as many in Western-Europe view Orthodoxy , as some kind of `` superstitious magic-religion '' ?",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,Catholicism,"Yes , as far as I know ( but surely , I ca n't speak for everyone ) . I can only speak 100 % sure for Poland and Hungary ( which are not western , but almost 100 % Catholic ) , but the anti-russian sentiment & amp ; media of the western countries often portrays Orthodoxy as some superstitious religion , and the Orthodox leaders heavily connected to the state . Also , the historical figure of Rasputin ( who represents Orthodoxy for the average Catholics living in a mostly Catholic country ) heavily influenced the average image of an eastern priest : mysterious , wild , uncivilised . As far as I know , this opinion is also common among protestant Europeans . Also , the pictures of Orthodox priests blessing guns/tanks/vodka did n't really helped in fighting these preconceptions . However , the pictures of Ukrainian priests standing beetween rebels and government forces maybe contributed to showing a real side of their religion.But , again , I ca n't speak for everyone , nor for every country .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,ArtefactPorn,"The Hungarians of the 10th century were probably a mixture of Turks , Ugors , and some other Eastern-European folks . This week , I heard an interesting interview on our state radio with a researcher . According to the recent genetic researches , some 20-25 % of the 10th century Hungarians showed asian ( mainly central and north ) characteristics , the other were eastern-european . Now , almost no Hungarians ( except the ones who live in Transylvania , or in Moldva ) show traces of Asian genes . According to the researcher , the reason of this is intermarrying with the Europeans of the Carpathian Basin . The old legends connect the Hungarians to the Huns , but most of the modern scientists rule out this possibility . However , it is not impossible , that some fragments of the remaining Huns became a kind of aristocrats among them , and united the tribes .

More than 1,2 million soldiers died or became severely injured in the offensive . I thought it would be interesting to share the thoughts of the Professor about his experiences : > One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression ; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years . By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead . Tolkien was always a pacifist , and it 's also worth to read some of his thoughts about World War II : > Well , the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter — leaving , alas , everyone the poorer , many bereaved or maimed and millions dead , and only one thing triumphant : the Machines . As the servants of the Machine are becoming a privileged class , the Machines are going to be enormously more powerful . What 's their next move ? ( Letters 96 ) It 's also important to note , that many of his great thoughts arose in the darkest of times : He first started thinking about the idealistic world of Middle-Earth in the trenches of the Somme . He dreamed about better times , when humanity lived in harmony with the greater powers of this Earth , and with the Nature . > It was just as the 1914 War burst on me that I made the discovery that 'legends ' depend on the language to which they belong ; but a living language depends equally on the 'legends ' which it conveys by tradition . … Volapuk , Esperanto , Ido , Novial , & c & c are dead , far deader than ancient unused languages , because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends ...

Not night as ours , unhappy folk , Where nigh the Earth in hazy bars , A mist about the springing of stars , There trails a thin and wandering smoke Obscuring with its veil half-seen The great abysmal still Serene . A globe of dark glass faceted with light Wherein the splendid winds have dusky flight ; Untrodden spaces of an odorous plain That watches for the moon that long has lain And caught in meteors ’ fiery rain – Such there is night . There on a sudden did my heart perceive That they who sang about the Eve , Who answered the bright-shining stars With gleaming music of their strange guitars , These were His wandering happy sons Encamped upon those aëry leas Where God ’ s unsullied garment runs In glory down His mighty knees .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"The Elves who spoke with the Númenoreans were n't just elves : They were Emissaries of the Valar . I think that the Valar knew , or at least could 've guessed the exact fate of mortals . Also , the Valar do n't seem to be the types to use merciful lies , so I do n't think they would give false information to the men , just to discourage them from going to Valinor . Also , the voyage of Bilbo and Frodo ( and later Sam ) to Valinor was not a reward , and this is also explicitely said in the RoTK : they ( especially Frodo ) *had* to go there , because the mental damage ( by the Ring ) , and the physical ( by the morghul knife ) was unbearable , and could n't be healed in this world . And , as the letter above says , the Valar do n't have the power to lengthen the lifespan of Mortals .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,And how the world *is* beautiful because it is broken .,Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"What do you mean by active help ? The Valar help in many ways , but the only `` active help '' ( by my dictionary ) is when they finally kick Melkor out of Angband , and when Ulmo tells about the plan of Gondolin to Turgon ( However , that was through a dream , so I 'm not sure if it 's active ) . But , the water , the strongest manifestation of Ulmo carries off the Ringwraiths . The stars of Varda give Sam the hope he needs . The ents , created by Yavanna , destroy Isengard . And , the descendants of Thorondor help Gandalf on many occasions . I do n't think that Manwe told the eagles , that `` Rescue my homeboy Gandalf '' , I rather think , that he was rescued because the eagles still patrol the skies , and still are on the side of the Free People of ME . They *are* creations of Manwe , but as Dwarfs are n't servants/messangers of Aule , the eagles are most certainly not just errants of Manwe . So , I would n't really call anything in LoTR an `` active intervention '' , but in their own ways , these things are *because* of the past interventions of the Valar .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I 'm not really sure . Maybe the wind itself was created that way , to aid the good cause ( this seems rather ridiculous , but we ca n't rule it out completely ) . This point could be argued endlessly , since Tolkien does n't give an exact explanation on how this works ( and it is very good this way ) . However , I admit , I overlooked the wind , and your point is good , but again , I 'm unsure .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"Surprise : Swords and horses were part of the human warfare until the XXth century . Although bows became useless much much faster , they 've still been around for a couple of thousand years . This is the historical reason . The reason Tolkien never developed advanced technologies for ME , is because the people in this supposed `` ages '' were living in an idyllic society , and they did not wish for these kind of things ( as Tolkien did not wish for them in the XXth century , and as many of us do n't wish for them now ) . Although , there are some places , where you see clear examples of technological advancement : The works of the Noldor in Aman ( fëanorian script , the palantirs , and because of Melkor 's temptation , weapons ) , or the Golden Age of Númenor ( shipbuilding , astronomy , mathematics , architecture , and in the time of the Darkening , weapons ) . Another reason , is that in the third age most societies were in a decline process . There were many many examples of technological developement going backwards in human history : after the fall of Rome , for example , most of our knowledge about engineering/siege engineering was lost , and Western-Europeans had to relearn it from Byzantium , and the Arabs , invent new menthods , or rediscover the old ones .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"Yes , I get your point , but even iron weapons were ( in most parts of the world ) in active use for more than 3 thousand years . So , I should have written iron swords , instead of simply swords ? The blacksmithing techniques have also seen some improvements , but as I gather , the medieval Europeans did n't really achieve big results . But correct me , if I 'm wrong . I 'm not a history expert , but I try to do my best .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"No , I do n't think , and I did not write that . First , I wrote the feanorian alphabet . That was created in their `` Golden age '' . Than , because of Melkor 's influence , they created weapons . I also wrote the same with the Númenoreans . They had advanced knowledge in mathematics , astronomy , etc.. In the times of their Darkening , they misused this knowledge : started to create warships , weapons . And , at last , the servants of Morgoth/Sauron/Saruman even created machines . I do n't think he objected to having a roof over his head . But get the Letters , and you will clearly see , that he objected to having cars , that ruin the countryside , he objected to using atomic bombs . He hated advanced machinery , for a very good reason .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I 've been thinking about this , and maybe my take is wrong , but I think that it 's the seal of the door . ( This idea sound simple , I know ) . I still like the Arda Marred theory of u/SkylanderOne",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I ca n't really answer the first part of your question . However , it is possible to overcome a curse . Mim cursed Androg , but it is stated in the Children of Húrin , that Androg overcame the curse , when Beleg healed him from his arrowshot-wound . Although Tolkien clearly states , that the curse is over , it 's still interesting , that Androg dies from an arrow later ( if I remember correctly ) . Melian also stated , that it 'd be possible for the Curse of the Children of Húrin to break . So , it always comes to the unanswered question of TCoH : Was Túrin the victim of his destructive nature , or the Curse of Morgoth ? And , it is stated , that the curse of a dwarf is especially strong , so I think this means that weaker curses also exist . I think the power of the curse comes from the nature of the `` curse-caster '' , rather than an outside power . Definitely not from Ilúvatar , or one of the Valar .",Uralic,Hungarian

The utter folly of these lunatic physicists to consent to do such work for war-purposes : calmly plotting the destruction of the world !

100courics,budapest,"I live by Oktogon and all I can say is that the entire area is packed with pubs/bars and lounges . Two minutes from Retox there 's a ruin bar called [ Instant ] ( http : //instant.co.hu/ ) . If I recall correctly , there are three separate dance floors and places to sit and drink . However , a beer is like HUF 800 , so do n't go there TO get drunk . For places to get cheap alcohol , I 'd primarily recommend shopping in a grocery store ( CBA and Spar are the most common ) . In Retox 's street , there 's a pub called Bakeger . It 's a basement bar at the corner of the street . It 's a genuine old man 's pub , but a lot of students discovered it ( myself among them ) over the past couple of years because a mug is HUF 250 and shots are cheap too . The good thing about that place is that it 's cheap , in the city centre , and a place to go out rather than drinking in the hostel room . But , once again , do n't expect shiny lights . Sometimes there are only old alcoholics there , sometimes the place is packed with foreign students . Non-party related , but you should check out Margaret Island while you 're here . It 's grassy and a cool place to sit out with your friends and drink or just enjoy the weather . There are a few clubs on the island , but to be honest they 're not the best . My friends and I went in one and spent half a night figuring out why there were so many guys , and then found out it was a gaybar . [ Szimpla ] ( http : //www.szimpla.hu/ ) is the place virtually every foreign young person/student goes to first in Budapest . It 's in the 8th district , so it should be about a 20-30 minute commute ( tram/walk ) . Alcohol rules are the same as Instant : do n't go there just for the drinking because it will add up . People go there to mingle with loads of other foreigners ; the only languages I heard there before were English , French and German . Maybe once a few words of Hungarian . Szimpla is the icon of the term `` ruin bar '' . It 's where the movement began . Definitely a place to check out . Other than that , like I said , the entire area near Retox is packed with fun establishments . Nagymezo street has nice bars next to each other , but my favorite is the Grand Boulevard ( Nagykorut ) . cafebars next to each other for half a kilometer or so ( places like Gong Cafe , Gong 2 , Limit Bar , etc ) . This place has an iconic nightlife .",Uralic,Hungarian
100courics,polandball,"Of course we did bad shit but saying that we - or even Horthy - welcomed the alliance with Nazi Germany is a massive exaggeration .

100courics,hungary,"For Hungarians , the situation is complicated even though the two mainly-involved countries are Ukraine and Russia . Many Hungarians feel that Ukraine falling apart would provide the opportunity to return the 150,000-strong Hungarian minority ( in a country of 40+ million ) in Sub-Carpathia to their English land , seeing as the region was historically Hungarian . It was just a Stalinist decision which created Zakkarpatia and moved hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians/Russians there in the 50 's . Anyways that attitude supersedes any other critical approach for many Hungarians . The problem is many Hungarians , even after 45 years of occupation , clearly never learned - or forgot - the horrific burden Russians come with . There 's a saying here , `` Hungarians are amnesiacs '' . Because they forgot the effects of the German/Russian occupations and clearly do n't learn from mistakes made by our ancestors in the past . As far as Ukraine goes , I see more empathy for the rebels for the most part . That 's because of the above-mentioned situation . The situation of Hungarians in Romania , Slovakia , Serbia , Ukraine etc are often deemed comparable to Russians in Ukraine , and as Hungarians they always feel the need to reunite with Hungarians . Unfortunately it 's really hard for Hungarians to translate this to other western nations in the 21st century since the fate of the entire continent may be decided in just a few years - so there 's a little more at stake than the 150,000 Hungarians in Zakkarpatia . It 's also not making it easy that our PM placed all his eggs in the Russian basket , seeing as Russia is now viewed as Europe 's pariah . Yup , Hungarians were always terrible diplomats , arguably the worst which is why we always drew the short end in the past 150 years .

If the Allies landed in Spain , Franco ( the Spanish dictator ) simply would 've entered the war on the side of the Axis , and the Allies would thus have a whole new front to worry about . Remember that Franco was already aided by the Germans in the Spanish Civil War . Also , if the Allies landed in Spain , they would have to cross the Pyrenees to get into France . Mobilizing such a large number of men , machinery and munitions would be time-consuming , thus unnecessary . & gt ; The Nazi 's did not occupy France so would n't it mean a much less opposed invasion into Europe ? I think you meant to say Spain here . Anyways , once again , it would 've been a rash move to invade Spain . It was a miracle in itself that Spain did n't enter on the side of the Axis .

100courics,AskReddit,"The cause of it was that political entities in Europe were actually looking for a war , all sides sharing equally in this cause . -Franz Ferdinand was n't actually popular at all with Austrians . Apparently ( I think I read this in a Stefan Zweig novel ) when they found out Ferdinand was assassinated , they grieved for a couple of minutes , then went on as if nothing happened . The emperor could easily have looked past it , should it have been an assassin in a more significant country ( France or Germany instead of Serbia ) - The alliances that we all know of today were n't remotely as clear back in the day . Everyone knew France and the German Empire were n't best friends , but the loyalties of countries like Great Britain ( who had at that point recent royal lineage ancestry in Germany ) , the Russian Empire , Italy , and ( most importantly ) the United States were still very questionable . -The treaty of Versailles was nothing but a public humiliation move . Everyone wanted to make it seem like the Entente were just walking around , doing nothing , when suddenly , out of nowhere , the evil Central Powers tried to rape them . Already by the time the Second Balkan War was over , everyone knew there was going to be another , potentially more devastating war . The only real questions were who was going to light the match , and what will the teams look like ... Austria-Hungary ( really just Austria , as Vienna had sole decision-making power in foreign relations and war ) were pressured by Germany to declare war on Serbia . The Germans said they 'd help , should there be trouble with the Russians ( who looked at Serbians as ethnic brothers ) . This was also a bit weird ; the United States , while neutral at the time , was unlikely to ever enter a war against Britain or France at that point . However , Germany had weapon licensing contracts with the Germans , which at first made them ( the Germans ) assume the US was at their side . They were wrong ; when the US entered the war on the side of the Entente , they fought German soldiers with weapons licensed from German manufacturers .

100courics,economy,"Hungary is either going to come out of its recent developments as the ultimate European winner of the 21st century , or will go back 50 years . In 2010 an eccentric ( to say the least ) right-wing government was elected . I 'm saying this because one has to understand the political logic behind economic investments of a state . Anyway , this government is a proponent of strict scrutiny of the economy , rather than the anarcho-capitalist idea of letting the economy regulate itself . Now this attitude alone garnered proponents and critics , the critics being by far the larger group : -Opponents of these events are claiming that Hungary is slipping back into a socialist state-like situation in which the government creates a bubble by fixing prices and inflation to make the people *think* life is golden - as happened in Hungary when it really was a socialist state . -Proponents say that what I just wrote is a gross exaggeration of the situation . It is true that when Western entrepreneurs arrived in Hungary in the late 80s/early 90s , most invested only to drain money out of the country . Meanwhile , the majority of the first generation of Hungarian entrepreneurs ( those who began to work in the private sphere which began to appear by the early 80s despite communism ) became oligarchs who could n't give less of a damn about the country 's economy or condition , they just wanted to stuff their pockets . Basically , while Hungary officially pulled ahead of most ex-communist bloc countries in the 90s , Hungarians themselves had tragic experiences with the private sphere . But , apparently , the current government gave the green light for partial monopolies to twenty-some western companies it has confidence in through strategic partnership agreements . Most of these are companies which have been in Hungary since the 90s AND actually contributed to the economy through taxation and job creation . For example , Coca-Cola : http : //www.kormany.hu/download/a/40/c0000/Korm % C3 % A1ny-Coca-Cola_en.pdf Another is Suzuki : http : //www.suzuki.hu/pages/display/corporate/article/cikk : suzuki_enters_long_term_strategic_partnership_with_hungarian_government You get the idea : the government wants those companies which are known to have been beneficial to Hungary 's development to continue investing . How has the EU been reacting to these events ? There has been sparring between the Union and the national government on a weekly basis in 2012 ( it mostly cooled down by the end of 2013 ) . Two of the four freedoms of the EU are really the issue at hand : movement of goods and capital . The European Commission said Hungary was barring these fundamental values by enacting legislation which a ) favors Hungarian brands over foreign ( protectionism , which the EU tries to combat in all member states ) and b ) tries to limit the investors to only those who the Hungarian government can trust . The Hungarian economy has improved , despite alarming voices . FDI figures reached new heights in 2012 , if I remember correctly . The budget deficit is under control and the EU removed Hungary from the Excessive Deficit Procedure last year , which it has been under since joining in 2004 . It 's not a spotless method , however . The current government inadvertently may also have presented an atmosphere in which small-to-medium private entities are discouraged from forming , threatening a fundamental value of capitalism : competition . Another alarming note is the Hungarian government 's recent ( yesterday ) decision to upgrade and expand the country 's nuclear power-plant with the aid of Russian funds and Russian work . http : //www.euronews.com/2014/01/14/nuclear-deal-between-russia-and-hungary/ Here 's the problem with that : Russia never , ever gives anything for free . East-central and eastern European countries are continuously bullied by Russia through energy exports . It basically exercises hegemony in the region through energy such as natural gas and oil . What 's odd is that , while the other countries in the region are trying their best to pull towards the West , the Hungarian government actually voluntarily approached the Russians with this idea , denying a tender for the project ( which means there was no official competition announced , which many Western bodies would have been glad to enter ) . This also brings us back to the freedoms I mentioned earlier . The Hungarian government denied the right to freedom of the movement of capital by denying a fair competition - not to mention that it denied this to EU competitors in favor of Russia . The `` good '' news is that ( officially , at least ) it 's just monetary investment , meaning Hungary will simply have to pay back the money . That 's good because at least that can be done . The real problem would come if it was agreed that Russians would provide the energy itself ; then , Hungary would become the next Ukraine : whenever it would say no to Russia , the Russians would cut energy supplies , paralyzing the country . Just my take on Hungary 's economy . I know , a lot of this seems like it does n't have anything to do with what you asked but they 're all related . Hope this helps .

Hungarian villages were intentionally flooded by breaking dams open . When Ceausescu came into power , he purposefully tried to disintegrate the Hungarian community by shipping large numbers of Romanian workers into cities like Oradea and Cluj . You notice how , starting in 66 ( after Ceausescu assumed power ) , the demographics of Cluj drastically tilted toward Romanians , while it was balanced before that ? Even before Ceausescu , Romanians sought to dilute Hungarian populations . Cluj was 4/5 Hungarian in 1910 http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj # Demographics Yet that number was halved in 1920 .

I personally take the historic route to explain the animosity between the two states , but I do concede that today 's situation in Voivodina is just as , if not more , important than what happened a century earlier . The Hungarian minority in Serbia has it the worst out of all Hungarian minorities among Hungary 's neighbors . I 'd say at least one person dies each year for a ridiculous reason like speaking in Hungarian in public or wearing a shirt with Hungarian writing on it .

100courics,hungary,"I 'd say the historical connection of the countries . We were in personal union for just about 800 years so it was n't something to overlook . The Serbs , on the other hand , caused the downfall of the Kingdom of Hungary - as well as absorbing large amounts of Hungarians against their will - so there was ( and is ) plenty of resentment between the two nations . Croats are Catholics and use the Latin alphabet , whereas Serbs are Orthodox and use both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets ( I ca n't remember which one for official use ) . So there 's a large cultural distinction between Serbs and Hungarians , but not so much between Hungarians and Croats - aside from plain ethnicity . Also , there was still conscription in Hungary in the early and mid-90s . There are urban legends of the Antall government secretly working out scenarios in which Hungary would be drawn in by the war ( if there was genocide against ethnic Hungarians for example ) . Luckily that never happened , so it remains an urban legend .

Croats are our favorite neighbors because 1 ) We have n't historically had problems with them ( aside from that little run-in in 1848 ) , and 2 ) They hate Serbs more than Hungarians . Hungarians supported Croats during the Yugoslav Crisis and a lot of Croat refugees temporarily stayed in Hungary until they could move back home once the war was over . A Croatian lady stayed with us - her family was murdered right before her eyes . She was one of the nicest people I 've ever met . Anyways , Croats are fine in Hungary since they 're our one neighbor who does n't give us shit . As far as stereotypes go , I do n't know of any , at least about Croats .

100courics,explainlikeimfive,"In terms of legality , it does ( or so it should ) . Since the US has a negative constitution , it focuses on curbing powers of authority , not enabling them ( as is the case with most European states ) . In itself , the Second Amendment should n't even be questioned ; everybody knows it was meant to allow citizens to possess firearms , not [ this ] ( http : //tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy-images/Bear % 20Arms % 20a % 20Right.jpg ) . However , there were things that the Founding Fathers could simply not foresee . For example , even repeaters would n't be introduced until several decades after the drafting of the Bill of Rights , let alone machine guns and weapons of mass destruction ( NBC ) . Many anti-gun enthusiasts argue this and claim that if the Founding Fathers lived today , they would probably support gun control laws . Obviously this can never be proven so it remains a grey area instead . The rise of guerrilla warfare and modern terrorism also questions the black-and-white validity of the Second Amendment . In 1788-89 , guerrilla warfare could n't have been imagined since firearms were relatively primitive and small numbers of fighters could rarely make it work against larger numbers of organized soldiers . Today , however , as Afghanistan shows us , that is very possible . No Constitution-drafting state in the right mind today would allow there to be an all-out right to bear arms for civilians , out of fear for things like terrorism and guerrilla movements . Of course , it can be argued that many of these outlaws did n't obtain weapons illegally anyways . The media does an excellent job at undermining the Second Amendment . Whenever there 's a shooting at a public location , the media lets it ride for weeks , sometimes months to create anti-gun sentiment among the population . An unintended effect of this is the copycat phenomenon , in which a loner wants a similar set of 15 minutes of fame and repeats the process . This creates more and more anti-gun feelings in the public . This ca n't just be viewed from a legal standpoint , because that is not the only thing that affected such laws in the US for decades now . Mass hysteria has just as much of an effect on the matter , in my opinion .",Uralic,Hungarian

Like when you post black crime statistics 'its because of poovverrtyyy ' , then when you disprove that claim they switch the subject to personal attacks generally .

I personally think that the global environment is a big issue and he seems to brush that off in favor of a less regulated economy , so I disagree with him on that . I think that he 's a good manipulator of words , he seems so self assured and certain that you 're inclined to believe him but I think the beliefs he espouses are very immoral and short sighted .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"Stuff like this have made me just so furious . The good part of this was that the Muslim scholar is predicting a happening in the future , a clash of culture . What bothers me about Breivik is that he killed a bunch of English Norweigan youth , and not the true problem . And if people say I 'm being extreme for that belief , think . The left apologizes for elements of society who disproportionately have killed thousands year by year .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; The German army was relatively well disciplined - one of the reasons so many Allied POWs from Britain and England survived unlike those who were captured by Japanese . German captured English and French had a great survival chance . They were more Aryan than Slavs , who Germany saw as Judeo Bolshevik pawns , and thus as more disposable . Russia did n't sign the Geneva convention , and the fighting was more brutal in the east so both sides committed more war crimes there .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"Thanks for the tip , I 'll try that out . As far as skin , I 've been good on skin issues by keeping stress low partially . I also want to recommend cold showers for the mornings . I start them out warm , then go to moderate , then to coldish then cold then very cold . This really wakes you up . It also closes your pores which helps prevent acne , and its good for your skin too , hot water can be harmful . Drinking a lot of water has been the big one for me too .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"This is one of the biggest problems for me which I 've remedied several ways . First , I just look at what he 's really doing and see if it 's so bad . Like socks on the couch or something . He 's my man , do I really want to nag him over something little like that ? He pays for me , gives me sex , is the father of my beautiful child , such a nice man , makes me feel safe , why should I bother him over this ? I 'm his partner and I 'm here to help him in a mutually beneficial relationship . The problem is in the moment I can barely help but let it slip . I literally do bite my tongue to help me avoid saying it . Then I shift it to something positive , I might go over and sit in his lap , or give him a kiss , or let him get a glimpse of my butt or something fun like that so I 'm not in a negative mindset . 1 or 2 minutes later it is something that I 've probably already forgotten , yet if I 'd pursued him about it could lead into him being angry or an argument taking place . I 'm no expert but what works for me is hold my tongue , change the subject and it rarely becomes a problem if I do that",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"Then you should probably marry a Pole : ) There are some Polish Catholic women who would make excellent wives . Eastern Europe still has lots of degeneracy and feels bleak at times , but at the end of the day it 's a non Jewish culture and that has a very distinct feeling . Yes there is degeneracy but you can call it out . No SPLC or ADL or stuff like that . Honestly if you want to move to Poland you should marry a Pole and have her only speaks the language to you in the house . That 's how my husband learned German , I would only speak to him in German and eventually he learned it that way . Just as a random aside from that , being in a relationship where you communicate less verbally can be awesome . You need to communicate in other ways so you spend more time physically touching , holding hands , sex , looking at each other , Etc . less of the offhand remarks that tend to start arguments . You re learn the different languages of love , especially in the beginning when you can barely speak and learn to communicate more with touch , sex , facial expressions , and smiles : ) We sometimes went hours together just silently looking at each other , me in his arms . It felt very romantic . Hope I 've been of some help , sorry for that random story",Uralic,Hungarian

I think he later served as a footsoldier when the tanks ran out of fuel . Later in the war he was a rifleman and he used a flamethrower as well I know . Most of the stories he had to tell were very very grim , the soldiers on both sides were incredibly cruel to each other . He said they would have to kill an enemy and quickly steal his boots before his legs froze , because the German boots were ill suited . He said the German soldiers raped tons and tons of Russian women . He also said that lots of Jews were mass killed in fields .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"I do n't think I 'm as virtuous as you think , I always did do it for myself . I viewed the boys I rejected for wanting sex as wanting to defile me and ruin my chances of a high quality man and thus as bad . I did it in a self interest of wanting a patriarchal husband . I just saw how gender relations worked from a young age , the natural urge of men toward an untouched virgin wife . I only wanted one man in my life , whoever I ended up marrying . These days I keep with that . I 'm only permitted to talk to other men when my husband is present . I 'm sorry if I 'm rambling on I just really love gender roles . The innate tender love between a man and a woman . Do you ever plan on having kids ? I do n't use birth control , my husband and I have a very large house capable of accommodating around 10 kids and we both want a big family . I 'm also home 24/7 so we can make it work . I think having children is essential to marriage , there 's something so intimate about being pregnant , it marks a girl physically as belonging to her husband which I love . It feels so freeing to let go of control and your husband is there to protect you . Being pregnant and held in his arms is the best feeling in the world .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"Interesting . I always love hearing what you have to say from a Catholic perspective .

I started dating ( not in a relationship , just romantically dating ) my husband when I was 14 and he was 19 on and off for a while , and during this time he slept around . For a few years I witnessed him become less and less happy and be destroyed by the life of promiscuity . We started dating again and he expressed his desire to live a pure life with a family and children . I made him wait till marriage totally chaste , not even kissing me until we could become intimate . He 's a total alpha male , everything you 'd want in a husband . Handsome , economically successful , traditional , dominant , loving , protrctve , good genes . I 'm glad I married him but I do wish he never slept around like that because it made him so unhappy , and I 'm glad that he has a woman who will treat how how a patriarch deserves to be treated . It 's not like I do n't rely on him either , being held in his arms and being safe and owned is such a great feeling .",Uralic,Hungarian

I 'm not saying to repress your sexual urges to my level prior to marriage , but its not some awful standard not to crawl in the street in sex clothes . And btw I doubt those super moral pride parade goers would like me or give me much consideration either not that I mind . & gt ; what you really mean here is , no one in your immediate circle of friends would act in this way . i would ask you to define `` normal '' for me , but i do n't want you think i 'm doing it for semantics alone . That 's fine , normal is common/predominant behavior in my view , homosexuality does not fit this , let alone homosexuals like the one I linked .

Right , so a homo dressed in fetish clothes dancing on the street is the 'real world ' but a conservative country with families and a strong culture is n't ... ... lol .

There were 2 million rapes max , so at most there 's an insignificant number of part Russian people in Germany . In Russia however , there were around 10 million rapes by German soldiers .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; when you go around calling other people 'sub-human ' or 'degenerates ' -- that 's antithetical to tolerance . that 's not a sign of confidence ; its a sign of insecurity ( if not complete and utter self-loathing ) . Ok subhumans is too far but not everything here is serious anyway . Degenerate is a very plain term . Degeneracy means evidence of decline , degenerates are people who engage in lesser behavior . It is not a sign of insecurity , and I have no idea how you think it makes me self loathing ? I like who I am . & gt ; a person that is secure with their own standing in the world does not need to shit on others . Wrong , I just recognize that there are sick people in society who need to be called out . Silent tolerance will allow the worst in society to be accepted . & gt ; its one thing to keep your distance from the unfamiliar . its completely another thing to be hostile ( like you are ) to what you can not understand . It seems you think hostility is always a bad thing . Hostility is inherent in nature , even in the animal kingdom different tribes of animals are hostile to foreigners to protect what they have . Even in the worst case , your argument is based around accusing me of being insecure , I do n't think that 's a very serious problem , insecurity even if it were true about me which I do n't think it is . I 'd rather be the watchdog against subversion and be 'insecure ' than allow society to accept trash like pedophiles and have achieved your standard of personal security . I prefer standing up for what I believe is right than you thinking I 'm secure in myself . In fact , yielding in my beliefs due to others judgement is a greater sign of insecurity than sticking up for what I believe in . I 'm secure in myself , people who espouse beliefs such as moral relativism are the ones I view as less secure in themselves . & gt ; the world is chaotic , and neither of us can do anything to change that . again , a confident person accepts things as they are . People can do nothing to change that ? Let 's say ten years ago there was no gay 'marriage ' in America , would you have just accepted that ? People can cause change in the world , only the weak pacify themselves by saying that everything is out of their control . What you call confidence appears more to me as weakness . I 'm interested in what you have to say and its hard to understand your point of view to me .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,CoonTown,Deport them all,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; your desire for structure ( which then leads to repression ) is considered unhealthy by many . I understand that , it is also supported by many and many view the results of your lack of morals/laws governing behavior to be regressive . & gt ; a truly confident person is tolerant of those that are not like them . I 'm very confident in myself , enough to know that all people are not equally deserving of tolerance . For example we should n't tolerate harmful behavior , criminals , liars , etc . Tolerance as a philosophy seems to be rooted in an expectation that all behavior is equal and deserving of tolerance . C.S . Lewis had something similar to say on `` equality '' , `` No man who says I ’ m as good as you believes it . He would not say it if he did . The St. Bernard never says it to the toy dog , nor the scholar to the dunce , nor the employable to the bum , nor the pretty woman to the plain . The claim to equality , outside the strictly political field , is made only by those who feel themselves to be in some way inferior . What it expresses is precisely the itching , smarting , writhing awareness of an inferiority that the patient refuses to accept . And therefore resents . '' I 'm totally self confident , even without supporting lesser behavior ! & gt ; meanwhile , people that are insecure have to cling onto their `` comfort '' , in order to uphold their sense of control within a chaotic world , outside of their control . Hit the nail on the head , I totally agree . I view order/conformity as a better goal than chaos and nihilism . & gt ; comfort is good , if you 're comfortable with yourself . comfort is bad , when you 're using it to sooth yourself from the reality of the situation going on outside your door . You keep acting like a homosexual agenda is inevitable , the opposite is the case . Eastern Europe is moving in the opposite direction of the U.S. , against left wing ideology . 10 years ago , 15 % of Russians supported gay 'marriage ' , today that number is 4 % . When countries have suffered within recent history , they do not accept decadency . Eastern European nations stripped of their independence by the U.S.S.R. , and now understand the true nature of the left wing and are shifting to the right . & gt ; you 're welcome to hate gays , but i 'm not sure what you 're going to do when the rest of the world begins to follow in the steps of U.S . Most Hungarians do n't want to model ourselves after the U.S. , believe it or not we have our own language , race , and culture and our media is n't pushing degeneracy on us . BTW , I do n't hate gays entirely . Ive said this before , I have lesbian inclinations myself , I just do n't do it because I prefer a more rewarding life . What I hate is the self righteous attitude of this entitled , diseased minority who believe they can degenerate one of the oldest human traditions without backlash .",Uralic,Hungarian

There were so many times where we tried to have sex , and I couldn ’ t get an erection , and my wife would cry herself to sleep . : ( Sad to see , there 's no need for this . & gt ; I felt betrayed because I dedicated my life for her , I do more for her than any other person I have ever dated or known yet she gave more to an ex than me . : ( Poor guy , I really do feel bad for him . & gt ; She told me that she didn ’ t realize what it all meant to me and was 100 % willing to do anything I wanted in the bedroom . I told her that I want her to want it , not for her to do it out of guilt or pity , and also , thinking about those things it just reminds me of you and him together , and I want to avoid that . My wife started crying hysterically , saying she wants to do it because she loves me and wants me to feel better . Aww , that 's so so sad , this really highlights more than anything the later on effects of sexual promiscuity . Not some reddit slut getting self righteous about it or anything , just how this women is broken and it has really ruined her marriage . & gt ; I still care for her and love her but the intensity of the feelings I have for her have weakened . : ( Even more sad . Unlike the pro slut agenda , this is a very nice man who still ca n't help but be sad to realize he married a girl who slept around . Eye opening to see the emotional effect that it has on him . & gt ; My therapist doesn ’ t think it ’ s a bad thing , he said my way of loving was based on delusion . Yeah thanks therapist , he 's totally deluded for expecting his wife not to have gotten fucked in the ass in a threesome .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,Modern feminism exists as a [ Jewish cancer ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category : Feminists_by_religion ) which harms modern women in many ways . It is promoted by industry and government for the sole purpose of increasing the amount of laborers without regard for how it messes with society .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,The purpose was to help gain power in Berlin . Munich was the home of the German right wing but they had almost no influence in Berlin which was a hotbed of degeneracy . Because of this some leaders used to influence more liberal areas were gay .,Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Yep . That speech coming out of anyone 's mouth expect for his would be viewed as genius . Hitler saw how international capitalism rendered Western 'democracies ' a farce , something even more visible today . Because he recognized how globalist capitalism was strangling Western culture , he fought against it . Today , the same international elites who control the government , education system , voting system , and media have done their best to portray him in as negative a way as possible . You see some Hollywitz movie with Nazis as the bad guy every six months , even though Stalin for example and even America have killed more people . What terrifies them about Hitler is that he targeted the globalist elite class .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"This whole thread is about democracy , quit trying to shift it to `` muh holocaust ' .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"The national socialism subreddit is a subreddit which assumes you know about several topics which are very discreet and most people do n't understand . It is also vitriolic to some degree . For an understanding of almost all the issues they discuss , I recommend reading Mein Kampf and Zweites Buch . Those two books outline national socialism perfectly . & gt ; when I visit that subreddit all I see is white trash complaining about immigrants and jews . Do n't rush to judgement on calling others who you 've never even met white trash . I 've Skyped with a lot of those people before and they seem like very intelligent individuals . & gt ; Another question I have is , is NS about peaceful segregation between races or is it all about violence ? As far as Hitler 's national socialism , it was about securing race homelands for Europeans . He did not want to commit violence for the heck of it , but he was fighting international capitalist forces . & gt ; My last question is are all NS groups anti-Semitic and racist ? If you 're talking national socialism as in Hitler 's national socialism then yes to both absolutely . National socialism has only once existed , non racist national socialism is just an idea . & gt ; And one more thing , can someone point me in the direction of NS economics and polices . Learn about Hjalmar Schacht 's economic plan . Also search more about the German Labor Front , rations , and other techniques Germany used to create a self sufficient economy . They never became totally self reliant , they needed some trade with allies for steel during the war but were far less reliant on globalism for sustenance . I think there was some NS general thread a while back with a lot of info too",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,What non `` racist '' national socialism has ever existed ?,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"That 's an interesting idea but I disagree . Hitler , Theodor Fritsch , Anton Drexler , Himmler , and Goebbels were the main people behind the advancement of national socialism and were all very very racist .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,Jesse Owens was treated well but that 's because it was a spectacle . The few Africans in Germany were sterilized during the Nazi reign . The foreign S.S. fighters were almost entirely European and only a few were non European . I see the argument that national socialism is not explicitly racist but I just dont understand it in the grand scheme of things .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,Yeah,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Here 's a short video about it . http : //m.youtube.com/watch ? v=S1Fc0Jtp20c Degeneracy just means behavior showing evidence if a decline .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,I think you should be cognizant of the fact that Israel is destabilizing the region . Some places like Kuwait and Qatar have the potential to be great because of their wealth I believe . I think Christianity is a better religion for the middle East than Islam is so maybe Arabs could adopt that instead .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Ok that 's a bit extreme I admit calling them the NSDAP . They may not call themselves fascist , but they are * Nationalist * Anti semitic * Explicitly racialist * Anti global trade and anti Jewish investment * Anti homosexuality So overall I 'd say it 's pretty darn far right wing while not explicitly fascist",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Idk , where I live Jobbik is at 22 % polling right now , which is like a Hungarian NSDAP .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,I think you ca n't stay in the early reactionary mode forever . The mass propaganda and Keynesian spending are short term solutions so big problems . I think over time you have to tone down and move more toward traditionalism with less of a revolutionary aspect . I disagree democracy is the end goal because democracies are often the cause of situations that require fascism . Weimar Germany was a democracy but was horrible for the German people . Modern 'democratic ' America is a joke . I think you need to create a more relaxed and less extreme but still ordered society .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,The difference is progressive 'fascism ' does n't exist in practice .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Seeing how international capitalists always tell us that we NEED them supposedly , then seeing how Nazi Germany was able to become largely self sufficient without being slaves to globalist trade/finance .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,They have several arguments aside from the usual knee jerk and six gorillion * It is totalitarian and puts the collective peoples success before the rights of individuals . * It limits the 'free movement ' of people around the world . * It has a system of laws which they generally oppose,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"It is actually working well for me , our country like Russia is moving in the opposite direction of the West .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"You can find so many different statistics which show how they live hedonistic , lesser lifestyles . Higher promiscuity , drug use , shorter lives , higher rates of mental issues , and even liberal estimates show that adultery is around 80 % for gays . They 're hedonists and perverts . As for transgender , it is in every way inferior to normal people . There is no way to say that mentally ill people who have to surgically mutilate themselves , have a 40 % suicide rate , and many other problems are somehow equal to straight people . & gt ; given that their sexual activity is consensual and is not with minors .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,That 's horrible,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Frankurt School Marxism is mostly a dead ideology do I can lay it out for you . A group of Jewish intellectuals created this ideology . It mainly centers around critical theory . Critical theory is the one element of cultural Marxism that remains common in the far left today . It espouses an attack on `` mass culture '' and political `` hegemony '' . For example attacking `` hegemonic masculinity '' AKA patriarchy and male rule , because that was what they percieved as the 'mass culture ' . Critical theory is the main pillar of cultural Marxism and stresses criticizing society , which obviously is easy for foreigners who have a belief in cultural superiority . Many of these Marxists were Jewish mysticists and zionists , which makes it easy to understand why they disliked European society . During WW2 , a bunch of them escaped to America and influenced the American counterculture of the 50s and 60s by kind of tutoring other influential Jewish revolutionaries in America . Herbert Marcuse for example , went to America and influenced Abbie Hoffman , a famous Jewish counterculture leader . In this way , cultural Marxism served as basically nothing more than an attack on culture . Many attacks on Western morals , institutions , and principles sprung from cultural Marxism . As for the common right wing claim of 'cultural marxism ' , I 'm somewhat wary of this cause its a knee jerk term . Yes , cultural Marxism was harmful and I do see similar beliefs espoused in the media but can not see the influence of Frankfurt School directly today . I do n't know if I 'd call it malevolent . It certainly complains more than it creates solutions and exists as a prasitic ideology on societies whose only purpose is to criticize .",Uralic,Hungarian

I think the nationalism would have to gradually tone down from a more reactionary Fascism such as Hitler 's to a nationalist conservative government like Franco . Obviously , the state would have to maintain its laws but I think over time once degeneracy is removed and the society is cleansed of international elements , you have to tone down the nationalism . Obviously keep a closed border and do n't liberalize the laws , but over time shrink the army , lessen propaganda , etc . Pure reactionary fascism is unsustainable over time .",Uralic,Hungarian

No reason why we should take the poorest Africans in the world into our fairly safe and peaceful land . Other countries who have taken in these illegal immigrants have paid harshly . In crime example , in Finland immigrants commit 10x more rape on average than Englishs . I do n't understand the logic of people who complain about deportations . Illegal immigrants provide us nothing . They demand food , shelter , and protection from our country and give us nothing . What do you think we will gain from these 'refugees ' ? You can be open minded , nothings wrong with that but do n't confuse masochism with open mindness . We should n't punish our own country in the name of empathy",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,childfree,"& gt ; Actually the culture does match europe -- or arabia and spain . Much of it was taken from Russia and Germany for ashkenazim and spain/morrocco for sephardim . Utter garbage and you know this . The culture does not match , the holidays do not match , the scripture does not match , the group behaviors do not match , the ethnicity does not match . I 'm at a loss for what supposedly matches here . What matches ? Because they lived for a period on the soil of Spajn or Germany ? Yet if the cultures matched , the Englishs would n't have gotten sick of them . The Jews in Spain supposedly were 'matching ' the culture of the Spanish yet the supported the Muslim invaders . & gt ; Also `` partially '' ? Just like you are partially descended from africans . Nope , pure European . I got a DNA test . In fact Russian genealogists recently disproved the 'out of Africa theory ' anyway . & gt ; HAHAHA what bullshit . Most jews dont have the nose , and plenty lack black and/or curly hair . Much of the time it actually is not easy to tell . Lots of non jews get mistaken for jews and lots of jews are pegged as non jews . Nah , I became an expert at it . Even more subtle Jews like Jon Stewart are easy to visually identify .

They want to come to our countries for work , not because they care about our culture . Not because they want to contribute to society . Magyars owe them nothing . We did not cause their country 's economic problems . Immigration has proven to be a huge problem in other countries , why should we try it for the sake of 'empathy ' ? We did n't cause their problems , we should n't let them cause problems for us .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"The further you remove sex from its natural purpose , the more degenerate it becomes . Homosexuality has a disproportionate relation to pedophilia as well . The 1972 American gay platform specifically called for the removal of age of consent laws , and it took till the 90s for mainstream gay groups to distance themselves from pro pedophilia groups like NAMBLA . It is a negative to society , which is evidenced by the actions of gays . Incredible levels of sexual promiscuity , infidelity , drug use , and STD rates are common among homosexuals , not to mention a general obsession with sex that I 've noticed . As far as this whole gay 'marriage ' thing I 've seen recently , the whole concept is a joke and was really used to slip by globalist trade agendas . And of course we know who is [ behind ] ( http : //www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/22/biden-jewish-leaders-helped-gay-marriage-succeed/ ) this .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; We 're agreed on that one , though it 's more of a `` muh traditional culture '' than Asian girls specifically , it just so happens that Asian girls usually come from very similar cultures to the one espoused as ideal by the right wing of western politics . If TRP could find western girls with traditional values in similar amounts , it would probably drop the `` Asian girls '' thing . That 's true . Not to mention , in America when I visited , I noticed pretty Asian women with even ugly white men . I think because Asian men are not attractive and white men are , it makes it easy more for white redpillers . I do n't think nihilism is good , especially among insecure men like the many there . One benefit of TRP is the ability to say offensive facts there such as jew naming , redpillwomen is also great .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; HIV ( not AIDS ) is prominent amongst the gay community , i wo n't deny that . and its largely because gay men are highly sexualized , stereotypically , i ca n't deny that either . Gay men are n't sexualized , most people do n't want them to be as forward and crazy sexually , they oversexualize themselves . & gt ; because HIV transmission has nothing to do with sexual orientation , on an innate level . its all about access to sex and unsafe practices . its far too ... black and white to conflate statistics with some sort of moral ideology . Yes it does , gay sexual orientations lead people to engage in sex in ways that causes more infections",Uralic,Hungarian
