17DF53E,skyrim,"They came without warning . Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound , and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count , wielding flame and foul sorcery , slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose . Of once-mighty Stonehall 's military strength only the Bronze Legion , led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin , was near enough to answer the call of battle . They rode into their city , fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets , cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion : an ethereal rift within the city square , and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion . Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer , the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade , cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil . Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast . It turned , smiling at her through a maze of teeth . Heedless of the battle raging around them , they charged one another . Deflecting blow after blow , the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them . Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her . The odds turned . The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly , a brutal thrust from the side , but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke . Blade scraped on blade , beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below , carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood . The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack , driving her blade through her foe 's flesh into the stampeding heart within . With a scream that split the clouds above , the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish . The stygian portal wavered , the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared . The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel . Though victorious , the survivors saw little to celebrate : the city lay in ruins , and survivors were few . Fires continued to spread . Unfurling her banners of war , Tresdin gathered what allies she could . Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss , and damned be any who would dare stand in her way .",Germanic,German

1L4V,DotA2,"**IT WAS THE REFLECT OF DUEL WITH AGHS ! COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT^so^so^so^sorry** We played against an Anti-Mage with Aghs and everytime our Necrophos ulted him he took 0 DMG from the ult . It did n't matter how much HP he had left . I could n't find any reason , he does n't take any dmg from Reaper Scythe . MatchID : 2989133401 Examples of what I am talking about : ( Time equals the Clock ingame ) **first time** Time : 63:31 on bot lane . He was duelled and ulted from Necrophos with around 1/4 of his HP . Reaper 's Scythe deals 0 DMG . In the combat Log only the debuff is stated , but nowhere any dmg . Spell Shield is on CD ( got popped by LC Duel ) . Lion Ult also does n't show up as dmg in combat Log , only as debuff and seems to deal no dmg . **game deciding time** Time : 65:27 mid lane where Dire Tier 2 would 've been . Again AM had Spell Shield on CD because of Duel and again he was Necro ulted with around 1/4 of his HP . In the **Combat Log** following is always written : > Anti-Mage receives modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff from Necrophos . > Anti-Mage loses modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff . There is no DMG in the combat Log and 0 dmg was taken . Do I miss something completely obvious ? Or is there actually something broken ? Please someone look into this matter , because if this is true , then AM Aghs is bugged . REALLY bugged . Matchlink : dota2 : //matchid=2989133401 & matchtime=4004 **Edit 1 : ** LC had no Aghs .

1cast,HomeNetworking,"hey there . so my wifi at home sucks . i have a modem/router combo from my isp which has built in wifi . its the Technicolor TG588v . i have a 100MBit/s down and 20Mbit/s up DSL connection and i get the full speed when i am hardwired , but none of that when i am on wifi . just made a speedtest on my ipad with full 3 bars and it went to 18Mbps down and 1.81mbps up , and another speedtest on my ( new ) phone , which got 14,52 in down and 2.03 in up . the coverage is also really bad , i only get 1 bar sometimes in some rooms , and speed goes down to about 1Mbps . ( the router is n't centered but there is also no way of placing it anywhere else in the house sucks , right ? i think i would also benefit from a 5Ghz wifi ( my modem only has 2.4 ) , although there are n't many other wifi networks nearby . i 've read a lot online , most of them said an enterprise solution would be much better than some normal . i 've found the Ubiquity Unifi AP AC LR , which looks really nice . the thing is that i am still living with my parents , and i do n't want to drill many holes and pull wires through walls everywhere . my question is , would the coverage be still good enough if i will place it on the floor ? i 've read that the coverage is more like a `` donut-shape '' so it would n't make much sense fixing it to the wall because our house is a bit wide . i do n't want to mount it on the ceiling either . another question : i am able to receive some signal outside of the house on the street , so if the new access point would be even more powerful , would this be worse for security ? thanks for your help , if you need to know more , just ask edit : typos",Germanic,German

Game publishers that wish to sell in brick and mortar chains ( that would be basically all of the publishers ) mostly have to agree to charge the same base price online as the physical copies in the stores . Otherwise the stores would not agree to sell the game due to competititon from cheaper online offerings . And dropping the price in the physical copies would not be in their interest since products in those stores are subject to the high cost of living present in Australia , it would just cut into their profit . And as the publishers must price their products in the currency they do business in , they are kinda slaves to the exchange rate , irrespective of any hedging they may do . Another thing that keeps the prices higher - at USD equivalent terms - in non-USD currencies is stability of the price as observed by the consumer . Consumers have formed a general idea about the cost of games ( cost of everything ) . They are not going to assimilate very well to price changes if they followed the exchange rate , especially when the observed niominal price goes UP .

0_0_0,TrueReddit,"Is n't ~~he~~ Coward claiming that the methodology itself was manipulated to find no significance ? & gt ; Fourth , the performance of my students from Math 1A was evaluated in the subsequent course in the sequence , Math 1B . The score gain for my students averaged 0.17 grade points over the three Math 1B classes , with a sample size of approximately 1000 students . This raises the question of whether this is statistically signifiant . Your colleague Philip Stark , the chair of the Statistics Department , and someone who has gone on the record saying that student evaluations are not indicative of teaching effectiveness , wrote in his analysis : & gt ; '' The test statistic was the following : For each section of 1B , calculate the three average grades corresponding to each of the three 1A sections . Take the standard deviation of those three numbers . Add those numbers for the three sections of 1B . '' & gt ; While it takes some time to understand this statement , it amounts to the following : My students were divided into 9am and 11am groups corresponding to my two Math 1A class , and then a test statistic was used that penalized consistency in performance between the students from my two classes . Stark 's analysis went on to obtain a p-value of 0.13 and he concluded : `` There is no _statistical_ basis for concluding that any differences in the 1B performance -- to the extent that such differences exist -- are attributable to differences in what they learned in 1A .

0_0_0,wikipedia,"Nope . It means there are no *atoms* left over from the duck liver , never mind molecules . The dilution is so ridiculously over-over-over-over-overdone , the probability of any original atom remaining in the resulting solution completely disappears . Read the whole linked article . Choice quote : & gt ; '' 30C : Dilution advocated by Hahnemann for most purposes : on average , this would require giving two billion doses per second to six billion people for 4 billion years to deliver a single molecule of the original material to any patient . ''",Germanic,Finnish
0_0_0,wikipedia,"`` 5 times '' is incorrect . Also the definition is not about molecules per bottle , the bottles was only mentioned by /u/LWschool . Are you sure how scientific notation and the homeopathic `` system '' works ? The dilution in this case is described as `` 200C '' . This means a solution of one unit of original substance in 10^400 [ one followed by four hundred zeroes ] units of diluent . The approximate number of *atoms* ( not molecules^1 , mind ) in the observable universe is ~10^80 . Therefore , dividing 10^400 atoms by ~10^80 atoms per universe leaves ~10^320 universes required to have **a single atom remaining in the solution** , on average . So the amount of diluent e.g . water required in this solution , is equivalent to the atoms of these 10^320 universes and the amount of active ingredient is one atom . The difference between 10^80 and 10^320 is not `` 5 times '' . It 's 10^240 [ one followed by 240 zeroes ] . Footnote^1 : The orginal analysis in the wiki ignores the difference between molecules and atoms to give a rough sense of scale . This means that the 10^320 number is actually not enough , because it needs to be multiplied by the number of atoms in the particular molecule . Really complex proteins can have up to 10^6 atoms . So the upper limit is more like ~10^326 universes . : )",Germanic,Finnish

These persons are affected by thyroid cancer or goitres , and have filed lawsuits alleging that the French government , at the time led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac , had not adequately informed the population of the risks linked to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout . The complaint contrasts the health protection measures put in place in nearby countries ( warning against consumption of green vegetables or milk by children and pregnant women ) with the relatively high contamination suffered by the east of France and Corsica .

I had strange on-going sounds like the game had freezed but it was still working . I was disappointed I couldn´t explore Exotic and the other two planets left . I am playing on XOne and I am looking forward to the next updates so I can continue this savegame . Until then , I have to start another one .",Germanic,German

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,I think the pogo community should focus more on the lack of communication by Niantic .
