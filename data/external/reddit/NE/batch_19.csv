They did kill our policemen after a person of their own ethnicity killed around 30 Turks . So they started this . There are thousands of people on the mountains fearing to be irrelevant once HDP has enough power to be the voice of the Kurdish people . They want to represent the Kurdish people and are not ready to give the voice to Selo because it would lead to their irrelevance . Those people in the mountains do n't know anything else except for fighting and surviving . How could they function in society ?

19O5,soccer,"Sorry for being an ass in the beginning , but obv . everyone thinks he 's an expert in politics and I hate discussions with people who have no clue how politics , power and influence works . I do n't support self-determination per se . If we were to grant self-determination for any minority in the world , we 'd have a zillion of states . I 'm not saying this because I 'm obv . a Turk but because the 'Balkanization ' is only in the interest of greater powers . Some people say for example that Genscher was the reason that Yugoslavia ended , because he recognized Slovenia and Croatia . In the end the powerful decide about who 's accepted and who 's not . Would you think that Sorbs of Germany should have their own state ? & gt ; Do we let an area decide for itself or do we protect the individual minorities from the tyranny of the majority ? We have to respect and accept the internal sovereignty of states . There 's no world police and nobody should act as such .

19O5,soccer,"Kosovo was apart from the northern Serbian part Albanian . At times due to the political situation their autonomy was even taken away from Belgrade . From this perspective it was pretty legitimate that they fought Belgrade . My take on their independence : Obiously there are power games played on . And since NATO 's Balkans/Eastern Europe enlargement , it 's quite obvious that they want to not only remain their control in that area but widen their control and interests . Therefore I 'm against such a Kosovar independence , being a realist and an anti-imperialist . The school of thought of realism tells us that states will always look for their own interests ( US controls Balkans ) and that IOs are of lesser importance ( they 're there so the powerful can voice their agenda ) . Therefore I am against it . The AZ-AR situation : Karabakh was not homogeneous like Kosovo ( except for Northern Kosovo ) , they ( Armenians and Azerbaijanis ) in the same area but in different villages . Until the Armenians decided to invade the area , resulting in massacres and displacement of 700k Azerbaijanis . Although the majority of the territory was Armenian , there was never the legitimacy for Armenians to take over Karabağ . The UN has oftenly voiced that they are supporting Azerbaijan 's territorial integrity and that the occupation is illegal . The same ca n't be said for Kosovo . But I 'm not supporting any country invading another country in any matter . As a matter of fact I believe that the Turkish army should leave Cyprus , too . In the case of Cyprus , it 's just that the Turks are portrayed as the bad people . The Greek Cypriots massacred Turks and were about to make a coup so they could unite with mainland Greece . But an internationally not recognized TRNC is not helpful for neither Turkish Cypriots nor for Turkey . The status quo sucks , and the solution could have been the Annan Plan . I assume you thought since I 'm a Turk I 'd support the Kosovar independence , but you have to see the reasons behind the acts of greater powers . Obv . Russia is helping Armenia a lot in the Karabağ issue as well .",Turkic,Turkish

Also they fought Atatürk 's TBMM from 1919 to 1921 in South East Turkey . Assassinated Turkish diplomats and influential Turks by a terrorist organization they founded called ASALA . They also massacred local Azerbaijani population in Hocali 1992 and expelled about 1 million local Azerbaijanis from Karabağ during the Karabağ war and since then they have occupied illegaly Azerbaijani territory .

19O5,worldnews,"The events of 1915 are complex issues one must understand . I tell you from the Turkish POV , that there are big factors , I do n't want to repeat my words all over again , since I 've done it a lot today but the main points are - Turks were in war with Russians . The Armenians started their rebellion and sided with Russians - Massacres were done both ways , Turks and Kurds were killed by Armenians and Russian forces . The other way round as well . - Armenians were not loyal to the Empire and had to be evacuated , so they were deported to Syria , which was still part of Ottoman Empire those days - While being deported , due to circumstances deaths happened , but they were not planned and executed like the Holocaust , but they occured due to bad implementation - Turks accept that massacres happened , Armenians never talk about massacres Armenians have done - Western European powers have commited genocides en masse , such as Belgium in Congo , or the French in Algeria , but they wo n't get mentioned . - Armenians , especially Armenian Americans , have politicized the event so much that it is used for mainly discriminatory reasons . There 's no possibility for empathy towards Armenians . - Armenians occupy Azerbaijani territory and have commited massacres such as the Khojaly massacre in 1992 , they are no angels So my friend , this is the general Turkish view of the events . There 's a slim line between a massive accident , such as deaths during deportation and a planned and executed killing of an entire race . Turks claim that the second one never happened and was never intended . Such documents were never found as well . The biggest issue is that it is a very complex issue which is mostly simplified by media and people . Therefore I would prefer historians to take over instead of people who want to make politics over the dead bodies of thousands of people . That 's enough for today . Have a good night .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,worldnews,"The people involved , the so called Jön Türkler or Young Turks in English were part of the Ittihad-i Terakki Cemiyeti . However , these people took de facto control over the Empire and that led to the Ottoman Empire 's entrance into WW I and into the Tehcir Law ( Deportation ) . The Jön Türkler aimed to conquer Türkistan and unite Turkic people . But they failed , and Atatürk blamed the Empire and the Jön Türkler for the massive loss and created the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and created after winning the Turkish War of Independence on several fronts ( French/Armenian legion in South East for example ) the Republic of Turkey . As you see Atatürk was not even slightly involved in the events of 1915 . Atatürk even fought officially the Ottoman Empire , basically the Ottoman Empire had and did fight Atatürk 's forces . The Ottoman Empire betrayed the people of Turkey .",Turkic,Turkish

Surely , one must be ignorant to assume that there was a planned and executed genocide to erase the Armenian nation within the Ottoman Empire . Armenians , who were loyal to the Empire until the 1880 's , started rebellions and demanded independence and self determination . The tragedy for Armenians was October Revolution because they sided with the Russians in WW I to take especially Eastern Anatolia . Meanwhile Turks and Kurds chopped off Armenian heads , and Armenians chopped off Turkish and Kurdish heads . All , as loss of trust and loss of rational thinking . The Turks decided to evacuate Armenian population into esp . Syria which was Ottoman those days . İt is true that people lost their lives on their way , but it would have had ended very differently if this evacuation did n't happen . Such a tragedy . Bolsheviks gained power and Russia left Anatolia . But the Ottoman Empire was crumbled and was left to nothing but to sign the Treaty of Sevres which had the initial plan to partition Anatolia in favor of Armenians . - & gt ; http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/TreatyOfSevres_ % 28corrected % 29.PNG However , Mustafa Kemal could n't accept such a loss and went to Samsun on May 19th 1919 and started the Turkish War of İndependence . The rest is history , but on the eastern front of the Turkish War of İndependence , the French sided with Armenians , where Armenians lost again to Turkish forces and all their dreams of a Greater Armenia became history . Shortly after Eastern Armenia was invaded by the Bolsheviks and there was no independent Armenia . And about 23 years ago , when Armenians already occupied Azerbaijani territory , Karabağ , they massacred local population as well claiming that it happened as an occurence of war , so how is n't that double standarded ?

Their presence and the occupation of Palestine , their former occupation of Southern Lebanon are the reason why the hatred is passed among generations . Israel , themselves , are partially responsible for the hate .",Turkic,Turkish
19O5,exmuslim,"& gt ; It 's really absurd though to saddle Israelis and Jews as a whole tbf , people get hated all over the world for the actions of their government , since it is represents the people who have voted for them . The reason for the hate of Jews is as well due to their lobbyism in the States , and their pro-Israel decisions in regard of their foreign policies and their veto-power in the UNSC . So , in the end I ca n't be really mad about it and they have their reasons , but I hate how they are not ready to their own failures . Like that one Arab friend I have who defends Hamas .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,bodybuilding,"& gt ; It sucks that the average consumer is dumb enough to think that they 'll do the work , but it 's not the companies fault that people are idiots . of course , that 's straight out marketing . They do n't claim that if you take product x that you 'll become person x , but the person might claim that he 's got that body by using product x . The consumers will always look for the easiest way , and for a way with putting the least effort to reach a certain goal . That 's why people buy those belly burners ( http : //i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-7bb1/k2-_1d6518bc-4bcd-41a5-a0b8-63db3970632f.v1.jpg ) instead of doing some exercises . And those ripped people advertising those products make you think they 've got that body by using that product . That 's nothing new to make the consumer think that way , but if you claim straight out that you 're natty , all the time , then you are nothing but a liar and scum . There 's another way to dodge the question like Kai Greene did on a news show promoting Generation Iron , or I guess Jay Cutler on Generation Iron , even Arnold himself and Tom Platz admitted that there 's the use of steroids , but straight out lying is bullshit .",Turkic,Turkish

'' Well , any revolutionary or violent organization can be declared as terrorists , like for example the M-26-7 by Fidel , but as soon as they take control of a state which is internationally recognized as a sovereign state , there 's nothing another state can do to get rid of them . That 's why the US has tried for decades to kill Fidel by some sort of contract killers , organized coups ( Playa Giron ) and in the end there was nothing they could do except for isolating them by cutting off foreign relations and by embargos . But the term you wrote is more of a philosophical term since you 're talking about what 's right or wrong and the behavior of actors . But international relations cuts that off hence there 's no discussion about the term 'freedom fighters ' . International relations is definitely far more interesting than political science . Definitely recommending that study course if you 're into power politics .",Turkic,Turkish

Gilthoniel ! At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy . * **your pov about what witchking thinks and does : ** oh my god he swung his sword at my feet with westernese blade which i destroyed the entire nation back then . ( ok , it indeed makes sense since that blow could really end the hunt ) . **what actually happens : ** witchking cries and stabs frodo . frodo passes out , putting the ring off and falls on the ground . ( he does n't very seem so scary right now , does he ? ) *A shrill cry rang out in the night ; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder . Even as he swooned he caught , as through a swirling mist , a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a ﬂaming brand of wood in either hand . With a last effort Frodo , dropping his sword , slipped the Ring from his ﬁnger and closed his right hand tight upon it . * right now every single hobbit got passed out and we got strider with two wooden sticks with fire on them . u could : 1 . ) kill him and take the ring from the unconscious hobbit . 2 . ) if he is too strong to be dealt with even when without being armed , so just distract/stall him while one nazgul takes the ring from the frodo . 3 . ) if he is godlike and there is no way to get even close to him . one or two or even up to three nazguls sacrifice themselves and one gets undressed and sneak up and takes the ring . 4 . ) just use the black breath or some other spell on aragorn ? if they are too scared to do any of these options above they should n't even get hundreds of leagues close to the gandalf . gandalf describing his battle against the nazgul ; I was hard put to it indeed : such light and ﬂame can not have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old .",Turkic,Turkish

911Mitdidit,lotr,"& gt ; If he regained the One , Elrond , Galadriel , and Gandalf would have to take of the rings or **fall under his control . ** that is a bald claim . not even the dwarves did n't fall under his control and galadriel believes she can dominate the ring . many people think gandalf may overcome sauron 's will ( just his will not his power ) aswell . ‘ Ah , alas ! ’ cried Glo ´in . ‘ When will the day come of our revenge ? But still there are the Three . What of the Three Rings of the Elves ? Very mighty Rings , it is said . Do not the Elf-lords keep them ? Yet they too were made by the Dark Lord long ago . Are they idle ? I see Elf-lords here . Will they not say ? ’ The Elves returned no answer . ‘ Did you not hear me , Glo ´in ? ’ said Elrond . ‘ The Three were not made by Sauron , nor did he ever touch them . But of them it is not permitted to speak . So much only in this hour of doubt I may now say . They are not idle . But they were not made as weapons of war or conquest : that is not their power . Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth , but understanding , making , and healing , to preserve all things unstained . These things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained , though with sorrow . **But all that has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing , and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron , if he regains the One** sauron will know their plans but they will not become his minnions .",Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,lotr,"thats the point of view of sauron and the elves . not neccesarily the fact since as you mention in the second paragraph things did n't work out as it is supposed to be . *It was said that , protected as it was by Nenya , Lothlórien would not have fallen unless Sauron had personally come to attack it . * and how do you criticise that ? if nenya is able to project that kind of power to preserve lothlorien but at the same time sauron should be able to govern it from a far he does n't really need to come and attack does he ? also gandalf and elrond were n't the original ( first ) bearers of the three and galadriel could have been more stronger willed after an age . altough its still a stupid idea to use the rings if sauron gets the one back but i do n't think gandalf , elrond and galadriel would turn out to be sauron 's minnions .",Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,lotr,"i thought it was obvious that gandalf is not an elf and that paragraph from the silmarllion is as fact as elrond 's speech about the three-rings . pretty pointless argument to be honest , no strategist or commander would leak all of their information to the enemy so noone would wield their rings if sauron regained the one .",Turkic,Turkish

911Mitdidit,lotr,"& gt ; Aragorn 's comments at the Council of Elrond have more to do with pride in the Rangers and the attitude of the elves who look down on men . aragorn actaully made that speech to boromir after his complaining about gondor being bulwark of the west and recieve no thanks . ‘ If Gondor , Boromir , has been a stalwart tower , we have played another part . Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay . You know little of the lands beyond your bounds . Peace and freedom , do you say ? The North would have known them little but for us . Fear would have destroyed them . But when dark things come from the houseless hills , or creep from sunless woods , they ﬂy from us . What roads would any dare to tread , what safety would there be in quiet lands , or in the homes of simple men at night , if the Du´nedain were asleep , or were all gone into the grave ? ‘ And yet less thanks have we than you . Travellers scowl at us , and countrymen give us scornful names . ‘ ‘ Strider ’ ’ I am to one fat man who lives within a day ’ s march of foes that would freeze his heart , or lay his little town in ruin , if he were not guarded ceaselessly .

911Mitdidit,lotr,"note : this question is about the books and please read the whole post before replying . i 'm curious about why the ''five '' nazguls left the weathertop after stabbing the frodo ? some people claim nazguls were afraid of frodo because he yelled 'O Elbereth ! Gilthoniel ! ' thinking frodo is some sort of elven ally and nazguls do n't have much power over elves because most of the elves have been in blessed realm ( they saw both spirits and pysichal forms ) but the answer does n't satisfy me because frodo got stabbed **after** he yelled these words and struck at the feet of witchking or some other nazgul . and what was aragorn doing in this events ? i read the chapter 'a knife in the dark ' and 'flight to the ford ' multiple times and i still ca n't figure it out and aragorn seems to be as confused as i am , trying to figure out why nazguls act this way ? ps : i do realize frodo would be a wraith under the control of witch king but why do n't they just take the ring when everyone passed out except one halfling who just got stabbed and fell ? and there is no mention of aragorn scaring them off or doing anything at all..",Turkic,Turkish

911Mitdidit,kurdistan,yeah probably wrong . i dont think anyone researches the ethnicity of a spesific city but the election results can give a little bit clue about it since kurdish parties never get more than 15 percent ( max 5 percent before 2014 ) of the votes in antep .,Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,kurdistan,lol at 'anti-capitalism ' nonsense . the only way for kurds getting autonomy or independence for real in turkey is to let these every single capitalist allies of turkey to turn on them and support kurdistan instead .,Turkic,Turkish
911Mitdidit,kurdistan,"to be perfectly honest , anything can happen this time ! people usually admitted that akp is the dominant party of turkey so they didnt give a shit about elections but this time we saw that they are pretty vulnerable and ready to crack down like ANAP and other center right parties did in the past . so i expect this to be the highest voter turnout elections ever . akp can lose or win huge percentage of the votes from nationalist or conservative voters . if mhp or hdp cant pass trough 10 percent treshold we are all doomed . on the other hand hdp will remain the same . will lose the votes from west because they didnt really condemn pkk but on the other hand can take out all kurdish votes unless there wont be a stockholm syndrome . i dont expect any improvement for chp , it will be arround % 25-30 for sure . its already a high voter base and cant reach to like 50 percent without any alliance like akp+cemaat+kurds did .",Turkic,Turkish

911Mitdidit,Turkey,"hatred is a strong word , i just think akp foreign policy is a huge fail . they should have just back the turkmens when the civil war started and keep them in check . instead of chanting allah akbar and shooting russian pilot ( thats their whole image to the world right now ) they could act like a democratic and secular force . like ypg did . i know for a fact that there isnt much difference in between these armed groups since war and violance changes people but some of them have better image and therefore gains international support . this could also lead turkey to build refugee cities in northern syria and have influence over these autonomous regions instead of keeping refugees in turkey and let them drain our economy . this way turkey and eu would n't have refugee crisis in the first place . we accomplished absolutely nothing and could n't prevent the rise of pkk 's syrian branch ypg . not to mention we still have 3 million refugees , no influence on any syrian region and a strong ypg which will aid pkk when this is all over .",Turkic,Turkish
