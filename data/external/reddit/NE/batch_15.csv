Those cases in which the glans presents a moist , semi-oily appearance ‚Ä¶ long thickened foreskin , pliant and giving , large and often tortuous dorsal veins , go to make up a picture that is exceedingly tempting to the surgeon ‚Äô s scissors . ‚Ä¶ To obtain the best results one must cut away enough skin and mucous membrane to rather put it on a stretch when erections come later . There must be no play in the skin after the wound has thoroughly healed , but it must fit tightly over the penis , for should there be any play the patient will be found readily to resume his practice , not begrudging the time and extra energy needed to produce the orgasm .

1143z,MapPorn,"There is not much demand for passenger connections between Portugal and Spain . You can also see this if you research the flights available in the whole Iberian Peninsula national flights are the norm , especially in Spain , and the rest are Lisbon/Porto - Madrid/Barcelona mostly . A train line from Sines ( not in the map , port city in the coast at around the same latitude as Beja ) to Badajoz/Madrid is being developed , but it will be freight only . The high speed train ( green ) that would run from Lisbon to Badajoz to Madrid has been cancelled because of the crisis and really it would n't be faster nor cheaper than planes so it was going to be unsuccessful . Another couple things you have to take into account is that Spain and Portugal are both really mountainous countries so train tracks are not feasible in some cases due to the high costs and large distances between cities in the interior of the country . Another aspect is that Portugal is a really dense country , most population lives in a thin area near the coast , so most of the train and road network is built around the Lisbon - Porto axis ( Faro - Braga ) if you extend it . Since the distances are pretty short , a high speed train is not useful in this case because it could only achieve top speed for a short peroid of time in between stops , hence Portugal not having `` green '' train lines such as Spain . As for things I think realistically could be better , I 'd like to see Porto - Vigo having more express trains to shorten the travel time instead of just prolonging the regional trains to the other side of the border . Lisbon - Madrid is mostly done by plane , the service now in place got `` absorbed '' by Lisbon - Hendaye and half the train separates at Medina del Campo to Madrid , that is fine . Faro - Sevilla is not really in demand but if Spain reinstated the train tracks to the border the regional trains could just end on the other side of the border and that would be good enough , even if it 's only done in the summer . All the other possible connections would be a waste of money in my opinion .

Quebec is a unique place that speaks French . There is a history of repression of the French language in that province , and laws were enacted ensure that the French language speakers there are not discriminated against in an ever growing English dominant North American market . I see nothing wrong with it , seeing as that is what the people there speak . English-speaking enclaves should learn French so they can properly communicate with the 80 % of the population of that province that do not speak English . It freaking common sense to do so ! I really can not understand how there are generations of people who must have made it a point not to learn French living in Quebec ( according to Wikipedia it 's only 5 % ) .

Why do Anglophones just assume that everyone needs to speak English ? I 've lived across Europe , and this kind of arrogance is presence only in English-speaking populations .

222baked,canada,"I am in the process of learning French right now for work . I am going to France next year , so I need to do it . I learned some foundations in French years ago in Ontario , but it was very basic . I dropped it after Gr.9 as I did n't think I would ever need it ( 't was comme on dit `` my bad '' ) . They only teach you some very basic grammar . Simple compounded future/past and the present , but also quite a lot of vocabulary since at the end of the day we had it for a period a day for 9 years . You can essentially not die if dropped into the centre of a French town , but that 's all what it will give you . I now used Duolinguo , and bought a bunch of grammar books and just read them over and write and rewrite . I spend a couple of hours a day writing and rewriting conjugations , and words . Generally just adding on every day to my vocabulary . I have some French-speaking friends and I practice with them , but they can get somewhat snobby when I make mistakes . I also write out emails for communicating with my future employer , and have to get them corrected by people . I learn from my mistakes . I also watch a lot of French and Quebec made shows/movies . There are some good ones out there . French music is cool too . Look up lyrics and translate the words you do n't know . Try to attack it from multiple angles . Speaking , reading , writing , listening . Slowly it starts making more and more sense . Do n't be afraid to make mistakes . I say the basis is learning the grammar and structure of the language , because like this it will make more sense . Learn all the tenses and rules for conjugations , and when to use them . There are nuances . Do n't be discouraged . It 's a hard language . Especially since it 's often hard to find people willing to speak with a beginner , and do n't even get me started on that ridiculous verlan they use in France . But just chip away at it . Lay the foundations from books and build on that .

What do you consider Western Europe ? As far as I know , only the Royal College in the UK has any sort of recognition of speciality training . France too has a mutual recognition agreement with Quebec , but I do n't know if that will provide licensure in any other province , as it 's done through the CMQ and not the RCPSC . Germany , Austria , Norway , Sweden , Belgium , Netherlands , ect . get no such deal and graduates from these countries have to repeat their residency in Canada . These are n't countries with substandard medical education . I am not saying the MCCQE should n't be easy to pass for everyone writing it . That is a given . IMGs study for it because they have to get a top grade just to have a chance of landing a family medicine residency in some northern community . It 's not the case with Canadian graduates .

I do n't speak of these people , because they 're not relevant , and I do not believe them to be in such a huge proportion as to be a serious problem . The system does not need to be more restrictive . It needs to be more permissive , but smarter .

I am all for checks and competence requirements , but there should certainly be a an equivalence process for foreign-trained specialists from Western countries .

I can compare Europe that uses brick and concrete [ like this ] ( http : //www.sape-tencuieli.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/casa-pe-structura-din-beton.jpg ) nowadays . One thing is that a solid brick construction does n't allow for the same type of water drainage as a brick facade on a frame , so you have issues especially with freezing and melting where water will enter , expand , and crack porous material like modern bricks and contrete . In Scandinavia , wood framed houses are common like in Canada largely for similar reasons . Stone and brick houses are also very cold and it takes a long time for them to heat up . In southern climates like Italy , Greece and Spain you see tons of [ cool stone houses ] ( http : //www.yourhomeoncrete.com/Custom/Resources/Files/pages/Building_Styles/P1010362.JPG ) and they 're very nice and cool in the summer so you do n't need A/C .

If nobody is with me i have bug nets and tarps and lots of rope for setting something up . I carry an axe , a little shovel , cookwear , and some bush tools ( awl , a couple knives , little saw , ect ) . Food adds up if you 're going for long periods of time . The pack obviously gets much lighter as time goes on . I know you can buy ultralight equipment , but its usually way more expensive , and it 's not as durable . Even my med kit is fairly hefty , but I 've come across situations where I 've needed all of that . Fishing gear sometimes comes with me , albeit only a handfull of lures . Very rarely firearms .

I have often speculated that Marijuana would help Parkinsonism , but from what small amount of research exists , and I have read , it only helps decrease to a minimal extent the tremors , while having no effects on the long term progression of the disease .

However , just because you got hit in the head , it does n't mean there 's a lot , or even any blood , filling your cranium . Decreased conciousness , or sleepiness , is a sign that there might be blood in there , and you should n't go to sleep without going to the doctor 's and getting a picture taken of your brain to make sure you 're ok .

I do n't know the situation of the OP , but if she mentions that not one , but two boyfriends drew her attention to it , I have a feeling it was also one of those time/place things . Cussing is n't really polite in dignified society , and is a sign of being low-class . I am also not from America/Australia/UK/Ireland , where cussing is seems to be more ubiquitous . I can be downvoted for it , but I know I am right on this one . It 's a mannerism .

It 's just how men communicate with other men . The only way to break this for people is to be aware of it and try and communicate differently around women .

222baked,canada,"I can give you a clear example of low income rents staying cheap despite inflation . Look at Vancouver 's poverty stricken Downtown East-side where rentals have resisted the inflation that is paguing the city , and you can find one bedrooms in the 350-500 $ /mo range . Why ? Because it 's a shit hole that 's targeted for the low income group we 're talking about . UBI would not increase this target group 's disposable income by a significant margin , and it should n't effect the price of housing in that area . As to your second point , that is only partially true , and there 's many times when it 's downright false . Often times people who have lost all ties and are in severe poverty wont find a job . They smell , theyre dirty , and they dont have a phone . They often wo n't get hired in the first place , and one needs some basic amenities and support to be able to pull themselves out of severe poverty . It 's why it 's a called a poverty trap . Canada is also large and many smaller communities do n't have plentiful jobs . I 'm not saying there arent lazy crackheads who ca n't even hold down a job , but it 's not so black and white , and some peole really do need help .

It would help many out of the cycle of poverty . Inflation happens at a relatively steady pace anyways . UBI would have to be reevaluated occasionally just like minimum wage .

222baked,canada,"Wow , there 's some real misunderstanding of our system here . First of all , let 's understand a bit the role of your family doctor . He 's the one who is supposed to hold a complete medical history for you , and ultimately decide treatment regimens , and tailor them to your needs , even above the authority of a specialist . If you visit walk-ins , it 's very difficult for your family doctor to keep track of your medical history . You may have revealed something at a walk-in that could later on affect your future treatment . This lack of effective communication might lead to your family doctor getting a big slap of malpractice when something goes wrong in the future . He 's ultimately responsible for you . Why would he take the risk ? Another big one is the misunderstanding in how our billing system works . That he 's being billed directly for your walk-in visit . GPs receive a yearly sum of cash for having you as a patient , and will receive a service fee every time you come in . When you go to a walk-in , not only is he not receiving that fee , but he is getting billed for a service fee . Now , you might scream that he 's being money hungry , but that 's not even remotely the case . Family physicians can only take so many patients to remain effective ( some take too many , but that 's besides the point ) , and so by you going to see walk-ins more often than your GP , you are essentially occupying a spot that could be better used on someone else for whom he can treat more effectively . Also , you 're literally depriving him of revenue . Your GP does n't make that much after covering his overhead ( see : http : //www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/how-much-are-canadian-doctors-paid/article7750697/ ) . Have you ever seen a server get angry when they do n't make tip ? Now maybe you can empathize a bit . Next is this 2-3 week waiting you are all screaming bloody murder about . That 's not really how it works . Most GPs have atleast 1-2 days a week where they will see take walk-ins also , and if you come into your GPs office with a soft emergency , they will squeeze you in . You might have to wait . The 2-3 weeks is for scheduled visits , which are not supposed to be used for acute conditions . When you have strep throat , you go right away and wait for your turn . Those scheduled meetings are used when it 's something that can wait ; follow-up , adjusting treament , yearly physical , non-emergency complaints . Also prescription refills should n't be a 2-3 weeks wait . Your family physician knows when you run out of medication , and usually schedules you to come back for a refill when you run out . I once got hit in the tailbone , and it hurt so bad I could n't sit down , but it was n't a serious ER emergency , so I went in to my GPs office he took me in first , because it was a priority . Learn to use your family doctor effectively . You should n't be going to walk-ins except in very extreme circumstances . It 's actually to your own detriment in the long term , and since you 're warned about this when signing up , your doctor is in right for freeing up a spot when you are being uncompliant .",Romance,Romanian

I guess it 's important for you guys to make a fuss over things like this . Keeps the government from pushing the limits too far . The article seemed so passionate about the erosion of the French language over machine translated memos , and I did n't really get it , but guess that sort of response really shows how important bilingualism is to our country .

222baked,canada,"& gt ; why many Qu√©b√©cois do n't feel like they 're fully part of the country . I personally ca n't blame them . Well , that 's a shame . We owe much of what has become unique Canadian culture to things that stem from Quebec . From maple syrup to birch bark canoes and ice castles , the Quebecois have promoted a lot of what is iconic to Canada abroad . Maybe the language has n't taken hold in the rest of the country , but I think culturally Quebec has been more integral to Canada than any other province . If it 's any consolation , a good portion of the world is adopting English as the language of business affairs also , so it 's not just Canada .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"Fair enough . If that is how you feel , who am I to disagree ? Although , I always figured that internally the government generally speaks English in an unofficial capacity and at closed door meetings if they can . At the end of the day , government employees are just people , and probably the majority are more comfortable speaking English despite them having some sort of official capability to speak French . Not everything that comes out of their mouths will be in both languages . It 'd be odd if that was they case . Sure , they can accommodate to a French speaker , but it 's simpler and takes half the time to use a lingua franca if it 's spoken proficiently by all . Then on any written documents , French will be present because those are the rules of bilingualism . It seems reasonable to me , and does n't come off as an attempt to alienate anybody , but hey , I 'm not really a English French speaker .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"I 'm sorry you feel that way . Really . Speaking as an Anglo , I love the French language . I 'm going to wrap up my degree in Paris in the coming couple of years , and if Canada had not had its bilingualism , I never could 've done it . I 'm glad I was forced to learn French . No contempt on this part . People in the English speaking Canada who have contempt for the French language are ignorant , but hey , the world is full of ignorant people , so we ca n't worry about them . However , from what I garner these are just going to be used for short internal memos , and it wo n't be like all official documents will be published using a translator . What does it matter if a machine translates it , or a human does if the end result is the same ? Either way it 's getting done . Realistically , I doubt machines are at that level yet , but it is besides the point . We 'll never have laws published in broken French , so fear not . I wish French-speakers were not so sensitive about these language issues . Do n't misunderstand , I can see why one feels that they are losing their language , but to start yelling fire that a machine will translate some internal memos used by parliament seems rather excessive . The truth is , and read this with feelings aside , the languages are not equal . Nobody said they 're equal . French is spoken by a clear minority of the population ( 22 % according to wikipaedia ) . It 's sad that not more people speak French , but you ca n't really impose 3/4 of the population who have no clue about the French language or culture to all of a sudden speak French , and do everything in both languages . I believe any rational being can see the folly in believing it possible to achieve something like this . French has huge respect across the country . Every cereal box is in both English and French , every child has to learn 9 years of French , and all official functions are bilingual . It would be hard to find a country where a minority language has the respect French has in Canada . I am a big fan of this by the way , but it 's sad to see that my fellow French-Canadians do n't even appreciate that we 're trying .",Romance,Romanian

Most would agree that it would be a shame to lose the French language , as it , and the French-Canadian culture , is so intertwined with Canadian identity , but having an automatic translator for ease of use is n't going to destroy the French language and everything Canada stands for . French is really mostly dominant in a very isolated region and Canada is big . Very big . The vast majority speak English , and a lot of people are many thousands of kilometers from a French speaking region . Most people do n't have a clue about French . It 's just a fact . However , nobody is trying to take French away from Quebec . It 's undoubtably the language of use there . Why conjure up the 1960s over some automatic translator being used in office ?

Home growing is possible because in every country where it 's been legalized/decriminalized , growing has been made legal , and I do n't think Canada will rock the boat on this one .

France and Belgium , for example , have a very difficult time integrating people from the maghreb because they ca n't assimilate them into their culture . I also suspect that it has to do with the very rigid French cultural identity and nationalism . Canada is more inclusive with its nationalism and has had much more success with immigrants . Many immigrants feel they 're Canadian first and this is largely do to the mosaic model . For example , I 'm a proud Canadian , and secondarily I 'm an immigrant .",Romance,Romanian

Economically it makes sense as the government has control over how many slots to fund and in which feild .

222baked,canada,"So many countries have implemented successful state funded post secondary education . Hell , even the USSR had it and many Eastern European countries still have some form of it . It would solve the imbalance in our current education system . There would be stricter limits on available university spots and only the best would be selected . None of this pay to get an arts bachelour degree and work in starbucks after . Also no more $ 1000000 bonuses for administrators . Probably more professorial positions would be made available . Our universities our publicly funded but are run like a buisness . With state funded education we 'd have tighter regulation and more control over something that is essential to the growth of our country . It 'd be great . It 's not even a novel idea . Look at Germany and how successful it is over there with their constitutional right to education . The side effects are awesome . EDIT : I 've considered one aspect that might contradict my enthusiasm . Although I stand by what I said about the benefits of nationalized post secondary education , I must admit we are geopolitically disadvantaged . Consider that we 're neighbouring the US . The brain drain already is happening , but if we had free education , all the money we 'd be investing in training young adults would be wasted if they decide to hop across the border .

222baked,funny,"Ok , this is a question that has been burning in me for a better part of a decade , and since it came up in this thread about those lil rascal scooters , I might as well ask it here . I consider myself a good driver , but I like to speed a bit in the left lane . I 'm in Canada and the limit is 100 . I like to through cruise control on and go 127 . It 's a sweet spot where you 'll never get pulled over , but are still going faster than the majority . In the middle lane you get the occasional guy going 110 or an 18 wheeler passing another one going just 1km faster . So to avoid having to keep dicking around with the cruise control , and save on gas and stuff , I like to just go in the left lane . Usually it 's fine , and if someone wants to go 140 , I 'll just pull over to the right and let them pass . Now , when I have a problem doing this is when traffic is fucking heavy in the right lane and everyone is going slower then my cruising speed . I do n't wan na pull over and go down to 110 because some dude wants to go 40 over . It 's not fair to me . I 'm wasting my gas , and time to follow this odd driving etiquette that people going fast have priority . Where does that shit end ? In that case I occasionally make them wait until it 's clearer for me to pull over to the right , or if I 'm super generous that day I 'll pull over and decelerate . It depends how angry I am at life . What 's the correct thing to do in this situation ? It 's not something that really is covered in driving school . Who is the asshole here , and when does that switch ?",Romance,Romanian

The box was introduced in 1949 , nearing the end of the spike in infant mortality due to the great depression , and WW2 ( which was quite devastating on Finland ) . Also abortions became legal in 1950 , probably also reducing the number of infant mortality . These things alone can explain a reduction in infant mortality , and not the baby care package itself .

And yeah I can see how this can come off as a social program vs welfare abuse , but I just do n't really see the box as that . The baby box wo n't be a huge help to the average family . Really , a household making over 40k a year wo n't really need something like this . Sure it 's nice to get . Like getting some government check in the male when you were young . However , the costs of a child are far greater then the couple days of charity this will provide . I presume that the average Canadian family is n't the one that did n't plan on having a child or taking into consideration the cost involved . Sure , that exists , but I 'm talking most people . The net social outcome has to be weighed against the cost of things . We do n't really live in some utopia . I really believe that if this program produces so much waste that the couple hundred babies it really helps wo n't be worth the millions it could take to implement . Also , that instead of doing this we come up with a better alterEnglish that targets those few hundred babies in a more meaningful way then a couple weeks worth of diapers . We can take the money spent on this and put it to better use . So it 's really not about abuse of the social safety net . I see this as misapropriation of funds for political motive .

( 2 ) End of a very harsh time period 1938/1949 end of Great Depression/WW2 both saw spikes in infant mortality .

My point was n't to cherry pick numbers anyways . The idea was that free education CAN and DOES provide quality that is comparable to privatized education . That is why we can find different rankings that list these universities in the same category . Some say they are better , some say they are worse . It 's irrelevant because it 's hard to really say that one university is better than another and remain objective . There are differences , sure , but when it comes to top schools , you 're splitting hairs by ranking them . Like the 800 year old debate of what 's better ; Oxford or Cambridge ? & gt ; Canadian schools would be at the level of American schools if they were privatized . Where are you getting this from ? Just because you say it , does n't make it true . Education can be free , and it does n't have to compromise the quality of education received . In Europe , where state education is made available , it is actually the private schools who are regarded as the worse of the two , while state schools are generally the good schools . That 's why we can argue over if ENS Paris is better or worse than McGill/UofT . Do n't be a champion of completely privatized education when there are counter examples . I believe free education is the way to go , but only if the state has the ability and interest to properly fund it .

I thought you were talking about medical practitioners having to disclose to their patients . Even the language seemed off , but that explains it then .

They 're horrible none the less .",Romance,Romanian

222baked,canada,"& gt ; A practitioner must disclose immediately to the practitioner 's client any interest , direct or indirect , that might be construed as prejudicial in any way to the professional judgment of the practitioner in rendering service to the client . I feel like you just made this up . Physicians certainly do n't have to disclose anything of the sort to their patients . You 're obligated to put the patients needs first no matter the situation , or you have to find someone else to take over your duties . There 's no grey area on that matter , and no disclosure necessary . Physicians have a regulatory authority through the Medical Council of Canada that can easily take away your license if you 're found doing anything unethical or against the wishes/interests of your patients . So , if you do find a physician is prescribing you a superfluous drug , or refuses to change your medication to a more effective regimen due to some loyalty to a pharmaceutical company , you 're free to contact the MCC , and they most certainly will pursue this kind of professional misconduct . The issue here is that in reality , it 's not really being used in anyone 's detriment . At most , it 'll be an asprin A vs asprin B type thing . That 's why the argument is mute . I feel like this is something that might seem to be open to corruption , and that 's why people who are n't directly involved with the system have a problem with it , but in reality it is n't a problem because of the high ethical standards that come with being a physician , which really are n't abused , and if they are , there are checks in place . There is also the inherent positive of pharmaceutical companies subsidizing professional education to pitch their newer better drugs . I think you can agree that is obvious . Most physicians make sufficient income that they wo n't compromise their integrity , and risk their license for some cheap perks . It 's just a perk of the job . Nobody suffers from it . It 's why the MCC deems it an acceptable practice . I do not know what the future will hold , but I trust the system on this , because I have n't seen any real corruption because of it . It 's just hypothetical .",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"I do n't pretend to know what you do , but a lot of family practitioners are self-employed small business owners , and can do as they please . Drug reps are just pitching a product . There 's nothing really wrong with that . Dog food companies do it for pet stores . Like I 've said , with the sheer volume of new drugs coming to market , it 's quite impossible to stay up to date on every drug . It 's why you have these drug reps . They come with some study , and a quaint explanation why their product is better , and then it 's up to your physician to decide when/where to use it . Most of the time it 's marginally irrelevant , like why their 70mg of asprin is better than the previously indicated 100mg pills for CVD . Many of those drug reps are borderline medically illiterate , and no physician really takes their word at face value . There 's got ta be some trust that your physician is doing things in your best interest , otherwise why bother going to the doctor ?",Romance,Romanian
222baked,canada,"Yeah , that 's the thing . Discrimination is forbiden based on religion as per our Charter rights . It does n't mean that one religion needs to be singled out specifically . By saying non-muslims , you 're still discriminating based on religion . For example , you ca n't throw out hate speech against christians and jews , and then say that that 's not an identifiable group because the two ca n't ne combined . By the imam preaching hatred against non-muslims , he is discriminating against various different groups based on religion , and it 's still very much hate speech .",Romance,Romanian

They 're essentially the same thing , the newer one that was marketed only needs to be taken once a day ( which is good ) . You 'd prescribe them anyways , they 're quite harmless , so what if the drug rep wants to pitch their drug ? It can get unethical only if the drug is inferior in either cost/effectiveness , and the physician prescribes it , but it 's the physicians responsibility and privledge to make that call . I do n't know any physicians who actually compromise on their patients well-being and ethical duty for some gifts and free meals . People have some sort of repulsion to these things because they do n't understand them and only see the outrageous superficial nature of them . Drug company = bad , doctor = evil and corrupt . In reality a lot of physicians are n't aware of new drugs which are constantly coming on the market , and some are better , whereas some are just the same . I do n't really believe it 's a widespread problem of docs prescribing inferior medication just because a drug rep told them to .",Romance,Romanian

Also I do n't argue for communism . I came from an ex communist country and have seen first hand the damages it 's done . I argue against unfiltered capitalism which is what you suggest should be in place in something as vital as education . I think you might change your opinion later on in life . Do n't hold so strongly to your notions of free market and unfettered capitalism because it is n't a perfect system either .

More doctor , engineers , and scientists . We would also benefit by allowing university access to those in lower socioeconomic classes who may excel in a certain feild , but can not afford to do so .

Not all degrees are gender studies . In a nationalized educational system , you 'd have the government dictating the availability of degrees based on projected need .

22vin,Roadcam,"There are two types of car insurance policies in Romania : RCA and CASCO . The first one is mandatory and it is illegal to drive on public roads without one ; this type of insurance covers everything you damage when you cause an accident ( other cars , people , public property ) except your own car . CASCO is for your own car and this one is not mandatory . If the company you signed your RCA with does n't pay for some reason , the damaged party can sue to recover their money . There are some cheap crappy insurance companies here so if the driver chose the worst and cheapest there 's a chance he 'll have to pay for the pole himself .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,Roadcam,"Does n't work like that here . I explained the way car insurace policies work here in the comment above ; if you hit something , your RCA will cover the damages regardless of speeding , not yielding etc . The only way you 're not covered by insurance is if you legally were n't supposed to drive the car ( no driver 's license , DUI ) or the car is not fit for public roads ( bad condition , illegal modifications , summer tires when it 's snowing ) . So if you have 0 alcohol in your system and your car is legally fit for driving on public roads , you can cross a red light while doing 150km/h in a city and if you cause an accident your insurance will pay for it . You will answer for the traffic violations to the Police , of course .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,cars,"Location : Romania - Europe Price range 8-9000eur max , used Right , so I need to replace our other car which is a 2013 Opel Corsa 1.2 86hp . Reasons : way too slow , crappy MPGs in busy traffic , crappy build quality , crappy ride quality , crappy everything . I 'm looking at diesel hatchbacks as MPGs are quite important but I 'd like something a bit more interesting than your average 1.6 diesel Focus/Golf . A good friend is selling his Boxer Diesel Subaru Impreza . Made in 2009 , 137000km ( 85K miles ) , 2litre 150hp diesel with a 6 speed manual . Extra features : leather seats , keyless go & amp ; entry , sunroof , xenon headlights . Price : 9000eur **What I like about it** : it drives really nice , the engine is powerful enough for my needs , that sweet AWD ( which is really useful considering we have snowy winters ) , it 's not your average crappy hatchback as Subarus are not very common here and I trust him . We 're good friends for quite some time and he owns a repair shop which focuses on Subarus ( he used to own a small Subaru dealership as well ) . He bought the car from Germany last year and wants to sell it because he 's looking for something more powerful . He replaced everything that needed to be replaced in the car ( he worked on all of my cars and he always did a good and responsible job ) and told me that atm there is absolutely nothing wrong with it . It 's not the first time I 'm buying a used car so I 'm well aware that anything can go wrong with it even though it drives just fine now . **What I do n't like about it** : It 's a bit old . So it 's almost 8 years old and it 's got 137000km . If I 'd get a diesel Focus , I could get one that 's 5 years old and with less than 100.000km . Sure , the Subaru drives better and it 's definitely nicer than a Focus but would it last as much ? I 'm planning to hold on to it for 4-5 years . Driver seat is a bit worn on the left side though I understand some leather paint would fix it and the front lip is a bit damaged .

22vin,Android,"So , as I said , I 've been using Android since Eclair , I always loved it and I was never interested in the iPhone , it just seemed too limited , simple and I hated that you could n't have a homescreen with widgets on it . I also loved the devices of the time ; the Desire , Wildfire , LG P500 , SGS were awesome , solid and reliable phones . And then the fun began when I bought myself a Sensation ( in oct 2011 ) ... Had it replaced 2 times , repaired another 3 times and still had display issues and build quality issues ( volume key fell off , the letters from the back cover fell off countless times , dust underneath the screen , creaky back cover and so on ) . Performance was crappy with stock ROM ( thank God for ARHD ) and battery life was poor . But I still kept it until a mont ago when the mb died and I had enough . I decided to sell it and look for another phone . So I started searching ; I really wanted the N4 but it 's not officially available in my country yet ; One X - no more HTCs , I wanted to try something else ; SGS3 - awesome hardware and features but too big for my taste , too plasticky and not my kind of design . There was no Android phone I really liked so I decided fuck it , I 'll get an iPhone and if I do n't like it I 'll switch back when the N4 will be available here . Now , the iPhone 5 is pretty expensive here in Romania - 16GB : $ 950 off contract and $ 400 on a $ 77/month contract ; not worth it when I do n't know if I will like it , so I bought an iPhone 4 . Now here are my opinions : **The bad , and things I miss most about Android : ** - having no quick toggles for wifi , mobile data and brightness takes some time getting used to - fuck iTunes . I have 3 computers and not being able to transfer data without syncing it with every damn computer I connect it to is just stupid . The good thing is that I transfer data rarely since I do n't listen to music on it and I do n't use it for taking pictures - God , I miss smart dialing . I never used contacts or recent list for dialing , just smart dialing wich was simple and fast . It 's gone now - the pull-down status bar wants to copy Android but does a crappy job . It 's useful but in no way as useful as the one in Android ( especially because this one does n't show icons when I receive something - it just shows a banner that dissapears leaving no icon on the bar ) . - communication between apps is very limited . I think you know what I mean , you ca n't just send a photo from the album directly to Dropbox or WhatsApp nor can you open an address from the browser directly in gmaps . **The good : ** - even with a 1ghz single core processor it 's so damn smooth and responsive . I can even play GTA3 ( without some of the effects for the iPhone4 , like it was at first on Android , it 's very playable , runs exaclty like on my stock Sensation ) - I do n't usually play games on my phone but I tried this as a `` benchmark '' - everything is so polished , the attention for the small but important things is impressive - battery life is so damn good ; I do a lot of mobile data browsing and I can get through a whole day without problems . With the Sensation that was n't possible , I had to plug it in my car at least once before I got home - it 's simpler and more basic but everything just works as it should . Maybe sometimes simplicity and not changing something that works just fine is better than new but not 100 % polished things - I love the lockscreen notifications , they look nice and the slide to reply/call back/open feature is pretty cool - the apps are very good . Most of them are more polished and work better and faster than on Android - iMessage is pretty cool if you have many friends with iPhones , like I have . Of course , there is WhatsApp , but it 's just not the same thing - the speaker is loud and clear , I can easily hear it ring and hear the alarm in the morning . Now the conclusion : am I sorry for buying an iPhone ? No , definitely not . This is just what I need right now : a reliable , smooth and simple smartphone with good battery life . There is nothing I did on Android that I ca n't do on the iPhone . I use my smartphone for calling ( minimum 1h a day ) , chatting , internet browsing ( 90 % are mobile sites ) , mail , reddit ( Alien Blue is good ; not as good as Reddit News or Reddit Sync but not bad either ) . I thought the smaller screen will bother me but it does n't since I rarely watch videos on it and do n't usually browse desktop sites ; the best thing about it is that I can easily use it with one hand - this is the main reason I do n't like displays bigger than 4.3 '' . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm still an Android fan , I still want Android to succeed more than I want Apple to but the iPhone is just better for what I want from a smartphone now . And since I miss Android I 've decided I want a Nexus 10 but as usual , it 's not available here right now . And who knows , maybe when I 'll get a chance to use a N4 I 'll switch right back .",Romance,Romanian

We usually say that snow tyres are n't efficient anymore once the tread is less than 5mm and they 're more than 5 years old .

I would recommend the Nokian WR A4 's . I 've got them on the Volvo and they 're great . Just remember : old and/or worn out snow tyres are almost as crappy as summer tyres .

Windscreen defogging never really worked so you had to have a cloth in your car for those cold or rainy days . - there was a strong smell of petrol in the back of the car - engine overheating was part of the driving experience during summer . - everybody carried a toolbox in the boot and everybody knew how to fix one ( or else you were fucked ) - replacing the exhaust was a routine maintenance job - there was no such thing as a fully functional Dacia .

There 's also a [ Stepway ] ( http : //www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/uploads/f2/news/img/201664_102441.jpg ) model . The old one is your average barebones low cost car , equipped only with the stuff you need and nothing more , like ABS , A/C , CD player , power windows . The new one gets a few nicer extras , like leather seats , auto climate control , 7 '' touchscreen nav & amp ; media center , auto gearbox ( they even offer a dual clutch gearbox on the Duster ) , LED DRLs . Photos [ 1 ] ( http : //static.automarket.ro/img/auto_resized/db/article/066/843/967177l-610x390-b-0c61b42f.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( http : //trimtechnik.net/assets/images/content/138/dacia_sandero_stepway_black_004__1000.jpg ) . A base Sandero costs ( in Romania ) 7000eur and a fully loaded diesel model about 13000eur . I would n't spend 13000eur on a Sandero though . How the car feels : - the old one ( as seen on Top Gear ) is not great at all . Yeah it 's cheap but it 's for people who want a cheap car that 'll take them from point A to point B without too much hassle . It 's kind of noisy , seats are not very comfortable , the interior materials are cheap , handling is n't great ( not dangerous by any means but if you enjoy driving , this is not the car for you ) . Engines were n't the newest versions , there was a 1.4l 75hp and a 1.6l 90hp , both petrol and a 1.5 diesel 85hp . You wan na get the diesel as it has great fuel economy ( diesel Dacias are amazing at fuel economy ) , it 's reliable and since it 's a diesel , it has a bit of torque so the car does n't feel slow . The 1.4 and 1.6 petrol versions are obsolete , they were phased out a few years ago but they were reliable engines ; fuel economy wasnt't great though . - the new one is much more improved . Feels less like a low cost car and more like your average european small , affordable hatchback . It handles better , it has better noise insulation , seats are better and the ride has generally improved . It 's still not a driver 's car by any means but it should be more than acceptable by anyone 's standards . It 's great for people who want a cheap small car and they want to buy it new , there are n't many cars that can compete with it considering the price and what you get for that price . Engines : the petrol options are now a 1.2 75hp NA and a 0.9turbo 90hp ; if you want a diesel , you 've got the same good 1.5dci 90hp . Fuel economy is really good , they also have an Eco button that reduces power and fuel consumption , a very good option for city driving . The advertised fuel economy for the diesel is 65 US mpg and it is honestly very capable of doing that if you 're careful with the throttle . Again , I recommend the diesel option unless you do n't plan on driving much ; if you only plan on doing much less than 10k miles per year , the 0.9 turbo would be a better option . It 's a tiny engine but the turbo makes it feel much more powerful and taxes and isurance will be cheap as it 's & lt ; 1litre . So yeah , the Sandero . It 's not a bad car at all , they may be low cost cars but as they 're made in the EU , they 're safe and quite reliable . Their target customer is not the car enthusiast but the person who wants a cheap new car that takes them from A to B hassle-free ; and the Dacias are , honestly , great at doing exactly that .",Romance,Romanian

Why am I saying all this ? Because when you first learn how to drive a manual , you 'll know how to properly drive the one you learned on .

22vin,Romania,You should n't experience any trouble . The road to Poenari is usually open all the time as there are many villages in the area and it is also the only access road to the Vidraru dam . Climbing to the actual fortress might be a bit tricky if there 's a lot of snow but as the altitude is not very high ( the fortress is 850m above sea level according to google ) there might not be any snow at all . The drive from Bucharest should not take more than 2h-2h30min depending on weather conditions and the roads are good . Keep in mind that you 'll have to pay extra for winter tyres when you rent the car . Winter tyres are mandatory in Romania when it snows and all rental cars are equipped with them but for some reason rental companies like to charge you extra for that even though they wo n't even hand it to you without winter tyres installed . I would also suggest getting the extra windscreen protection because there might be a lot of small pebbles on the roads due to the sand-salt anti icing mixtures they sometimes use for the road surface .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,Romania,"There 's no need to get chains unless you wan na go further up in the mountains .

You can ask for it at the rental location , before signing your contract . Now , regarding rental companies : I 've used Hertz , Avis , Enterprise and Sixt in Romania .

It will help the old oil drain faster and remove deposits and residues . It costs ~15 $ in my country so it 's cheap and definitely worth it . - after you drain the oil screw the drain cap back and start the engine and let it run 2-3 secs ( do this 2 times ) . I know this may sound stupid but the engine will be just fine ; this helps drain more of the used oil , you will see that after you unscrew the cap again more oil will drain from the engine even if it stopped previously .

Edit : you can see her indicating the street on the left , probably telling him she wanted to back the car because she missed that turn and you do n't see them arguing .

22vin,todayilearned,"Yeah , it was a great phone but only if you never used it as an actual phone .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Haha yes , you are most correct . Bucharest is a jungle . A most colored jungle . There are poor and average people who are robots , always stressed and every day is just work , groceries and home . They live in apartment blocks and always fight for parking places ( btw , parking in Buc is a nightmare ) . And there are the other ones , rich and spoiled , driving luxury SUVs , occupying two parking spaces with them , always drinking coffees at ridiculously expensive cafes in overrated places , causing traffic incidents and fights and showing off with their money every time they can . And last but not least , the gipsies , who are one of our biggest problem . They 're uneducated , they beg for money or try to scam you . Fact : although it may not seem , but Bucharest is one of the safest European capital cities . You 'll get trouble only if you 're looking for it ( e.g . gipsy neighbourhoods ) . Bucurestenii ( romanian term for Buc inhabitans ) are exactly like locusts during holidays . They invade the seaside during the summer and the mountains during every other season . They are acting exactly like they escaped from a huge prison . Yes , some of the people in the country are different , living happier and more peaceful lives . But that depens on the are you 're in . There are richer areas and poorer areas . So , the answer to your question : your life would have been much , MUCH more different . But probably in a bad way . It 's hard to make a career here . The country is full of economists , bankers , businessmen etc . It 's hard to study business and find a job after you graduate , the market is simply full .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Hmm , Bucharest is big but there are n't too many stuff to see . Don ; t miss the Palace of Parliament , it 's the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon . It 's simply HUGE . The Transfagarasan is an excellent idea , Balea Lake is gorgeous , but also google Transalpina . Some say it 's more beautiful than the Transfagarasan and I kind of aggree with them . Our mountains are really beautiful . If you have time , go in small mountain expeditions ( but only on marked tracks ) , you wo n't regret it . There are a lot of beautiful places to visit in Romania , but most of them are far away , and our lack of a nice , big , motorway network means you 'll lose a lot of time on the road . The Moldavian monasteries are something you should see if you have the time , the Maramures area has some wonderful landscapes . Btw , when you 're going towards Transfagarasan , you 'll probably pass through Pitesti , my hometown . It 's a smallish 200.000 inhabitants city , there 's nothing to visit but it 's pretty clean and it has a pretty nice city center . You can take a 1 hour detour to eat something or drink a beer there if you like . On the other end of Transfagaras there is the city of Sibiu . A lovely city which is worth a few hours stop . Also , Sighisoara is not too far away . It 's a small medieval city , a must see if you have the occasion . Something you should know about RO : prepare for bad roads . Some are good but some are full of potholes . The first part of Transfagarasan was kind of full of potholes 2-3 years ago but they probably fixed it by now . And be on the lookout for scammers . Foreign people are often scammed ( not robbed , not aggressed , simply scammed ) by gipsies . Do n't accept anything they offer . Some of them look and sound so legit you simply ca n't beleive you 're being scammed . There is no such thing as a good business on the street or in a small shop here . If you want to do some shopping , do n't buy amazingly cheap designer clothes , they 're always fake . Prices for clothes , perfumes , electronics are the same as in Germany , France , Britain and every other European countries .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Well , the most common stuff Romanians eat for breakfast are : fried eggs with bacon , sausages , omlette , cheese , tomatoes , cucumbers etc . Usually a plate with mixes of these and some tea . I ca n't eat stuff like these in the morning , I eat cereals . I fucking love cereals ! : ) ) I 'll definitely put them back together , but most likely only for design .

22vin,IAmA,"Funds . Funds for school equipment , funds for everything else . And motivation . More and more students are unmotivated so more and more professors are less willing to teach us the way they should . Hope I got your question right , if not tell me : ) No , the pay conditions have n't really improved and I do n't think they will , not in the near future . If you 're a good doctor and if you choose a good specialty you will have enough money . But if you 're a doctor stuck in a small city who does n't rise from the rest then you 'll end up being poor . The base salary for a M.D . is around 600eur/month . Way to small . But of course , it goes up when you add on-call duties and other additions . Some 40 yo doctors earn less than 1000eur/months , others make over 10.000/months . As I said , it depends a lot on your specialty and notoriety .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Sadly , it 's true . Political corruption is sky-high . It affects our lives a lot . An example : we 're a member of the EU . That gives us access to a lot of special european funds which we can get if we come with viable projects ( infrastructure plans for example ) . But our politicians prefer not to access those funds because they are strictly monitored and they ca n't get some for themselves . So they use our money for stuff we can easily do with european money . But how do they use them ? This is how : they spend , on paper , 6 fucking million euros on a km of motorway . In a similar European country , a km of motorway costs 4 times less . And they 're buiding them 100 times slower than they should . They make huge contracts with companies owned by their relatives/friends , contracts which cost a lot more than they should . So , political corruption here means stealing peoples money . You can imagine how badly it affects us all .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Hai noroc ! : ) As I said in my first post , there are doctors who ask for money and doctors who do n't . Actually , everything seems worse than it is because the mass-media makes it so . It depends a lot on what doctors you meet . Do n't come back dude , do n't come back : ) ) It will take a lot of time for this country to be on par with other European countries . Most probably not in our lifetimes . Hell , I would love to work as a doctor in the U.S . Although I find it hard to leave my country , if I wo n't be paid or treated as I should be , I 'll leave . Romania needs a total political class change . There is no politican capable of correctly running this country atm .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,IAmA,"Well , Igor rarely : ) ) But I 'm tired of Dracula comments : ) ) As you know , Dracula is Bram Stoker 's creation ; in Romanian culture the stories ar kind of different . Vlad Tepes ( the son of Vlad Dracul , the one who inspired Stoker ) is ( was ) , in my opinion , a much scarier person . As you know , he impaled thieves and murderers and he enjoyed serving his lunch among his `` victims '' . They were actually impaled alive : the stake was inserted through their anus and pushed through their body in a way so it wo n't touch any vital organs , leaving them like that , to die slowly and painfully of thirst and hunger but with a stake inserted in their body .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,IAmA,"There is much to explain . Russia is `` delicate '' to deal with . The second language spoken in Moldova is russian , a part of their citizens are pro-Russia and Russia itself has its strategies , plans , which involve certain countries , territories . There is actually a `` country '' within Moldova , called Transnistria . It 's a small separatist region which proclaimed independency from Moldova and stated they are pro-Russia . They 're not recognised by other countries , but they have borders , their own currency and such . As I said , it 's a huge and controversial subject . People here are mostly pro-EU . But there are some communist nostalgics ( mostly old people ) who are pro-Russia . Pro-America : I ca n't really say .

22vin,IAmA,"Everything is learned in Romanian . There is an English module for foreign students and we learn English medical terms in the first two years . We learn anatomy from books and dissected cadavres . We 're not allowed to dissect ourselves as cadavers are expensive and not that easy to find . To get admitted in the medical school you have to take the school 's own exam . That depends on the school you want to go to . Then we have school exams and when we finish a license exam . After that you have to take the residency exam in order to practice a certain specialty . After that you take the specialty exam and then the last one is the `` primariat '' exam , the one that makes you a full-licensed doctor . This usually happens in your mid 30s . Well , at first we were 800 divided into 8 `` serii '' of 100 people each . One `` serie '' was divided into 10 groups of 10 people each . From the beginning of the 4th year , we are , of course , less and we are divided into 14 `` serii '' ( i guess ) , each `` serie '' is divided into 8 groups of 5-6-7-8-9 students ( depends how many are in a `` serie '' ) . Most of my classmates are , well , as you say `` nerds '' : ) . Some of them are good friends and fun people , other are obsessed with school and competition . Yes , six years , and as I said before , there is a residency after this which is usually a 5 year one ( depends on the specialty you choose )",Romance,Romanian
22vin,IAmA,"Haha , yes , Romanian is 80 % latin , with some slavonic influences . We easily understand other latin languages ( those of us who are n't dumb of course : ) ) ) but we ca n't speak fluently ( conversation level ) if we do n't study them . Most of our english teachers are awesome and most of the young romanians can conversate in english . I was good at english , I have a Cambridge Advanced Degree which I took when I was 16 but sadly I 'm waaay too rusty nowadays , I forgot the grammar because I have n't practiced anymore .

22vin,IAmA,"Well , dental practice is private practice so you have to pay for it if you do n't have a special insurance . Eye doctors are also mostly private . Gyno : depends if you went to a private practice or a hospital . Hospitals are free for insured people ( most of the citizens have state insurance ) . So : hospital visits are free and private system visits cost . If you have a nice private insurance , it covers private hospital/practice visits , but if not you have to pay .",Romance,Romanian

There are also professors who will make your life a living hell if you try to bribe them . There are just a few students who `` arrange '' their exams but they are n't able to graduate a year only by doing that ; in every year there 's at least one professor who wo n't accept money . Even if you manage to graduate medical school by bribery , you have to take the residency exam in order to become a doctor . Now , I heard about people who wanted to pay big cash for the questions in the residency exam and it was impossible . The doctors who make the questions are virtually locked down ( with strong security ) in a remote place for ~ a week in order to create the questions without anybody finding out . A lot of Romanian doctors are amazingly well trained but , sadly , not all the hospitals are well equipped so they can practice their job at their highest standard .

22vin,aviation,"The Concorde was retired because it was very expensive to mantain , fly and Airbus stopped making parts for it . Safety was not the reason , the costs and maintenance issues were .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,aviation,The Concorde was manufactured by BAC and Sud Avitation . BAC became BAE and Sud Aviation became Aerospatiale . They both joined the consortium called Airbus Industries .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,aviation,BAE operates as BAE Systems and focuses on military equipment .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,pics,"And here we are , in Romania , trying to get rid of more than 100k stray dogs that bite more than 10k people a year and we ca n't because NGOs keep protesting and stopping the process . People have been killed by stray dogs ( yes , killed by dogs in 2014 in an EU country ) and we just let them be .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,pics,"Yes , they say stray dogs should n't be put down , they should be kept in dog shelters or adopted instead . The problem is it 's way too expensive to build shelter and feed all these dogs and impossible to find people to adopt them all . Fun thing : last year when a four-year old was bitten to death by strays while he was playing in a park in Bucharest , many of these `` animal-lovers '' defended the dogs and said that the child probably provoked them . And this is just one of the many stories about dog attacks and moron NGOs . Almost forgot : some NGO members adopt dogs to get them out of the shelters and release them back on the streets .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,Borderporn,"I crossed the border between RO and SRB a few times on Portile de Fier ( near Dr Tr Severin ) . I easily exchanged from lei to dinar in the nearest Serbian town ( Kladovo ) . Also , although Serbia is not an EU member , crossing the border was very easy : no need for a passport , just the ID cards and absolutely no vehicle search . It was almost as fast and easy as crossing from RO tu HU .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,Borderporn,"Well , most banks here tend to refuse other currencies other than EUR , USD , GBP , CHF , AUD , CAD , HUF , SE/NO/DK Kr and a few others . A lot of small banks only have the first four cureencies for exchange . That 's because other currencies are not common here and it 's too much of a hassle for the bank to sell them . I assume this is also the case for Serbia , not enough Romanian tourists or Serbs who work in Romania in order for the exchange to be profitable . But usually you should be able to echange from lei to dinar in the towns near the border since people who live there cross the border quite often and viceversa . Oh and regarding our relationship with our serb neighbours , we have always considered them friendly and good neighbours .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,htc,"My friend 's One Mini 's plastic frame is also full of cracks . Never dropped , kept in a case . It 's sad because even though it 's a midrange phone it 's not a cheap one . Build quality was the reason I gave up HTC , the Sensation was the crappiest built smartphone I 've owned . But I 'm happy to see that the new M8 is top quality . Got a chance to try one a few days ago and honestly it 's probably the best quality piece of hardware I 've held in my hand lately . Made my plastic S4 feel worse than a toy , now I regret choosing a plastic phone . Too bad I have one year left on my contract and I 'm too broke to afford one free of contract .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,iphone,"Samsung has upped its game . Here in Bucharest , for example , there is a Samsung Customer Service Plaza where they will take care of any problem you have with your device in under one hour . For example , I had a small stain on the oleophobic coating on my S4 and they changed the display on the spot , no questions asked . They also changed the display on my LED TV in 20 minutes ( dead pixels ) . What I 'm trying to say is that competition is high , big brands are beginning to understand that customer service is extremely important .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,iphone,"In the EU also & gt ; Whether you bought the goods in a shop or online , under EU rules you always have the right to a minimum two-year guarantee period at no cost . I never understood why there is only a one year guarantee period in the US . I mean , you buy a premium $ 600 phone and the manufacturer guarantees that it will work fine just for one year ? Two years is perfectly reasonable , you hold on to your device for the 24 month carrier contract you signed and it is covered by warranty in that period ; if it breaks after 24 months , it 's easy to buy another phone with another contract .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,iphone,"That 's false , we also pay less for phones bought with a contract ( for example , Vodafone RO lowest 5S price is 150eur but you can get it for free if you are an existing customer and have loyalty points ) . The phone is still a 650eur phone , you can get it cheaper because the carrier subsidizes it at first but recovers the money from your monthly charges .",Romance,Romanian

22vin,Roadcam,"Normally , roundabaouts are esentially round multi-lane roads . Think of a stretch of motorway : two lanes , two exits to the right ; now take that stretch of motorway and turn it into a circle . You can take the next exit if you are travelling on the left hand lane only if you change lanes before the exit and yield to the first lane ; however , you are free to drive on the first ( right ) lane for as long as you wish without taking an exit . So , if you are in a roundabout , you can keep driving in a circle , in your lane , for as long as you want . You 're not obligated to exit the roundabout , you can drive inside it until you run out of fuel . Probably some countries have different rules but esentially this is how a roundabout works ; it 's just a 360-curbed road .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,gaming,It 's not like you 're going to pay $ 6 just for DayZ . You 're also getting the $ 30 games you need in order to install DayZ .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,Roadcam,"I know what ESP was developed for but ESP works best at normal driving speeds . The moose test , for example , is done at ~80km/h . Nobody can guarantee that a regular 20k eur car can successfully swerve at 160km/h because they are n't designed for that , they 're meant to be driven by normal people within speed limits . In conclusion , ESP is meant to save your ass when you 're doing 90-100km/h in a Golf , on a normal road , and you swerve to avoid an obstacle that just appeared in front of you . There is no way the manufaturer can guarantee that you 'll be fine if drive that Golf at 160km/h on a shitty road with bad asphalt , potholes and dirt . That car is not meant to do that .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,AdviceAnimals,"Actually jaundice can have various causes , other than hepatic failure ( ex . an obstruction in the common bile duct ) . Jaundice appears when the liver ca n't clear the bilirubin into the bile wich means the bilirubin and other toxic waste pass into the blood then into the skin which causes itching . I asked about the yellow coloring because he said his father was itching and this is usually consistent with jaundice . It 's a bit hard for me to explain in English",Romance,Romanian
22vin,Justrolledintotheshop,I remember when I bought my last car and picked it up at the dealership ; the fuel indicator was as low as it can go and the BC was showing 0km left . I was lucky there was a gas station 500m away . Oh and I 've never driven a test drive car with the fuel light off .,Romance,Romanian
22vin,iphone,"This is also my problem . I got bored . I understand that some people are not interested in deep customization and do n't get bored quickly and I thought if the UI was polished and smooth I would n't want to change anything either . But I kinda miss having a lot of customization options without even rooting . iOS works great and I ca n't say I experienced issues but I just miss some things I found in android . I 'll probably switch back to an android phone but I 'll keep my iPad 4 because for now I ca n't find another tablet with this form factor ( I hate 16:9 tablets ) , battery life and build quality .",Romance,Romanian
22vin,Roadcam,"Well , actually this is a motorsport event . The road is closed and the driver is allowed to drive as fast/risky as he can . So the people who organized the event are at fault . They should n't let the spectators stay this close to the road . In a motorsport event everything is possible , even with the best drivers - anything can go wrong with the cars , they are tuned for speed and not reliability and they are driven to the limit .",Romance,Romanian

I love Lumia designs and their build quality is great but I simply ca n't use WP . I like both Android and iOS but there 's not one thing I like about WP8 .",Romance,Romanian
