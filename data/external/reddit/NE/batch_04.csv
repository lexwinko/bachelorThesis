2ntle,Darts,"I 'll try to give you some answers , other redditors will surely chip in to fill the gaps I leave : 1 . My favorite practicing game is Split score . It 's somewhat easier to play on soft tip boards since they automatically count score , but it 's not any more difficult to count as any other game on a steel tip board . Here 's how it goes : Each player starts with 40 points . Each round you shoot a different number , in order : 13 , 14 , 15 , any double , 15 , 16 , 17 , any triple , 18 , 19 , 20 , bull ( 25 and 50 both count ) . Only darts in the designated number count , e.g . in second round if you hit two darts in 14 and one in 11 you only get 28 points . The twist is if you miss all three darts your overall score is halved ( you round up for odd numbers ) . The game is fun and can be pretty even matched even if the players are n't on a similar playing level since halving your score makes it easier for a weaker player to catch up to you . Also , you practice cricket numbers ( which is good since you 're playing in a cricket league ) plus doubles and triples . Other popular games are Around the world , Shanghai , etc . which other redditors can give you more info on . 2 . General consensus is that you should stick with whatever works for you . That , however , does n't mean there are n't any steps to improve your game . Check out /r/flightschool ( althought it 's a bit dead ) or google Flight School and join up . Its creator George Silberzahn provides some great tips and practicing routines . Other , more general advice is the usual - keep your body steady and move only your arm , follow through , focus on your target , etc . 3 . Yeah , substantial pointing in cricket is considered poor sportsmanship . Now , what 's the threshold ? Well , that 's kinda subjective and different people may give you different opinions on it .

2ntle,travel,"Maybe I 'm a bit biased ( being a English and all ) but Croatia could hit all of the points on your backpacking checklist . It 's definitely cheaper than all the other countries you 're considering . There a direct cheap flights from London to several touristy locations here . There are plenty of hostels and backpackers , do a bit of google-fu about 'Croatia backpacking ' to find other people 's experiences and advice . We have a lot of Aussie backpackers here so you 'll have no problem meeting new people ( Aussies being outgoing and English speaking as they are ) , esp . in hostels . We have great seafood here but a variety of other kind as well . Not what you would exactly call 'ethnic ' , but seeing how Croatia was under the influence ( lol ) of various nations through the ages , that has reflected in the cuisine as well . So you 'll find a mix of Italian , Slavic , and Turkish , with more German and Hungarian if you wander to the northern parts of the country . The same applies to the other aspects of the culture and architecture . Croatia had a turbulent history since well before it even became a country so there are plenty of sights to see , museums to visit etc . Nightlife is great in the more touristy cities while outdoorsy and off-the-beaten-path stuff is found a bit off the major tourist hot spots ( as one would expect ) . As far as safety goes , Croatia is basically as safe as it gets in Europe . With minuscule violent crime rates the only thing one should keep an eye out for ( esp . during the tourist season ) is an occasional pickpocket . For example , two girls going back to a hostel in the wee hours really do n't have anything to worry about .

2ntle,Darts,"As I see it , the main allure of tungsten darts is that they 're heavier so you can have a smaller ( thinner ) dart which helps with grouping while keeping the weight the same . They 're also much tougher ( my last set came with a lifetime guarantee ) . Sometimes it 's tough to get used to to thinner darts , as thicker brass and bronze ones provide a better grip ( at least for me ) . So , if you 're happy with your bronze set and do n't feel any significant advantage in tungsten ( give 'em a try ) then stick with bronze at least for now . But as you get better and your grouping tighter , you 'll notice that your bulky darts sometimes get in the way of putting the third one in the bed .

2ntle,explainlikeimfive,"It 's going to be difficult to ELI5 such a complex question , especially without starting flame wars in comments like they always happen when such subject is brought up , but I 'll give it a shot . I 'm going to skip a lot of history here , because I think that 'ancient hatred ' argument is silly and not valid . Croats and Serbs were neighbors for a long time , and despite being in different empires/kingdoms their culture and language was very similar . The main thing that divided them was religion . Due to historical circumstances Croats are Roman Catholic and Serbs are Orthodox . When national movements started sweeping Europe in 19th century , religion was a major part of national identity . That , among other things , was basis in differentiating yourself from other nations . Seeing how Croats and Serbs were similar , religion played a major part in building their respective national identities . By the end of WWI , it was becoming obvious that Austro-Hungarian Empire was going to collapse . Croats , being under foreign rule since 1102 wanted to score a better deal . Realizing that they 're too small to be on their own ( since the bigger surrounding nations could chop them up ) decided to enter a union with Serbs and Slovenes , thinking that they 'll finally be equals between their similar ( 'brotherly ' ) Slavic neighbors . However , that Union soon turned into a monarchy with a Serbian king . Power struggles began and Croats found themselves once again oppressed by a bigger nation . This is the real beginning of the 'conflict ' between Croats and Serbs that will define their history later on . WWII came , Nazis rolled in , broke up the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and installed 'independent ' ( puppet ) states Croatia and Serbia . In Croatia , the power went to the Ustaše , a radical fascist party similar to Nazis . They set up labor and concentration camps and prosecuted and killed thousands of Serbs , Jews , Gypsies and uncooperative Croats . The hatred between the nations grew . In the meantime , opposing forces were Chetiniks , ruthless Serbian militia loyal to the King trying to create Greater Serbia ( often slaughtering civilians which , of course , created even a bigger wedge between the nations ) and coumminst Partisans , composed of all nationalities from the area . The anti-fascist Partisans eventually won and a communist federation Yugoslavia was formed . Charismatic leader Tito did his best to keep nationalistic tensions in check . And they were for 40 or so years . Now , to explain why Croatia decided to break from Yugoslavia in early 90s would take too long , but lets just say it was a mix of economical , political and nationalistic reasons . Serbia tried to forcefully keep them from leaving because , to put it simply , they were the dominating force in Yugoslavia at the time and Croatia was one of the most economically advanced states . When Croatia declared independence , a lot of Serbs living in Croatia were afraid that the genocide from WWII was going to repeat and rebelled . So Croatia found itself fighting Serbian insurgents and the official Yugoslav Army . Cue some more nationalistic tensions . There were war crimes on all sides which , again , just fueled the hatred further . Nowadays , you 'll find people in both countries with various opinions . Some keep deep hatred . Some just resentment . Others do n't really care .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

EE started to 'get in touch ' with different races basically since the fall of the iron curtain . 23 years ago . So this part of the world is on a tolerance crash course of sorts . It will take time . Look how long it took for the US and WE and there 's still room for improvement there . Also , it does n't help that EE is extremely racially homogeneous and thus has exposure to other races mostly via tourism . It 's easier to overcome racism if you have people of other races living in your community , sharing the same problems , living similar lives right in front of you . Majority of people in EE live in non-touristy areas and probably wo n't see someone of a different race in person their whole lives . That 's not helpful .

Now , as for how one got citizenship of another FR after moving there , I 'm really not sure , but my best bet is by having permanent residence there . Although , most people would n't bother , since your FR citizenship was n't much of an issue so the majority would stick with their original one issued to them by place of birth . That , of course , does n't mean that all of the ethnicities were born in ( and thus had the citizenship of ) their ethnically respective FRs ( Serbs in FR Serbia , Croats in FR Croatia , etc. ) . As you can see [ here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/hjXdk8o.jpg ) , there were areas were a lot of people lived in a non-'English ' FR ( notably middle of Southern Croatia and Bosnia ) which were consequently the areas mostly affected by war ( with Eastern Croatia being an exception since that was a main corridor of Serbian invasion , but that 's besides the point ) . Long story short : FR citizenship was issued by the place of birth regardless of ethnicity ; mobility between FRs was perfectly normal ( and sometimes encouraged ) ; people would usually stick with their FR citizenship after moving since it made no difference .

They do n't see Croatia and everything about it as it is today ( which is admittedly difficult if you do n't live here ) but as it was when they left . So , for instance , people that emigrated during the Yugoslavia were either yugo-nostalgic or , if they were more on the nationalistic side , were still ranting on about Yugoslavian secret service , Croatian struggle and so on . The people that emigrated because of the war in the 90s were almost all pretty far right nationalists , identifying with the Ustasha regime , blindly hating Serbs , etc . It 's like they did n't have any closure and the war is still going on in their minds ( there a lot of people like that here , mind you ) . On the other hand they said that the Australian Croats they met were all friendly ( at least towards them ) . Most of them were hard working and almost all were business owners , so I guess entrepreneurship is something that they have in common . They talked about how they teach their children to love and respect their Croatian heritage .

Mountain Rescue received an emergency call at 12:05 about a climbing accident at Anića Kuk rock in Paklenica NP . The Australian - Cech duo was heading in the direction of Kač where on the height of 70 meters the Australian climber fell , injuring himself and losing consciousness several times .

I 'm kinda sad to see all the comments here deferring you from Split , but I guess that 's the impression people got when they were here . I 'll admit , it gets hectic here during the season , mostly because , as other already said , Split is a mayor transportational hub and anyone that 's trying to go anywhere in this part of the country stops here . But the good news is that you picked the best time to visit ! Split is notoriously busy during the season , but in April/May it 's ideal as there wo n't be near as much tourists here as there would be in August . I may be a bit biased but I 'll just say not to write Split off . After all , you said you 've done your research so you did n't put it in your itinerary for no reason . As far as the ferries go , you have nothing to be concerned about . True , there are fewer departures then than during the season , but that just means there are 4-5 a day instead of 10+ , so you 'll have no problem getting to the islands and coming back on time . And about your day trip , Krka and Hvar are both worth visiting , so try to fit them in somehow in your itinerary . Makarska is more of a touristy summer vacation spot , with nothing notable to see or do aside from going to the beach and partying ( but both are only doable during the season ) . I especially like your 'stopping in random villages ' part on the way from Dubrovnik from Split . It really shows you 've done your research : D It 's often overlooked but it offers great scenery and quaint little towns just made to sit and relax .

305-1468,mechanicalpencils,"I have one in 0,7 . With it 's minimal styling it 's a very good looking pencil . One piece metal body , besides looking cool makes this pencil very robust . In fact it 's proven to be indestructible if you retract the lead sleeve . Even the cap is carved from one piece of steel ( as opposed to sheet metal forming ) , and engraved . Color is beautiful ( mine is blue ) and very durable . Makes a nice loud click . Grip on this paint is actually quite good despite not having knurled surface or whatever . I also removed the otherwise nice looking and sturdy clip , it looks better like that in my opinion . Hexagonal shape means it wo n't roll around . Disadvantages are top heaviness , and the impossibility of disassembly . Also the fact that the cone is a bit longer then on other pencils , so I sometimes find myself holding the pencil by the cone instead of the body , which is difficult and makes the pencil slip , but I tend to hold pens close to the tip so YMMW . For work or lot of writing I prefer a drafting pencil , but this one is the best for lying around on the desk when you need to write a note or whatever , and you 're not afraid if you accidentally sweep it across the room . EDIT : ( after reading comments ) The front does not move back and forth on mine . I probably have an older model since the sleeve is retractable . It does rattle a bit .

305-1468,BuyItForLife,"It really depends on what you want to measure . If you are measuring plastic parts , you need accuracy of ±0,01 to ±0,05 mm , and you can buy a caliper like [ this ] ( http : //www.insize.com/products/tools/pdf/caliper/1205.pdf ) . It 's rated ±0,03 mm ( about 1/3 width of a leaf of paper ) , but mine is actually accurate within ±0.01 mm . I use that at work and it performs great . It cost about 15 € . Used on plastic it shows the exact same value as a digital 10x more expensive Mitutoyo . It 's made of milled , engraved , thick stainless steel . It will also last longer than the Mitutoyo since it has no display or batteries . OTOH , if you have to measure high precision metal parts made with tight tolerances , you need a more precise caliper *and a micrometer* ( because calipers are not really that precise , after all , you must press on stuff using your shaky , variable hand ) , and many have recommended a lot of good calipers for that .

Only around 9 % of those deaths are related to injuries of any kind , most commonly in automotive accidents . The rest are disease related . In 2012 , for example , 68 % of worldwide deaths were caused by non-communicable disease , and 23 % by communicable disease . Both categories include large proportions of preventable cases . The most common communicable disease deaths were respiratory , HIV-related , and diarrheal , which could be reduced by vaccinations , contraceptive availability and education , and water treatment . Many noncommunicable diseases were related to tobacco and alcohol abuse , as well as poor diet . All of these could be addressed by public education and commodity taxation programs . By focusing on violent deaths , you draw attention away from effective , moderate cost ways of saving far more net lives . **EDIT : ** Evidently I should spell this out : by parroting exactly the same faulty line of logic , I thought it would become more obvious _why_ it 's a faulty line of reasoning ( `` By focusing your attention on stray animals you 're drawing attention away from homeless people ! `` , `` Why do you insist on advocating for the arts when people are starving ?

This more than anything will keep you motivated when you are using online resources - by themselves , online tools are n't enough for a lot of people . If you have a little extra money , paying a tutor for weekly lessons might help with motivation too ( partially because the financial commitment tends to be a good motivator ) , but it is n't strictly necessary .

3w4v,changemyview,"You suggest that taxpayers should not pay to alleviate the inconvenience to a party whose case , while failing the test necessary for a conviction , leaves no significant room for doubt of their guilt . It seems morally repugnant to help such a person - why should the taxpayer pay a probable criminal for their inconvenience ? However , there are a some obvious corollary cases that you do n't mention . What about a case where reasonable suspicion is established at arrest , but in trial innocence is determined beyond a reasonable doubt ? If you assert that an individual is undeserving of compensation because , although there was n't enough evidence for a conviction , it can be rationally believed that guilt is very likely , then what of the certainly innocent ? What about the probably innocent ? Why is it also acceptable to inconvenience them ? If you frame the problem not by individual cases , but statistically over many cases , could facts from this perspective sway your opinion one way or the other ? If the statistics showed that 9000 out of 10000 people acquitted were determined to be more likely innocent than not , would that be enough that you 'd be comfortable awarding them all compensation ? 9500 ? 7000 ? 2000 ? Another angle . You are given four proposals : that the state provide 1 ) no compensation in the case of reasonable suspicion at time of arrest ; 2 ) compensation equivalent the pay given jurors ; 3 ) a flat compensation per day tied to the minimum living wage that year , regardless of income ; and 4 ) a tax rebate as compensation . Would you consider only the first of these fair ? Would you suggest a fifth alterEnglish ? Yet another consideration : suppose a person is either actually innocent or actually guilty of a concrete crime . You only know how likely a person is to fall into one of these categories . Do you feel comfortable inconveniencing a person , perhaps significantly , when your certainty is n't very high because it 's cheaper to do so ? What about discrepancies in who bears the burden of accusation ? It 's easy to demonstrate that some races bear much more of the burden than others , for example , as do certain socio-economic classes . Given that the burden is significantly unevenly borne by some , is fulfilling a social contract for order really a good enough justification ?

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"I ’ d been talking with people I didn ’ t know In the park the other day , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove . The sky was solid gray , And we were talking about all the ways The world could be better . One woman said , “ It gets complicated , “ Taking value at its face . “ You ’ d think value was something obvious , ” Her hands were all over the place . She gestured left , then right , then left , And with frustration in her face , She sighed , “ The obvious “ Is the source of all confusion. ” Later that day , I was walking around By the pen where they keep the Bison And struck up with a rough looking man Built like Mike Tyson With a scar right down his neck , But a disarming grin . “ If you take all the little things that pile up around , “ Each little things weighs nothing at all , ” Like grains of sand ? “ Yeah , but take “ Every grain of sand on the beach in your hand , “ And you ’ ve got a problem. ” We shot shit for a good long while , Until that gray turned into graphite , And we said goodbye and walked away Into the almost night . I shivered . Left my coat somewhere , But damn , I couldn ’ t remember . Then I ran into this dude who smelled Like a broken sewer main . He offered his coat and asked for a buck , I said no , but all the same We got to talking , and for a while It felt like eternity went by . But before I escaped something happened , And his visage grew profound , Like his dirty hair was glowing From the inner peace he ’ d found , and then I remembered something dumb I had done Just a couple hours back , And in the darkening night , Not feeling quite right , I tried to stumble back To the place that I ’ d come from , But I couldn ’ t remember . I swear then I saw a pippala tree With a man lying down beneath , Who exuded grace and rainbows In his final dying breath , As he said , “ Every gear in this grand design “ Will fail and be replaced . “ Be the masters of your own machines , “ And find your special place. ” That ’ s the last thing I remember Before waking in my bed . Still don ’ t know how I got back here Or what else that prophet said . I know that trip was worth it , But the message isn ’ t clear . Good thing at least some images Didn ’ t disappear .

I understand your idea for the trailer , but it ended up being too unfocused for my tastes . You were probably avoiding it intentionally , but try putting some dialog scenes into the trailer anyway and then decide if you do n't like it that way . And you may already know this , but you need to change your title font to something that is n't that ( do you have a graphic designer on the project ? ) .

Now , to the strictest pedant , all the ways there are are very few , Since they would say that anything is bad if you believe that ’ s true . But if we all can just agree that mode of thought ’ s erroneous We can be less postmodern and considerably less onerous . The first flaw that I can ’ t abide is formal inconsistency , Which demonstrates no forethought , or no technical ability .

3w4v,linguistics,"Lojban is not what you imagine . The language is alien in the sense that it 's grammar is n't based on that of existing languages , but the grammar is both regular ( no exceptions ) and simple ( not many rules ) . The vocabulary is drawn from `` Mandarin , English , Russian , Hindi , Spanish , and Arabic , weighted according to the numbers of speakers , and using a phoneme-matching algorithm to assign words with the highest figures of merit relative to the six languages. '' [ [ source ] ] ( https : //mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi ) . This has the effect of making speakers of those languages , Mandarin and English especially , recognize many of the words once they get a hang of the phonetic rules . It 's also not too hard to pronounce by design . Lojban has 6 vowels and 17 consonants , picked to be distinct and allowing for some phonemic variation so people coming from different primary languages wo n't have a hard time pronouncing the words . Lojban has many interesting features that are n't very robotic . Emotion particles come to mind - simple words you can add to a sentence to let people know how you feel or how you feel about something . Another is evidential indicators , which let you concisely explain how you know something ; this lets you easily distinguish between knowing something from personal experience , vaguely remembering something , knowing something second-hand , or knowing something without evidence but with conviction .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alterEnglish , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ?

3w4v,haskell,"I 'm a little surprised no one has mentioned Go . At OSCON this year I heard about quite a few companies that were happy with Go for large projects . Praise included the relatively small language size , ease in training new hires , good community , and excellent selection of libraries . I think it would meet all of your requirements . I 'll second Rust , but it 's a new and immature language - the community is great , but libraries are n't comprehensive yet , and idioms in the language are likely to change significantly over the next few years . It also does n't have as much industry use yet . Python is another solid , pragmatic choice , and it may serve you particularly well depending on your interests . Look at popular Python libraries and see if any of them catch your eye . It also has the best language learning resources of the three , so that 's a major plus . **EDIT : ** To keep things to the point , my number one recommendation for the original poster is Python based on their interests , professional utility , and availability of learning resources . But since there was such an ambivalent reaction to Go here ( with respect to voting - the comments have been more \*ahem\* _uniform_ ) I think a few things need to be said . Firstly , all of the criticisms made here are valid _on the level at which they criticize the language_ . But the comments , in my opinion , largely miss the point on other levels . Go might be good language to learn for a person who has only been seriously programming for nine months _and_ only deeply exposed to Haskell for several reasons . It 's important to understand that the Haskell community is an echo chamber for certain - correct , according to us - points of view . As an aspiring programmer , it 's worthwhile to be exposed to communities with different points of view and different priorities , and we should put at least some trust in the ability of a student to eventually , with experience , form their own informed opinions . Another pedagogical point : our concerns as more experienced programmers are not all the same as those of someone who has only really been programming for less than a year . Comments like `` There 's nothing you would learn from Go '' lack perspective ; the familiar ideas Go contains are the best ideas from several generations of languages , and for a new learner some of those ideas are still unfamiliar . And the specification of the language is short , which is another big win for a learner .

3w4v,UkrainianConflict,"Much of your summary is accurate : the only part I 'd contest is the `` two sides '' narrative . People in Ukraine have a wide range of views , but most have an ambivalent , stability above all perspective . A pro-EU , West-leaning bent prevails in the intellectual class , while rose-tinted nostalgia for the Soviet past is more common in ethnic Russian enclaves and the economically declining Eastern regions of the country - the two sides narrative has its roots in these biases . But a highly polarized , two-sided model of popular opinion , common as it may be in media representations , does n't match this reality very well .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,skeptic,"There are a few words in in this conversation that are confusing readers . To understand why I 'd reject what you say , we need to be clear about what you 're claiming and what I reject , so let 's work from those confusing words . & amp ; nbsp ; The first confusing word is _science_ , which is confusing because it 's polysemous . _Science_ in the current context may reasonably refer to : 1 . The _scientific method_ - A set of iterative , observation-based techniques for acquiring and updating beliefs ; 2 . _Scientific practice_ - The activities scientists actually engage in to arrive at beliefs , usually ( but not always ) by application of the scientific method ; 3 . _Scientific knowledge_ - The body of beliefs generally accepted by the scientific community , usually ( but not always ) arrived at by scientific practice . Scientific knowledge _is_ a set of beliefs . But , to pin the conversation down , we seem to be talking about the scientific method . & amp ; nbsp ; The second confusion occurs between a pair of similar verbs , _to believe_ and _to believe in_ . The verbs _to believe_ and _to believe in_ are used to convey different meanings . Commonly ( unfortunately , not consistently ) : - _To believe_ refers to a truth value judgement ( _I believe the mailman 's name is Frank_ ) . - _To believe in_ may refer to a higher-order belief , that is , a belief about a belief . This `` believing in '' can get complicated and often conceals some vagueness when you think about it more carefully . ( _I believe in the power of love , _ but usually not _I believe in the mailman , Frank._ ) There are people that _believe in_ the scientific method in the same nebulous sense that people _believe in_ karma or a higher purpose or the power of love . However , it is sufficient to believe that the scientific method satisfies certain information gathering properties ( properties that , not coincidentally , are falsifiable ) for a rational person to continue using and propagating the scientific method . No `` believing in '' is necessary at this level , except insofar as it is implied by believing that the scientific method has certain well specified properties . There are beliefs that are so fundamental as to be axiomatic ( `` I exist '' , `` there exists a fundamental reality '' , `` I have some information-preserving relationship with that fundamental reality '' , `` fundamental reality has non-random structure '' ) . There is no logical basis for truth-value determination of these `` reality axioms . '' There 's no way to test them , even in principle . Arguably , metaphysical naturalists _believe in_ these axioms as well as believing them . But these beliefs are lower-level than science in any of its senses . & amp ; nbsp ; The last confusion is around the phrase _a matter of faith_ . The classification _a matter of faith_ is being used to establish an equivalence between beliefs which I do n't think is justified , or perhaps is too vaguely specified . Stepping back to low-level beliefs , I 'd argue that accepting the reality axioms is n't a matter of faith - at least , not in the same sense that accepting divine revelation is a matter of faith ( I assume belief in divine revelation is a belief that mental forces , not reducible to natural forces and elementary particles , exist and do communicate with people to inform their beliefs about reality , and that this information is reliable in some sense ) . When I accept the reality axioms , there are different processes going on than what go on when I accept divine revelation . Defining _a matter of faith_ to include both not only stretches common usage , it also leaves a big bag of interesting processes that contribute to the acceptance of esoteric and religious beliefs either undescribed , or implies those processes are happening where they are n't . And that brings us back to the scientific method : the information-gathering efficacy of the scientific method is a consequence of these more fundamental reality axioms holding . So it 's not a matter of faith either , or even a consequence of faith . It follows from the derivability of the scientific method from the reality axioms that coherent rejections of the scientific method necessarily either involve rejecting some of those reality axioms , which can get weird , or adding new axioms , which is problematic for a slew of reasons . I 'm glossing over these arguments , but I think you get the picture . & amp ; nbsp ; I have n't presented a full argument , but I think this makes it clear what an argument against classifying the trustworthiness of the scientific method and the trustworthiness of divine revelation as both being matters of faith looks like . Ultimately , the conditions under which they both are matters of faith requires making `` faith '' mean something other than what `` faith '' is generally understood to mean or usefully defined as . There is something going on in accepting the axioms of reality , but it needs to be described separately . It is n't the same class of phenomenon .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,nonmonogamy,"Just warning you that I have analytical tendencies . That said , here 's how I would approach your issue if it were me : **TL ; DR** You should n't feel bad because you are asking for help with a problem . That 's normal and fine and okay ! Keeping your problem , your desired outcome , and proposed solution separate in your discussion will probably make things clearer to you . By involving your partner in the discussion , you 'll feel less guilt because you wo n't be prescribing a course of action but collaborating on the health of you and your relationship . Describe your problem and desired outcome first , and let your partner suggest a solution before you suggest yours in order to get a less pre-filtered opinion and gauge his feelings . Decide what to do after that . But definitely do n't feel guilty for asking him to participate . **Long Version** You have a problem , a causal hypothesis , and a proposed solution . You also have an implied desired outcome . The thing you seem to feel guilty about is the solution part . Some or all of this analysis may seem obvious . If so , great . & gt ; I 've been really struggling with my fear and anxiety about being left behind or abandoned [ ... ] Your problem is that you are experiencing abandonment anxiety , or , to be specific , the symptoms you are bundling under this label . This is the first thing you should discuss with your partner and his wife , if you have n't already . You also have a desired outcome , which you stated as `` build [ ing ] our foundation stronger '' , but that 's more of a solution . Your real desired outcome is to experience less anxiety . & gt ; [ ... ] which is connected to an anxiety problem and a recent dip in mental health . You attribute that anxiety to two factors . The first is a change in your underlying mental health , which implies that you have experienced/are experiencing other symptoms that suggest this is the case . Your intuition about this is probably right . I 'm assuming that you are taking steps to work on this issue on your own . The second is a change in the relationship dynamic . It 's a safe bet that your abandonment issues are linked to this . However , it may be worth exploring exactly what changes have happened - is it just that he 's dating , or have other habits changed as well ? You also believe this change is a problem _because of_ the first issue . Although this seems like a reasonable assumption , it 's not the only possibility . How true this is may influence how effective a given solution is for you . In any case , you should always be sceptical of your assumptions about hidden causes , and focus more on observed effects . When evaluating solutions , a solution that will work _without assuming a cause_ is more robust . & gt ; I wanted to ask him to for a month , at most , to not pursue any new romantic relationships [ ... ] so I can examine what is bothering me and work on healthy techniques for being both a good girlfriend and a good participant in a poly relationship . This is your proposed solution ( I 'm sure you have a lot of details here you 're leaving out ) . You probably feel guilty because your solution involves a restriction on your partner , and you might be forcing or manipulating your partner into doing something he is n't comfortable with . I think you can feel less guilty by viewing this not as a final and inflexible prescription , but as a possible solution you thought up that might help you . You do n't have to feel guilty about trying to solve your problem ! You also should keep in mind that you have to trust in your partner 's agency . As long as your request is a request and not an ultimatum , your partner deserves to be able to choose to help you in this way . However , it is problematic that you are framing the conversation as the acceptance or rejection of a fully-formed proposal . Although your solution seems reasonable , the sort of solution you might come to after a discussion with your partner , it is n't the only solution . You need feedback from your partner before you can know what parameters to flex , or even if it your proposal makes sense . Maybe allow your partner ( maybe his wife too ) to propose solutions himself before you prime him with your own . Maybe his proposal will be similar to yours . Maybe it 'll be something you had n't considered . In any case , it will help you take his feelings into account . Notice the assumptions your proposal makes , though , and weigh this idea against other options that are slightly or very different . If you think you 've already done this , do it again anyway - cognitive researchers have documented that subjects almost always attach themselves to the first solution they come up with and justify its merits after the fact , so you have to spend at least some effort in trying to correct for that tendency . What are you asking him to stop doing _exactly_ ? Date , or date without your involvement ? Is there some other behavior change on his or your part that would also help ? Why a month at most ? Is it because you 're making some assumptions about his needs and feelings ? Do you already know what steps you 'll take to work on yourself and think that 's the amount of time you need ? Have you explored options that might feel uncomfortable , like breaking up and being on your own for a while ( remember , you do n't actually have to _do_ things just because you think about them ) ? Also take time to explore different rough outcomes of that month ( or whatever time period ) - your problem improves a lot , it improves a little , it stays the same , it gets worse - and what that would mean your next steps would be . It may lead you to change your strategy . Maybe `` that thing I 'd do next '' is what you should start with in the first place .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Major religions would adopt official stances on alien intelligence , many opting for flat denial , and otherwise remain unchanged except for a few new cults . Suppose the data could be interpreted as something intriguing , however - images or sound files showing aliens and their culture . Everything is much more unstable in such a case , but in some ways it would look similar . Religious opinions could be much more divisive , since denial would be a more radical and visible stance .

Next time you go and film an event , try and put some more effort into the interviews . Prepare questions before hand and ask questions as they come to mind . Interview each other and interview strangers both before and after the event . You can even do audio only interviews with a digital audio recorder and use that material over the footage . On that note , the audio of the event itself is probably more interesting than the music you picked . The in-camera mic is n't that great , especially in windy conditions , but even an inexpensive audio recorder with a sock will give you usable audio . Speaking of the music , you do n't need to be such a slave to the music in your editing . The footage is what 's interesting . Maybe pick shorter clips of music , mixed in with the original audio , so that you do n't feel the film has to be the same length as the track , or ditch the music entirely .

The NSA should change its policy for several reasons . One of them mentioned in the petition ( which by the way had an 800 character limit ) is that the release of these theorems and algorithms benefits academia and industry . Another argument is that broad classification is *bad* for national security . Those for which an application has not been found are especially ripe for exploration in the open sphere - and the argument that they should all be automatically labelled dangerous until proven harmless is itself dangerous . Duplicate discoveries by the agencies of other governments , also kept secret , may put our government and industry at risk for cryptographic attack . Transparency on cryptographic vulnerabilities ultimately leads to higher security . Another argument is that the NSA is losing some potential talent because there is no guarantee of recognition outside the agency . That 's not everything , and there are compelling arguments from the other side . But it is my ultimate belief that some moderate change in policy is good for national security , industry , and the scientific endeavour , and that it currently is n't on the agenda because the public does n't think about these issues very much and math does n't tend to capture the public imagination often more than anything else .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

All of these things can be different and contradictory , and to make sense of it all we either need rigorous definitions - in which case we are using a version of the language different from ordinary usage - or we need `` common sense '' , which is far from a rigorous or absolute quality .

The reporting is disrespectful to atheists , but for a subtle reason . It 's silly to claim his views of religion were completely unrelated to the incident and should be totally left out .

We 're probably pissed because the article is written in a way that , for a person with anti-atheist sentiments , it can easily be interpreted to confirm and solidify their preexisting biases without even having reading the article ; that his atheism is mentioned in the subtitle and the first sentence is inappropriate emphasis .

Another economic crisis catapults a radicalized Svoboda and a new ultra-right party from the industrial , Russian speaking East to take over from Party of Regions dominance and create a new dichotomous party system . Svoboda pushes for a 'purely Ukrainian Ukraine ' policy that more aggressively targets the Ukrainian central dialects ( Surzhik ) for extinction and tries to place anti-Russian language laws on the books throughout the country . Russian language books are burned in some places . The attacks are clearly on not only the Russian language but also Russian ethnicity . The new right party moves for Eastern succession . Let the West rot in Europe - Crimea and the East will become their own state , possibly vying for annexation by the Russian Federation . In the East Ukrainian language textbooks are thrown out of school windows in retaliation . Meanwhile the economic crisis worsens , and as each side blames the other secession by the East and South becomes a serious political platform . At the same time pro-EU sentiments grow and lead to an election cycle dominated by right-wing Western politicians . In retaliation to the election , Crimea holds it 's own internal election and votes to secede , declaring Crimea a fully autonomous republic allied with Russia . Eastern attempts at secession are more mixed , and lead to skirmishes and conflicts . Local terrorism targets Ukranian law enforcement being ported form the West to `` keep the peace '' in the Eastern oblasts . With Crimea no longer voting , the votes swing to the West . The violence in the East mostly calms , but Ukrainian national identity is deeply wounded . Unlikely scenario , but I reached to make it happen .

I just went through an entire cycle of acceptance regarding this . & gt ; & gt ; Throwaway because my usual username is literally my name . & gt ; & gt ; After my dad 's divorce from his first wife , he did a lot of mixers and singles parties . He was freaking out that he was almost 50 and was the only one out of his siblings without a family . My favorite part of this story is that he said the last straw before he turned to `` dating magazines '' was when he went to a dance for singles and had to escape out of a bathroom window from a very agressive gay man . So he sent letters to all the women he was interested in and then planned his trip to meet all of them in their respective countries . The woman before he met my mom actually tried to trap him in a room when she found out there were other girls he was planning to see . I 'm glad he kept going after that because he went on to meet my mom in The Philippines . They had a connection and began dating until he brought her back to the states and got married . & gt ; & gt ; Reviewing this story now I ca n't believe I did n't think it was a mail order bride thing , for years I would deny it by saying it was a dating magazine . But I can see why , my parents really love and work well together . Reading about how most men that get a mail order bride are , I can confirm that my dad is kind of a socially awkward guy .

It is n't , so what exactly is the point of telling us it is ? * An homage to the movie , probably the only thing it has in common . & gt ; *Tedious . That 's the word I 'd use to describe what I 've seen so far . There 's clearly some good actors on display and the storyline is alright , but for some reason I 've found the episodes so dull and slow-moving that I 've found myself zoning out and having to rewind and watch again . * Then it 's clearly not for you , I love slow pacing shows and movies . There are many fast shows and sitcoms that could be suited for you . & gt ; *Characters . The characters in the movie were brilliantly written , perfectly executed and , unlike the TV series , entirely convincing . The Coen brother 's characters suck you into the movie and deliver the perfect blend of charm , sympathy , quirkiness and darkness . The characters in the TV show are very uninteresting , with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton 's character . I feel nothing for the others . The female cop in the movie was exquisite , the female cop in the TV show is so dull I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow . The rest of the characters do n't convince me at all . I could n't care less if they all went through a woodchipper in the next episode . * You absolutely misread everything about the characters both in the movie and TV show . Just saying that the characters on the TV show are not brilliant written goes beyond me as all the main characters undergo grade A character development . & gt ; *I feel nothing for the others* & gt ; *I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow* You 've just contradicted yourself , you clearly do feel something for at least one character other than Billy 's . & gt ; *Hitmen .

Now , the hit men in the TV show do n't have any of this . First of all , one of them is deaf . Who the fuck is stupid enough to create a deaf hit man ? Think about it , he ca n't even hear himself , how 's he going to creep up on anyone ? How 's he going to know the police are on him if he ca n't hear sirens ?

He looks like a starbucks-drinking hipster who 'd have trouble fighting sleep , let alone killing anyone . I 'd laugh my head off if he 'd been sent to kill me . Pathetic . * That 's just a silly argument . You ca n't see into people 's heads , I bet you personally know many nice-looking people that do all kinds of nasty shit you do n't know about . And again , here 's your personal preference projecting . If you want to see something really realistic , why do n't you watch a documentary ? & gt ; *The whole Hess family .

Akaforty,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Well it 's not exactly like I can work around the ME-25 to get the guitar tones of Foo Fighters or Queens of the Stone Age . The ME-25 does n't have any good preamps and when I was recording , I just stuck to bypassing and recording the raw guitar input , since applying anything from ME-25 only decreased the overall quality.Although there are some effects that do n't affect the final quality , it all seemed detrimental to me . I did some tracks ( they 're on soundcloud ) where I liked the tones , but it 's usually only compensating for something else . If I record guitars as background instruments , it works , but I want to record guitar-driven music and it 's a disaster . I thought I tried everything , I think the quality simply lacks on a multi-effect pedal . Since I ca n't record what I mean right now , I 'll try to describe my problem to you with words . When I record my guitar directly , it sounds very bland , one-dimensional and boring . This is very different to what the actual tone of the guitar is , when played on an amp . It does have that full , jazzy Les-Paul tone with great bass and just the right amount of mids and heights . This does not show on the recordings in any way and you can obviously hear the low quality of recording , even though I 'm recording at the highest setting possible on ME-25 . I just do n't think it 's possible to get rid of this plastic , artificial sound without moving on to a recording my amp with a microphone .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3Fyr,skyrim,"[ Video1 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=btOb2XqnNTw ) We ’ re starting the new year with a all-new Skyrim modding interview . This time around we ’ re talking to Will Willson , part of the Dark Creations team . A post-grad student in the UK , Will is an integral part of DC ’ s ambitious project known as “ Beyond Skyrim ” . What ’ s the mod all about ? Find out below… **Can you give a general overview of Beyond Skyrim and where the mod project currently stands ? ** Beyond Skyrim is a series of interlinking mods which will ultimately allow players to visit other areas of Tamriel within the Skyrim engine . Assets for each new region are being painstakingly created from scratch , including architecture , creatures , weapons , landscapes , textures and objects created by our artists and modelers . We pride ourselves on our fidelity to Elder Scrolls lore , and our ultimate aim is to create a player experience which will fit together seamlessly with Skyrim itself , allowing players to continue their existing character ’ s adventures in other lands , or perhaps even sidestep Skyrim ’ s story entirely and experience what the rest of Tamriel has to offer . [ Image1 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uVzSmEa.jpg ) We have made three years of progress towards this goal , though of course there remain many challenges ahead . When we started back in 2011 , we had little more than ideas and determination . While similar mods had been conceptualized and even released for previous Elder Scrolls games , we ’ re in uncharted territory for Skyrim . As we move into 2015 , we have built up a well-developed and cohesive community dedicated to our goals , in which our veteran members can actively train newcomers and continue to grow the project . Both our technical and artistic foundations are now firm and we are working hard to implement the quests , characters and stories that will bring this expanding world to life . **The project seems pretty ambitious… how much time is being put into the project ? ** It ’ s difficult to give a precise estimate , since our community depends entirely on volunteers working in their free time , which is of course a variable commodity . As a result of this a degree of membership “ cycling ” is necessary , as different individuals become able to contribute more or less , depending on their other commitments . At the last count , Beyond Skyrim had more than 50 active members , although the amount of hours each of those can contribute will continuously change based on their personal circumstances . Some members can work only a few hours a week , while others put in almost as much time as a job . At a minimum , thousands of hours have collectively been put into the project so far . We ’ ve become increasingly adept at managing and coordinating a highly flexible membership base . It ’ s necessary to break down some tasks like landscaping regions into smaller units , which can be worked on by individuals as they become available . We ’ ve found that taking many very small steps produces the most consistent rate of progress overall . **On your FAQ , you mention the project includes several modding teams – care to give any shoutouts ? ** The two largest groups within Beyond Skyrim are currently the teams working on Cyrodiil and High Rock . They are the oldest and most developed of the projects , and the closest to producing release-quality content . Cyrodiil in particular has gained a reputation for attracting high-caliber 3D artists eager to create their own interpretations of classic locations from Oblivion , some of which will be centre stage in what is likely to be the first Beyond Skyrim release : the region containing the Cyrodiilic city of Bruma . [ Image2 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Hrfeq1v.png ) Although much remains to be done on the asset front for High Rock , it has made great strides in landscaping , and is within sight of completing our first pass for the entire landmass of the Province . I think that it ’ s safe to say that many of the hardest challenges for both these projects have now been passed ( which of course isn ’ t to say there aren ’ t more still ahead ) . We also have teams working on Hammerfell , Morrowind and various other smaller projects , although they are currently at a less advanced stage of development . But progress has accelerated recently and we can expect to hear much more from them in the coming months . [ Image3 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/6CrDLFP.jpg ) As for individual members , there are too many , contributing in too many ways , to mention them all . But there are a few I would like to single out , not simply for their own work , but for their dedication to raising the bar of quality of Beyond Skyrim as a whole . In the field of 3D art , I should draw attention to Markus Liberty , who has constantly set new standards for himself in making architectural models , and inspired others to produce assets to match this quality . [ Image4 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/cYaHaek.jpg ) Among landscapers , we are greatly indebted to Wellpapp , not only for his phenomenal output but also for his generosity in sharing his hard-won expertise with multiple projects . [ Image5 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ZNRW8u8.jpg ) And on the soundtrack front , mention must be made of Xae and Guin , our two Lead Composers , who have forever raised our expectations for the original soundtracks that will accompany our project .

3Fyr,skyrim,"**With The Elder Scrolls Online having a more sweeping look at all of Tamriel , have you been taking any inspiration from the game for the modding project ? ** ESO has of course been a big inspiration to our project , since it filled in a lot of gaps which had previously existed in the lore . However , much of this has taken the form of backstory and helping inform the history of the regions we are making . After all , there is a gap of more than a millennium between the events of ESO and Skyrim , and cultures rarely stay static for long . There ’ s also the fact that ESO uses a different map scale to Skyrim , so we ’ ve had to be selective about what we can include . Many of our locations will take a look at the after-effects of the stories within ESO rather than directly reproducing them as they appeared in ESO . [ Image6 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/2lvKSQ9.jpg ) We ’ ve been having a lot of fun imagining ways in which the stories and characters of ESO have faded into legend with the passage of time . How biased local historians have converted the complex 2nd Era politics into fables about good and evil . Or how quests performed in ESO have cast long shadows over the intervening years that the player never intended . Skyrim players won ’ t need to have played ESO ( or Oblivion or Daggerfall for that matter ) to understand the events of Beyond Skyrim , but there will be plenty of nods and references which veterans of those games will recognize . **What other modding projects have you worked on ? ** I first caught the Elder Scrolls modding bug when contributing as a writer to Tamriel Rebuilt in 2008 . After that , I became involved in the still-ongoing Black Marsh project for Elder Scrolls 4 , where I soon found that my main talents lay more in administration . Since the Dark Creations website was founded in 2011 I ’ ve been involved in the running of the site and helping a great variety of Skyrim modding projects organize their hosting and forums . **What ’ s been your biggest challenge to date with the project ? ** Beyond Skyrim ’ s biggest challenge was , hands down , the creation of our Tamriel topographical map . This has formed the basis for the height maps on which all of our projects are built . Nothing else would have been possible without it , and it ’ s the hardest thing we ’ ve ever had to do . Although there were plenty of sources to draw on , even before the release of ESO , such as the in-game maps from Elder Scrolls II-IV — these were produced to fit wildly different scales and graphics . And of course , we wanted the end product to look as realistic as possible , which meant all the LOD at the borders joining up seamlessly . [ Image7 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/SmMHSZX.jpg ) Integrating all that information from different sources , and trying to deduce what all the rest of Tamriel would “ really ” look like at Skyrim ’ s scale , was both a technical and artistic mountain to climb . It meant figuring out ways to circumvent the hardcoded limits to the distances the game engine could render , and spending hours poring over the most obscure of Elder Scrolls lore references for clues about the landscape . On both of these fronts , we ’ re deeply indebted to a man known to us only by his username of Morcroft Darkes , who was responsible for many of the technical breakthroughs ( as well as the hard slog ) that made the final map possible . **Anything else you ’ d like to share ? New screenshots , trailers , etc ? ** Our most recent trailer ( shown at the top ) was created as a celebration of our third anniversary since the founding of Beyond Skyrim . It shows a selection of our landscapes and locations from across Tamriel , from the moors and citadels of High Rock , to the swamps of the Nibenay Valley in Cyrodiil , as well as glimpses of more exotic locations such as the Alik ’ r Desert in Hammerfell and the far eastern island nation of Roscrea . It also features footage of some of the new creatures that were custom made for Beyond Skyrim in action . A second trailer which we have also released recently , takes a more in-depth look at Country Bruma , the northernmost region of Cyrodiil , which is our current priority candidate for the first Beyond Skyrim release : [ Video2 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c2XsmMeCS9g ) And last but not least , here are a selection of screenshots from our cutting edge work on new regions : [ Album ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/oVHhH # 0 ) **Thanks for the interview ! **",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

Using `element = array [ index ] ` you create pointer to the element , meanwhile `array [ index ] ` access array each time . If you modify only 1 element it wo n't matter , but for example simple particle system would access 4++ properties ( velocity , speed , pos , etc . ) - so theoretically 400 % faster , pretty good right ?
