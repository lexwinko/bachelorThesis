Because of this , her family and the local nobles fabricated her crime and used torture to get over 100 people confess that they knew about it or took part in it in just a few days .

Abodyhun,summonerschool,"It feels so sad becuse I enjoy adc a lot more than support , but I always cringe at what my supports often do . Like using CC on Yi before he gapclosed with Alpha or even better , during it . Or use exhaust after the trade . Or starting Doran 's ring .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"And even if your tanks try to stop him , he and his team just kills them in no time .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Showerthoughts,It takes time to see the difference though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nottheonion,"Holy crap those just look stupid . I 've never followed fashion or anything , but up until now I could see the appeal of the new trends . This one looks plain ugly though .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,Holy shit I did n't remember that the cgi was THAT bad .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"During the last solar eclipse we had a partial one where I live . Me and a few friends used the polarizing filters from movie 3D glasses rotated in an angle to block nearly all the light . The eclipse was still visible , and while everyone only looked at it for seconds we had a cresent shaped afterimage for months . Sometimes my brain ignored it , sometimes it came back . Overall I 'd say it was stupid , but worth it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It 's not that , it 's more about trusting your partner that he 's an experienced player who probably knows how to follow up your plays .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,That one 's a really good placement because Baron 's head makes clearing it awkward .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I mean , Ezreal could get an untargetability frame in it or something .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Easy , just make Ezreal 's flash do damage and remove his E altoghether .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I 'd be ok with it if they balanced them around it .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Sorry I was talking about Tristana in another chain , mixed them up .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I know that in theory you could use this mechanic to avoid hooks like that , but in reality people just get lucky with it . There are already ways to dodge all hooks and stuns in the game , there is no need for them to avoid them sometimes even after getting hit . I 'd be ok with it if Riot turned this into actual mechanics like Illaoi 's CC immunity frame during her ult or Camille 's untargetability .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,So would it be okay if you went topless anywhere ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,It takes about 2 months to reach level 30 if you play daily . It 's basically to force people to learn the game before trying to play competitively .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Blitzcrank peeling in teamfights . So many Blitz players just try to go for the enemy carries bringing all the enemy team closer to their own backline , but using it like a reverse Alistar W is really strong as well dragging divers off your carries . Kudos if you can time it to pull Yi off your carry just after he comes out of alpha .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Honestly Tristana doing that should not have mana cost , but should make her computer blow up or something .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Because she uses it too late and gets hit by the hook . Either make the channel instant and adjust her ( and all other champion 's ) power accordingly , or make these spell 's channel stop after getting hit by CC .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"You should E before Blitz gets into a position to hook and act like any dashless adc . I 'm sure there are really godlike Tristana players who can reliably E out of the hook , but they 'd rather avoid it completely as well . In reality it 's just something that randomly saves Tristana from mispositioning .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,She has an aoe knockback and one of the highest attack range at high levels . Why add an extra safety which is basically the spellshield version of the dodge stat ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"To be honest , all of those interactions are cancer .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Then it was a pretty stupid change . It rewards Tristana for having bad reflexes .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Still , it basically rewards him for having bad reflexes . E-ing out of Blitz hooks should in no way be justified .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I 'm really interested , looking forward to update threads .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I 'm moving as fast as I can .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Did n't even know they had multiple songs .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Seems like Riot would use it as an incentive to go out of your confort zone and play different champions time-to-time .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,& gt ; Some are kind of silly though like cut down 150 trees That sounds pretty hard seeing how rarely Maokai is picked now .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Maybe once game recording gets better we will be able to include footages as evidence .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I think the biggest problem is matchmaking putting really bad players together with veterans . I still get fresh level 30 players starting ranked for the first time while I 'm climbing in gold . The difference and skill and knowledge is huge and they basically lose the game for their team more or less based what they play , yet matchmaking thinks they should swim in the shark pool .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"In reality it just confirms them that they never actually had a chance in the game because you were trolling . It may not be true that you were trolling from the begining , but they do n't care .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,I 'll check it out when I 'll get home . At least solo practive still runs smoothly .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"Did n't try my laptop at home , only my desktop , but it ran smoothly on it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Thanks for the advice , it 's not always as bad as I described , but just like some other people said , I also get frustrated when I 'm overloaded .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Or just telling people at a new job that you are a bit overwhelmed and ca n't do the job as fast as them yet . I 'm actually slow af when it comes to multitasking and I can explain it 10 times to people they still think I 'm lazy .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,This is what my SO just ca n't understand and I feel like it 's going to end our relationship . In the end I either have to convince her that I still love her or roll my eyes as she talks about gaming addiction just because I do n't want to go out drinking every week .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"http : //www.speedtest.net/result/6281967137 Here you go . I 'm pretty sure it 's a hardware limitations problem , but I 've never seen it causing a problem like this . LoL runs without issues .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Yup . Looks like I can only play practice when I 'm at school . Still I 'm thankful that it runs smoothly on my home desktop .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Just tried 600 x 400 and the problem was still present . Feels bad man .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,And she was n't even a relative ? Eww ...,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Right now I 'm playing ranked to get my provisionals and get demoted to bronze and play against people on my level . Casual matchmaking is a bit unfair .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,me_irl,I 'd totally do the same .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"It 's so weird , I just started playing a few days ago and I play 99 % with ball cam on , only turn it off when the ball is above me . Other times I feel like I ca n't control my car with it off though .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,That 's just the shopkeeper .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,74372 Let the luckiest one win ! Thanks OP !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Hey are you playing ashe as you promised ? Or what exactly was your promise back then ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,worldnews,"To play the devil 's advocate , only a small number of them would actually commit false-flag attacks , most would condemn it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Oh you are right , sorry ... damn I dorgot to vote in the finals .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"We would probably need tribunal to come back then , it would take way too much time to review them with the support team .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Yeah , it 's easy to just write them off like lunatics , they are not that far from us as we make believe . We do n't really read articles either and just blindly follow whatever news and advocates we believe are true . Their narrative is basically the same as ours , that our sources lie to us for profits ignoring the damage they do and we just blindly follow them ignoring the other side of the arguement .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,How much did they offer though ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,It 's pretty crazy if you think about it . You are documenting your entire life from your cringies phases that you wish just did n't happen to the best stages of your life .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Really , I did n't know that . Probably because most of the people with mods I 've met pretty much fit the stereotypes , though none of them were really extreme .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Hentai with people who have vaginas and dicks .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Yup , originally when they are split they can heal back really easily , it 's a major annoyance for people . So the reversal process is basically opening up the middle again and stitching it together .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"It 's not at all like that . New players are generally matched with low level players ( though the lack of keystone masteries early on have quite a big impact ) tier 2 runes are basically free and the stat difference between them and tier 3 ones is really small . I could still maintain an 55 % + winrate on Blitzcrank with tier 2 runes . As for champion prices , most of the cheapest champions are pretty strong either in soloQ or competitive . I 'd say a new player does n't lose because doing everything perfectly but not having that plus 4 AD from runes , but because of smurfs and matchmaking randomly placing them against veterans who have much better mechanics and game knowledge . The 20 min surrender option is necesseary , there are unwinnable games due to people bhaving really bad games and enemies snowballing from it to insane levels of power . Some games are unwinnable and if someone has already given up mentally , then it 's better to end the game early than with 10 more minutes of annihillation . I almost never use it , but some people need it ( you need 4/5 players to vote yes , so almost the entire team needs to give up ) . Last , even Riot admitted that the new player experience needs tweaking , but now they are focusing on other high priority stuff .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,I think it 's on the same level as a wisdom tooth removal with a bit longer healing .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,But the chance of a random number generator generating any specific number is pretty low as well .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Well , as much as I learned in this thread all of the listed mods are reversable .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Actually the holes close up pretty well , even larger ones look like normal piercing holes after some time . And there is earlobe reconstruction surgery for larger stretched lobes .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Only when it 's fresh and still pretty much swollen and painful . If it heals it will stay like that unless it 's surgically reversed .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Blue collar jobs , artist , tattoo artist , piercer just to name a few obvious ones . Also basically any higher paid job that does n't require you to interact with new customers often , like programming and software developement .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Holy shit , that 's irl futanari .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Yup it 's penis splitting .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"I actually really like the looks of split tongues and other body mods . I 'd really be into the body modification subculture if it was n't so entangled with spiritualism and anti-technology , both of which I really hate .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Just tag him with RES and remind him every time you see him .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Not necessearily if they set things up properly and do n't let people punishspam .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"There is a little risk of developing lisp probably due to cutting through muscles and connective tissue , maybe nerve endings , but most of the time once it heals up the difference is unnoticable .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Just how far can this insanity go ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Apparently it means crazy in some language . It 's weird cause I always just assumed it 's some satanic thing from the Bible .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Crap I ca n't spell their name . xD,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , but most of the time what happens is enemies run off with 200 hp , noone follows up and they kill you fast . Then your team dies one by one trying to kill them .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It 's really mostly because not that many people put that much effort into climbing . Most people either have school or other responsibilities that do n't allow them to grind the ladder enough . Or they are just extremely stubborn and refuse to change their playstyle , build etc .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah I love playing Twitch , but there 's a reason why I do n't have amazing winrate on him , when teamfights happen I just freak out and can only concentrate on one or two things at a time . Only recently have I started to train myself to prepare how the fight is going to happen and get ready to do certain things to avoid death .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I actually kind of enjoy it , but I agree , some things can be missed with it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It has been changed back in the assasin update , now it 's like a normal dot ability where it immediately applies the first stack then one more each half second . Now the first stack is missing .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Or speedboost which gives about as much speed as a dash .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwitchMains,"I 'll still have to test other build routes , but the bork into runaan into IE still feels pretty good .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Easily . Also do n't cry about getting oneshot by enemies staring at you angrily , you do damage from range ( which is about as long as the range of most abilities in the game .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Hey I need to go at least 40/4/3 at 20 to feel good about myself ok ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,crit items getting cheaper pretty much broke him . Soon he 'll be picked by everyone and their mother so riot will nerf him to the ground .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,If they bought old Poppy back I 'd play top lane again .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Old Poppy was so much fun to play . In gold I could win lane 80 % of the time because people had no idea how to play against her , they got baited by the passive or stood next to walls . It was fun running through entire teams to oneshot the adc then kill 3 other people .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"In reality it 's not that bad though . Still playable , I just got a 4 win streak .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"You are right , I completely forgot about that one .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,What about a quest to play a champion that is currently free and you have a low winrate against ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Tier 2 runes also give very good stats .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,What about place X amount of controll wards and assist killing enemy wards with them ? Or play as some champions which you have low winrate against ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"I just downloaded the game , although I will need to use LowSpecGamer 's guide to make it playable on my laptop .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"Oh so that 's why everything seemed to be so choppy in the game , like it randomly speeds things up . I thought it 's just my laptop .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,hearthstone,Hey hey ! Wan na buy some ... compensations ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Also just recently I E-d , but the poison ran out on the target before the particle reached it and it took no damage . I was so salty because of that .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,todayilearned,"For anyone wondering , these are the posters mentioned : https : //s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a2/4b/70/a24b708a771c0238309b9939d0194d31.jpg http : //images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16700000/iron-maiden-iron-maiden-16769381-500-476.jpg It 's unbelievable that someone was branded a murderous psychopath based on a few music posters and a tattoo . The `` experts '' who testified against him should be jailed for murder .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Holy shit all those saves on both sides . Well played !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Oh I like metalcore , Trivium is among my favourite bands . Though it does n't stop me from enjoying [ Messugah ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qc98u-eGzlc ) . But I agree with you , full screaming without any rythm on the instrumental part is just boring .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,They are magical artifacts that enhance the capabilities of the wearer .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,`` Look . Your oil is leaking . '',Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"In the game I 'm thinking about , his passive ran out a long time ago before he just outran my mobi boots .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"On that note , why is GP so damn fast ? He outruns mobility boots with cloud drake only .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,He went from catching opponents who pushed too far to catching immobile carries who pushed too far .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Like Yi .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Heh , I 'm actually pretty into metal genres that involve lots of screamong and growling , but I know how you must feel . It took me quite a long time to learn to appreciate that kind of music .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , even I have a wide variety of music I enjoy , but jazz is still something I ca n't wrap my head around . It feels like every band member is playing random parts of different songs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Seriously just play more Garen , WW , and if you really want to play sona for support build sightstone ( though blitz and soraka are easier to carry with ) .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"But Cait , Lucian and Ezreal all have pretty hard combos needed to play them effectively . Twitch on the other hand has a huge suprise factor that bronze players are not prepared for .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"You should try recorfing some gameplay , then we could give better advice . Until then , your safety should be your No.1 priority in fights , think about what enemy champions can catch you and wether or not you have vision on them and only attack from the edge of your range . Also take your time and learn to kite properly at high attack speed , it really does matter especially if your team is peeling for you . If the enemy has multiple tanks consider getting last whisper earlier .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Nice job ! I still remember how good it felt to carry a game for the first time .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,So free health potions ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,Havent 's seen this many edits since checking out some terror attack threads .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,At least he does n't destroy your axes like Yasuo .,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,AskReddit,Chicken pox parties were pretty much the norm everywhere before the vaccine became available .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I voted for her just for the fact that it 's impossible to spellshield her Q on Sivir .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I do n't think too many people use practice mode either , apart from Vandiril . Though it 's a nice thing to have along with replays .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"To be fair I rarely see that joke , so it 's possible that most people who upvote it saw it the first time .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Looking good .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"He 's actually a well designed champion , Riot made arrogance into an actual mechanic . It also helps player get better at roleplaying their champion by flaming after every single ks and death . /s",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Only when they really go out of their way allowing the enemy to almost escape , so I need to blow ult or summoners for it . Or when the enemy kills me because of it . Overall I do n't like gambling wether or not they have a way to escape .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Hell I actually rage when people try to let me take kills , even if I can kill them afterwards . Teaching people that there is no KS in this game is the first thing Riot should do .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwitchMains,"How do you like him so far ? I know that he plays quite differently compared to other adcs , but once you get used to thinking with stealth you can be really successful with him .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"The funny thing is , I 've been using that word for ages and always thought it was spelled invounerable . Thanks kind stranger , now I 'll be able to spell properly .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Ah the old revieve teleport meta .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,movies,I do n't understand how they can screw horror movies up so much .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,movies,"Oh my god , I did n't know it was considered that bad .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,movies,"That scene was indeed stupid , but I 've heard that the movie was n't actually that bad . The plane scene was just a minor thing .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,movies,I guess they just think of these as a harmless prank until they realise the damage they 've done . Or they can just be jerks .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Kayle , the Lulu 's passive who became sentient .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,Good to know . Then it 's probably worth more downloading that since it likely is n't 50 Gb like most games nowadays .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,"Yeah , but you do n't really see demos nowadays either . Also refounding is quite hard sometimes . I 've done it with a couple of games where I was n't sure if it would run on my computer or I 'd like it , so I pirated it and either bought the original one later , or never played more than a few hours of the game .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,Well you still have the option to pirate it for a demo and buy it if you find it good .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,"I have the same gripe with Witcher 2 's menus . It reeks of console based menu , but even playing it on xbox it 's a hell to navigate .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I was exaggerating a bit , usually I try to give kills , but KS as a support is rare anyway . Most real supports have like 60 AD and their abilities do like 100 damage max . It 's quite hard to steal kills as Janna for example when the carry and jungler does 3 times your damage .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,We also have mods that ban upon disagreeing . Also on both sides on the site .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,If we get bamboozled we riot until he gets fired !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Actually I 've never seen that happen but my English is really bad when I 'm tired .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"They just Q and dodge some key ability , then stay invisible just long enough that you need to attack something , otherwise you 'd just be afking in the middle of their team . Then she appears next to your adc and takes 70 % of their health with a single autoattack .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , you definitely need a few more items to do that . Also I still do n't fuck with Vayne , no matter how fed I am .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I 'm pretty sure there will still be people acting like you guys banned everyone still using the old client after a 24 hour notice .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Not real 1v1s , but it helps assasinate people a lot with the movespeed stealing . Also the mix of just enough AD to kill casters after one turret shot ( which was only possible with BF sword ) and attack speed is a lot better on him than other adcs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"No , it was because before the botrk changes he could only choose between shitty starting items . Also he is pretty bad vs tanks and poke supports , now that they are toned down he can shine .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Wait it does n't give personal score ? I didny't know that , my bad .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Then the 500 bonus points would have even mattered more . Hell I 'd have had a random stranger sit down at a computer just for the photo then .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,place,Just post something at /r/meirl and you are good to go .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,You should just have invited a friend to get the bonus 500 points for the slumber party . With 50 % winrate that means 10 games .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gaming,I think it 's stock photo with screen photoshopped on .,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,TwitchMains,"13x15 is the smallest I could make it , I 've edited the post with the plan .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Then play something else if you do n't enjoy the game .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwitchMains,"Any idea about where should we place it ? The bottom right corner seems to be pretty empty right now , but I assume it 's a spot that is often vandalised .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Yeah , I actually really liked the game , but I was lucky to avoid the fanbase .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,I 've got to the point where I assume that every single picture like this is bullshit or there is a story behind it . I think everyone should think like this . Worst case scenario : the story is legit and you are rightfully outraged .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Are you sure you do n't have low spec mode on ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,michaelbaygifs,"We did the same thing with the second film , but instead of someone dieing , we made it stricted with only drinking when someone dieing in an absurd way . We still drank enough not to remember anything from the movie and the night .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Did you eat your shorts yet ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Ugh , do n't mention lane swaps . In pro play it looked like teams are no brain grouping 4 people top , in reality I read suff about it for hours and I still did n't think I could pull it off with friends .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,This makes me so mad I want to kill something .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Showerthoughts,Why does getting picked up result in an ijury ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , me too , it 's not game breaking or anything on the champions I play , but I thought it was fixed already .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It 's a hearthstone card , it has 3 mana overload so it locks up 3 mana for the next turn .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Nope , it 's really misleading to see projectiles go off and fizzle out , it even consumes empowered attacks as well .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Whoops sorry , I did n't know that .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I think it 's just bugged and unintended . It 's really misleading to see your attack fittle out mid-air . Delaying the sound and projectile 0.01 seconds would help a lot with the issue .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I do n't want it to be easier , I just want the sound and projectile delayed until it 's safe to cancel .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,summonerschool,"1 . E shield is about equal the damage , but damage gets reduced by resist , shield gets boosted by ally resist , plus they get on hit effect , so unless it 's needed to kill someone fast , it 's better on ally . W has travel time , so enemies can jump on you if you try to use it agressively . Generally use it to mess their combos up . Also gives attack speed , it 's really good to boost your adc with it . 2 . Depends on the situation . If they do n't have high priority cc targets like Katarina you can just ult the tank in the middle of their team . You get multiple knockups out of that , tanks use bonus health better due to armor and resist , and they use the slow aura better as well .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwitchMains,Botrk is also really good because after finishing the cutlass you can kill caster minions after a turret shot with a single autoattack . Also everything the others said .,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,TwitchMains,"Your Q is extremely strong in the laning phase even without the stealth , when a fight breaks out use it for the attack speed steroid . If you can land W in a place where it can add 3 or 4 poison stacks on your opponent , you basically win the 1v1 . So use it when Lucian or Vayne used their dashes . When pushed under tower you can W the caster minions to get them just low enough to kill them after a turret shot . Do n't try to 1v5 unless you are sure you can avoid all the CC they can throw at you , in which case upload replay for the sweet karma . Do n't try to 1v1 Vayne , she can dash to dodge your ultimate shots , which hurts a lot when the winner of the fight is decided by who can land 3 basic attacks on the enemy first . You are not very effective against tank teams since you ca n't kill them fast enough to make a flank worth it . On that note Braum , Taric and Yasuo are your biggest countersin teamfights since a good ult is your win condition . Be careful with harassing enemy under turret , your poison will make it aggro you . Keep this in mind for dives as well .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Caitlynmains,"Thanks , in my future games with her I 'll try to focus more on it , because currently I barely use it in fights because of how rarely they feel useful to me .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,news,"That 's because they first need to ensure that the drug works outside of petri dishes , first in bigger and bigger animals , then they check it on healthy volunteers ( college kids ) in extremely small doses to make sure it does n't cause problems in humans , and only then can they move on to see if it really helps sick people . It takes millions of dollars to develop a new drug , and over 90 % of them end up being rejected at some point . Sorry , this turned out a bit longer that intended , but as someone who studied pharmacy I try to educate people about this part of medicine . We either go this way with tests , or get cases like a year ago when they went on with clinical trials despite test animals getting sick .

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I agree with you in that the leveling system needs improvement and even Riot admits it , but they do n't have plans for revamping it currently . As for the champion prices , this is Riot 's current business model , if they were to make champion cheaper or free , then skin prices would have to go up .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"With the reworks making the 450 ip champions fully viable while keeping them at their original cost , I think Riot does a fairly good job helping out new players . They can even craft champions from hextech shards . Also party ip weekends make grinding a lot more effective now with the 4.5x bonus compared to the old max 2x bonus .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I still remember the release of Aatrox and thinking how uninsiped the champion was . I 'm glad Riot moved past those times .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Their prices were reduced so new players would n't be completely wrecked by veterans . If they have real cost , new players would be better off not getting them and saving up for tier 3 ones .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"They do this because they think pointing out all these stuff about teammates makes losing not their fault at all .

Abodyhun,StardewValley,"* In combat your foot is part of your hitbox , but the sword swing comes from your arms . So downwards you have much smaller reach . * On PC while fishing or in combat if you click close to your character it registers to change the direction of your aiming . This makes you throw the line in the opposite direction , or miss your sword swing and get hit by a monster and die . Which is still has too harsh punishments .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Thank mr rekkles,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"When I get fed as adc I basically have to play the same way as before and deal a little more damage . From the enemy perspective it never seems like they lost because I got fed , but because they did n't focus me . Though on Twitch sometimes I reach points where I can reliably assasinate carries and assasins . Nothing 's more satisfying than catching a Yi who just used alpha on minions and killing them before he can reach me or run away .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pics,Bottom of a ship ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I think the support being bad is mostly just a self fulfilling prophecy . Everyone says that it sucks , so people are reluctant to play it , when they have to play it they are clearly unexperienced and blame the adc for the skills of the enemy support . Prinkle in a bit of confirmation bias and suddenly noone wants to play the role . Though I have to admit , when I 'm too tired to adc I just pick leona for easy wins .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I 've just realised Thresh or Leona could hook themselves onto a bunch of boxes to kill themselves .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,The beauty of these offmeta picks is that the enemy needs to learn to play against them on the go . It gets hard though when you already fed 3 kills to that pick .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Well , triple and pentakills get announced , hitting key skillshots , reacting to engages and shielding it time does n't . If your teammates did n't see/pay attention to what you did do n't expect to get praised . And anyway people usually congratulate `` bot '' instead of `` adc '' .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I do n't think they would change that , focusing a single target is pretty much a core mechanic for her . Making it work with Runaan 's would gut her single target damage .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,gwent,"I did that , but it still took me some time to realise how things worked . Hopefully later on there will be better animations to make these things clearer .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Wow thanks , I had no idea how the hounds worked .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,Also I do n't think they want to become fucking murderers .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Quit Hearthstone some time after the switch to wild , started gwent recently . I really enjoy the changes so far , especially with the kegs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Your autofilled support forgot to ward again right ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Thank you guys for the amazing games and free giveaways ! I have no idea how you stay profitable .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Why not be stricter towards leavers as well ? Coming from Leauge it 's very suprising how often people leave .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Imagine a Deus Ex game as Project Twitch .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,"Seriously , as someone new to the game I 'm suprised how lenient the game is towards leavers . Also I have n't yet been matched against a player who is worse than me .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Just remember not to play against the monk in the first town . The relic he offers is nothing , but an old GOG promo material . For some reason they left him in the game , and beating him results in nothing .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Also bets were weighted against you , so you could n't even mitigate losses .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,It pretty often screwed you over even using the same input every time .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"If you really want the game , it 's under $ 3 at GOG . I was just about to buy it when I found out about the giveaway .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,witcher,"Currently the goty edition is on 50 % sale on GOG . You could check [ this video ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=vrJ330NGjCU ) to see how you 'd like the game on minimum graphics ( and way bellow them ) . I 'd say go for it , though I 'm biased , I ca n't even run the second game .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,witcher,SKT T1,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,lowendgaming,Even an old card like this could help my even older desktop . I 'd probably play Deus Ex HR and Witcher 2 with it . Edit : I 'm in EU btw if it matters .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Haha I have amd phenom cpu with that card .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,I do n't own it and still got it .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I hope Valor will mistake you for some fish and eat you . No offense .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,This was a pretty wholesoeme comment .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"But overheal gives YOU the shield if you get overhealed , not to the teammate you just healed .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,For some reason I ca n't seem to find it .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Is the looking glass a reference to the story or an extension to the game ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"If you have issues with the combat , remember that enemies deal 150-200 % bonus damage to your back , even while rolling away from them . Once I learned that , the combat got a lot more managable .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,"We ca n't just be constantly outraged about the same thing , the jokes got old after a few weeks . Just not using UA services next time you wanted to fly somewhere also works .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,Housing prices in some US cities are truly fucked . Do those houses even change hands besides being inherited ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"Hungary . Though I realised that by expensive neighbourhoods people mean villas and luxury , while I was thinking about average ones . In my defense I 've only slept an hour yesterday night .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Mulliganinc cards was invisible at the round start . Previous round ends and all I can see is `` opponent is choosing which cards to replace '' . I click somewhere where a card is supposed to be and it gets mulliganed .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"True , though a really expensive neighbourhood probably has those nice cast iron or stone fences with houses looking more like castles .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Though I do n't really like that replies to top level comments are all gray . It 's very hard to read sometimes .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"TBF I do n't live in the US , so my assumption was mostly based off me liking trees in a neighbourhood .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"The first image looks like some expensive suburban neighbourhood , the second one looks like it 's next to a trailer park . Edit : TIL I have no idea how a good neighbourhood in the US looks like .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Oh I see . In the meantime I looked up the topic myself as well , and while I agree with the notion that he should n't have used that character , the internet overreacted . Maybe it would n't have happened though if the game did n't get so popular .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"I also played Undertale , but never heard about your second point with the character . Care to explain ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Is the rule34 part really the bad part of the Undertale community or is there anything else ? I do n't think there is a game or movie that does n't have pornographic fan art .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Also the combat in 2 is very clunky with having to target enemies and no strafing/sidestepping , only dodgerolling , but it has no invincibility frame in it , so you could easily get hit during it and take the 150-200 % backstab damage . That alone could kill you from 70 % health by certain enemies .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"You can try the combat rebalance mod for Witcher 2 . It adds new animations which are less clunky , takes off the 200 % backstab damage bonus from you and enemies and generally makes the game less roll focued . Also the third one has a lot more different combat .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Also the one talking about a game , then dropping the line `` the latest game in the series is Nier Automata '' . Ok there might be a chance someone actually really enjoyed that game , but with the success of NA I 'm smelling karma whoring .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"Not likely , but there will be something more revealed in a few days as they did a twitter poll about something vague .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,It also has cloud saves just like Steam .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Thanks , I 'll check back . Did you use mods for the game back then ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Wow you just made my reddit experience 200 % better .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Do you guys even use your riot account to browse reddit normally ? I mean I guess you do n't comment , but just normally reading and upvotting ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,"Looked up everything , aim is right click , melee is left click while not aiming , but I can do melee attacks by mashing right click and nothing else . Also it happens with no pattern .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,I 'd hate to throw up in that suit .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"Sure , but WinRAR 's devs did n't try to lure people in by bringing it up on social media .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,"Now that you say that , we might get a reboot of some sorts , like Prey .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,It 's such a shame though . I 've also heard that the newest Resident Evil was n't a big success despite pleasing fans .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,Top left is Doom Guy .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,They did the deformed face really well with that .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"I think the biggest difference his how enjoyable it is to watch games compared to other esports . I 'm a big LoL player , but I find LCS boring to watch . Rocket League on the other hand is entertaining because it looks so smooth and elegant .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,"Yeah , and it felt logical . The pulse rifle and other guns hit strong enough to tear limbs off in a few shots , even a single shot should be deadly to a normal human .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,I 'm pretty sure they record sounds like these in theaters or something lik that .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,But does WinRAR have rule34 ? Checkmate Windows users .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,creepy,"Weird , I would have guessed surgery rooms mostly smelled of sanitizers .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,"Wait you were under the train and got fucked up with the stuff under it ? And still survived without even losing a limb ? You were really lucky , I 'm pretty sure a few extra punds would have resulted in you getting rolled up like a burrito .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Is the enchanced edition basically 1 remade in 2 's engine ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Yeah , I heard about it the closeness to Prey as well , and I enjoy those kinds of games .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"Well , I picked up dead space , but looks like it has one of the most horribe mouse acceleration I 've ever encountered . I played the pirated version when it was new , but I do n't remember it being this bad .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,I only avoided milling my stuff because I was lazy .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,DeadSpace,I was actually a lot more afraid of the Hunter in the first game .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,"Currently I 'm torn between a higher end dektop or a mid range laptop . Obviously the desktop would be better value , but I could bring the laptop to college .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,TBF Morrowind quest details did n't always help either . I still have PTSD from that one quest with wrong directions .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Now it 's our turn to rant .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,lowspecgamer,Witcher 1 . I 'm pretty sure there are places where the second game runs faster than the first .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"I personally do n't have problems with weather , since I play them : P",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"I 'm also kinda like this , sometimes I get this stomach churring nervousness when I pass for card advantage .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Utility cards like Water Hag ensures that you are never out of answers against any kind of meta . If a mechanic becomes too powerful we just tech more counters against it , and even clear skies has more uses against non weather decks than Flare against a Warrior opponent .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"You have to stop sniffing it , it 's bad for your lungs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Oh I see . At first I was kinda reluctant with chopping up my game library with purcashing games on gog , but ever since all their giveaways ( and gwent ) I 'm happy to purcashe there too .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Maybe once gog connect comes back you 'll be able to get the gog version .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,You can run offline games on steam as well without internet connection .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,I 'm still not sure how to calculate weather after passing . Sometimes I play one more card just to be sure .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,Haha I 've just started playing since the open beta release and I 've been wrecking people with monster frost . I 'm kinda afraid to move on to ther deck types though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gaming,"Holy pile of shit , I 'm dying .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,It looks like something from Hotline Miami .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,movies,"I also really liked it , and with a few improvements the next one could be truly successful .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,sports,But a dedicated one .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,sports,jesus the dedication ...,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah I think so too , but by the looks of it , higher honor wo n't net more keys , so maybe people wo n't really do it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Though I hope honor begging will be punished or stopped in some way .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,In my opinion the whiffs are kinda necesseary for balance though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,Also soul gems .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"It 's kinda like the nostalgia others have for the original Deus Ex . There is no hand holding , and the beging of the game can be really terrifying . You can venture into areas where enemies almost oneshot you , others cast a curse on you that reduces your carry capacity , forcing you to drop your loot if you want to get out of there . In exchange , getting stronger is a lot more satisfying . Enchanting , alchemy and magic can become seriously overpowered . Also you can kill any character , even main mission characters . But you can also accidentally wander into the main boss 's hideout and take him out like any other enemy , deeply questioning wether or not you were the coosen one , of if there was one at all .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Ca n't stop watching . Rocket league is still the most fun to watch esport ever .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,How the hell do you keep something like that cool ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Also tons of people really just use Steam for CSGO , just like using Battle.net for Hearthstone . People would n't buy a new console or pc to play an almost 10 year old game or a glorified solitaire .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,food,That sounds a bit like and overreaction to me . I 've never heard of it and where I come from we live and die by unpasteurized milk products and smoked sausages .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Haha yeah witcher 1 definitely has some ( many ) of those cringe moments . I love it because of that though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"I actually really liked the alchemy/monster hunting in the first one , it felt really realistic .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,I had a friend do the same to me twice before me realising the truth . At least that got me thinking wether or not it was really a friendship at all .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Hahaha that 's borderline EVE level shit .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Really though , I do n't know what got me and others hooked so much back then . It was all about clicking at stuff requiring no effort , just time and patience .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Oh I see , thanks .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,It 's one of the few movies I watched multiple times .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Had the same thing happen to me , but it was my runescape account 's password that I shared with my `` friend '' in case I forgot it . After months of playing it free and getting almost maxed out gear ( at least what I can get for free ) one day everything disappeared . I told him , then he made up something about a hacker . Next time it happened he said I said something offensive and admins removed my items as punishment . I only caught up to it when I wanted to buy the premium currency in Voyage Centruy Online years later , but since I did n't have a bank account yet , so game him my credentials and asked him to do it for me and I 'd pay in cash . The very next day my account was wiped and he made up some hacker bullshit again , thinking I would n't remember it . I 'm glad that happened though , it ended a very toxic friendship for me .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Strange , steam did n't ask me to update for a long time until recently .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,634 Thanks OP !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,4892 Thanks OP .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,lowspecgamer,"Yeah , I guess the Neverwinter engine was never made for such detailed ( lol ) character models in mind . Currently I have everything turned down , so I get a mostly stable framerate .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"& gt ; Yeah enchanting ~~on hit~~ is pretty unbalanced ~~with the mod early on , but quickly balances after around level 15~~ FTFY",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,Oh I did n't know that . Then it 's fine . Unless I wanted to nitpick on enchanted weapons with on hit effects still getting more dpsm but that would n't really matter until lategamem here you have high weapon skills anyway .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,RocketLeague,Oh it 's only visible in HD quality .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Would you call that state of existence life though ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"It 's not that hard to imagine their thought process though . Even though car accidents are much more frequent than vaccine injury , I have n't seen more than 3 accindents in my life , and they all were just bumps . You do n't think about losing control of your car on the highway all the time . On the other hand , to these `` all natural '' people vaccines already sound like something artifical and scary especially when they hear about the scare stories . Also anti vaxxine advocates are pretty good at sounding like they make sense and often you 'd need to study biology and chemistry for years to understand why they are wrong .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,I can see a Dota logo hidden there .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,witcher,"Still nothing . Thankfully someone gave me a code , worst case scenario is I get mine and give it away . : D And honestly we are talking about a game that 's currently under $ 3 .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gaming,This is among my greatest fears in my life . Finally being able to buy a higher end system but not being able to play as much as I 'd like because work and family .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gaming,"As someone who only played Half Life 2 and the Portal games a few months ago , this highly resonates with me .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gaming,But they no longer get as low lowest prices as they used to .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,Just look at the wounds it gave the antelope just by holding it back .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,"I 'm pretty sure though that most predators who play with their food know what they are doing , us mammals rely on very similar cues to tell others if we are hurt or distressed . They just do n't really care , like a child squishing a baby animal .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,"Well , geese are assholes .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,Bird is the word .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,dwarffortress,"My bad , I did n't notice it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,dwarffortress,"Yeah , that 's why I 've tried to change thing up , since I always had about 3 idlers . When I checked things , a single dwarf was assigned to almost everything , even if it had 0 experience with that job , while others had 5 jobs max .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,dwarffortress,"So I either let dwarves do jobs they suck at , or risk a few idlers ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"No problem , I 'm glad I could help .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"I mean , there are really tense moments when you are low on ammo and health , but the whole game is such a unique experience , I do n't think anyone should miss it . Bottom line , the game is cheaper than a meal in most places .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Doom is on 67 % sale on steam right now though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Rocket League just had a 30 % sale a week ago , I doubt it 's going to be on sale very soon , but who knows . I might get Dark Souls if it 's going to be on 75 % .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , now that I think of it Yi may be more cancer , since he can already outplay almost every stun by moving fast and timing alpha well . The idea of hitting a spell on him and it only damaging a shield without stopping his oneshots on carries sounds tilting . Meanwhile Katarina is just a sitting beyblade .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,& gt ; Beyond a **shadow** of a doubt . Well played .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Totally worth the time , the devs were really creative with the weapons and enemies , also by the end of the game it ventured a bit into Lovecraft levels of horror .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,It only happens if cait did n't finish the channel yet . I 'd hate to dodge Vi ult with Fizz E only to give it back to her 5 sec later .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"In the combat you have limited resources , but you are given the ability to avoid almost all damage by dodging projectiles or enemy attacks . Overall it feels really satisfying and intense , there were times when reaching the next light pole felt like true relief ( they act like save points since monsters are hurt by light ) . Overall they were really creative with the weapons , like those burning flares can give you a moment of relief to regenerate some health and keep monsters away , and flare guns are basically the game 's BFG .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Yeah it definitely should stop Vi 's ult if the target gets out of range . It should n't refound it 's cooldown though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,"Dive in headfirst with your arms pointed towards your head . When you are halway in , stretch your arms sideways and let them side into her arms . Then pull your legs inside too and fit them into their place . You are controlling her now like a sock puppet .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,videos,"I do n't think it 's that bad , I 'm pretty sure they have enzymes to dissolve/weaken the old shell . It 's more like scratching off your clothes or something like that .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Sorry I might have sounded too agressive . English is n't my first language , so I ca n't always measure my tone correctly . You are right though , it should n't take much time to adapt to new GA apart from a one match suprise factor .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Wow got ta try this in game .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I have a toaster laptop with Intel HD Graphics , previously I could run the game at 30 fps , now in the smallest fights it drops bellow 10 , makes the game completely unplayable .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Even after death ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It looks smooth , but it 's kind of uncanny as well .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,New Rift Herald is another big bug monster . GA 's visual on the other hand is something we had since the begining . A drastic change would be hard to adapt to .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Either mods do it , or admins which could get the sub in trouble .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Art,"& gt ; cutting itself is an attempt to mend the soul , but that it is a harmful attempt that appears to make one whole and functioning but is actually disabling . Oh I did n't even think of that it 's really clever .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"There are people who play religiously for years and never get out of bronze . With the old XP gains you would n't even be level 25 yet , and the requirement of getting level 30 is there for a reason . Surely you can go ahead and play ranked now , but even among low elo ranked players there are expectations in terms of game knowledge and mechanics you just have n't gained yet . It 's pretty okay for you to fall to lower bronze . You have to play for half a year at minimum to have a basic understanding of why we do things as we do them . Until then watch streams and read guides . It took me a year to get to silver . Also bronze 1 ( and every league 's 1 ) is pretty toxic because of people tryharding to get to a higher league , as well as others who give no shits because they are at the bottom of the higher league and it 's pretty hard to fall back to a lower league .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,Though that might result in a full trade embargo against Turkey or something else until Erogan 's mafia gets cleaned out .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,Luckily he did it before we had a chance .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,It 's about as surreal as if MW2 's No Russian mission went live .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,"I did n't even realise this happened in the US . How the hell did they even think they are allowed to do anything like that ? They ca n't get away with it , I 'm pretty sure Erogan 's visit will be quite awkward .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Art,"This is also what I got out of it . I found the cutting namechoice odd , to me the sewing part is self harm in general . Self harm disables OP just like self sewing disables the limbs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"How long have you been playing ? If you have n't been able to get out of bronze after multiple seasons of playing , maybe it 's really the time to move on . Find another game you like , when I get tilted in soloQ I just play single player games for a couple of days . Go beat Half Life 2 on hard or something . Or you can buy a cheap guitar and start learning that . As someone who used to play guitar a lot , even a very cheap used one is good enough to see if you 'd enjoy playing an instrument . On the other hand if you are newer ( like less than 1 year ) then do n't worry that much , there 's a lot to learn in this game and it takes lots of time to really grasp everything . The game takes lots of focus and quick decision making and often only by trial and error can you see what is the best choice in each situation . Also try to add someone after a good game , I 've made lots of duo partners by this . Hell if you are on EUNE I can duo with you .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,Much better than him being hard from the begining .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,You know what you have to do .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"Well it 's so cheap now , it 's almost free .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I find the spellshield more disgusting on Kararina though . Both of them are cancer .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Holy shit that laughter is contagious !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Sadly low level matchmaking is n't that good , the only thing you can do is fight through it and learn to get better at the game . Though honestly I 've never found a game where new players get fair matchups . In a year you 'll realise that all those ranked player that beat you easily are just trash .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"The game can be pretty fun to learn all the things , but it has a pretty steep learning curve , as others said it takes 3 months of daily play to get a basic understanding of controls and mechanics , then another year to get a minimum game knowledge . The big question you have to ask is : do you want to start playing a game that you can never fully learn but can always get better at ? If you would rather play something that can be picked up and put down any time , I 'd suggest another game , League would just frustrate you as you 'd regularly get matched with lot more skilled opponents .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Well whaddya know ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , Yasuo , Riven , Zed all have to dive into the enemy team to do their jobs , but if the team just does n't engage , they will be useless .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,gifs,This made me so unconfortable . Imagine getting stuck halfway through .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Documentaries,How did they manage to save all the second class children ? It 's like they were going for some achievement .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nuance,We just brought a sub back from the dead .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Maybe it 's really not that necesseary , but as an adc-support main I 'm glad that I can take support as secondary and not play it 10 times in a row like with the old system . There should be a better incentive to play support , then maybe we could get rid of autofill .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I think the biggest problem is the circlejerk that support ca n't carry because they are fully dependent on the adc . For a long time though this changed and bot lane is about even , maybe even a bit more dependent on the support 's skill than the adc .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Also old Taric before the nerf . The biggest play you could make with him was flash & gt ; ult & gt ; e but it won me games 75 % of the time .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Then flame the adc for losing lane when he is basically playing 2v1 .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"But without it everyone is fucked . I like playing support half the time I play , but without it I 'd play it 90 % of the time then feed as adc because my mechanics got worse . Or take a secondary role and risk getting assigned to it . Ca n't just everyone learn support to some extent ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Morgana is such a weak support right now , but she 's still so much cancer to play against as Blitz . One game I had to play against a morg-sivir bot lane . Never felt so useless , but finally landing a hook felt so satisfying .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Oh the other adc that has insane mobility and safe farming spell , but gets a get out of jail free card because `` it 's not a channel just a cast time '' .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Only in writing . I 'm a slow speaker even in my first language and it 's been years since I 've spoken a word in English .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Maybe they should keep working on it a bit , maybe write another code for it , since this tail is n't just a passive one that you drag around .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"When you are used to higher fps it becomes really hard to adapt to lower one , just like Faker saying that the game is unplayable with 40 ms ping .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Reading this , a lot of the game 's design choices make sense now . Though I like the game better as a linear one .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Also bought Downwell thank 's to Mark Brown 's video , I love it . Frustrated me to no end and only reached the second area a couple of times , but I love it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nottheonion,"Yeah , I 'm not sure how viable are the ones after a week , I 'm sure they only keep the freshest sperm in the balls . Edit : Apparently they live up to 60-75 days , after that they are recycled .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"Hmm I 'll check if my laptop can run it decently , reading the features and reviews , the series might have gotten a new fan !",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nottheonion,My girlfriend has this sharp pain during ovulation until she switched birth control . If you are on it you might want to ask your doctor about it .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nottheonion,Wow I did n't know that . How long do they survive in the balls ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nottheonion,Is pushing you chopped off penis inside another person still sexual assault ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,hearthstone,I thought it was programmed to crash ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,I 'm pretty sure many of these posts are just faked by marketing department employees buying a few thousand upvotes to reach the frontpage .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,What 's the biggest thing that stops the client from being as smooth as a web browser ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Do you think we should get a warning if we are assigned jungle and do n't have smite ? Or creating custom warnings to ourselves to react to certain picks ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,"I vaguely remember something similar where the celeb was the victim . Some basketball or baseball player , he was having lunch at a restaurant and this kid comes up to him asking for autograph . After he gives him one , he starts coming back with more things to give them to his friends , even making his mom buy tshirts and balls for more autographs .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,Holy shit that 's quite arrogant . Though I wonder how many photos I could get someone taken as a prank .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pics,I was genuinely suprised that pumas do n't have the upper body strength to climb a tree like that easily . If there were n't any fork in the tree it would n't have reached the sloth .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,"You know , jokes can sometimes go wrong even if people do n't intend it .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,news,"Dogs never needed to learn the dangers of those pools , so they never even think about those pools ( or any water ) being dangerous . Wild dogs on the other hand would learn it pretty fast .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,todayilearned,Only a radio that sang Just bidet ! Bidet ! Bidet ! Noone ever wants to be defecated .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Back when I played it the first time I found it hilarious that the police woman did n't think much of him because of his tweed jacket .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Apparently they originally planned the game to be open world , the long drive to phisically get you to the final boss 's place makes a little more sense this way .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Though piracy is always an option if you do n't want to give money to grey market .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,"I 'm using a Dell Inspiron 5040 laptop , Pentium P6200 2,13 GHz dual core CPU , Intel HD Graphics , 4 Gb RAM . I 'm sure it 's not the key , the same thing happens with grabbing bodies and searching them .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,TwoXChromosomes,Imagine the hand moving just at the right moment and stabbing yourself in the boob though . I 'm a man but I still shudder .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Did you try to bring it up to higher ups ? Maybe you could get a raise out of them .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Ponzi scheme is the one where you ask for investment and promise high returns , but the returns are only from the investments of newer investors . You do this until you start running out of new investors , then disappear with the last batch of investments .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Hahaha same with emails . Last time I was really close to switching email adresses , but instead I just deleted 50 pages of junk mail handpicking the important ones from them .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"About 6 years ago me and my brother found a fistful ( like literally a fist-thick stack ) of scrape-off lottery tickets in my dad 's car . My parents divorced due to my dad 's inability to handle money and business , needless to say , this discovery did n't help us believe that he handled money much better .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Also people are inexperienced and they get afraid of breaking up with their partner just like being afraid of asking their teacher if it 's ok to hand it their notes and reports about their work of that semester 6 days after due date .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"It does n't happen overnight , but suddenly the cheaters ca n't be invited to the same occasions as OP . And since OP has the moral high ground , and needs friends to get out more anyway , he 's getting invited more often . So the other two naturally gets left out more until they barely talk to the rest of the group . Especially if they have other friends to hang out with outside of the first group of friends .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,witcher,Hey is it still available then ? I 'd be very thankful !,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,"Yup , everything on minimum , steam helper disabled ( it actually gives a ton of fps ) and that allow jobstealing stuff is set to 0 as well . This way I manage a smooth 30 fps that dips to the 10 's sometimes , but when I try to do a takedown , no matter how little I press Q , sometimes I still execute people .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,witcher,Damn I still did n't recieve mine . Maybe something is wrong with my email .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,gwent,"Also I heard there are combat mods that actually allow you to strafe during combat . If that 's not the biggest quality of life change , I do n't know that it is .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,OldSchoolCool,It must have been a pretty good date though .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,funny,Thankfully now you can give the kid a phone or anything to just ring them if you ca n't find them . A radio tracker would also be a good failsafe solution as well .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,lowendgaming,"Yeah , it 's funny that in Hungary we have some 8hr job paying that much . Though living is cheaper as well , so unless we travel or try to buy anything imported it 's not as bad .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,lowspecgamer,Human revolutions would be greatly appreciated as well . I 'm just a few fps from achieving a stable 30 fps and I 've already used every official and unofficial tweak I could find .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Got ta change those account names .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,randomactsofcsgo,Thanks for the giveaway on behalf of the community .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,"The problem is , I ca n't find any config files . The GPU is really weird though , I ca n't find any series model for it , like intel HD graphics 5000 or anything , it 's only intel HD graphics , so it might be the weakest in the line .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"what you want , but make sure you 're on the high ground .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,Actually I 'm in the middle of saving up . I 'm going to work through most of the summer once the finals are over .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Sometimes I wonder if it 's the same two people with different usernames .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,I there any graphics mods or Low Spec Gamer style config files that you know about ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,So what was the cause after all ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Lol as a kid I used this against my parents and other kids .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Wellthatsucks,Thanks I 've almost spit my drink on my screen . I guess he was kind of lucky after all .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,But he just killed you .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Seriously he 's so fast at making them up .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,& gt ; Another tripped over his own feet and started peeing himself ... but I think that might have been a Renekton main after the rework . That 's the part where I started laughing audibly while choking with coughing .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Wellthatsucks,Honestly for how dumb he was I would have just used one of [ these ] ( https : //www.sciencecompany.com/Assets/ProductImages/nc0146g.jpg ) .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Wellthatsucks,"I thought of the tearing part , but I would have never thought about filling the hole with dirt . How do you even clean that ?",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"In the patch notes . No legendary or ultimate skins , nor recently eleased ones .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah you are right , no legendary skins .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , today night it will open . though no legendary skins .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"wait a few more hours , you might get lucky in the personal shop thingy .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,nonononoyes,"Neither is motocross , nor nascar , yet people still do it for entertainment .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,nonononoyes,I 'm pretty sure they can still butcher it the normal way outside the ring too .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,You have some next level prophecy then . Maybe you really should take shitposting up as a carreer .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"I also got really screwed over , only one skin went to my adc I otp , a shitty skin went to my flex pick , the rest are either champions I 've played 2 seasons ago or only bought for aram .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,My 70 % skin is fucking Guerilla Tristana who have n't even played in 2 seasons and I 've been voting against every round during the champion survivor 's last rounds . Meanwhile Blitzcrank is my exclusively played support and did n't get anythign for him .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"It 's only available during certain events , each time you get new offers .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,I 've just realised that this is the first time I 've heard the actual arguements against women voting . I guess they kind of make sense to people who have that kind of mindset .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,Wait it 's worse than just a normal nude photo ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,I love it . Now I 'm not even that mad that you guys beat them .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,space,"You are are right , I do n't even know how far that star is . I thought it was just a few dozens of lightyears away . The fact that radio signals weaken is new to me , thanks , I did n't know about that .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,Sadly I 'm not really familiar with moddingm though I 'm pretty sure there are people over at the game 's subreddit who can help more .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Yeah , but 100 % hit chance would make the player 's DPS too high . Though I 'm pretty sure there are mods to alter dps based on weapon level .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,Did n't even know about the Witcher 2 combat mods . I might give it a try on PC then .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,patientgamers,"Honestly I would n't even recommend that . Just tell them that combat still features dice rolls and is balanced around characters not hitting every attack . Same with spells . The game becomes so easy to exploit later on with alchemy and enchanting , let them have the early game challenges .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,Deusex,"Uhh I 'm playing Human Revolution . Honestly I 'm a bit suprised that the game even runs on my laptop , but I was kind of hoping to squeeze in a little more FPS . Guess my only option is my desktop then .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,space,Would n't our heavy usage of radios give us away ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,The combat alone is good enough to buy the first game alone .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"I especially love how shooting walls and stuff creats lots of dust essentially blinding you , so you have to move around a lot during combat . Edit : Just read the second half of your comment , guess we both loved the same thing .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,"If it 's any consolation , FEAR scares are rarely jumpscares ( at least not with noises ) and you do n't have to fight most of the ghosts ( except a specific type ) .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,space,"It would be scary though if we were to find out if they were really aliens , since that would mean they would know of us by that time .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,worldnews,Last time I 've actually heard it 's getting a bit better .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"But having 10 bans in soloQ would really mean some champions being permabanned . They rolled with this system so people would either risk wasting bans on permabanned champions , or letting them pass through .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Mine would be even more off with overall percentages . I got 2 skins for my main adcs , the rest of them are for champs I 've mained a year ago , or only bought for URF .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,GameDeals,The first game has one of the best shooting combat and AI ever made .,Uralic,Hungarian
