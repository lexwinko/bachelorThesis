ACircledSquare,todayilearned,"Not blaming it on Bush per se but giving free money willy nilly to everyone with high interest rates kind of reminds me the housing bubble . Anywho here are some sources . https : //carybankruptcy.com/blog/are-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy & gt ; After graduation , college students sometimes find themselves earning less money than expected and monthly student loan payments can quickly become quite troublesome . As stated above , ordinarily student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , but filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection may offer some assistance if graduates find themselves falling behind on student loan payments . Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects borrowers from having to repay student loans during the pendency of the chapter 13 plan . & gt ; & gt ; The only way a debtor can discharge either federally subsidized or private student loans is to prove that that repaying the student loan debt would impose an undue hardship . This is done by filing an adversary proceeding ancillary to the debtor ’ s bankruptcy case . The Brunner test is currently used in the Fourth Circuit , which includes the Eastern District of North Carolina , and requires that three conditions be met . First , the debtor must prove that a minimal standard of living can not be maintained while repaying the student loans . Second , other conditions must exist that suggest that the debtor ’ s poor financial circumstances will persist for a large percentage of the student loan repayment period . Finally , the debtor must prove that a good faith effort has been made to repay the loans prior to filing for bankruptcy . Fulfilling all of these requirements is difficult , but not impossible . http : //www.totalbankruptcy.com/overview/basics/student-loans-in-bankruptcy.aspx- - & gt ; Generally speaking , student loans are non-dischargeable debts that can not be eliminated through bankruptcy ; however , there are some rare exceptions . & gt ; & gt ; Prior to the bankruptcy law change in 2005 , student loans owed to private non-profit institutions were dischargeable , but the new bankruptcy law closed that exception . & gt ; & gt ; Currently , the only way to eliminate student loans in a bankruptcy is to file an adversary with the bankruptcy court and demonstrate that the student loans impose an `` undue hardship '' on you or your dependents . & gt ; & gt ; To learn whether your student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy , fill out the below form to talk to one of our sponsoring bankruptcy lawyers for free : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; The `` Undue Hardship '' Exception & gt ; & gt ; Bankruptcy judges have interpreted the `` undue hardship '' exception very favorably towards student loan lenders , and disability or other extreme circumstances are typically required to successfully eliminate student loans . & gt ; & gt ; A majority of jurisdictions require you to demonstrate the following : & gt ; & gt ; Repayment of the student loan would prevent you from maintaining an adequate standard of living & gt ; Your financial situation is unlikely to improve & gt ; You have made a good faith effort to repay the student loan & gt ; Adversary proceedings to determine the dischargeability of student loans can resemble a `` mini-trial '' and can be very time-consuming and complex . & gt ; & gt ; Accordingly , legal fees can be substantial and difficult to afford , especially for someone facing `` undue hardship '' . & gt ; & gt ; Chapter 13 and Student Loans & gt ; & gt ; Student Loans can be included in the 3-5 year repayment plan of your Chapter 13 bankruptcy , but you will be responsible for any remaining balance upon the completion of your bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; Anywhere from 10 % to 100 % of your student loan may be included in your bankruptcy , depending on your assets , debts , and income . & gt ; & gt ; Including your student loans in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers many protections and may provide you with short-term relief from collection activity . & gt ; & gt ; While you are in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , the student loan creditors are prohibited from adding any interest or penalties to your pre-petition debt and can not garnish your wages or place liens on your property . & gt ; & gt ; You can also request that the bankruptcy court make a final determination on the proper amount owed if there is a dispute as to the correct balance of the student loan . & gt ; & gt ; Speak to a Bankruptcy Lawyer Today & gt ; Student Loan Eligibility After Bankruptcy & gt ; & gt ; Generally speaking , a bankruptcy filing will not affect your eligibility for federal student loans . & gt ; & gt ; These government loans are based on need , not credit , and federal lenders are prohibited from denying a student loan solely based on your bankruptcy determination . & gt ; & gt ; However , federal lenders are allowed to consider your credit history since the bankruptcy when determining your willingness to repay the loan . They may also deny a request for further loans if your student loan is in default and not included in a repayment plan . & gt ; & gt ; Private student loan lenders may consider a previous bankruptcy filing when determining eligibility . & gt ; & gt ; Maintaining good credit after bankruptcy , repaying old student loans , and demonstrating a steady income are all factors that could influence a private lender to grant you a student loan even after a bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; A parent 's bankruptcy filing generally does not affect their children 's eligibility for a student loan , unless they are required as a cosigner on the loan . & gt ; & gt ; Debt After Graduation & gt ; & gt ; Of those students who do take out loans to finance their undergraduate education , some studies show that the average student loan debt is $ 20,000 . While most loans allow for a grace period for recent graduates , the likelihood of finding a full-time position that pays well enough for recent graduates to pay their loan bills is becoming increasingly slim . & gt ; & gt ; Advocates for student loan reform say that by eliminating subsidies to private lenders , the government will be able to make more Pell grants for low-income students while offering loans with fairer terms for those who require them . & gt ; & gt ; The above summary is by no means all-inclusive and is not legal advice . For the latest information on bankruptcy and student loans , speak to a bankruptcy attorney in your area . & gt ; & gt ;",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Can you please correct any miss understanding I may have for ZFS and GlusterFS ? Two identical servers with twi drives partitioned with ZFS . We use ZFS because ZFS is a good substitute for LVM , it also incorporates a form if its own version of RAID . But we want to take it a step further and user GlusterFS . We want to do this so we can offer the ZFS drives over the network and but also because we want replication of data in case of a major failure . This way if Server1 is completely destroyed , we can default to Server2 and still have access to the same data stored in the ZFS volumes . And here are my questions , conclusions . - ZFS offers a huge degree of scalability . By adding glusterfs we ensure redundant drives available across the network . - GlusterFS is NOT a filesystem ( like NFS , ext4 etc ) are . It is technology that offers redundancy . - GlusterFS is not to be confused with NFS , even though they are similarities . NFS is a filesystem that is available across the network ( similar as a Samba share ) . It is that and nothing else . On the other hand GlusterFS offers whatever filesystem you want to share ( can be ext4 , ext3 , btrfs ) across the network and it also allows for a huge degree of redundancy .

So if I may let me just say few thoughts as someone who had a rough time , not with addiction but just had a rough path to go through . Going from an addict to going to school for psychiatry is no small feat . You should never ever take for granted where you manage to bring your self to . This kind of stuff does not happen all the time because it is hard and thoughtful work . Never say `` anyone can do it '' . Yes anyone can do it , provided they put an insane amount of work , patience and thought into it ... and that is where the difficulty lies at . It takes one thing to go wrong for something very bad to happen . It takes a million little steps to go right for something good to happen . Do not let anyone , including your self , take that away from you . And just in case you find your self fall flat on your face at some point ldown the road ... let the dust settle for a little bit so you will get your bearings and catch your breath and then get.the.fuck.up pronto and go at it again with twice the tenacity . My hat off to you dude/dudette .",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You see , for me at least , this move that you are doing ( and let 's be clear I have nothing against you , I 'm sure you 're a nice bloke ) , the move that takes us **from what is constitutionally right , to what is politically right , ** Yes , because in this specific paragraph we are talking if Greeks are more or less naive than other nations and if so should people address it by doing an introspection of the events that were unfolded . You mentioned in your previous post `` You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves.. '' You somehow mix expressing one 's political opinion about the competence of the state as being anti-democratic . Now if the people were lied or were told half truths , that is a whole different debate and history will pass its final judgement . & gt ; How is it crass to say that people died in order to have true and proper elections in this country ? You said in your previous post `` but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey '' . & gt ; When it comes to serious issues , I have n't . As we are both members of the human race , allow me to not believe you when you say that you never , ever said in your life a comment that was just sarcastic and with no real substance . & gt ; According to him , all Greek governments are incompetent . That 's a ridiculous claim to make . Even I would n't make that claim . But , the governments , in any country do n't appear out of thin air , people vote for them . So , to say that X government is incompetent , would beg two questions : a ) for whom is this government incompetent and b ) what does this tell us about the electorate ? We are basically saying the same thing . The only difference is I have no qualms in saying the Government is complete idiotic because I do not directly associate the Government with its people . For example , I do not view Greeks are incompetent because they voted for Syriza , even though I view Syriza incompetent . Do I place blame to all of us Greeks for the cluster fuck of the last 45 years ? Yes I do , we should have known better and we did know better but this does n't mean I view Greeks as incompetent . I just view it as Greeks have to get their shit together . & gt ; I challenge you to find a single piece of evidence that the Greek debt was caused by the ordinary Greeks , and not by financial institutions , or dodgy deals . I will argue that financial institutions , or dodgy deals of course are at the core of the problem . However , to say that Greek citizens are not responsible as well is naive . Not paying your taxes , feeding into clientism are two examples of how Greek citizens fucked shit up as well . Of course you can argue that tax evation is a result of Governmental policies which then comes back to what you were saying , people elect their governments and should follow the policies of the Government they elected . If they are not happy then the people should change how things are done , as much as they can because I do realize corporate powers behind the scenes are sometimes extremely powerful .",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves . Every `` red line '' Siriza said would not be crossed , has been crossed . This new deal is even worst than before . Siriza was always saying about plan B and as it turns out it plan B never existed . Does this make Greeks incompetent or naive ? I would say no more than any other country that has been lied to by their politicians . So please , stop taking it so personally . & gt ; I do n't know where you 're from , or in what culture you 've grown in , but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey This is such a crass thing to say . How do you know if people in other countries care less or more about politics in their country ? Do you also understand that people in Democratic societies have shed blood for their right to vote and for their right to be free ? Funny you would mention about New Jersey but ... `` New Jersey played a significant role in the Revolutionary War . George Washington spent more time in New Jersey than anywhere else during the war . New Jersey 's strategic location made it a center of Revolutionary War activity . '' http : //www.revolutionarywarnewjersey.com/ & gt ; And also , perhaps you could have been more respectful to the people that voted for the current government ... ..but what you 're saying is simply ignorant , ridiculous , and **anti-democratic** I do n't understand this . Yes the comment of the previous poster may have been a sarcastic comment with no real substance but tell me who has n't done this before ? Are you going to tell me you have n't done it either ? Also , why do you demand a more respectful tone to what he wants to say ? Why do you view his tone as `` anti-democratic '' ? Why such an attachment to a Government ? As long as no hate speech is involved , who dictates what and how people express themselves . Democracy is messy , it is loud , it is difficult . And you know why it is difficult because we have to put up with each other 's opinions . Show respect how ? By expressing our thoughts in a pre-determined manner which is not `` anti-democratic '' ? Who sets the rules for that ? Do you even understand that Democracy allows for freedom of expression ? Who puts the guideline of what `` anti-democratic '' is ? A sarcastic comment is anti-democratic ? Prehaps a satire is anti-democratic as well ? It appears your post is just pure emotion , the same way Syriza handled the situation with Greece . And just in case you accuse me of being pro ND or pro PASOK , let me stop you by saying that this bullshit for a mess has been brewing up for 40-45 years and to say that Greeks have no responsibility is just naive . Are we to run away from criticizing our selves even if it is in the form of sarcastic comments , satire or just a calm conversation ? How is what the previous poster said `` anti-democratic '' .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,budgetfood,"Total protein is one part of the picture . First of all , 26g of protein is too little for a grown man . There are plenty of articles discussing this issue . Menno Henselmans from Bayesian Bodybuilding has done a [ great review ] ( http : //bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/ ) of the recent literature . The take away message here is that the optimal amount of protein is 1.8g per kg . So compounding that factor in , if a 70kg man only gets his protein from oats he would have to eat 3000 calories worth of oats . Not something that I would call practical or healthy for that matter . Additioally , another factor you do n't take into account is that oats are n't a complete source of protein . For the layman that means that , oats lack some of the essential amino acids and thus they should be paired with a more complete source . So do n't get me started on spinach which has only a measly 3g of protein per 100g . If you have any questions I would be happy to answer and/or provide my references .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,budgetfood,"Curry oatmeal I usually sauté an onion along with a couple of diced mushrooms , then add a teaspoon of turmeric with a pinch of black pepper .

However , think let 's think of another example . Say there is a couple on the night out , and the husband notices someone on another table staring at his wife . He feels jealous and threatened and proceeds to punch the other guy . The husband felt like shit , but was his reaction justified just because he felt that way ?

In this situation some smokers played the victim because they thought that they were being oppressed but in reality , they were being oppressive . Pre ban if you asked someone to blow out their cigarette , it was n't that uncommon to receive a `` go fuck yourself '' as an answer . As far as the other example , I think you are right . However , sometimes our feelings are not justified because , well they are feelings . If I feel I am being controlled , it does n't necessarily mean that I am being controlled .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"There seems to be some short of synergy between instant gratification and avoiding negative emotions .

Then there are others that feel oppressed and make a point by posting videos such as the one in the OP . All play victim in some way or another .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Maybe I was n't clear enough . Let me clarify . Although u/styder_hiru did make a reference to people with mental issues in his post , my answer was directed at the general public . As I said earlier , it would be foolish to blame someone for having a mental health issue . It is n't in their control after all . Reading the original post , you will see that I intentionally did n't make a reference to people with disorders . Rather , I mentioned people with insecurities . Being insecure about yourself is not the same thing as being anorexic . Yes , there is some overlap and people with anorexia display extreme insecurity . But it is more of a spectrum than just absolutes . To conclude , I am more concerned about what can be done with people that sit in the middle of the spectrum , which I feel can help in some capacity .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Okay , I 'll bite . Please , do n't pull a straw man on me . I never said anything about people with an **ongoing** mental issue . These people should be treated by a professional , and obviously not buying magazines is n't going to do them any good . I am not a mental health professional so giving out advice to people that obviously need one would be incredible irresponsible . If you read the original post more carefully you would realise that it mainly targeted people that avoid exercise . Avoiding exercise is not the same as suffering from body dysmorphia . And while we are at it , you might benefit if you see a professional yourself . Blaming projection is a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder . Also , I do n't see any point to continuing answering to you since you seem to want turn this into an argument . I wish you all the best .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Care to elaborate ? I do n't think calling me naive adds anything to the discussion . And as a matter of fact is just a matter of looking away . [ This ] ( https : //link.springer.com/article/10.1176/appi.ap.30.3.257 ) study suggests that exposure to media correlates to negative body image . What the authors suggest is & gt ; `` Parents need to limit children ’ s exposure to media '' . [ Another one ] ( http : //www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144504000737 ) since you might argue that the first one was limited due to sample age . & gt ; `` Exposure to media images of thin-and-beautiful women negatively affects the body image and mood states of young women . '' Totally agree with that . & gt ; `` Media-literacy psychoeducation prior to the media exposure prevented this adverse effect .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"I wholeheartedly care about my friends . So I find no reason to be a prick about it . We tend to be quite stubborn when we have our backs on the wall , so that 's another reason not to pressure them . As I said , the point of the OP was to determine what 's the best course of action when they are in denial . Both the industry as well as the media , push the people in one direction or another . There is no incentive in that other than profit . Feelgood generates publicity for the media , twinkies make money for the sugar lobby . That 's one thing though . People tend to blame others for their maladies . For example , they keep blaming muscle magazing for their unrealistic standards . Well then , do n't buy that magazine . How is the magazine hurt by you not working out ? When smoking on public spaces was banned in my country , many smokers would bitch that society should be more tolerant and that the government was infringing their rights . Talk about victim complex . In the end , I fully agree with you that corporations carry a part of the burden . But nobody should be absolved from personal responsibility .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"You hit it on the head . While I did research the issue on the context of health I could n't find anything relevant , even on scholar .

AgentErgoloid,Xiaomi,"Hey there everyone , I got my Mi5 a couple of weeks ago . I flashed Slim7 , but right now I use the latest Lineage OS as my daily driver . Although , user experience has been great I faced a bug in both ROM which I believe is firmware related , but I do n't really have a solution . I am not sure if it happened in stock , but in both custom ROMs that I used , sometimes the capacitive keys ( back and recents ) would stop working . This happened every 5 minutes or so and it only gets fixed if I lock and unlock the device or if I navigate to somewhere else , hence the reason I believe this is software related . I did a bit of digging around and some people who were also affected by this concluded that might have to do with certain panels being incompatible the kernel , since Xiaomi uses both LGD and JDI panels for the Mi5 . Has anybody managed to solve this issue ? A workaround would to enable on screen navigation but I would prefer not to . Cheers !",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Abstract Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass . Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs , the principle of specificity , which states that adaptations are specific to the nature of the applied stimulus , dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others . Research is lacking , however , as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains . The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program versus a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects . 17 young men were randomly assigned to either an HT group that performed 3 sets of 10RM with 90 seconds rest or an ST group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with 3 minutes rest . After 8 weeks , no significant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii . Significant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat . In conclusion , this study showed both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size , but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24714538/",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,chemhelp,"My textbook suggests that there are three factors that determine how good a leaving group is and these are size , electronegativity and reasonance . Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom . On the other hand Iodine while less electronegative , is much larger than Fluoride . I understand that if we were to compare two anions of the same size but with different electronegativities the one with the higher electronegativity would be more stable because it has a higher affinity for electrons and thus is `` happier '' to have a negative charge . I also understand that larger atoms are able to stabilise the charge better than smaller ones . But why is the later effect stronger than the former ?

AgentErgoloid,PickAnAndroidForMe,"A little background information . Currently I have a nokia N8 which has served pretty good for the last couple of years . However a couple of days ago its digitizer stopped functioning . I am working on fixing this sooner or later but I thought to my self that maybe it is time to buy a new phone since I wan na test out android to see if it is so great as everybody is hyping it up . So I did my research and found out that the best bang for my buck would be a Nexus 4 . It seems like that its specs are a significant upgrade to the N8 I have now . The only thing that bothers me is that it has a glass back . Anyway , after careful thinking I got to the conclusion that I might as well buy nexus 7 or 10 instead of nexus 4 and keep the N8 to make phone calls and send texts . Also , it is worth to notice that I used my N8 mostly to surf the net and read PDFs ( which was n't easy considering that the screen is pretty narrow and it takes about 30s to `` flip '' a page ) . Which of the above devices do you think would be the best suggestion for me ?",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,techsupport,"I have been having my N8 since it came out and I have been very pleased with it . There were some hiccups here and there but nothing too serious . A couple of months ago though my touch screen would stop responding and my phone would need a restart in order to function properly again . It did n't freeze , it just would n't respond to touch input . The physical keys worked fine and I was even able to open the task manager ( albeit I could n't shut down any application ) or open the camera app . This would happen 2-3 times per week and a simple restart would always solve it . However that was n't the case yesterday . At some point during the night I woke up and decided to set my alarm because I had forgotten doing so earlier . At this point the very same problem that I describe above happened again . Not thinking much about it , I thought that a simple restart would solve it as per usual . That was n't the case though . Even after restarting the phone the problem persisted . I then decided to try and hold the power button for 10s until the phone vibrated three times . To my surprise , it was n't effective even thought whatever problem occured in the past would always be resolved that way . Next up , I decided that I should try and back up the phone data , before trying anything else . Thankfully I did n't face any problem during the procedure and I was able to back up everything . The next two things on my list were the 3 button hard reset and a firmware downgrade . None of these things proved to be effective . I am thinking that this is related to faulty hardware , and more specifically faulty digitizer . What are your thoughts about this issue ? Thanks a lot .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,ecr_eu,"Lately I 've been trying to break into the eliquid sector by approaching shop owners , sadly there is no appreciation for creativity since most of them ask for clones . Risk aversion is a constant as they do n't have much room for error , in case a batch does n't have the expected sales . But this is completely understandable . Times are tough . I did some digging a while back for an unrelated purchase . Turns out that because ELTA has n't been profitable for some time now , they outsourced custom checking to a private company . So this where the additional 15 EUR go to , if an item is taxed ( 15 EUR plus 24 % VAT for items deemed to worth between 22 and 1000 EUR , if my memory serves me right ) . I do n't know exactly what 's their policy regarding specific item categories , but for what is worth there was a post about a month old , on a very well known Greek technology related forum , that some guy stated that he was taxed around 50 EUR for a bunch of comic books . The original price was below 20 EUR . There was another guy on the same thread , who was also called to pay an additional 50 EUR for 3 or 4 video game cartridges . He also , originally paid below 20 . In case you can provide proof that the item cost you less , than what they estimated , you can apply for a second check . But it takes about a month and it will cost you an additional 10 EUR , however there is a chance that you wo n't be charged since the law has gone back and forth a couple of times already . If your order comes from an EU member state , then forget everything I said . On the other hand , if it comes from a elsewhere , prepare for a long wait and additional fees .

If you put a bucket of warm water outside , and that warm water just happened to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit , but the outdoor temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit , the water would cool down . That 's because the outdoor temperature , while still warm , is cooler than the temperature of the water . Heat naturally flows from warmer places to cooler places . The heat 's `` goal '' is to reach equilibrium–a state where everything is the same temperature as everything that surrounds it . That 's why a hot bowl of soup or a cold glass of soda will eventually reach room temperature if you leave them out long enough . The difference between you and a bucket of water ( well , one of many differences ) is that your body is constantly generating more heat . All that heat has to go somewhere , so it tries to escape through your skin .

AgentErgoloid,HomeworkHelp,I 'll give you an answer to your first question since the same principles apply to the second . First things first . You will have to convert pKa to Ka . In order to do this you will need to antilog 4.76 . Ka=10^-pka -- & gt ; Ka=10^-4.76 -- & gt ; Ka=1.74*10^-5 From there on you can calculate the concentration of H3O^+ . Ka = [ CH3COO^- ] [ H3O^+ ] / [ CH3COOH ] [ CH3COO^- ] = [ H3O^+ ] = x [ CH3COOH= 0.28-x at this point you can assume tha 0.28-x≈0.28 thus : Ka=x^2 /0.28 -- & gt ; 1.74*10^-5 *0.28 = x^2 -- & gt ; 4.87 * 10^-6 = x^2 -- & gt ; x=sqrt ( 4.87 * 10^-6 ) -- & gt ; x= 2.2 * 10^-3 Now that you know the concentration of hydronium cation you can calculate the pH since : pH= -log [ H3O^+ ] pH=-log ( 2.2 * 10^-3 ) -- & gt ; pH= 2.66,Greek,Greek

Think about it . Caffeine has a half life of 5 hours , however you need cease consuming it for a couple of days in order for your tolerance to reach zero . So what does exactly happen when you develop tolerance for a given substance ? The brief answer would be that the system being targeted ( receptor ) downregulates itself .

The phenomenon mentioned above happens due to homeostasis . * *Homeostasis* Homeostasis , also spelled homoeostasis or homœostasis ( from Greek : ὅμοιος , `` hómoios '' , `` similar '' , and στάσις , stásis , `` standing still '' ) , is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant .

I for one find the situation unfortunate , but dont see any `` dreamleague dictatorship '' .

Aglarod,DotA2,"would you have refused to play on scheduled time because you lacked full roster while the opposing team was ready to go ? Would n't you say you screwed your opponents over because of bad time management of your teams activities ?

Aglarod,wow,"Lets be real for a minute . No matter the stupidity that is doing it on stream , imagine how it feels that your character you spent years building and getting items and achievements is now `` gone '' . Yes i understand that they `` promote '' this behavior . As if people arent doing that shit already and have since forever , most of us played on friends accounts once or twice - maybe not for boosting but farming/powerleveling . It seems the punishment is heavily disproportionate to the crime . You wan na make an example ? ban them for a season , two seasons , from next years blizzcon participation even , but permaban is taking it too far . Not to mention that its not a smart move , because while people wont stop subbing over this , it definitely leaves a bad impression . Plus those guys are huge advertisers for wow , with streams that hit tens of thousands of viewers regularly . And i would think they wont be too quick to buy new accounts and play wow again .",Greek,Greek

I cant really post armory right now , might edit it in later",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,wow,"Probably because a number of skills i was very used to in raids ( eternal flame , light of dawn ) now have significant cast times . My main ability ( holy/divine light ) is a very slow cast and does not feel very rewarding either . i just dont feel like im doing much .

Aglarod,DotA2,"I disagree quite a lot . Its a matter of opinions in the end , but i think Slacks is overly loud , meme-circlejerk absorbed and honestly , very much controlling of his interviewees . I often get the feeling he wants to make the interview about himself , and tries to spin it to be `` fun '' ( cringeworthy ) for the chat , ultimately shifting focus from the players .

Congrats to EG , and wp CDEC for giving us an entertaining and competitive final",Greek,Greek

Mid-fight level ups are not uncommon , and 2 stat points can make or break a fight , an experienced player should have the presence of mind to skill it in fight , and that should give him an edge .

Aglarod,DotA2,"Oh boy finally , i was thinking of getting in the business myself sometime and really wan na read some advice Below are just suggestions , if anyone disagrees/wants to correct something please do so 1 . Enforce an age limit of sorts . You dont want kids coming in to play for free/yelling etc . Also keep in mind that some games attract younger people ( a.k.a league usually attracts non adults ) and you might not want that in a place that serves alcohol and whatnot Honestly , PCS for players in a bar is not a good idea , Consoles on the other hand would probably work well but w/e floats your boat . My suggestion would be to instead get some old ( or new ) arcade game machines ( Street fighter /MK/R-Type etc. ) . 2 . If you set up PCS , make sure at least the towers are in a spot where they wont be accidentally showered with a drink or something 3 . Dont focus too much on gaming ( basically , dont make it awkward ) and alienate other potential customers , though thats something really subjective . 4 . Better forgo that dungeon crawling idea and replace it with a shooter theme . That means CSGO , Battlefield , CoD and/or whatever else you want . I dont know if its legal , or you would have to negotiate a deal with twitch/streamers w.e . but watching those things in a bar with the goal of making money might be a legally different situation from watching at home , dont really know 5. maybe get a barman/bartender to make you some game related drinks . ( There have been some pokemon related stuff going around on the web ) . Nothing much . Just 2-3 game inspired drinks ( Think `` clarity potion '' etc . ) . As for food , you do not really need to go that far . Just the usual stuff that would accompany a cold beer Tournament nights are your best weapon in this business , especially you combine them with some cool stuff like raffles , giveaways or even allow people to bet on matches ( dont know what you would reward them with though ) .Make sure your place has online presence and advertise your pubstomps frequently ( fb page , maybe twitter ) . Anyway best of luck to you , hope your business goes well",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,gaming,"Well having read this review and watched TB 's video about it , i 'd say that its definitely not 3.5 , its higher , dont know by how much though . In the video , Thief ( PC Version ofc ) was reported having extremely smooth performance and you could see the PC port was amazing . Truth be told , most game reviews are as biased as the reviewer and in many cases rushed and exaggerated . This game clearly is not deserving of such low rating , and this for me means egmnow is not really a site i should consult in the future",Greek,Greek

I open TL every day when i sit on my pc and check what sc2 and d2 streams are going on and pick one of them . I check for any good articles on d2 and sc2 both .

Now as girls get into it , someone who wants to swear can do so with a wider vocabulary , and he uses it . Simple as that My point is , its just insulting , it wont get better no matter how many banhammers drop . No need to go on crusades about it , just ignore it and do your thing .

The map felt considerably smaller , it seemed like ganks came out of nowhere , even though wards were up i did not notice stuff that in wc3 i would see in a split second . Teamfights also were too chaotic at start but i had expected that . Of course it was all a matter of adjusting and now i think d2 is vastly superior , but those first days it felt like playing dota2 made me worse at the game",Greek,Greek

I actually did not see it discussed on the dota2 subreddit ( and to be honest its nothing new to the scene ) , which is why i did n't edit it in the news thread.They did make a pretty big issue out of it though so if someone considers it newsworthy you might as well add it . The statements in question : http : //i.imgur.com/5N4Tx3d.png",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Draskyl should be there ( and yes i know why he declined ) , cant believe he wont be at TI while a bunch of `` community figures '' will",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,n0tail cast is very good . Cast was also very good before n0tail . I dont think anything needed to be salvaged,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Its a nice concept but there is something about adding so many `` conveniences '' to the game that i dont like ... An experienced player can manage his inventory in a fast and efficient manner , hence he gets a fair advantage over an inexperienced player . Its a good idea , would not like it to be in the game though",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Its a matter of practice . Also everything you do while playing is part of the game and it should rightfully require an amount of skill to execute,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Sweden is great and Mason is an asshole . He did have one point down though . Most swedes i talk to online automatically think they are superior to others . ( Master race and all that shit ),Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,i remember there was a time where everybody wanted to beat up babyknight because he was a huge flamer/dick.They would wait for him at LANS . Mason seems to be walking down that path,Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,Tasteless fuck yea,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Maybe it was great for a chinese fan , but for us europeans/americans it didnt mean much . We were not emotionally invested and personally i just wanted to enjoy some good games without getting anxious about a team i support . But , we didnt even get good games . Not that its anybody 's fault , boring finals happen all the time in other sports/esports ( mainly starcraft 4-0 and 4-1 sweeps ) , it was about time we had one as well .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Nobody is discrediting newbee , but you cant force people to like or admire something . Yes they won , congratulations . People showed manners and gave them applause , chanted their name , and all was good , but thats it . In the end it was a boring series and an anticlimactic finale to the season",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"This is gold Maybe you should link it to d2 subreddit or something , people ask but dont know where to find this",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I think he said something similar last year ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Fucking perfect , immensely entertaining cast , i love it Some guys in chat and here need to chill though . So much butthurt , if you dont like it close the stream . Almost every cast nowadays caters to people who dont know enough about the game , and when something like this pops up they cry and yell because they are not being spoonfed tedious info , graphs and stats again and again . I for one welcome this , its not like it happens often , or in grand finals .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Will we have to subscribe to TB 's channel to access vods ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Point is , you will not find yourself in those annoying situations if you manage your inventory properly-which is something you have to learn . Everything that happens after loading is dota . Courier handling , buying items , swapping items , everything . Yes , Experience should give an advantage via mechanics . Inventory management IS mechanics",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,DotA2,"Na'vi , or whatever team Fear plays on , which i guess now is no team . I used to really dislike navi , was a huge MYM fan back in dota1 , when Mym vs navi was `` el classico '' ( F4F 3.5 finals anyone ? ) . At TI1 i was rooting for online kingdom but that team disbanded , so i basically thought navi was the best of the `` old '' players , plus if it wasnt for them at TI2 china would still be laughing at us",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Yep , plus it will show koreans what dota 2 actually is , it kinda seems most gamers do not know much about it still . The prestige of TI ( and the incredibly huge prizepool ) will attract more korean teams , and gamers will follow suit",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"I like the daily challenge , the remodel and the A-Z other than that pretty underwhelming , which is ok. Those are optional stretch goals , we dont have to reach them . In the end i got a relatively cheap compendium and i d say with the current unlocks its already worth its cost.Anything more is a bonus , if we reach it cool , if not , no problem",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"yes , he said `` soon ''",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"we frontpage now boys Also this looks great , seems like a very high skillcap game",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,aww,"The host of that place and owner of the studio brand used to work as a caster/commentator for ESL , plus some other stuff for years . He decided to invest in this and produce `` shows '' . Pretty damn good shows , also he managed a team of other casters/commentators booked theme events and such Another guy used to code tools for a game called dota 2 , they liked his work , invited him to the `` world cup '' for casting and then hired him . Point is , years of 8-5 jobs before they ended up there . Of course luck helps , right place at the right time with the right skills and all that .",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,thegdstudio,Sheever is not part of the studio though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Amen , same here",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Chances are they simply do not want to risk it . Their bootcamp doesnt start until later in June , it would make sense to play it safe and buy as much time possible for his arm to recover fully . Also , i dont think alex garfield really wants to field his team without fear , he is an important `` persona '' if you may , after the free to play documentary , its the kind of thing that creates storylines ( and brings in money )",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I dont think what 2gd said then and puppey now are comparable to be honest . I also thought 2GD 's joke was very funny and people get offended too easily . Puppey was straight rude though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I really hope this isnt true but if it is ... . i understood EG 's predicament when they released Idra but if they actually use Fear 's injury as an excuse i cant even imagine the backlash if proof gets out,Greek,Greek

AlexBrallex,worldnews,"The minorities did nothing wrong , they were just being minorities , of course they rioted because of the harsh conditions and their religion . At the time super powers ( christians ) were at a war against ottoman empire . So I guess for the turks to get at peace they had to cleanse muslim turkey from christians to erridicate their problems they had against the super powers . But I see it as a very wrong move from the turks to commit genocides against its own people , there could have been better ways . It kinda has been the nature of the turks , since the turks started occupy other countries they 've been known how barbaric they 've been against christians . Killing many , abducted children to fight for them . One reason for the bosnians to convert was this , so the turks would be easier on them at the time ( and tax reasons ) , but serbs took it very wrong . Remember that turks were almost like mongols ( culturally/warfare ) before they 've established real kingdoms , no wonder they happened to have an aggressive nature ( my point of view )",Greek,Greek

AlexBrallex,worldnews,"My first paragraph was the answer of your questions . & gt ; And why do they not constitute genocide ? There is no aswer to this.. Because there was never a slaughter against turks at a scale that can be labeled as a genocide . Turks usually were taken prisoners , those being killed in the war had the unfortunate to do so . But were never systematically slaughtered by other factors , **understand that** . Compare it like what the Nazis did to the Jews and other minorities , less gas more bullets . So yeah , people have sure have grudge against Turks . My family/roots being partly from Trabzon/Sinope area , did experience the slaughter . Many had never had the oppurtunity to leave , before being slaughtered . & gt ; Thank you for 3 passive-aggressive paragraphs full of racism Sorry I did n't want to make it passive-aggressive , just wanted to state that how it was or how it was mostly seen by people . & gt ; it 's likely that many of my ancestors were Christian at some point Can be very true , because modern turks are a blend from everything they came in contact with , and you can see similarities from western turks ( in Turkey ) with some Europeans . & gt ; So that Turks no longer are so much like Mongols should tell you about how inclusive and accepting the Turkish culture was Turkish culture **HAD** to adopt to become a well functioning kingdom/empire , cause unlike the nomad-life it is n't very stable and do n't tend to last long . Just look how the Seljuk ( semi-nomadic ) crumbled and the Mongol Empire ( but there were other factors as it was too big ) .",Greek,Greek
