The extreme left btw not so much - that\\ 's the reason why Nicaragua didn\\'t accept the deal - it didn\\'t go far enough for them . \\n\\n\\nIt\\ 's just the far right nationalists under trump ( and Everyhwere else too ) who don\\'t agree - but that\\ 's the problem - Nationalists will never say a multi national deal is a good deal - since it\\ 's diametral to their agenda of \ '' xyz first\ '' - the idea of a greater good between nations just doesn\\'t exist in their vocabulary . \\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,So you want results that are worth it ? Like a total reduction in climate change ? Not a rise in average temperature at all but a decline.\\n\\nSee basically no problem . It just won\\'t work - cause for this to happen the carbon emissions would have to sink even more then planned in the Paris accord . \\n\\nEspecially by developing nations - basically meaning that they would either need to forgo development of their nations and revert to being even poorer then now - or an even bigger financial burden on the guys with money ( so us ) to help them meet their energy needs without carbon emitting fuels . \\n\\nPlus - at the same time the developed world would need to cut back even more radical - and that\\ 's not a question of \ '' we need to bring more electric cars on the street and shut down coal\ '' - then the goal would be - no cars other the electric and shut down gas too.\\n\\nThis deal is the best that is available at the moment - and it actually got possible cause green energy generations is making huge steps forward especially in developing nations - a reduction would need even more and actually brutal policies - which no nation would go for . \\n\\nSo yeah - the stabilization of global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels is a huge thing -\\nJust to compare - if nothing is done it will ( depending on the model ) raise by 4.5-5C in 2100 - and if you belive that we have mass migration now - wait till 1/4-1/3 of Asia is uninhabitable and the Sahara stretches to the Congo .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Russia gets this \ '' bonus\ '' cause it closed\\nPretty much all it\\ 's dirty industry after the fall\\nOf communism.\\n\\nChina and India get their bonus cause otherwise they would not be on board at all - but they are actually doing something - India has shelved its plans for more coal power plants and china has done the same and will in fact close down several beginning this year.\\n\\nWhich leaves the biggest point why one is against it the redestribution of wealth - that\\ 's the real reason why you don\\'t like it right ? Why should we give any of our hard earned cash to those people . \\n\\nWell the reason is very simple - take hurricane season - I think there is no doubt that global warming influences the strength of hurricane which hit the US every year - and\\nThey are getting stronger and the season is getting longer . \\nKatrina cost 150 billion $ - not including 120 billion federal aid\\n\\nOne hit like Katrina costs the US economy more then all the transfers that happen In the Paris accord over the next decades . \\n\\nAnd those will get more and more common . \\n\\nSame with rising sea levels - at the moment it\\ 's just a problem for Nauru - but soon it will become a problem for cities like Miami and states like Florida - which will need to invest billions into flood protection . \\n\\nAnd then we have displaced persons - large parts of Mexico will become uninhabitable for humans due to the increase of arid climate conditions - same with conditions in the Sahel zone in Africa and large parts of Central Asia . \\n\\nAll this will lead to mass migration which we haven\\'t seen since the fall of the Roman Empire . \\n\\nAnd all this will be way more expansive then transferring a bit of wealth now.\\n\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,The idea is to stop global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels - which is doable and will hold the worst symptoms at a manageable level . \\n\\nSure if you want to reverse the warming which has already happend - then it would mean investing more money and even harsher rules for carbon emissions in developed countries - but it would also mean telling 6 billion people \ '' sorry guys can\\'t have what we have - for at least 50\\nMore years\ '' \\n\\nSo yeah while the accord is not perfect - it\\ 's a step in the right direction - especially since most countries are going along with it . \\n\\nAnd sorry - just saying \ '' it\\ 's not good enough that\\ 's why we can\\'t accept it\ '' is a bad argument - cause it means that nothing will happen which will make it even worse in the long run . \\n\\nThis is the best option at the moment - finely balanced between the developed nations need and want to stop global warming for the reasons I said - and the developing worlds need for energy and well - development . \\n\\nI don\\'t know if you have ever been to china -\\nBut if you ever go - take a train and look out of the window at night - whole villages in darkness with just one or two light bulbs here and there . A stark contrast to shanghai or Guangzhou . \\n\\nSo the want they have a \ '' modern\ '' live to is hard to limit - and china tried the would have the next revolution at hand . Something we all don\\'t want for various reasons . Same\\nIn India . \\n\\nAnd thats why a certain leeway in their goals was searched for and found . \\n\\nIt\\ 's not perfect - but it can acchieve the set goal -,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,No what is the deal ? \\n\\nI mean the real goal of trump - what does he want - not a general guide to negotiations - what does he want / or what shall be written in a new agreement ? \\n\\nA general guide to negotiations is pretty useless - I want an idea what he / you want in the new deal - \\n\\nLet me guess - not much is coming ? Cause you have no idea besides \ '' a more fair one\ '' - so what is a fair deal ? How much does the US have to cut their emissions ? How much does china have to ? Who pays for clean energy incentives in developing countries ? \\n\\nPlease - just general outlines - and not \ '' read up how to make a deal\ '' - cause that is pretty useless in this discussion .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"I actually read it.\\n\\nBut there is nothing substantial - noting that says \ '' this is our plan\ '' - except that it will be fair and if it doesn\\'t work then to hell with it.\\n\\nI mean I am used to it from trump - but well - I expected more - I expected at least a goal - a post that says \ '' this is what we want instead\ '' but all\\nHe says is \ '' we want a better deal , and if we don\\'t get it we will continue as before and endanger ourselves cause we can\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's a bit childish . But ok.\\n\\nIt\\ 's grandstanding and blustering with no substance behind .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"Look I have closed contracts / deals . It\\ 's part of my job . \\n\\nAnd if it was just a Buisness deal I would agree - it\\ 's like 101y\\n\\nBut this is not a Buisness deal - he has to come out and give some idea what he wants - cause if he just says \ '' hey we want a fair deal\ '' everybody else will say \ '' well this is a fair deal\ '' and this is not some negotiation about some property on the upper east side.\\n\\nThese are negotiations with nearly 200 countries - all with their own interests and agendas - so just saying \ '' we want a fair deal\ '' won\\'t cut it - he has to have some ideas what he wants , lay out plans , set agendas - in short be constructive - but from what I have seen the last 5 months he can\\'t do\\nThat - all he can do is deconstruct and dismantle . \\n\\nI am not even sure if he grasp that this isn\\'t a 0 - sum problem - this is not a about \ '' I give you , you have more , I have less\ '' this is about creating something for the greater good which in the end will benefit everyone - and especially so the US and developed nations cause our wealth is incredibly endangered by global warming even if we don\\'t see it . \\n\\nAt the moment we can buy our way out and maybe enjoy longer summers - but this will end pretty soon for reasons I have mentioned above ( or maybe elsewhere - not sure about my comment trail ) \\n\\nAnyways - he won\\'t come forward with anything substantial - cause the moment he does he would have to leave his zero sum logic behind - and that\\ 's something I am not sure he can . \\n",Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're not taking into account most trade wars are tit-for-tat . \\n\\ni know - but the 6 % in trade that will partly be lost ( not totally just partly ) will not hurt the EU in total . Switzerland is bound to loose more and sooner or later its population will accept that . might be later though . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm not Swiss , but that is just plain wrong \\n\\nNo actually i am right . Lets just look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss \\n\\nTrue - and as soon as they start the feel that their products \ '' Made in CH\ '' are less cost competitive ( due to renewed certification for example needed to sell in the EU ) they will ramp up their production in the EU plants and cool down production in their swiss plants . Those are multinationals . They are not bound by borders where they produce and in large parts the infrastructure is already in place . \\n\\n & gt ; Nestle \\n\\nThe same in food . Of the 340.000 employees of Nestle 8900 work in Switzerland . Nearly half of those 9000 work in the HQ and research divisions in Switzerland . So if it gets harder to sell Swiss made Nesquik in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg - they will simply ship french made there . The bottom line wont be touched . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R & amp ; D as Germany , so there are a lot of research based companies there as well \\n\\nAbsolutley true . But if you look at the why that is - you will find that CH profited extremly from several EU programs which they were part of so far . Programs in which swiss participation or the negotiation about that have already been shelved as a result of this vote . If it stays like that expect this ratio to go down south pretty fast . \\n\\n & gt ; but Switzerland does produce things.\\n\\nnever said that they dont . \\n\\nI said that a lot of the stuff they do produce is mass produced and can be produced in the EU as well . Nobody is doing it now since the swiss have the market cornered . But if they cant offer their services to a competitive price anymore - well lets just say that new options arise .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,& gt ; Do you expect me to have a full list of Swiss products ? \\n\\nno that would be ridiculous . But lets have a look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland is leading in tunnel construction\\n\\nNot so much . Switzerland does built a lot of Tunnels . True . The companies that built them are not only swiss though . For example the Gotthard Base Tunnel is built by a consortium of 3 non swiss and 2 swiss companies . \\n\\n & gt ; exports specialties such as chocolate and cheese\\n\\nso does belgium . Plus chocolate exports are 650 Mio . \u20ac out of 90 Billions . Doesnt really count much . And chocolate is not really hard to produce . The last major technological advancement ( and the reason for swiss dominance in this field for a long time ) was the conche - but it was invented / discovered more then 100 years ago . \\n\\nAgricultural goods actually account for 1.5 % of the exports to the EU from Switzerland . \\n\\nAnd belive me - if Lindt looses buisness from this - they will start the produce \ '' as good as swiss chocolate\ '' in the EU . \\n\\n & gt ; is an important manufacturer of medical products and chemicals\\n\\nabsolutely no doubt about that . But chemicals can be produced anywhere in the EU . and when it comes to pharmaceuticals - If the guillotine clause is invoked they have to be recertified in the EU - a long and expansive endeavour . So why should Roche and all the others not just produce in the EU and get rid of that pesky little problem . \\n\\n & gt ; their research and development in all kinds of areas is outstanding.\\n\\ntrue - but as we speak here it seems that the EU already has stopped negotiation for the horizon program with Switzerland . a program ( which if as successful as its predecessor ) would bring nearly 2.5x the amount of money to swiss universities and research institutions as the swiss paid into the pot.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's pretty sweeping and simplified remark to say that we can simply copy these products and do without their R & amp ; D. This will also be painful for the EU.\\n\\nWe dont have to copy . The products already exist . What will be painful ( for some maybe ) is a bit less competition . But thats it . And when it comes to R & amp ; D ? The swiss research facilities are good - no question . But the money that fed them so far stays and will just be redistributed to other institutes within the EU . I wouldnt worry so much about that .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Please give me a list . \\n\\nOr just some examples . Of goods that are or can only be produced in Switzerland . No doubt that they exist . But they are only a tiny fraction of the 90 billion \u20ac export volume Switzerland has to the EU at the moment . \\n\\nBut lets have a look at what is the main mass of export goods from CH to the EU . \\n\\nMore then 50 % of the export goods fall into this categories : \\n\\nChemicals and related products - & gt ; so chemicals produced in large quanties and pharmaceutical products ( which can be produced anywhere in the world and which will have the additional hurdle of EU recertification if it comes to the worst ) \\n\\nManufactured goods classified chiefly by material - & gt ; which encompasses everything from simple plastics to High Technology goods . There is also office / telecom equipment in this category . While i guess that there will be some companies that produce unique goods in this category most of it can and is produced by other companies in the EU already . \\n\\nMachinery and transport equipment : Same as above . There might be some swiss companies that produce very specialised goods in this category . But most of it will be run of the mill more or less standard goods that can be bought from numerous sources in the EU . \\n\\nSwitzerland and swiss goods are not unique . ( well most are not ) and thus can be replaced . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Oh yeah . Absolutely . I am just saying that this could prove to be the classic example of why the will of the majority is not always the most beneficial way to follow . Depends on the EU reaction . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Not really : \\n\\nAs i stated above : \\n\\nActually they are the 4th largest ( 6.6 % of the trade ) \\n\\nWith an import volume of 121 Billion \u20ac and an export volumen of 90 Billion \u20ac.\\n\\nBut see - This doesnt matter so much . Since the import volume wont shrink - they still need the stuff we produce and at the moment they cant get it cheaper form a third source cause if they could they would buy it there.\\n\\nBut the export volume will shrink once the free market clauses get axed . \\n\\nIt will simply make buying stuff made in Switzerland more expansive then buying the same stuff from within the EU Market.\\nAnd they are not producing anything ( besides watches maybe ) that cant be produced at similar costs in the EU or worldwide.\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Thats fine . But i think that treaties are there to be kept - and as such the guillotine clause should be invoked by the EU . \\n\\nThey can have their opinion - no problem . But they have to live with the consequences .,Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,I wouldn\\'t say thought in school or that it is something that comes up in a conversation . For me it always seemed as if all girls know that there is a plan B that is an option - more so then in Austria for example where people often \ '' go on holidays\ '' to have an abortion - in the small village of my granny \ '' she went on a weekend trip to Vienna\ '' sometimes was really known to be code for \ '' getting an aboftion\ '',Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,There is a difference between \ '' not talking about it\ '' and \ '' if I do it I will go to hell\ '' - for example it is still hard for people in western Austria to find doctors who will perform aboftions - those people generally had to travel to Vienna until a few years ago . \\n\\nThis was as far as I know never a problem in the Eastern European states .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,It\\ 's a bit of carelessness cause you have the option abortion on the table and not just as a sort of last resort . \\n\\nMy ex was Romanian and although she was a very responsible girl wen it came to sex and contraceptives this carefulness was gone . It came to weird situations were she basically said \ '' lets fuck\ '' and I said \ '' we can\\'t cause no condoms\ '' and she responded with \ '' no worries abortions are cheap\ '' - well not word for word - but that\\ 's the mindset . \\n\\nIt\\ 's just a totally different view on the whole abortion debate that is going on there . Except of Poland - but that is a very special case on itself .,Germanic,German

There is no other option . \\n\\nItalians produced about [ 500 kg of trash per year / person ] ( http : //www.nationmaster.com/country/it-italy/env-environment ) in 2000 ( i doubt it got significantly less ) . So even if we apply the 85 % top rate that leaves 75 kg . of trash per person per year ( in reality as shown above its about 300 kg ) . Which means that a city like Parma would still produce 14.000 tons of trash per year which is not going to be recycled . ( In reality its more like 56.000 tons ) \\n\\nSo question : Where do you put that . \\n\\nAnd if you say \ '' Well we simply have to recycel 100 % - Sure i agree . But its not gon na happen soon .

Autogegner,europe,"Had there not been the immigration of 2015 , Hofer would not have gotten that far . The problem has reached a size , where public security can not be guaranteed any more in certain areas of the major towns , i.e . near the main station in Innsbruck . Noone wanted to allow nearly unlimmited immigration and there is zero understanding for paying immigrants who had gone through the asylum procedure as much as someone who is unemployed or more than conscripts in the army or the civil service and most students have.\\n\\nIf we would not have had the problem of too much immigration , the FP\u00d6 would not have gotten into that position .

Autogegner,europe,"The FP\u00d6 in its current form results mostly from J\u00f6rg Haider , who had studied the american far-right , i.e . Newt Gingrich in order to copy their platforms . Haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring .

Autogegner,europe,"Van der Bellen is clearly the better choice . In order to explain , i copy a previous comment of mine : \\n\\nHofer ( the right wing candidate ) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that Hofer and his supporters have shown . They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . At first , they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia . In the later phase of the campaign , they started calling VdB a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia ) and a neoliberal.\\n\\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . In an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel . The TV station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed . He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . He was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . A few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . When beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\\n\\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \ '' lies\ '' when VdB started citing him . There is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking Austria as a hostage with him.\\n\\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is , that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia . Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria . Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago .",Germanic,German

Autogegner,europe,"& gt ; As for his motivation , Assad has a long and well documented history of using fear to control the population.\\n\\nThe government does not require any other fear than that of the rebells winning . Assad still has widespread support . Despite predictions about a mass exodus from Aleppo in case of the expulsion of Al-Nusra , nothing like this happened . Before Aleppo was completely retaken , rumors of attrocities were spread in the media - 500.000 civilians were said to be starving , civilians were claimed to be murdered , so called \ '' activists\ '' were calling for a military intervention . Aleppo was retaken and none of these claims was ever attempted to be proven . The media and political instances have gone silent on Aleppo . I didn\\'t hear a single report about the per estimations 1 million people fleeing from the rebell-controlled parts of Aleppo , when it was still safely held by the so called Opposition . At no point did the media or the political decission makers complain about people having to flee from rebell-controlled areas , rebells calling for genocides against non-Sunnites . Before the insurgency , Syria was a mostly functioning state where people of various ethnic background could coexist . Neither the EU , the US or any single EU state have ever voiced concern about the cleansing of rebell-held areas from non-Sunnites . The \ '' people are scared of the Assad-Regime\ '' narrative only works , if the character of the insurgents is overlooked : They are sunnite extremists whose mission is to terrorise anyone who does not belong to their own sect . For the same reason , the christian population in Iraq has nearly vanished and due to similar motivations , the Lebanese Civil War has lead to a shrinking of non-Sunnite demographics . \\n\\nAny reason that could be given as a motivation for the government to conduct such an attack could also be used if such an attack was conducted in a planned manner . Southwards of the village in question , Rebels tried to push into the city of Hama two weeks ago . Taking Homs would allow the Rebels to reconnect to their areas between Homs and Hama . If chemical warfare agents were deployed , it would make much more sense to do so in an area where they would be of use and allow ground troops to take areas cleared of enemies . The insurgents on the other hand have much more reason to release toxic gas in an area held by them . For months , they have been asking for military action of western troops against the government . This time , they finally got it . However , it\\ 's not been the first time , The US supplied anti vehicle missiles to what they called the \ '' Free Syrian Army\ '' and an air raid conducted by american aircraft against the government held town of Deir-Ez-Zor that allowed Daesh to advance only happend a few months ago .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"A Financial Transaction Tax does not need to be very large to be effective . It simply needs to be large enough dissuade trading for gambling\u2019s sake but not so large it dissuades socially necessary business.\\nNaturally , it\u2019s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax in a way that it is harmonized across many markets . However , it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations . Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral . In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one . Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.\\n\\nIf the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT , the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous , volatile transactions towards other markets . Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile , so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets , which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.\\n\\nNaturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe . Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading . But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT ( but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized ) .\\n\\nAs far as Sweden goes , my understanding of Sweden\u2019s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected , they were less severely effected that less regulated markets . Furthermore their response was more effective , created a softer landing , and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets . Perhaps it\u2019s not perfect to be out front with a FTT . And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect . But it\u2019s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse , the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today . Perhaps , given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS , that\u2019s not an unqualified good thing\u2026 but that\u2019s another discussion.\\n\\nAnd yes , there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.\\n\\nlastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax .

Nor am I an expert in Austrian politics ... I\u2019m just an American expat living here . However , my understanding of the Austrian politicians stance on FTT is that it is based more on their ideological beliefs and how corrupt they are than it does from a sort of technocratic assessment of facts and metrics . The prominent exception are Maria Fekter & amp ; Andreas Schieder but I have the impression that the media has concluded that both are \u2018too boring\u2019 to be allowed to go on at length least they actually explain something important using long words which many people don\u2019t understand.\\n\\nAbout the exposure of Austrian banks to risky loans in Eastern Europe : A FTT does not directly effect the ability or likelihood that private financial institutions will engage in stupid and risky transactions and I have not heard a serious proposal from any competent person which would . However , one thing is certain : There isn\u2019t anything about the markets right now that is all that different than summer of 2008 , there is no technical reason that similarly unpleasant circumstance might come together now as they did then and cause similar catastrophic events . More importantly neither Germany or Austria has the resources today to deal with such a hypothetical event as they did in the end of 2008 to 2009 . This emphasizes the need in some folks minds to gather those resources . However , some politicians have a sort of ideological / religious stance : No new , more , or different taxes . No agreeing with anything having to do with the EU . No taxing people who have enough money to bribe me . No management or \u201cinterference\u201d in the markets . Then conversely \u201cNo taxing the poor\u201d \u201cTax the bastards that caused all this mess to begin with\u201d , etc ... \\n\\nHaving said all of that , from a technical point of view a FTT does not need to be a large tax , it needs to be a broad tax . Nor does it necessarily mean that the government must earn more in tax revenue . A skillful FTT could leave the government with as much taxes coming in as it had before ( or not ) . Therefore the questions \u201cShould we implement a Financial Transaction Tax\u201d and \u201cShould the government increase taxation\u201d are two separate questions.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that we should prefer taxation on things that have complicated negative impacts which are not borne by the parties in the transaction ( Negative Externalities ) like pollution , health risks , carbon , consumption ( VAT ) or ultra-high-speed trading than real income ( this means things like wages for real work and things like profit from selling goods ) . I also think that governments around the world are facing the absolute need to reduce their public debt and that means both reducing spending and increasing the taxes coming in . It would also help if the U.S. would refrain from invading and occupying any more nations ... but here in Europe the military spending issue is different and more complicated .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"Well , currently there is no \ '' EU B\u00f6rse\ '' there are only national ones , like the ones in London or Frankfurt and there is no \ '' EU tax collector\ '' or \ '' EU taxation\ '' .

( I just described my bank , Bank Austria which is owned by UniCredit SpA ) .\\n\\nAlso while the US is a transfer union ( States pay in to the Federal Government more or less than they receive from the Federal Government ) the EU is not . So not only does the mechanism for collecting a broad , EU wide tax , and then redistributing back to member nations not exist , the idea does not already exist either . However , EU governance does cost money to run and currently there are bidirectional payments going on in this regard ... so it\\ 's not a completely novel setup.\\n\\nHaving said all of that , in broad strokes a skillful FTT would be collected EU wide ( this probably means harmonized national FFT tax rates collected by member nations ) with some sort of offset ( which is probably a harmonized lowering of business income tax levied by member states ) . So the need for everything to be equal to prevent market distortion would be covered by harmonized tax rates and local collection ( where in the US the Federal Government could just do all of this in Federal Tax law and it would apply to all the states equally without the need for specific treaties or agreements ) .\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you follow US politics or are interested in US governance but I think this issue highlights the difference in the structure of governance between the EU member states and the EU and the US states and the Federal Government ( which I find very interesting ) .

Pharmacies and notaries come to mind . Until the mid-80s , many industries were regulated in that way , including bookstores , grocery stores and taxis . This is called \ '' Gebietsschutz\ '' ( regional protection ) and if you wanted to open e.g . a bookstore , there was first a \ '' Bedarfspr\u00fcfung\ '' ( necessity check ) if another one was necessary in that particular area . If there was already a bookstore nearby and that store didn\\'t exceed a certain number of customers ( population density was also factored in AFAIK ) , you would not get a license to open a store there . \\n\\nI would imagine other countries had and have similar rules for certain industries . \\n",Germanic,German

Chefdiplomat,AskEurope,"It is funny how you talk about people supposedly being misinformed yet you spew almost nothing but nonsense and propaganda.\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is actually corrupt and working for Wall Street . Your comment is 1:1 the defense of the Clinton campaign and not even accurate as Bernie Sanders did bring up Wall Street reform as one issue where she was clearly influenced by Wall Street donations . By the way this is not even a new accusation just listen to what people of her own party had to say about this in the past : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=12mJ-U76nfg\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is using Colin Powell as an excuse . She set up her own E-Mail server , which is unprecetented . There is simply no comparable case.\\n\\n* The generals working with her have described her as extremely hawkish and as always going for the most hawkish option . She is a war criminal and also responsible for the war in Libya , which was based on nothing but lies . One of the lies she kept peddling about Libya , the lie about black mercenaries , actually led to black genocide in Libya , which was conducted by the people she was supporting there and she didn\\'t stop peddling that lie when she was informed about that fact as her E-Mails prove.\\n\\n* Trump also did not go bankrupt personally four of his over five hundred businesses did and they were put into bankrupcy for restructuring . This is not about incompetence but using thebankruptcy laws for personal gain . It might not be the right thing to do but it is quite common and says little about the competence of an individual.\\n\\n* Trump would not have more money if he would gave invested the money he has received from his father in an index fund anyone , who knows a little bit about finance knows this . This is a completely bogus claim that has been falsified many times . Here is a good breakdown on why this claim is nonsense : https : //www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-03/should-donald-trump-have-indexed- .\\n\\n* There are legitimate criticisms about Trump University but the accusations about the Trump Foundation are mostly without real substance if you look into them f.e they accuses him of donating 100000 $ to veterans through the foundation as part of a settlement when the settlement said that that was exactly what he was obliged to do . If you want to talk about Scams you should look at the Clintons , who by the way have not only used dubious schemes to make money themselves but also have supported scams . Also if you want to talk about morality you should talk about how Hillary Clinton fought hard to keep the minimum wage in Haiti below 0,61 $ , how she is a war criminal , hiw ger husban starved over 500k Iraqi children with sanctions etc..\\n\\n* It is hard to argue that Trump is a sexist for treating men the same as women . He has also more women working for him in senior positions than men and has been hiring women for executive positions when that was practically unheard of in the building industrie . \\n\\n* He has not credibly been charged with rape . His Ex-Wife accused him of rape when they were getting a divorce , which she later admitted was a bogus claim and there were a couple lawsuits in which he was accused of rape , which turned out to be fraudulent . If you want to talk about rape and abusive men you should talk Bill Cinton and Hillary Clinton , who has not only bashed people inclusing Monica Lewinsky for talking about Bill Clinton\\ 's abusive behavior and let\\ 's talk about Hillary Clinton accusing a twelve year old girl of lying while defending a pedophile , who has raped that girl : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? =1 & amp ; v=Tor00iWUhDQ.\\n\\n* There is no actual evidence that Trump is a racist and he is actually quite the contrary as he has supported Jessie Jackson , affirmative action , the Civil Rights Movement etc . in the past and has put people of minorities in charge of big projects for his company for decades . Meanwhile you got Clinton calling black youth \ '' Superpredators\ '' in the past , which is an actual racist statement . People claim that Trump is a racist based on a statement about illegal immigrants coming from Mexico , which is not a race and a lawsuit about a building project he wasn\\'t even directly in charge of.\\n\\nStop criticising other people about supposedly believing in propaganda when all you pretty much do as I said in the beginning is repeating propaganda and spin .

We speak Austrian German , which is one of the three Standard German language variaties and there are several dialects of Austrian German , which compared to each other are quite different in itself . The differences also depend on the region though as Bavarian German , which some also call Austro Bavarian is also different from the language the other parts of Germany speaks and more similar to some Austrian dialects but also Austrian German itself . Generally speaking if you compare the German that is spoken in Germany there are differences in the vocabulary , word and grammar usage as well as the pronunciation . Of course we usually understand each other as there are quite a ton of similarities but they are not as similar as it is sometimes portrait . I actually sent a Northern German something I had written and he understood most of the text but not all of it and said that I was missing words , that my word usage was way off and that the sentences partly made no sense when in fact all there was to it was just the difference between Austrian German and German Standard German .

Harris for example wrote a book about Islam while not even knowing the most basic teachings of Islam and he even thought that you get the death penalty according to Sharia for saying something that is actually Islamic doctrin . Fact of the matter is that by far the most people have died and suffered at the hands of atheist leaders wanting to erradicate all religions as they thought that their ideologie f.e Communism , National Socialism , other variations of Fascism or variations of Socialism are incompatible with any kind of religion and a religious society . In addition to that financial , territorial , geopolitical and political interests are the real reason for most if not all conflicts . These interests will most likely always be there hence there will always be conflicts regardless of religion or not . Judging by your profile you seem to know nothing about world affairs f.e you claim that ISIS attacks are not retaliations , which they are as the attackers and ISIS say themselves etc . and you seem to be an extreme left winger , who spews a lot of unverified drivel and ignores facts that you don\\'t like .
