0x126,Amd,This is some choking pattern . I get that with my Fury on WOW since this game sometimes even pushes my 16thread cpu to 100 % ... In your case it 's clearly a underpowered CPU . ( Can also be RAM speed/size . BF1 consumes about 7GB ( 9.5 in total ) on my system . On 4K the 4GB vram is not enough . Have to lower stuff to medium for 4k @ 60fps ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Have that on my system too ( in wattman ) . Happens only on shitty programmed games ... WOW Legion in my case . BF1 is always 90-100 % on wow it jumps from 0 to 100 and back cause the gamecode is shitty optimized and way outdated . They ported ftom DX 8 to 9 and then from 9 to 11 . Wrapping and changing is not optimizing . My 16 threads are at 100 % in wow at some places and gpu drops to 5 % usage ... that is really sad since no difference can be seen .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Same here like dragnar . I have my fury now and 800€ for a TI that does 10fps more on 4k ultra is n't a reason to upgrade at that insane costs . Vega may lower prices , support freesync 4k @ 60 ( which is what i need ) and be 100€ cheaper . Nobrainer to wait another 5 months till vega is on sale before Christmas .

0x126,Amd,"Use search function , read QVL list on Mobo site and buy accordingly . There are a trillion Mem OC threads already . There is a tech support thread . Have fun .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Basically : 2133MHz is the base frequency of DDR4 everything above is an overclock . Setting only the mem . frequency or using XMP is not a OC . XMP is for Intel platform . on AMD it is called DOCP . You have to set - frequency , DDR-voltage , the DDR reset voltage , the calculated timings ( yes , calculate them or try & amp ; error them ) and the SOC voltage ( only AMD afaik ) . The QVL gives you tested setups that work . Better would be to get certified RAM . If you have a 3200MHz rated kit , you should easily get 3000MHz OC ( use XMP , set only the MHz to 3000 - worth a try ) . I use a RAM kit that is not even listed on my QVL and running it at 2666MHz of it 's rated 3000 ( rated Vendor* ) . I have lower MHz but could do a CL14 instead of a CL15 ; ) The most importand thing is to use the latest bios with AGESA 1.0.0.6 because there are much moch settings and more stable OC possible . Hope this helps you somehow .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Idk about the PLUS but on the B350-A Prime I ran the RAM at 2666MHz pre AGESA 1006 . On my current board ( Fatal1ty x370 K4 ) the CMK16GX4M2B3000C15 runs at 2666MHz with CL14 ! So I 'm happy .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,that is the more pragmatic approach which I picked too ( get the cheapest with highest MHz and run it at best speed ) . This is the way to go for advanced users who can adjust their OC themselfs and not relay on XMP or auto OC,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Since 1700 = 1700x = 1800x i guess with good air cooling 150W+ it should be possible . A good 1700 silicon should clock to 4GHz like the 1800X does . XFR idk if I need that ^^,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"Ok so there are many reasons that could happen . First of all it does not seem to be a power throttling ( but you can always go to full % since it only consumes what it needs ) . Temp throttle at 76°C is also excluded . So the most common thing left is that the VRAM is full or the RAM . 8GB of VRAM are only maxed out on AAA titles in 4k with AA fully on so - nope . Since your paging file is 11GB ? ? ? I think that this is the problem . Mine is mostly 0-200MB with 32GB RAM Close all other apps and play around with the settings of the game . Vertical Sync may also be leading to downclocking or some other target setting for FPS . The card seems fine , there has to be some periferal problem ( HDD , RAM ) . Do you often switch to the desktop ? or how do you play ? windowed or full-widowed or fullscreen ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,no it 's not normal . As a wrote this may have nothing to do with the GPU but rather the RAM/Paging/HDD read/write . open the task manager and look at the performance graph of RAM and HDD . Even huge number of page faults or read/write errors may be a hint ; ),Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,I gave back the reference 480 and getting the Red Devil too . Best after market cooler after intensive research .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you did n't change the fan curve and throttle at 85-90°C in the best case . in the worst you throttle because of power draw ^^ if you have some G/V/Free-sync at 1080p on it does n't matter but when I used the reference card with 4k it jumped from 40 to 28 and up to 35 FPS in seconds . horrific . stable clock with power limit up and fan ramped up got me to 70° ... and a vacuum right next to my head . going for custom cooler now .,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,This makes total sense . Vega 11 is maybe between 6TF of 480 and Vega 10 . Paired with HBM 2 Vega 10 has to compete with Future Titan X . Going from Furys TF is considering better architecture and or higher clocks feasable .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,The reason is stability . My old GT 8800 ruined my PCIe slot while hanging in there ( case screws were not enough ) .

0x126,Amd,"This is a new architecture .

Since I just wanted to check the headroom , I now have clocked all cores to 3.5GHz at 1.18V with ~35°C idle since I do n't need the power yet . All games I play are limited by the GFX card . All applications I use are 1.5-3times faster than with my old 2500k . Ryzen Master does not set the VCC correct ( HW monitor showed other than was set , higher ! ! ) - so do it in bios ! It is sufficient to set the voltage offset +0.12V for ~3.8GHz was it for me and the multiplier to 38.5 ( or play around with the multiplier and divider values till you get there ) Edit : only crashes I experienced were to low voltage or to high temps .

0x126,Amd,"It 's not pointless . It 's better binned ( other thread with analysis of 90cpus ) and clocked higher to start with .

0x126,Amd,Mine does 3.8GHz at 1.28V So I guess if you do n't get the lottery silicon you just have to put +0.05V on it - which with your watercooling is no problem . I run that on the Wraith Stealth ( I think it is the stealth ! ),Germanic,German

So I could push it up there with 1.35v , CL 15-17-17-17-36 and 2933 ( 3000 ) MHz . My mobo does n't store that correctly ( works for one boot fully stable . Then it gets reset - buggy ) .

0x126,Amd,WoW ok no b350 will have the vrms to oc 1800x to max . I ordered the asus board since it supports up to 3200. there is the plus that supports two cards but not mATX anymore . Is that even possible in sizes ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Maybe not boosted to max ? running on 4.5GHz while boost should be 5GHz could mean 100 % but overall ( of possible ) only 80 %,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Still thereis the issue of not utilizing the power of 1700 . Even well threaded games seem to underperform currently . My guess is microcode ( windows fix needed ) or caching problem ( bios fix needed ) .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Software Problem ! Bios - windows- microcode - threading - optimized only for intel ? We will know soon hopefully !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Well preventing windows from randomly switching tasks between ccx would be sufficient for most purposes .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess not outbound,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Mindfactory.de has numbers . Hundreds there . Problem is , that was the best supplied seller . So my bet is shortage too .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,There is a full thread on the problem . Windows switches tasks from core to core but even over the core complexes ( ccx ) where it is slow . This does not happen with cpu only tasks ( therefore good benchmarks ! ) . Additionally powersaving features and memory bios problems . Wait some days for fixes . Then come back for new benchmarks ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"No no this sub clearly always stated that its 5 % below skylake and best for general use , not gaming special . Anyway if you keeping it , wait for the memory , scheduler and microcode fixes that reduce the gaming performance compared to benchmarks . For me it 's a huge upgrade from 2500k . But if gaming would be my focus i 'd get a 6600k and a 1070 for 1080p and a 1080 ti for 4k",Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Yes he is good at what he does . Works at caseking.de btw 8auer means Bauer which means builder ( edit : constructor ? ) or farmer in german . So I like to read it as The Farmer : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,In normal conditions yes but amd cpus are voltage torture resistant . So LN2 and 1.6volt do n't kill it ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I put 16GB ram ontop of my 1700 box but still 0.0GHz and 0 fps . Ordered 3000MHz ram but does not help !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Me not since bios ( memory ) , microcode and windows scheduler patches still need to fix many issues . after that it should be 5-10 % better in games ( that are shitty optimised if at all for intel ) . After these improvements R7 should be in games too where it belongs : - on par with 6900k - 5-8 % lower than 7700k in 4c max engines",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,currently with all the broken bios and scheduling problems yes . but non gaming ( GPU communication and CCX switching ) are the same or ahead so there are some software problems open !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,downvote without a comment ? thats lame guys . nothing wrong with my comment . look up the CCX thread moving issue yourself . holy crap : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Have n't seen these . Thanks mate ! But it does not help to deactivate the whole CCX haha That is nice to see more clear that Ryzen has lower IPC than Kaby but what prevents gaming performance like a 6900k is that switching threads from one ccx to another goes by RAM and not L3 which makes a difference in time in the order of a magnitude . Since windows does this automatically ( god why ? keep temps lower ? idk.. ) this is a problem on fps but not on usual benchmarks ( one task per core , overall delays are fine cause end result counts ! )",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Should have bought a better gfx card..,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Delivery probably 9.march or 16.march Only in germany there are plenty but would cost me 20€ shipping : (,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Ok so that is what can be zen 2 - 5ghz on air,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,So what do you suppose ? Test at 480p at 500+fps to take out the gpu of the equation ? 1080p with a 1080 is a better setup than 80 % of gamers would get since a 1070 is already suited better for 1440p I still do n't get why the benchmarks are that off on GN . Sure IPC is lower but that crippled result seems to be some caching problem or motherboard problem . Will see the next days,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,It 's fake or 1700 @ 4GHz is only 50points behind a 7700k @ 4.2GHz in single core . http : //imgur.com/a/JWYaI So I do n't see any reason other than the OC space ( for DX11 gaming only builds - who does that ? ) on the 7700k to go for the 7700k ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,A single compile is never the problem but like in media editing you have to check what shit you did . 5seconds can add up to weeks that are lost . Testing environments ( emulators for mobile ) are resource eaters . The more the better !,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"yeah but you get +4c +8t for all the workload ahead and games are maxed out with 4cores currently ( DX11 are fine even with 2c ) So why bother ? in 2 years even 1700 & gt ; & gt ; 7700k ; ) Edit : what I mean is , i buy a 1700 over a 7700k cause more cores , almost same 1080p be better next 4-6 years . that simple .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Hi /u/AMD_Robert , first thanks for your work . Second : will it be possible to store or share OC profiles ( Edit : online ) for games and applications ? e.g . disabling 4 cores and oc others higher ? Since it is possible with Ryzen Master to store those localy will there be a import/export function ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Got the 1700 still happy I preordered since my 2500k had to go anyway . Mainboard not yet chosen - since this is the real critical thing . Does it support 3200MHz DDR yet ? Do I go for a B350 or the X370 for future upgrades / APU use on one ? How do prices react the next few days ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess it is more a software or mainboard problem with the review all over the place . it makes no sense that these CPUs die in games like flies . Anyway why would you choose 4c over 8c ? because of 5fps ? That is crazy stupid,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,With a mid range CPU and a SSD yes sure . If not you got a CPU bottleneck or in another place . Totally correct . He elaborated it again later .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you should have wrote that somewhere ; ) the minimum are HUGE btw,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,there is another thread that states other issues currently not solved . This is only one of them but can be seen as you mentioned in the 4+0 and 2+2 fps . 12fps are about 10-12 % which in turn would be 16fps with all cores . only this problem alone : ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Cache management seems off the rail on some boards ( other thread looked it up ) . Which would be reasonable : in fully threaded benchmarks only the core cache is used heavily ; in games the commom cache SHOUD be used too since multiple threads work with same materials . Hence the issue could be windows driver or bios . Iff there is any . Idk . Plz asus let me buy the mobo and do my build . Please .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Waiting for stock in germany/austria of anything currently . Only some shops have mobos with 20€ shipping costs ... that is too much,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"If you game , why would you get a Ryzen ? This is a workload CPU not a high clocked gaming CPU : ) You may have to wait till all problems are sorted out ( May ? ) to use full capability of ryzen .

0x126,Amd,"Low FPS not dropping like shit . So with ryzen you get lower average and peaks but higher consistent lows .

0x126,Amd,"So why does it in some games and others not ? LOL yes . Games use the same resources as other applications but are crafted to supply specifically the gpu . Hence it depends on HOW it is done and if the architecture is suited for this .

We had water in our basement ( about one inch in some places ) and very low water pressure in the house ( it was pretty infuriating trying to shower on the top floor ) . We thought the water in the basement was caused by cracks in the foundation and missing drainage of the soil around causing rainwater to be pushed through the floor . We also thought the low pressure was caused by an old and probably clogged meter , and because noone in our household REALLY cared we did n't do anything about it . But after the pressure did n't change after we replaced our meter as advised by our water supplyer my dad figured out the two problems might be connected . We hired a company to look into it and sure enought , after digging about four feet down we hit water .

Not many players will use that feature , im certain , but i don´t think it would be hard to add . * **Fix the DotA-TV camera** I think I dont have to say much about this . Just go watch a replay and try to change the camera to player-perspective . * **Please add a key-overlay to DotA-TV** I think an optional overlay in player-perspective that shows you what keys are being pressed by the player at the moment would be pretty nice .

17DF53E,skyrim,"They came without warning . Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound , and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count , wielding flame and foul sorcery , slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose . Of once-mighty Stonehall 's military strength only the Bronze Legion , led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin , was near enough to answer the call of battle . They rode into their city , fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets , cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion : an ethereal rift within the city square , and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion . Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer , the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade , cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil . Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast . It turned , smiling at her through a maze of teeth . Heedless of the battle raging around them , they charged one another . Deflecting blow after blow , the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them . Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her . The odds turned . The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly , a brutal thrust from the side , but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke . Blade scraped on blade , beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below , carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood . The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack , driving her blade through her foe 's flesh into the stampeding heart within . With a scream that split the clouds above , the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish . The stygian portal wavered , the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared . The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel . Though victorious , the survivors saw little to celebrate : the city lay in ruins , and survivors were few . Fires continued to spread . Unfurling her banners of war , Tresdin gathered what allies she could . Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss , and damned be any who would dare stand in her way .",Germanic,German

1L4V,DotA2,"**IT WAS THE REFLECT OF DUEL WITH AGHS ! COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT^so^so^so^sorry** We played against an Anti-Mage with Aghs and everytime our Necrophos ulted him he took 0 DMG from the ult . It did n't matter how much HP he had left . I could n't find any reason , he does n't take any dmg from Reaper Scythe . MatchID : 2989133401 Examples of what I am talking about : ( Time equals the Clock ingame ) **first time** Time : 63:31 on bot lane . He was duelled and ulted from Necrophos with around 1/4 of his HP . Reaper 's Scythe deals 0 DMG . In the combat Log only the debuff is stated , but nowhere any dmg . Spell Shield is on CD ( got popped by LC Duel ) . Lion Ult also does n't show up as dmg in combat Log , only as debuff and seems to deal no dmg . **game deciding time** Time : 65:27 mid lane where Dire Tier 2 would 've been . Again AM had Spell Shield on CD because of Duel and again he was Necro ulted with around 1/4 of his HP . In the **Combat Log** following is always written : > Anti-Mage receives modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff from Necrophos . > Anti-Mage loses modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff . There is no DMG in the combat Log and 0 dmg was taken . Do I miss something completely obvious ? Or is there actually something broken ? Please someone look into this matter , because if this is true , then AM Aghs is bugged . REALLY bugged . Matchlink : dota2 : //matchid=2989133401 & matchtime=4004 **Edit 1 : ** LC had no Aghs . So that could n't be the problem **Edit 2 : ** CLEARED IT UP ! Thanks to u/Drakesfjord and u/DimitrijaT ! I have completely forgotten that the reflect is Aghs upgraded ... silly me ...",Germanic,German

Then the ignition happens at some convenient position near the wall . The next time the piston side moves away from the wall is actually the work phase . When the work phase is over the piston side again approaches the wall and forces the exhaust out . When the piston side again meets the starting wall , the cycle is over and the next rotation begins with the fuel intake phase again . https : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Wankel_Cycle_anim_en.gif",Germanic,Finnish

There was a change in the law that directs extra government funds to dual language muncipalities . Basically some municipalities that are designated single language suffered in the change . However , the determination of language status is next made in 2023 and the government was not allowed to make special determinations .

Game publishers that wish to sell in brick and mortar chains ( that would be basically all of the publishers ) mostly have to agree to charge the same base price online as the physical copies in the stores . Otherwise the stores would not agree to sell the game due to competititon from cheaper online offerings . And dropping the price in the physical copies would not be in their interest since products in those stores are subject to the high cost of living present in Australia , it would just cut into their profit . And as the publishers must price their products in the currency they do business in , they are kinda slaves to the exchange rate , irrespective of any hedging they may do . Another thing that keeps the prices higher - at USD equivalent terms - in non-USD currencies is stability of the price as observed by the consumer . Consumers have formed a general idea about the cost of games ( cost of everything ) . They are not going to assimilate very well to price changes if they followed the exchange rate , especially when the observed niominal price goes UP .

0_0_0,TrueReddit,"Is n't ~~he~~ Coward claiming that the methodology itself was manipulated to find no significance ? & gt ; Fourth , the performance of my students from Math 1A was evaluated in the subsequent course in the sequence , Math 1B . The score gain for my students averaged 0.17 grade points over the three Math 1B classes , with a sample size of approximately 1000 students . This raises the question of whether this is statistically signifiant . Your colleague Philip Stark , the chair of the Statistics Department , and someone who has gone on the record saying that student evaluations are not indicative of teaching effectiveness , wrote in his analysis : & gt ; '' The test statistic was the following : For each section of 1B , calculate the three average grades corresponding to each of the three 1A sections . Take the standard deviation of those three numbers . Add those numbers for the three sections of 1B . '' & gt ; While it takes some time to understand this statement , it amounts to the following : My students were divided into 9am and 11am groups corresponding to my two Math 1A class , and then a test statistic was used that penalized consistency in performance between the students from my two classes . Stark 's analysis went on to obtain a p-value of 0.13 and he concluded : `` There is no _statistical_ basis for concluding that any differences in the 1B performance -- to the extent that such differences exist -- are attributable to differences in what they learned in 1A .

0_0_0,wikipedia,"Nope . It means there are no *atoms* left over from the duck liver , never mind molecules . The dilution is so ridiculously over-over-over-over-overdone , the probability of any original atom remaining in the resulting solution completely disappears . Read the whole linked article . Choice quote : & gt ; '' 30C : Dilution advocated by Hahnemann for most purposes : on average , this would require giving two billion doses per second to six billion people for 4 billion years to deliver a single molecule of the original material to any patient . ''",Germanic,Finnish
0_0_0,wikipedia,"`` 5 times '' is incorrect . Also the definition is not about molecules per bottle , the bottles was only mentioned by /u/LWschool . Are you sure how scientific notation and the homeopathic `` system '' works ? The dilution in this case is described as `` 200C '' . This means a solution of one unit of original substance in 10^400 [ one followed by four hundred zeroes ] units of diluent . The approximate number of *atoms* ( not molecules^1 , mind ) in the observable universe is ~10^80 . Therefore , dividing 10^400 atoms by ~10^80 atoms per universe leaves ~10^320 universes required to have **a single atom remaining in the solution** , on average . So the amount of diluent e.g . water required in this solution , is equivalent to the atoms of these 10^320 universes and the amount of active ingredient is one atom . The difference between 10^80 and 10^320 is not `` 5 times '' . It 's 10^240 [ one followed by 240 zeroes ] . Footnote^1 : The orginal analysis in the wiki ignores the difference between molecules and atoms to give a rough sense of scale . This means that the 10^320 number is actually not enough , because it needs to be multiplied by the number of atoms in the particular molecule . Really complex proteins can have up to 10^6 atoms . So the upper limit is more like ~10^326 universes . : )",Germanic,Finnish

Here is my script that give the right key . import pylibscrypt scrypt = pylibscrypt.scrypt password = 'test123'.encode ( `` utf_16_be '' , `` replace '' ) salt = '384eaed91035763e'.decode ( 'hex ' ) print ( password.encode ( 'hex ' ) ) key = scrypt ( password , salt , 16384 , 8 , 1 , 32 ) print ( key.encode ( 'hex ' ) ) Output : 0074006500730074003100320033 9f2117416c7b2de9419a81c4625a28e40c16ac92aaa3000bb2c35844b3839eb1 In C if I simply pass `` const uint8_t password [ ] = `` test123 '' ; '' then I do n't get the correct key .

0bi,medicalschool,"Survey taken . About the questions : 1 . Yes , most definitely . When I go to see patients , I see them by myself . Both history and exam . I then summarize this for my attending , who will only check a few things but will take my word for most . This of course requires that I admit when I 'm not sure about stomething etc . but they are generally fine with that . Sometimes in acute cases when there is nothing to really add to the process , I like to talke with the family of the patient to explain everything to them etc . Also because I see less patients than the attendings , I 'm able to spend more time with them which sometimes reveals more underlying issues or causes , or allows to focus on the impact of the disease more . So a definite yes , in several ways . 2 . Sometimes this has happened . I find it annoying , because it often coincided with very little learning moments . Fortunately it has n't happened in my fields of interest . No problems with self-worth , but that 's probably mostly due to there being nothing to do in general . 3 . Two things : confidence ( /assertiveness ) and space . We work with six week rotations in several fields . The first week , you 're learning a lot and ask for a lot of direct supervision . If you 're well prepared , you can pick things up quickly . Once I 'm confident about my abilities to see patients by myself ( for example ) , I make the suggestion to the attending . If they are confident enough in their indirect supervision skills , they 'll let me/you . That 's the space part . Also , try to be a good colleague . In my evaluations I 've been told that people like to give me space to grow , because I claim it and because I offer to do the meaningless tasks as well , just to reduce the workload on the attending . So , to summarise : be prepared , try to be confident . Try to learn a lot at the start of a rotation , offer to do a lot of things and claim learning/individual moments when possible . And then it comes down to a bit of luck with your patients and attending . Hope this helps !",Germanic,Dutch

I waited with seeking help until I failed several courses in a row , one of those for the fourth time . I even had my plan thought out , like you- though the plan was complete . At the point where I failed that one course *again* I realised that my feelings of depression were n't going away . Not by themselves , at least . And I thought about if I really wanted to die , or just did n't see the point of living . I wanted to , but realised that I hated patients that let themselves die from treatable diseases at a young age . And at that mirror moment I turned to my parents . Who got me in touch with a ( licensed ) psychologist and I started taking psychotherapy ( supervised by a psychiatrist ) . It was a slow crawl , but I 'm doing better now . This was my first winter without therapy and without substantial depressive feelings . I still have to think about it consciously though , it 's all still looming around the corner . IAC , I 'm at a better place now- both mentally , personally and academically . I 've learned that the hole is never to deep .

The pressure , the time-sink , no application or explanation of why what you 're learning is relevant ( which I wanted because it was just so much ) , not doing nearly as much of the fun stuff outside of school as your friends ... It was during this time that I also developed a period of depression . Fortunately enough , I got help for that .

And because cancer is such a high-risk diagnosis , it is always listed . Most DDX programs offer two columns : one with the most likely diagnoses ( e.g . the flu ) and one with diagnoses that are n't ( very ) likely , but because of their serious nature need to be excluded ( e.g . cancer ) . Important note though : diagnostic programs are meant to be used by physicians and are **all** still in their testing phases .

0bi,AskReddit,"I 'm kind of in the opposite situation . My girlfriend and I had known eachother for a year before we officially became a 'thing ' . When we got to know eachother first , we went on a couple of dates and I pretty much fell for her- she did n't quite fall for me . During that year , there were a couple of occasions where I thought there was something more than 'just friends ' as well . When we finally started dating , I asked her pretty quick if she wanted to be my girlfriend and I told her I loved her quite soon after , because , as I figured out , I never quite got over her during that year . This is ~2 months ago now . She has n't said it back yet- I 've said it twice . I do n't want to crowd her with it , and I do n't like the idea of saying it again and again getting no verbal response . The reason I do n't really mind it though , and the one that keeps me patient is this : when I said it , we looked eachother in the eyes and I could see pure joy in hers when I said it . So I know that even if she does n't ( know she ) love ( s ) me yet , I 'm sure she likes me and that she 's comfortable with how I feel and not at all freaked out by it . Moral of the story : be honest and even more so : be sincere . I have to respect that I was pretty darn quick in saying it and that she ca n't say it back yet , even if I want her to . And I can do that , because she made it clear that she does n't mind . So in your case , OP , tell her that you appreciate it and that you unfortunately do not yet feel that way . But also let her know that you 're comfortable with her saying it first- I think most girls are afraid they 'll chase their guy away by saying it too soon . Then hug her . Nothing like hugs .

0bi,AskReddit,"That 's not true either though . IBD and IBS are two different types of condition entirely . IBD is an umbrella term for two diseases ( Chron 's and ulcerative colitis ) , whereas IBS is just the syndrome . The difference is that both forms of IBD have a known pathogenesis ( that means we know how the process that causes the disease and its symptoms works ) , which IBS does not . That 's why Chron 's and ulcerative colitis are diseases , and IBS is a syndrome . This difference is most clearly illustrated by the treatment options : there are drugs available for IBD ( next to lifestyle changes etc . ) , but not for IBS .

0bi,AskReddit,"Hey dude , I think you 're skipping a couple of steps here ! First of all : most forms of skin cancer are local laesions . There is only one form of skin cancer that is malignant and causes metastases . This means that *if* one of your moles is cancer , this says nothing about all your other moles . Secondly : as stated before , most forms of skin cancers are benign ( i.e . they remain local ) and can be removed on the spot . ( this is preferable to leaving them be , because further growing can cause other issues ) Thirdly : they do n't have to remove all of your moles to see if you 've got cancer or not . Basic inspection by a dermatologist or GP ( if possible assisted by a dermatoscope , a certain type of lens ) can tell whether a mole is 'suspect ' or not . Only suspect moles need to be sampled for lab analysis . Finally : moles can come and go naturally . So getting checked out is just a precaution , not a guaranteed death sentence . To summarise : getting checked out is the doctor looking at your moles really closely , if possible assisted by a lens . If he thinks something looks funny , he 'll take that certain mole out and send it in for analysis . Most likely diagnosis : not cancer . If the diagnosis is cancer , that taking away the mole was most likely your treatment . Getting checked out can give you ( and those around you ) peace of mind and in the unlikely case of it being the shitty type of cancer : the best treatment for all types of cancer is catching it in its early stages . TL ; DR - get it checked out . If not cancer : yay ! If cancer : most likely 'meh ' or at least yay that you found out now instead of in two years when you 're dying of it ( which is n't necessary ) .",Germanic,Dutch

The interior is also very touring oriented . The custom line is what you would expect- custom . You can get a racing boat , a caravan or anything in between .

0bi,AskReddit,"Ulcer would explain acid burns , but not reflux . That would be caused by Lower Esofageal Sfincter ( LES ) defect or a hernia in your diaphragm among other things . Do you actually have reflux , or just burns ? If reflux , up to what height ? It 's mind boggling to me that you ca n't get a referral if he thinks you might have an ulcer .

0bi,AskReddit,"You could have a short phrenulum . Nothing to worry about as long as you can retract it fully when flaccid ( means no phimosis and no hygiene issues ) . Make sure you use lube during sex if necessary though , because rough , dry sex could tear your phrenulum .

The most common STD , Chlamydia , is often asymptomatic in females . Asking is okay , but wo n't get you anywhere because of what I just said . So , just use a condom during sex . If you at some point have a regular , monogamous partner , you should both get tested prior to having unprotected sex ( and she should start birth control or something else ) . If you do it like that , very little chance of gaining a STD . Worth knowing though is that condoms do no necessarily protect against herpes . It 's no a bad disease , and most people 40 years old or older have it , because it never goes away . Same for HPV . Any more questions ? : )",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"How old are you ? Most likely normal in any case , erection angle decrease with age . Some people start higher than others . As long as its hard you 're ok .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"That 's possible . The scrotum is innervated by nerves that originate from the spinal cord , so your sense of pain originates from them . Sitting in a bad posture for too long - & gt ; back pain and in you case maybe some compression of these nerves . Depending on how much it bothers you , you could see a doctor .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,Could be a hernia . Have you tried pushing it back in ?,Germanic,Dutch

How long is your penis when erect ? Are you able to ejaculate/orgasm ? 3 . See questions above . 4 . Mood swings in bipolar are generally speaking far more long-term . I.e . couple of months manic , couple of months depressed etc . They generally do n't happen at the drop of a hat . Sounds like you could use help though , start the search for a psychologist you like today : ) ( either through your GP/PCP or not ) . And to answer your questions : not strictly genetic , but it is observed in familial relations . 5 . Could be possible . Addiction is a very strictly defined term though . Just being hungry and eating more =/= addiction . Start eating less and excercising more ( it also helps to keep your mind off the food ) . Pills etc . are all scams . Gastric surgery is hit-and-miss and relatively dangerous , should only be tried as a last resort . Your GP/PCP should be able to help you with this . 6 . Describe your stool .

Definitely mention it during the doctor 's appointment you just made though , because as I mentioned in that post there are other diagnoses that need to excluded . -- -- - 2 ) About the theories : definitely sounds like constipation . However , constipation has a cause which needs to be found . Hence the doctor 's appointment . The cause might be dietary or excercise related , might be inflammatory and unfortunately could be cancer . That , however , is not the most likely diagnosis based on what you 've told me ( age ; lack of other symptoms , weight change and sweating ) I 'm sorry to have to drop that bombshell , I hope I 've mitigated it a bit with the explanation . Please , please do n't freak out- there is no reason to acutely think this is cancer based on what you 've described , but it 's impossible to rule out right now . Hence why I mentioned it , I prefer being honest . Making an appointment one month from now and maintaining [ the diary ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale ) would make you a model patient and would you put you on the perfect track to finding a diagnosis . That also means you 'd be doing everything right to mitigate *any* cancer- ( related ) risks . Your doctor will really appreciate this and might make them take you more seriously too .

0bi,medicalschool,"So , the post currently on the front page about number of procedures done during rotations got me thinking about what 's considered 'normal ' in the U.S. and over here . I started comparing the procedures I 've done to some listed in that post and figured it was like comparing apples and oranges and that people first needed to understand the architecture of medical school over here . I figured that warranted its own post , I hope you find it interesting . I 've made it specifically about The Netherlands , because I 'm not aware of all the specific differences between the EU countries . Maybe people from those countries can chime in on that . **So , general outline first . ** Medical school in The Netherlands is six years , but requires no premed . You can enroll straight out of high school at 18 . The education is then grossly divided in two parts of three years , the first three focus on anatomy , physiology , biochem etc . The latter three focus on rotations in increasing manner . My faculty is unique in The Netherlands due to the fact that we have full-fledged rotations during third year ( a big advantage IMO ) . You have two weeks of Christmas holidays and 8 weeks of summer leave , though this decreases each year as you advance . In turn , you get two weeks twice off at randomly designated periods during the year from fourth year onwards . **The Netherlands is a small country** ( [ 16040 sq mi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands ) ) but has [ eight university hospitals with ~300 first years each ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_hospitals # Netherlands ) , so due to student density you 'll never have to travel very far during away rotations . Door to door it rarely exceeds 1,5 hours and in those cases ( and often sooner ) you 'll most often have the option to be boarded locally ( paid for by your faculty ) . **Most medical schools** in The Netherlands have adopted a 'thematic curriculum ' . This means that instead of separate courses of anatomy , physiology etc . you get a course 'GI ' , or 'Circulation ' . You will then learn about anatomy , physiology , pathology etc . of relevant organs to that theme . The only 'traditional ' course I can think of that we have is biochem , though that 's already angled a bit towards onco . **So , the first three years** ( your 'Bachelor's ' ) consist of above mentioned 'themes ' . In general , this takes place in the faculty building and is made up of lectures , so called workgroup settings , practical sessions ( e.g . histo ) and live-patient lectures . You are also trained in scientific literacy and do an actual test-study and have ethics classes . If you 're an average or above-average student studying nine to five should be enough to pass with decent grades here . We do n't have the STEP-system , though each faculty has some version of 'progress exams ' where you take the same exam ( not the same questions ) at set intervals during med school but have to perform better as you progress . **The second portion** ( your 'Master's ' ) is mostly rotations with designated prep courses in advance . The length of each rotation differs per faculty , at mine most rotations are six weeks each . In general your first rotations will be at your faculty hospital or very close and as you advance you can have rotations further away ( this is relative though , see above ) . Most rotations are set , though you have several electives as well . Now , about the prep courses : these consist of repition and more in-depth study of most-common diseases , anatomy etc ; practical tools ( such as basic management of post-op surgical patients , heart failure pts , ATLS etc . ) ; more diseases within the field and practice patients and cases . In general you 'll be studying more than 40 hours/week during these prep courses as they are very short . **Rotations at my faculty** are ( with different prep course length , not listed ) : * IM 2 x 6 weeks * Surgery 2 x 6 weeks * Neuro 6 weeks * Psych 6 weeks * Ob/Gyn 6 weeks * Peds 6 weeks * GP 5 weeks * Ophto 2 weeks * Derm 2 weeks * ENT 3 weeks * Public health 4 weeks * Elective 6-10 weeks * 12 weeks of warding in one dpt of choice ) * Elective 12 weeks or 2 x 6 weeks All in all almost two full years of rotations . The last two bullets are both in sixth year , which is called the 'switch year ' nowadays as it has no more prep courses and focuses on actual clinical work . Rotations are generally 8-17.30 with several call duties added ; with of course the exceptions of surgery and [ derm ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/52elsz/i_dont_get_why_everybody_says_derm_hours_are_easy/ ) . **And afterwards ? ** You 're a licensed physician . You can either work as an *ANIOS* ( physician *not* in training for specialist ) , or if you 're lucky/very good/have work experience as an ANIOS you can enter a 3-6 year residency program , which will make you an *AIOS* ( you see the 'n ' for 'not ' is missing ) . There is no match system , you have to apply for a spot through regular means . After that , you 're a full fledged specialist and have to find work somewhere . Please note that to become a GP you also have to specialise . **Other notes . ** At a lot of faculties it 's possible to do a rotation abroad . At some faculties , there is a special 4-year med school programme for people who degrees in e.g . biochem- which is a lot more like your premed/med structure . I 'm not completely with all the differences between this programme and the US programme . However , they generally accept less than 30 students each year ( compared to ~300 regular 1st years ) . **So , I hope you enjoyed this read . ** Ask any question you like !",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,medicalschool,"So , today I started my dermatology rotation . I have to say , it was not like I expected . To start off , they made us come in at 8.30 . 8.30 ! ! That means I had to go to bed by 22.30 to get my minimum of nine hours of sleep as I have to bike 15 minutes to get to the hospital . Absolutely ridiculous . Rounds then took almost two hours , which left me with a measly hour for my coffee break followed by the mandatory two hours for lunch . But the afternoon was worse . I was seeing outpatients , and because my supervisor was slow ( he was supervising multiple people at once ) I finished 1.5 hours later than planned . This meant that after preparing all my cases for the coming two days , I could only go home at four and drink beer in the sun for a mere two hours before I 'll have to start cooking dinner . And the worst part of it all ? My attending said that *every day is like this . * I have no idea why you guys all say that derm life is easy , this is my toughest rotation by far .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,depression,"Hi , I may or may not be using this mainly as a step-up to seeking professional help . I have n't decided . I 'm just looking to hear someone 's thoughts , because I ca n't really talk to anyone about it IRL . I apologise if I 'm using this place for something it 's not intended for . Basically , nothing has been working out for me lately . Or at least , it feels that way . None of the things I worked hard for have yielded results , nor have the things I wished for come true . I do n't know why . All I do know is that I find it very hard to deal with- especially as a person who 's had a lot of things 'handed to him/going his way ' until the last year . It started about a year ago , but has only gotten serious the last 3 months . Nothing working out has made me apathetic , and it 's a self-enforcing loop I ca n't really get out of . The only times I 'm not having depressed thoughts are when I 'm out with my 'friends ' doing things that bear no relation to normal functioning- i.e . when I 'm keeping my mind off things . Lots of times , alcohol is involved . I always stay till closing , because I do n't want to go home . I put 'friends ' in quotes , because I have no one I can tell everything . They 're more like acquaintances , just people I have small talk with and know a little about . Over the past months , it 's gotten to the point where I do n't know what I 'm doing any more and how to stop this nonsense . I fail to see the point of life . The only thing that 's kept my from killing myself the last weeks is what it would do to my parents and some of my 'friends ' . I considered posting this to SW , but I figured I 'm feeling more depressed than suicidal . I 'm sorry if this is hard to follow or reads like a rant , I just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere . I really do n't know what I 'm looking for with this post , I guess acknowledgement would be enough . Thanks for reading . -0bi [ EDIT ] Thanks for all the kind words everyone .

0bi,medicine,Great post ! And a relevant username if I ever saw it . I also feel the OP misses the `` stacking problem '' as I like to call it : working long hours is fine . Not being respected by patients is fine . Nothing being improved about logistics is fine . Not making a lot of money ( yet ) is fine . Having student loans is fine . etc . etc . However *stacking those* becomes a problem . In other words : working long hours for little pay in shitty conditions with patients who are not helpful and who do n't respect you or what you do and who do not take responsibility for their own health but blame you for them not getting better is **definitely** something to be unhappy about . And blowing off steam every once in a while is healthy .,Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"I 'm not 100 % on the Australian system , but this should basically explain it : Public healthcare is a hospital . Lots of different patients , many doctors and nurses . Partially paid for by the government . Private healthcare is a called a practice . It 's a lot smaller , and often targets one specific type of patient , e.g . those who need a knee replacement . # # # Warning : complicated stuff below that explains the underlying 'problem ' with private practice . # To understand why private practitioners make so much money , it 's important to understand the following . Hospitals can do two types of treatment : treatment that makes them money and that costs them money . Insurance companies are not willing to pay the huge costs for cancer treatment for a patient directly . It 'd mess up their statistics or something . So if that treatment costs 10X money , they get 2X from the insurance and have to pay the rest themselves . To be able to pay that treatment they need money , so they 'overcharge ' the insurance companies for the 'cheap ' treatments ( note : this is all regulated and consensual ) . So instead of charging X ( the cost ) , they charge 2X . So they make 1X profit per treatment to cover for the expenses of cancer treatment . A private practice offers only specific types of treatment- and you guessed it- those who make money . Since they do n't need the excess amount to cover for radiation therapy , they can charge less than 2X and still more than 1X . Result : they make more money , whilst being cheaper for the insurance companies . That results in more patients being sent there , and less 'cheap ' patients to the hospital . Eventually the hospitals will no longer be able to pay for the expensive treatment if this continues . That 's why doctors often dislike private practitioners- they 're money wolves and mes sup the system at the same time .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,explainlikeimfive,"About radiation ( I do n't think that was addressed in the other threads ) : radiation damages a cell . If you damage it enough , the cell will die . So they concentrate several radiation beams upon the tumor , to kill the cells there .",Germanic,Dutch

This would mean that they absorb food that is digested , if not digest food . This is not true- the liver converts food and waste products into things that can be removed from the body . This is metabolism . That is NOT the same as digestion . I think that 's where you went wrong . # Kidney Latest post : `` The function of the kidneys is to filter blood and remove waste materials while keeping the necessary nutrients in the blood .

I mean , after 1 you 'd kind of know he was n't sterile , would n't you ? @ Iced_Tea : a female is productive for more than 2-4 days . Sperm can survive for up to 3 days outside of the male body . An ovum can survive for two days without insemination . And that does not account for individual differences/special quirks , let alone ovulating a daily early/late .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"& gt ; Actually , you can compare a measured fasting blood sugar to a standard fasting blood sugar and draw conclusions just fine .

It is called `` juvenile diabetes '' because it is more commonly diagnosed at younger ages , but people can still be diagnosed with Type 1 well into adulthood . The more important factor is whether the lifestyle indicates that Type 2 is more likely ; if one has high blood sugars and is obese or inactive or has a poor diet , it is more likely to be type 2 . The most certain way is to test for the antibodies associated with type 1 . Note the probably in my post . & gt ; It is not always faulty from birth . Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin , causing reduced and , eventually , no insulin production . This can happen at any time , though it is more common at younger ages . Okay , thanks . & gt ; That is also fairly inaccurate . Type 2 can be regulated with diet and exercise , yes , but type 1 can not . You can still eat a normal amount of carbohydrates and control blood sugar levels by taking more insulin . Yes , but people are still advised to reduce ( 'cut ' was the wrong word ) or at least regulate carbohydrate intake . & gt ; In tougher to control cases of type 2 , insulin is sometimes used to control blood sugar when diet and exercise are not enough . Probably the most important thing about this that you neglected to mention is that type 2 can be controlled by not being fat in the first place , exercise and diet , oral medication , and insulin , whereas with type 1 , you just get boned with a genetic predisposition or an environmental trigger or something ( nobody really knows ) .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"Cancer is an abnormal , uncontrolled growth of your own cells in the body . This can occur anywhere . The main problem is that cancer does not consist of other ( so called 'foreign ' ) cells , like bacteria , but of your own . Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt ) . Easier to reach = better prognosis . Malignant means that some of the cancer cells have breached the little layer on top , or that the layer is not in place . These cells can then travel through the lymphatic system into your blood and spread elsewhere through your body . They can then form a new tumor there . This is called metastasis , and severely curbs the prognosis . The xkcd comic is about malignant forms of cancer , because , like Randall said , there is indeed no way to make sure that there are no cancer cells left in the body . Until 6 months later , when there is either a new ( small ) tumor or not . Benignent cancer , is not that bad . It can be treated , and after treatment the only problem can be that it returns- because you are more sensitive towards cancer if you have had it once . The 10-year survival rate is actually 50 % , not 60 . It differs per form of cancer- colon cancer is one of the worst .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"Did you eat before the blood test ? If not , the diagnosis does n't stick . That said , there are indeed two types of diabetes . Assuming you 're over 15 , you 'll probably have type 2 . I 'll explain the difference below . Diabetes means that you are not able to properly filter sugar from your blood , or more accurately , absorb it in regular tissue ( muscle , liver , fat etc. ) . Normally , your cells receive a signal from a certain hormone , called insulin , to absorb sugar . In type 1 diabetes , this hormone is faulty from birth ( which is why it 's uncommon to see first symptoms past the age of 15 ) . This is like not being able to feel pain . In type 2 , your cell-receptors have become insensitive to insulin , because they have been exposed to high concentrations of it for a very long time . This can be compared to your brother punching you in the arm for half an hour- at some point you do n't notice it anymore . **Untreated** diabetes can have severe consequences , such as neuropathy ( losing your touch , often in feet and hands first ) and severely increases the chance of cardiovascular disease . It also leads to hypertension ( and thereby increasing the chance of CVD ) etc . Treatment differs per type , but in both cases you will need a strict diet , and mainly cut carbohydrates ( sugars are a form of carbohydrates ) . Type 1 diabetes has the 'advantage ' of being a problem with the insulin that you create , so this can be solved by injecting artificial insulin after each meal . This is not the case for type 2 .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"[ ] ( /awyeah `` I 'm a medical student '' ) The immune system is comprised of two parts : the innate and the adaptive system . The innate attacks anything they feel as dangerous , whereas the adaptive will counter specific antigens . It 's the difference between shutting the door of the city hall , and installing a system that keeps felons out . The innate immune system is comprised of several parts : firstly you skin , and the inner lining of your mouth , gut etc . Cells ( e.g . bacteria ) will have to get through this layer to enter your body and infect you . Just like they need to get through the walls/doors of the town hall . Secondly , you have macrophages and so called Dendritic cells that will 'eat ' anything they do not recognize as being part of your body . This is comparable to the security allowing only people through with a key-card and kicking everybody else out . They will then present a part of that foreign ( that 's the term ... . ) cell to other cells : the lymphocytes . ( B & amp ; T ) This is the security guard taking your picture and uploading it to the database , so everybody else will know what to look out for . The lymphocytes are subdivided in 2 main categories , which are both subdivided even further : * B lymphocytes , consisting of * Plasma cells * Memory cells * T lymphocytes , consisting of * T- helper cells ( subdivided , but this is omitted to keep it within limits ) * Cytotoxic T cells B-cells are formed in the bonemarrow , T-cells in the thymus . Both circulate the blood and lymphatic system , which is where they are activated . Each lymphocyte has a specific receptor , that can only notice one kind of antigen ( facial recognition software in the mugshot database ) . When a T-cell encounter its antigen , the response depends on which type of cell it was that encountered the antigen . * Th cells will activate other cells : the macrophages , B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells . They encounter antigen that is presented to them by macrophages and other cells . This is you alerting one security guard , who then alerts the rest . * Cytotoxic T-cells recognize antigens presented to them by normal cells , like your live cells . They get the signal that the cell is infected and kill the cell to prevent further spread . This is useful against viruses . This is a suicide- one hostage says that there are ten terrorists with him in the room , so they should just blow it up . When B-cells encounter its antigen , often presented by a T-helper cell , they will begin producing antibodies , that cling to the target cell ( that produces the antigen ) and make it easier for it to be eaten by macrophages . This is hiding a transmitter in the felons clothing , so that he can be tracked and weeded out easily . This is the task of Plasma cells . Memory cells will remember the specific antigen , and when they encounter it again they will be activated quicker than the first time around . In other words , he remembers the face and can print out the pictures more quickly . Because you asked specifically about NK cells : NK cells are like cytotoxic T cells , with one big difference : Tc cells have to be activated to kill a cell , whereas the NK are always active- they have to be stopped by the cell itself , otherwise they kill it . This is a back-up mechanism . Normally a cell , once infected , will tell the Tc cells that he 's infected so they can kill them . This is not good for the pathogen inside . So some pathogens ( like the herpes virus ) will prevent that from happening . But when they do this , they change the outside look of the cell . This is recognized by the NK cell , who then kills the cell anyway . This is like a room in a building with terrorists no longer answering the phone- they 're not answering , so the terrorists must be there . # # # This omits the principle of MHC molecules , among other things .

The chocolate and brown layer are called the epidermis , the yellow one is the dermis and the white the subcutis . As you 've noticed- the epidermis has two major parts ( actually five , but hey- keeping it simple ) : a layer of dead cells ( chocolate ) and one of living ( brown ) . If the dead cells burn or get removed , nothing happens . You can eat the chocolate fudge of the cake , and it 'll still be there . This is the epithelial layer . If you were to repair it all you 'd have to do is redo the fudge/glazing . If you have a more serious wound into the living cells , this can be more complicated , but nothing really serious will happen . You can still fix it up nicely from down below , as regeneration starts low and works upwards . This would lead to a clean heal and would still be a first degree burn .

This usually comes from the super-wealthy , who in turn expect legislation that does n't screw them over ( e.g . raising taxes ) . So for someone to get elected , he first has to kiss some rich people 's ass . And then some more . For him , the upside is that he 's elected , for the rich that their interests are safe . If whoever 's elected somehow violates the agreement , no one will fund him , so he wo n't be elected . And this excludes lobbying , which is a whole different can of worms .",Germanic,Dutch

I had mine on , but could n't resist the old saying : Me : `` Go catch some real criminals . '' Police : `` Haha , very funny . Just move along . '' Me : `` Yeah , would n't want to waste your time on some drunk students now , would you ? '' Police : `` All right , step off the bike please ... '' Cue cop being very nice and letting me off with a warning for public intoxication , insulting an officer and possession of an edged weapon ( a Leatherman I carry on me at all times ) .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"Not quite actually . We were arguing mostly over morals , not laws . I am not trying to contest in any case that what he was doing was legal ( except perhaps in the cases of sex with 16-year olds , I know not of his location and related consent laws ) , let alone moral . NWF claimed that I was defending his actions , upon which I did my best to explain the very complex morality issue in cases like this . ( in addition to explaining that I at no point defended his actions )",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"& gt ; So is punishment for all of the people he hurt . Sure , I understand him , but I understand the victims as well and more importantly I tend to sympathize with them a little more than this guy . How do you know if he 's hurt people ? He 's had sex with them , that 's all . The fact that they 're under the age of consent ( possibly not even in all cases , it 's often 16 nowadays ) does n't mean he raped them . Understand this bit for the rest of your post too . The fact that we state that people under the age of 16/18/whatever the set age is wherever you are can not consent to things , does not make what he did rape . If the age of consent is 18 and an 18-year old guy has a girlfriend that 's 16 years old , can he have sex with her ? I agree that the situations are different , just trying to illustrate that **consent can exist , even if we legally state that it doesn't** . You also use the term 'victims . ' Again , this makes the assumption that any of them were actually abused . & gt ; Neither do your rapist apologetic comments . I get the understanding part , but you 're spending more time trying to cut me down for my opinion , then you are for someone who preys on 14 year old girls that he gets drunk and manipulates . But yeah , I 'm the bad guy here for not wanting to be `` understanding '' . Tell me why I 'm wrong , but lets be nice and try to understand the rapist ! Right , stating that *what he 's doing is wrong* ( yes , that 's all I said regarding his actual actions ) is racist apologetic . Yes , I try to alter your opinion . That 's why I comment . I 'm trying to make you see that there 's more to having sex with underage kids than the media would have you believe . Someone ca n't help who he/she is sexually attracted to , we can only learn them that we do not accept them acting on their desires . IMO we should do this . People generally do n't take advice from people that in their mind does not understand them . You see this in all things : kids and their parents , relationship advice , this post to you on reddit . So understanding why he has sex with underage girls is important . There can be tons of reasons for this , plenty of which can be shown to not only relate to young girls , e.g . small boobs . Re : the getting drunk- he has only ( AFAWK ) done this with one , others he has served alcohol . This =/= getting drunk . Also , every guy ever gets girls drunk and manipulates them . & gt ; I agree with that , but does n't apply in this case . He knows what he is doing is wrong , he even said he knows hes going to end up in prison , and on top of that he said he does n't care and is going to continue to do that . All your carebear understanding and forgiveness in the world is n't going to change that guy short of professional mental help which you ca n't supply . Oh , I agree that he should get professional mental help . Do you not think that extending the character of such help through everyday life works though ? Would you be fine with telling someone who attempted suicide that he should feel bad for shit he 's done and that he should jump off a roof ? No ? Moreover , stigmatising people only makes them sheltered . For this person to come out and seek professional help , he needs to be convinced that it wo n't work out negatively for him . For that , it helps for people to say that they understand his position , but do not agree with him . Witch hunting everyone is sure as hell not going to make them walk out their front door . & gt ; I do n't need to understand why he does these things to know that a mid twenties male intentionally getting 14 year olds drunk and trying to get them to `` do anal '' is wrong . It 's wrong . If you need to have a polite conversation with that rapist to understand that , by all means stop wasting your time talking to me and go have a private chat with him . As I explained above , people do n't take advice from people who they think do not understand them . You are also , as is usual in cases like this , extrapolating for the worst from things he says , and combining statements he presented as separate occasions . So no , you do not need to talk to him to understand that what he does in wrong , but to why he does it . Do you think you can get that from talking to anyone but him ? & gt ; Actually , statutory rape is a type of rape , and that is why it has rape in the term . First of all , that logic is flawed . Second , that depends on your definition of rape . If you view it as having sex with someone without consent then you are legally correct , practically not always ( see my example above about 18/16 dating ) . Again , **consent can exist even when we legally state it doesn't** However , it 's mostly defined by the public nowadays as having the inclusion of force , i.e . forcible rape . In which case , it 's something completely different . & gt ; Much like date rape . It 's still rape . This guy is a statutory date rapist , and sounds mostly like a date rapist if anything . Just because he is n't stealing random women off the street and sexually assaulting them , does n't mean it 's not rape , as that type of rape carries that assaul level charges with it . It is rape , but keep trying to sweep this dudes issues under the rug for him . AFAIK date rapists use GHB or similar to be able to take advantage of girls , right ? This is most definitely different- he may be having very consensual sex with the girls that we deem as wrong because they 're underage . That 's different from drugging someone up and feeling them up . & gt ; Your right , he 's a great guy , and we need to just talk to him and treat him nicely and he 'll totally stop being a shit bag . Which is completely what I 've argued this entire time in every post I 've made concerning this topic . See ? I can do sarcasm too . -- - Now , let me clarify something : I do think that what he 's doing is wrong . First and foremost on the account of the fact that he 's using alcohol to take advantage of the girls . The fact they are underage is something I 'm split on- on one hand it 's illegal , on the other hand the girls can be perfectly fine with what happened- as many college aged girls that have sex with men whilst they are inebriated . I like to assume the latter , because that would mean we have someone taking advantage of the girls instead of raping them and because **TBH if this guy does this so much , I 'd imagine one of them would have filed charges by now . ** -- -- - & gt ; Cheers , I wo n't reply to you anymore as I really do n't enjoy having conversations with pseudo intellectual people being apologetic over rapist shitbags . A , so I get a stab too . Thanks , I enjoy that . A shame you do n't like discussions .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,AskReddit,"Yes , you should . It discredits your entire argument and has been pointed out by someone else , understanding is important in cases like this .

The PC will be used mostly for gaming , and the graphics card I have chosen is the MSI GTX 770 `` Lightning '' , which is clocked about 10 % faster then a standard 770 .

Will that chest have different loot , or will it just not be there ? Or maybe it is there , what happens then ? I guess what Im really wondering about is whether I should buy as many unique items ( recipes/diagrams/cards ) as possible , because I will just get different/new items later on when looting/winning cards , OR , if I should save my money and count on finding most of the stuff by looting/winning cards etc .

1337w4rri0r,AdviceAnimals,"The dictionary defines an assault rifle , in addition to being an automatic weapon , as 'a nonmilitary weapon modeled on the military assault rifle , usually modified to allow only semiautomatic fire . ' ( http : //www.dictionary.com/browse/assault-rifle ) So a semi-automatic rifle can be correctly classified as an assault rifle , even though it lacks an automatic firing mode , making the premise for this dank meme faulty . Further on , I think the distinction is meaningless , because it 's not the firing mode that makes the difference for which rifles should be sold over the counter to millions of civilians , it 's the magazine capacity , the ammunition and the designed purpose of the weapon . An AR15 is not made for hunting , it 's made for warfare/security and it 's very powerful at that effect .

1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"As far as I know , meditation and hypnosis is scientifically proven to alter brainwave frequency when practiced , especially in more experienced individuals . I dont find it very unlikely that audio could help in achieving a desired mental state more easily , especially considering buddhist monks have chanted in groups for ages . Whether or not that is true , I find it pretty far fetched that you compare the use of audio to drugs , hyperventilation , crystal vibrations etc . You also seem to be implying that OP 's practice is not 'valid ' , because he/she happened to do so while listening to certain sounds , and that is just silly . All in all , I find your rant about what is right or wrong to be judgemental , non-constructive and quite random .

1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Yeah . Here 's the thing . Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . It is not meaningless at all . Every single thing you do might alter brainwave activity , but the relevant part is in which direction , how much , and for how long . When sleeping , the brain wave frequencies dramatically changes when compared to being awake . Why should it not be measurable on the opposite side of the scale , when highly focused and attentive ? & gt ; I did n't say OP 's practice is not valid , I have no idea what the studies are ( I would guess they 're inconclusive ) . All I 'm saying is that it 's not meditation . Why would listening to certain sounds prevent meditation ? Even if all this audio at certain hz ' is just mumbo jumbo , it could certainly act as merely whitenoise , which many people find useful to prevent distraction .",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Provide some study demonstrating that inducing certain brainwave frequencies brings about some kind of benefit . I did not claim that inducing certain brainwave frequencies provides benefits , and I will thus not defend said non-claim . I merely disagreed with your idea that meditation has nothing to do with brainwave frequencies because 'Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . ' However , my opinion as a layman and # not-an-actual-neuro-scientist , is that brainwaves have a lot to do with meditation , including its benefits . Here is an article about meditation that does not talk about benefits , but changes in brainwaves during meditation . http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100319210631.htm Feel free to read that or google 'hokey new age drug psychedelic buzz seekers studies ' to find your own sources . & gt ; First of all , I did n't say certain sounds prevent meditation My interpretation of your initial post was that you strongly disregarded OP 's meditation as valid , because he/she listened to certain audio while practicing . The title of this thread is 'Found this video to *meditate to* ' . Neither OP or I have claimed that the audio itself can be poured into anyones ears and it can be regarded meditation . & gt ; Also , you 're contradicting yourself here . *Audio does not prevent meditation* and *blocking out audio fascilitates meditation* is not a contradiction , even if reworded by you . I suggest we leave this matter for now , as we seem to not agree even on what we are discussing . You seem pissed off about 'new age stuff ' and I will certainly agree with you on a lot of things in that regard , but I found your initial post to be somewhat insulting , because my opinion is that there were no reason to bring up all that stuff in such a negative retoric , just because OP said he/she meditated while listening to certain audio , which he/she found useful or helpful .",Germanic,Norwegian

Happy House : I liked the song , but I 'm not that fan of female vocal . In Dulce Decorum : A good song and the kind of rock I like . The Chameleons : I have already heard a lot from this band before . A good suggestion , thanks . First Chapter : I heard the songs 'Tomorrow Never Knows ' , 'Garden of Delight ' and '1969 ' . My first impression was that it was a little slow-paced , but I liked it and will probably listen to the whole album another day . I liked 1969 the most . Sisters of Mercy : I started by listening to 'Marian ' and it was one of the better songs I 've heard today , even though I 'm not the biggest fan of songs that last over five minutes . There was something I liked about 'Alice ' but the melody was n't that good in my opinion , but as you said their earlier EPs are better . The two last songs I listened to was 'Walk Away ' and 'Train ' . I really liked both song , especially 'train ' and its different kind of sound . Nick Cave and the bad seeds : I liked the way the vocal talks instead of singing in 'Rings of Saturn ' , really unique . I also listened to 'Into My Arms ' which was totally different . I also liked this song , however it was more of a time-to-relax kind of music , and not what I looked for now . Nick Cave and Warren Ellis : After I had listened to the first two songs I realized that maybe I was listening to the wrong Nick Cave , so I checked out another Nick Cave I found on Spotify . I guess this was the Nick Cave you meant , since this was a more punk like band .

Just want to add on anskie 's comment , the game mechanics of Dota 2 has not really been streched that much , if at all , as Monkey King is the only hero that was made originally for that game engine . All the other heroes were created in the Warcraft 3 map editor , for DOTA 1 , and that limited what you could do and could n't do with spells .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"& gt ; The `` decision on the system using those 3 '' came like 2 years ago . Not what I was thinking , more what Casemiro brings into the starting 11 than you using 3 . I know you have used 3 in midfield for a long time , I 've watched Real a lot since 2013 . Kovacic and Casemiro is different players and Casemiro fit that DM role nicely , leaving Kovacic out of the starting 11 . & gt ; He is the natural heir to Modric who will turn 32 later this year and has shown signs of regression this season . Modric has n't though ... only think is that he might not be able to play that often when it becomes 2-3 games in a week , but he still outperform most midfielders in the world . I still think it 's possible to lure him away . Not a big chance , but definetly one United should atleast look at and see if they can get for a price that is right . But all this was more `` I want us to get him '' , but nothing realistic transfer all in all .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,soccer,"He is behind Kroos/Casemiro/Modric though , and will be so for next season too . Most of his minutes came before Zidane decide on the system using those 3 . After that , he has n't played a lot . Isco is probably before him too , or else Isco could get a reason to leave . It really depends on the system , and yes he is young and all that , but if United comes knocking , saying they would like either Isco or Kovacic , Real could sell with a reason . Asensio is n't sub for those 3 midfielders , and James already seems to be on his way out . Turning 22 , but can be a guranted started at United if he wants to come and play . Real does n't have a big reason to sell because they can just keep him for depth , but the question is if he wants to wait until either of the 3 midfielders right now stop playing for Real , or become a starter for a club ( with possible CL ) I do n't think it 's too out there to suggest a transfer for him , and I think it 's a bigger chance getting him than either of the others ( the reason I suggested it in the first place was because I rather have United spend money on Kovacic than James , not that he was a very realistic buy )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,soccer,"& gt ; I 'm sorry is he supposed to start over Kroos , Modric or Casemiro ? No , not at all and not what I meant . But he is behind them , and will be so next season too .

However , if another team outside top 4 won the CL , it would mean England had 6 clubs that qualified and would need to remove one spot from the league , so only top 4 got it . The rule changed a couple years ago , last time it happened in PL was when Chelsea won CL and finished 6th . Tottenham lost their CL spot because they finished 4th .

This means whenever Ronaldo is with RM , he is `` under a Adidas contract '' while when he does things on his own , he is with Nike . Nike still has his shoes , whenever Ronaldo do interviews on his own he is covered in Nike etc . It benefits Nike more to have Ronaldo on a contract , and also allowing Adidas/RM to use his image rights , than not have him at all . If Adidas had both Ronaldo and Messi , it would blow for Nike not being able to front any so profilic as them . So Ronaldo being in Adidas ads & lt ; Having Ronaldo on contract to use him in private , for Nike . Just my take on it though ...",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; BW an e-sports that had been going for 10 years had almost 0 scene outside of korea , sure in korea it was THE e-sports but korea was just one country . & gt ; or at least for a time , something BW never managed to do . Because the game came out in 1998 , a time where it would have been impossible . What people point out is that BW made the way for every single other game to develope a pro-scene . People saw how in Korea , BW had a competetive scene with many many pros , and saw it would be possible in their own country . Maybe not with BW , but with other , new games . BW showed people that if you organized and the game was good enough , it could be an e-sport . Not just a tournament at your local school , but a country-wide , even worldwide e-sport . It allowed games and developers to push toward this . Starcraft 2 became `` the esport globally '' , no one denies that , but the godfather of all esport is BW . Anyone saying that SC2 could become what it did without BW is n't seeing it right .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Sorry , completly misread your comment . Or maybe I misread Emu401 , and it lead to me thinking you meant `` grapichs is disabled for ladder '' , but I see what you mean now . Did they comment on it ? I saw it and thought they would update it , as it 's not that big a change and probably wont affect gameplay that much , and is a result of monitors at the time being 4:3 , and in their tests they did n't see it as a big change . However , if they already said it 's disabled for ladder , it 's pretty clear .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"BW is still a better game , and also a more fun game for many people . The limitations are something you improve on , it 's not like a new player is as good as a veteran at controlling their army . Of course , not like that in SC2 either , but it 's not as damning to have all your units in 1 hotkey . Which is why BW have a bigger `` compete with yourself '' aspect that many enjoy in games . Look how big MOBA games are when people feel they are competing with themselves to be better , and not feel like the game is unbalanced to favor the other race/player . There is something satisfying to us to get better at things that is harder . Getting better at army control or macro in SC2 is not as good as feeling as getting better at it in BW , so BW just gives a better impression . & gt ; What is toxic though is people arguing that having interface limitations is something positive at a point you can contemplate a community that bashes a more recent game because it has actually evolved and does provide less interface limitations , while improving tons of other aspects to the game . It 's a balance to people bashing older games because they ca n't control the whole army with 1 hotkey . Some see it as interface limitations , other see it as `` the game '' BW is a game where you control 12 units at a game and need to select each induvidual building . It 's the game , it 's not a `` limitation '' in any way , because the game do n't wish you to be able to select more than 12 units . A limitation is how the game was 4:3 , because that 's what the computer screen was . Now , the game is updated to modern standard . That is what a limitation is , not `` being able to only select 12 units '' Also , `` while improving tons of other aspects to the game , what do you mean by that ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; if you could just mass ling 1A it would be wayyyy to easy . Remember that pathing in BW matters . You wont have a ball like in SC2 , however , the 12 unit balances out someone being ahead , it 's more tasks to do therefor harder to be ahead in BW than SC2 . But deathballs are never a good thing in Brood War , and would be a pathing nightmare .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"How would reavers ruin the game ? Other than harrass , they are n't a big deal for Terran , just be sure to have 1 goliath in your army if they use dropships in fights . Or keep 4 marines or so in your base when the timing hits . PvP is different issue . Doubt he would rage about just a random unit like Reaver . Actually , in my many years of playing BW , I 've never raged about a specific unit . However , I can see how Vultures are cancerous for many people .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Yeah you just want broken balance in your favor . Actually , not always . Have someone deathball Protoss and attack a land mine/vulture/siege tank army . Yea , that protoss lost the game easly . Even tho the units pathing in BW make it hard to create a deathball .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,Atleast SC2 BW custom map .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; with regards to deathballs I highly doubt it . Also , in BW you do n't want to approach any army using a deathball . Imagine having a deathball and then a fungual hits , only that the fungual is big enough to hit all your units and it puts every unit , except your strongest , to 1 hp . Yea , that 's Plague for you . Have fun with 1 muta coming in killing 3 of your units with 1 shot . Or have a death ball and 1 storm hits . Or try attacking a siege line-up with a deathball . Deathball is a disadvantage in BW . A protoss having deathball Zealots would never be able to attack a Terran set up with mines and siege tanks .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"1 building select is part of the balance too tho , just like 12 units select . Look at is as , the further ahead you get , the harder it gets to control everything and be effective . Thats why pro 's are so incredible good , they do both the micro and the macro to an incredible extend .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; but if your looking to add more people to your scene i am not so sure your really moving things forward here . Blizzard 's video , before showing HD remaster , at the event was basically a video how people in Korea talked how they used to play BW and spend hours and hours of it . It 's basically marketing old fans that HD is coming out . I think they know their target group : People who used to play BW and/or SC2 that look to play some RTS again . I doubt they are working to get many new players into the BW scene , but I have a theory that they want to develop a new RTS in a new setting/universe , and try to get some RTS hype going again . But changing the gameplay for BW would be a pretty big decision , and big in a bad way . The game already survived 19 years in it 's current interaction , that living through it 's sequel . I do n't think it will change the pull of the game that much .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I respect sc2 for what it is and I would n't see it work if it had the limitations bw has . It would n't . But SC2 is balanced around being able to select your whole army at once . BW is balanced around having only 12 . That 's the point people try to make and why people do n't want to have being able to select more units . A big part of the interest of BW is how difficult it is mechanically . SC2 issue with many BW fans is how the mechanically skill disappered , and it went more down to balance issues that was n't properly fixed the first years of SC2 , and lower ranked players felt the game worked against them in a bad way . BW works against it 's players in a good way , with being mechanically hard , not bad balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"No , it will not . The games will most likely be played through the new game client Blizzard has , so all that happens is that someone starts the game in HD and some in the BW , and they play eachother on the same server , kind of thing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"As Tastosis like to point out , when you can only control 12 units at a time , being far ahead is really difficult to make a big advantage out of , because it gets more and more things to do . Not being able to select your whole army at once is a big balance point .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Yea , I noticed that too when I looked a bit tonight on some videos . The Battlecruiser looks insanely good and what I think they are going to aim for with most units . Hopefully . Zerglings look a bit iffy to me , same with marines . Zealots looked pretty good tho . Terran-buildings , definetly need shadowing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think so , yes , because what it looks like is that BW is moving to the client that SC2/HOTS and so is . In this video , he talks how people with old users will be able to log in/connect the user to the modern one . As I see it , we who now owns BW will need to download it on the new client . And because of that , all I can see is that in the summer , the HD remaster will be sold on that new client , and all play will happen on that client . Meaning people who have BW now outside of the client will not be able to play with people on the new client . But remastered will not replace the BW out now if that 's what you are thinking of . It 's not like they put out a patch that updates the grapichs . The game ( I think , but not sure ) will be out on the client now soon , and then Remastered will be released on the client as a sellling item ( which will be like a DLC to the game on the client ) and it will just be updated grapichs , and everone that play BW , either in its original form or HD , will be able to play together since everyone use the same client ( this last part im 100 percent sure of ) So yea , we will need to buy HD remastered anyway , 100 percent sure , but it 's probably not expensive .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I 've always wondered why people disregarded these The gameplay in BW is very unique to it 's game and engine . The SC2 engine just makes the balance all messed up , and it feels very off putting . It 's nothing like BW , where the gameplay `` flaws '' , or just commanding 12 units at a time , or needing to select 1 and 1 building , is part of the balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; You seem to have completely missed the point of SC : R. SC : R is not meant to replace SC2 and make BW great again , it 's meant to give lifelong fans and ex-players something that can provide a ton of nostalgia and enjoyment by updating an ancient game and giving it modern day features and support for modern software . Anyone that watched the event would see the video Blizzard played before the Remastered trailer . It was basically a `` nostalgia '' thing , and Blizzard knows that . They do n't aim to revieve BW as a globabl esport , but it will definetly help the scene again . I 've been loving the revive for BW the last couple of years , because I loved the game as a kid . But never got to see any live events as in streams . Just VODS on youtube . Now , I can watch Flash livestream himself for every game he plays . Even Nal_ra . It 's amazing . But I do n't expect Blizzard to try push the scene more . I have thought that Blizzard is more trying to get more and more people back into RTS before they release a new RTS set in a new universe . Would be very exciting .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What he meant was that when SC2 came out , Kespa still had tournaments in Korea , but even tho it was BW tournament in the proleague , they added a `` SC2 match '' into the best of 5 series , meaning it was quite forced . Everybody thought SC2 would be the big thing , but it was still a bit more time left for BW really , as it was still big , but with forcing in into the BW scene , it just looked rather disrespectful . Should just have let time pass and the scene make the transition itself , not have a poor SC2/BW hybrid . Probably what he meant .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The coaches stand right behind them in the booth , have n't you seen the International ? & gt ; If timeouts gave better strategic games then that could add value to the game . But it 's ... real time strategy ... People want to see RTS , not a pause screen and someone filming the players for 1 minute . Nobody want to see the best of the best having to take a 1 minute timeout to strategy ... They want to see them being capable of playing at the highest level while coordinate at the highest level and strategy at the highest level , all at once . It 's why the game is so fucking hard to play with 5 individuals with no communication . Just leave timeouts out of the scene , seriously . Nothing kills the experience and flow of a game more than a pause screen and a minute of watching nothing happens , or commentators just talking , or watching the players just talk . It 's a real time strategy game . You play and strategy at real time speed , not with timeouts . If a team need timeout to talk and strategy , they are not a good team .",Germanic,Norwegian

As a Toss player , Reach and Nal_ra were incredible fun to watch . But neither had the `` dominance '' factor .

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"& gt ; but lots of professional sports use them and I could see it being a good experiment . But in Dota 2 , there are 5 players all constantly talking with each other . In sports , it can be difficult for coaches and managers to talk to all it 's players at once . & gt ; Certainly the team using it could take some time to calmly re-assess when they do n't have to focus intently on the micro and decision making of their hero for a few seconds . But that 's the RTS part ... You play , you strategy , you do the micro at the same time as the macro , you plan your next move while doing something else . It 's a big part of the genre . Would every team in Dota 2 say `` Yes , please '' to a timeout ? Yea , definetly . Should it be like that ? Definetly no . It 's what makes the team better and a team with players of less induvidual skill can beat a better team or a team that is ahead in terms of farm and items , because they are better at playing and strategy at the same time .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Why ? Tactical timouts ? ? ? Video games mix them together , you play and strategy at the same time . ARTS , action real time strategy , which Dota is . Being able to have tactical timouts just ruins a big aspect of the game .",Germanic,Norwegian

No kidding , it would be a huge difference if you had unlimited selection and you could just keep all your production in one hot-key , it would just make the game unbalanced .

They have just touched the grapichs and bugs , and let the game be as it is . Changing a lot of the mechanics will change the balance , and while it 's obviously more comfortable playing with the newer features like SC2 have , it 's part of the game in BW and a big part of the `` feel '' of the game . Keeping everything as it has been is not a bad choice , consider how highly the game is rated . I was very happy to hear most of their changes being non-gameplay related . With you saying that you hoped it should be in the SC2 engine , what do you mean with that ? Do you mean like many of the mods in SC2 that is BW ?

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think the biggest selling point would be that it 's a fresh universe , really . Blizzard making an RTS outside Warcraft/Starcraft . & gt ; '' It 's like SC2 , but with cannons instead of lasers ? '' Simplifying it a bit too much , are n't we ? See the huge difference between the Warcraft series and Starcraft series , despite both being RTS from Blizzard . They will find a way to do it different enough . Overwatch is something completly new and outside Blizzards comfort zone , and it 's amazing . A new RTS game soon , and with soon we are talking 2-3 years to announcment , will be a fitting time . Soon , as in `` 4-5 years from now '' , and by then SC2 will be , what , 10 years old ? Actually , 11-12 years . So why would n't they try to make a new , big RTS ? Selling points : Set in a completly new universe , it 's 12 years since the release of their last big RTS ( biggest difference in their RTS release are just 7 years with WC3- & gt ; SC2 ) , try to bring back the fans that have left Blizzard because they do n't play any of their games ( because RTS are the only ones they are interested in )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Tell them , BW is a game where you compete a lot with yourself in terms of getting better . Yes , you can only select 12 units , and yes , only build from 1 building at a time . It 's really hard . But the better you get at it , the more fun is it . It 's really rewardful getting better at the mechanics . Tell them , this is not a limitation of the game , but rather rules of the game , just like most sports have rules about how big of a field you play on , or how many people can be on one team at a time . Also , I ca n't remember I 've lost a game and felt it was because the game fucked me over , rather that I played badly or the opponent play better . There are no balance-whining .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; People do not understand that at this point , any RTS game that pulls some attention is good for any of us . I love that Blizzard did a BW HD remake , and my hope is that it 's to get more `` older fans '' , aka . those who stopped playing BW and SC2 , to get some feel for the RTS genre again ( I 've been playing RTS my whole life , from BW to SC2 to WC3 and now back to BW , so I love the genre ) I hope with increased interest in BW HD , they are `` making a fan base '' before launching their new RTS , set in a completly new and fresh universe . But since it wont have `` Warcraft '' or `` Starcraft '' attached to it , it 's biggest pull must be `` Blizzard RTS game '' , and it will be a wider base of fans if as many as possible play a RTS Blizzard game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 've seen a couple of comments on here about players doing some sort of `` tutorial '' , but nothing recent . But the game has n't been patched since 2001 , and most builds are viable even tho some are preferred than others . Day9 dailies are many BW videos , check them out maybe . Other than that , just watch many pro-games , as the action is often slow in the start and you will pick up some openers and build orders . The standard build openers are nothing crazy and pretty easy to learn actually . The difficult stuff are doing a good execution and deal with your opponent .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Thank you for posting , I admit I did just post this quickly when I remembered ASL S1 casting .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"It 's also a nice `` intro '' to BW as far as understanding what 's going on . For us that are a bit more aware , it did become a bit repetative , but it 's alright since the casters are some awesome people with lots of passion . They changed a lot in S2 tho , so if one know the game or watched season 1 , it 's a really good `` follow up '' into watching some amazing series .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Watch the ASL S1 , and ASL S2 , on Afreecatvlive on youtube , with english commentary . Especially S1 , where casters like Tasteless , Artosis and Rappit point the commentary to newer players and SC2 players that never played BW . You will learn A LOT .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Nukethestars and moletrap are the two I watched the most ( I know there were others doing commentary , but I liked moletrap for his wide knowledge about players , and Nukethestars for his voice , also his passion ) I remember Cholera ( ? ) and Klazart-something being two others , but never got into any of them .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; No multiple building select and manually rallying workers to mine makes it unfun to play for me . No multiple building select is part of the balance . And , you might enjoy getting good at it . Part of the satisfaction with BW is how you compete with yourself at getting better at the game , at it 's mechanic . It 's not a limiation , it 's part of the game . Imagine going on a football pitch and complaining that the field could be a lot bigger so you have more area to run around on . Yes , that 's true , but the rules of the game decide you have to stay on it . But I can definetly see it being less fun for many since it takes focus away from controlling the army and doing more `` acitve '' stuff , but it 's just part of the game . Workers automatically mining was actually a change I would like to see , but it 's not really a big deal in the end . Keybindings are really sweet to have , but I realised that all buildings and units current hot-keys are so burned into my brain , that I 'm more sure I will be able to handle it better using legacy hotkeys ... Will be hard to change , even tho key-bindings are a lot better ofc .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I remember playing a lot of BW and thinking back , I was so horrible ( to my defense , I was like 10 and only had played it for myself ) , think 1 worker per mineral , in the mineral lines . Then I found the pro-scene , and oh boy , did I learn a lot . Just watching the pros play will make someone a lot better , and now we live in an era where most pro 's stream every day and you get FPVOD of anyone ( back in the days , up until SC2 release , it was unheard of having FPVOD of the pros , it was as holy grails )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Lol , not in BW . A move into a tank/vulture army that is correctly setup ? Yea , your zealots are dead and your dragoons will most likely die . I think you are likely joking , but it 's interesting to see how a BW fight can be changed just with adding some flavor . Fast arbiter tech has been popular in recent meta , and works wonders most often . But a Toss army A-moving into a sieged up , mine-laid terran army are just too weak , unless it 's the toss catching the terran army off-guard . 200/200 army Terran will crush most things in the game , but the strenghts of Zerg/Toss is how they have spell-casters to even the scale .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Definetly looks better in your edit , and my `` theory '' is that they have made everything to look remastered , and will polish with comparing the models now , the ones they made and the old , and add details/changes ( like your edit has done ) to make them more similiar . I think the issue I have with remaster is how everything looks really `` shiny '' , or too flat , definelty needs the hard shading that BW have . Still , really excited to try it with new grapichs , but it will be really , really hard to move away from the current BW look , if the HD do n't `` improve '' My biggest fear is the HD remaster kinda staying too `` weird looking '' for me , and throw me too much off , and then the pro-scene use the HD look . I 'm actually quite interested in how that is going to turn out . I 'm just so in love with the BW look that I hope it stays that way ... And it 's something poetic that a game is being broadcasted with the same look for 20 years and going strong .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Bugs develop into features , but they are releasing some fixes , like Dragoons will stop and not do any commands . The pathing issue is a feature in the old engine , not a bug . The engine used in BW have a `` timer '' that updates the pathing every few second . Every x second , the unit will `` update '' it 's pathing , but it can cause for weird movements when a unit try to , say , go down a ramp because it 's pathing gets `` blocked '' when the timer updates . This is not bugs . This is the engine . People like the engine and they wo n't fix it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s Day9 demonstrates it here . Also , just because some of us like the weird mechanics and pathing , does n't make us `` neckbeards '' , it 's just something satisfying with flaws like that . The smooth movement in SC2 is great , it 's works really good for that game . But if one have played BW , one could easly see how the smooth pathing and units clumping up would not work for the game . And as you can see in Day9 's video , it 's possible to counter this if you are good enough .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If true , I can see BW coming back big . Some of the best with it was after losing a game you would just jump into a custom game and relax for a bit . It might be old tech , but so many of the maps are fun .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"BW 1.18 will be F2P , not sure if they meant BW HD will be free to play .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Not really , and who knows , maybe Blizzard is n't that caught up in making big bucks for BW HD , and it does n't seem so with BW free patch ( even tho making BW free and have many come back to it , reliving how amazing it is , will have them buy BW HD , is a great move ) I think they most likely just want to have so many as possible back , and making BW free and releasing BW HD is going to have 2 games drawing people back into the scene .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Really a selling point for me , together with classic gameplay . Do n't care much for updating the grapichs , but the rest is so good to see being implemented .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 'm already playing BW as of now , so if it turns free it 's not a big deal , I just hope it means more people coming in .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Modern matchmaking tho , and the 1.18 patch leading up to it will try fix bugs and also make it more compatible to more modern PCs , so thats big too .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"For some , this is n't a big deal . But for some of us it 's on the level of SC2 announcement . Taking BW up to modern age , in term of match making , a bit grapich update but still keeping the old gameplay style , is amazing news !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"`` Modern Online Play '' , not sure if there is any other way to take that than matchmaking system .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If you have ever wondered why pathing is bad , check out Day9 video on it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s It 's not a `` Pathing issue '' , it 's literally how the engine is .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Its a fucking video game . Most people excited for this do n't care if BW does n't have a flawless engine with perfect pathing . Few that played BW back in the day is at an age or level that they can become any sort of profesional in it . & gt ; Did n't realize the SC community had completely fossilized at this point . It 's a 20 year old game . I 'm probably one of the younger people putting several hours into the game , and I 'm 22 . The target audience just want to play BW with a good match-making system and is happy they did n't change any of the gameplay . If you watched the event , they even had the lead up to it being people in their late 20s to late 30s talking about how much they enjoyed playing it back in the day , and this is just to bring a new looking BW to those who wants it . If you read up , you will also know that BW players playing 1.18 will be able to play against 1.18 BW players , which is why they wo n't change the big gameplay features like pathing . Is the pathing bad ? Obviously , the engines 20 years ago are like that . Does it need fixing ? Not really . It 's the game , and if you do n't like it , just do n't play it ? Many other games out there you can play , do n't see why you latch on this or even take time to comment if you do n't like what they are doing . Just do n't play BW . Surely you have better things to do . Also , if with pathing you also mean how the units move and with clumb up like in SC2 , you have not an eye for gameplay features like that , because it 's essential for lots of the BW gameplay to be like that .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Overwatch Blizzard releasing a game like Overwatch was definetly a big , big risk . Usually you make a game after your reputation and fanbase , and while Hearthstone was kinda `` out there '' , it 's not so weird for the fanbase to see Blizzard making a card-game based on Warcraft . However , Overwatch was one not in any genre Blizzard was familiar with , was even a FPS , and on top of that , a whole new universe and franchise . And it was great !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Well , this is just an issue because Avilo is a new account , surely ? He will play up to getting his rank , but will need to play D 's first . It 's been like this for ages and the BW community always wanted that matchmaking system new games have . Obviously did n't `` desperatly '' need that new system , seeing how it all turned out , but it 's a big deal to keep lower ranked players staying and improving .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think , the biggest atmosphere factors will the sounds and the music . Seriously , sit down and just listen ( without eyes open ) during a fight and it 's all about the music and the sounds effect of every shot fired , or death sounds or spawn sounds or the music playing in the background . I think HD can really get a BW feel if you have all elements included .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I will be very impressed if they have , or well , I can see they `` updating it to 4k '' , but remaking completly new cutscenes , same quality as SC2 ? Doubt it .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; because this game will only push the downfall of SC2 ... . When the HD announcement was made , they played a video that was basically people in Korea recalling their time when they used to play SC ( as in SC1 ) and talk about all their memories . Very marketet at `` remember SC1 ? Why not come back for a bit , watching it again , and play it again with updated grapichs ! `` , and not so much about getting new players into it . However , SC2 got it 's big chance and it 's been amazing that it has lasted so long . Few games ( as games that you have to buy to purchase ) has lasted so long . Think about games that came out in 2010 , and how many have big tournaments as of lately ? There are not many RTS out now , so we might be able to have all BW and SC2 , other options I can think of is WC3 and Age of empires 2 , but not many others . If Blizzard is willing , they can support both a BW scene and SC2 scene , and many people will be playing both . And nice thing with BW is that all balance is done and they basically wont need to use time or money to work on it anymore . I also doubt many that already left SC2 community will come back to BW if they did n't come back to SC2 already . Idk , just think the RTS genre is on it 's way down , and BW HD might be a sort of plan to get more people back into the RTS genre , before Blizzard is dropping a new RTS . What would be amazing is a new RTS game in a new universe/setting , in the same way Overwatch is its own universe . I think Blizzard have seen that , a problem with SC2 might not be gameplay or balance , just that people are sick of playing in the same universe for 20 years . Maybe it 's time for something completly new and fresh . At one point , people just need to accept that SC2 has had it run , and do n't talk bad or think bad of BW growing . BW is an amazing game , better than SC2 ( coming from someone that loved playing it and rate it highhy ) , but a revive of BW might mean we get another RTS soon !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The grapichs of WC3 is pretty alright , but I do think some would welcome some balances . As far as 1v1 go , there are most likely more about `` the races themselves '' that really have the issue , like the Blademaster being incredible strong , so not going him as first hero is ... well , it 's cheesy not to , which makes it a bit , idk , boring ? Same with Demon hunter for night elves . And the meta is kinda stale , the same builds vs. the same races , but I still find the game very fun to play and watch , mostly because of the heroes coming into effect and changing up each game ( as with item drop or good spells/hero combos )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; If the BW esport scene thrives it will hold a unique position in that it is one of rare , if not only game that has `` settled down '' . Blizzard just got incredible lucky with the `` flaws '' of the game . Like the developer here brought up , it 's okay that not every reaver shot connect . The reason for this is if it did , the reaver would be so incredible strong in harrass . It would mean as soon as reaver landed in your base , you would not be able to run away with your workers ( as the pro 's do now , and is an incredible skill to jump between the bases to move the workers quickly ) With every shot connecting , the reaver shot would hit however , even if it landed behind the minerals patch or far away . So that 's a flaw that just is needed to stay it , or the balance gets a bit icky . E : Also a point that Tastosis likes to bring up , is how the game balances its self with limitation . Being able to just select 1 building or just 12 units at a time , means that the further you get ahead , the harder it gets ( an army with many , many units and spellcasters are difficult to handle , vs a smaller army ) so it 's nicely balanced that you can sacrifice and come back without having to straight up fight a stronger army .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Probably for the best that back in 1999 the developers did n't get a message from thousands of people over every single change and every singel one with an opinion , a disagreeing opinion , would be able to talk shit to them over how they ruined the game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,That 's a hilarious story haha,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The game will become free , as in , Starcraft Brood War out now will get a patch , 1.18 , that makes it free ( basically , free to download ) Then , Starcraft BW HD will come out in the summer . I 'm not 100 procent sure , but look at is as an expansion pack , or a DLC , that allows you to play with the updated grapichs . However , you still play on the same servers as the ones just playing BW . So the community will not be split between the two 's . Most likely it will be in the same client as SC2 , but we will see . All it means is that us that play it now will just have to DL it in the client . Nothing biggy . I think the only thing that is redone is the grapichs . Doubt they would put the money into new cutscenes , as it is very expensive and they do n't expect a huge income probably . There are also not that many cutscenes , so we are n't really losing out ( the old ones still look great IMO ) , however , as it is so few , so why not ? But my quess i no .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I figured it was a shading issue , but it 's probably in it 's polishing stages . Yea , I hope what they got now is kinda what they have `` build up '' themselves , and now they will look at their models , compare it to the BW models , and then shade/change to make it look more alike , but keeping the new style .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Along with the dramatically improved visuals , StarCraft : Remastered will also bring modern connectivity to the game , including full Battle.net ( now Blizzard App ) support for matchmaking and chat , enhanced ladder functionality , and support for friends lists , streaming , and cloud saves . The new matchmaking feature will automatically connect players of equal skill based on their chosen race , but the game will also continue to support the original matchmaking system—which is to say , no matchmaking at all . & gt ; '' If you remember , the original StarCraft didn ’ t have a button like Warcraft III , '' Stilwell said . `` Players threw down a gauntlet in chat channels or hosted open game lobbies for other players to join and discuss terms . We ’ re retaining that style of interaction as an option . That is an essential element of the game ’ s culture . '' What they are saying is that the game will get a new matchmaking system like that , but they will also keep the old style for those who wan na do that , and it basically keeps custom games as they are . So we get both , but I do n't think the lobby-based system will count towards your rank .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What OP do n't seem to understand it 's all about exposure and maintaining a fan base . There are some that currently enjoy both SC2 and Brood war , and some that enjoy neither . And also those who enjoy SC2 only , and those who enjoy BW only . Blizzard know there are many people in that BW-only category , fans of Blizzard games that have left SC2 . Giving that category of people a new and fresh start will make them continue use a Blizzard product , which is important and will allow Blizzard to produce new product in the future because they have a big fanbase . Ignore the current BW fanbase , and you might lose out on people who will be excited for new products . OP also dont seem to see this is a rare phenomenon , a 19 year old game having a huge fanbase and a viable market . Only other thing that comes close is Age of empire 2 HD . BW HD wo n't make huge sales , so it 's not a `` greedy company '' thing , I think they truly love SC1 at Blizzard , and this is something they want to do for the game .

Arsenal did well for many years , and then they build Emirates so they could financially battle vs. the other top clubs . However , the fans have now obviously seen that the board and owners are happy with a top 4 finish and make money , rather than doing what they promised and compete with spending money they earn .

Obviously a group of fans have become sick of some making money off Arsenal losing and , while calling themselves `` Arsenal fan TV '' , is just showing disgust in a disrespecting matter towards the club .

The eldians that fight for Marley ( Reiner/Bertholt ) know their attack was a horrible thing to do , but thet view it as a necessesary thing to do , so the marley change their view on the eldians in the Marley nation . Also , the marleys need to titan powers to fight back other nations . And other nations are probably scared of the Marley because of they hold the titan power . And the Paradise Island inhabitants now view Marley as the enemy , because of the attack . But isnt Marley 's action reasonable consider what history say ? A people all capable to become huge titans should not hold much power and control others . But what if that history is fake ? I think we will end SNK without having a `` good '' outcome , and many lives were lost for no good reason , just like real life . History is written by the victor after all .

And now , many years later , I 'm able to catch every pro-game played . Truly amazing having BW come back during a time period where streaming is so accessable and I 'm older and not just a kid sitting on youtube listening and watching koreans play video game ( I discovered the english casters later , like 2010 time , and continued watching people like Sayle after the korean scene disappeared ) BW have been such big part of me growing up , despite I 've never been good at it , and I do n't know anyone else that play it .

Verbual `` harm '' to the refree will get you banned for 4 games , physical harm will get you a life-ban . Verbal harm towards other players get you nothing , elbowing them gives you 3 or so . If elbowing a player is 3 matches banned , then dangerous tackles should be atleast 3 too . That 's my whole point . You cant compare the situations and justify that the dangerous tackles should have bigger bans . Because Messi did nothing to another player .

My main point is that you ca n't compare a ban given for something one did to a refree , and something that a player did to another player . Refree-punishments will always be harsher .

Toss and Zerg pretty much overrun them early without their tech . Protoss you got many options . Teching to dragoon is just one mineral-only building , and then you can just pump zealots and dragoons .

The most important thing for protoss really is just expand , atleast vs. Terran , and just get that income to create lots of dragoons and zealots as you will most often not do favourable trades . Zerg got it the hardest . You kinda need everything . It 's popular to either get just hydras/lurkers or just mutas , but you also kinda want a zergling/lurker/muta tech . And late game tech you also need everything , like ultras , defilers , lurkers , zerglings . Mutas are too expensive to keep building tho , but they are really good to have mid game . Need to expand far away from your main base is your key , as it will take longer time for the other races to attack you , and you can just out-swarm them . As far as the play styles go , Terran is a lot turtling , Zerg is very swarming and Protoss is a middle-thing , can do alright on 2 bases , but unfavourable trades on 2-bases loses them the game . It 's really hard to compare them at all . Only thing you can really keep in mind is how units a relativly the same strenght , as in how much hp one zealot have or a zergling or a marine .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Not what I mean . I mean , Warcraft is an established franchise . Starcraft , Diablo too . Overwatch was completly new . I want their next RTS to be completly new story too . Forget gameplay , it can be the same . & gt ; The same would likely happen in a WC4 vs WC3 scenario . Would still be `` Warcraft '' and people might be sick of it by now , between the former games and WOW . I just think people want a fresh , new franchise from Blizzard . I know people want WC4 , I want it too , but I think Blizzard should go for something new , like they did with Overwatch . Establish a new universe for their RTS . So , nothing about the gameplay or the characters or the changes it would be from Warcraft 3 to WC4 . It 's still warcraft . And I think Blizzard is at the point with their games that saying `` a non-WC/SC/Diablo game '' has more pulling power . People would be more interested in that .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I see you point . Still feel Zerg have it more messy because of 1 tech-building per unit . Protoss got it a bit too , but when they tech to templars they get zealot speed at the same time , or Dragoon range from cybernetic . Factory builds vultures and tanks with an add-on , so it 's pretty easy . Spawning pool , hydra den , spire , ultralisk tavern and defiler mount , + queens nest . It 's a big amount of buildings really .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; We need innovation and iteration . Unlimited unit select and great pathing you have in SC2 . BW is older generation and people love how it is , that it 's old . Lets keep it like that other than the grapichs .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Arbiters vs. Zerg are seldom , and reavers are like a big option vs. both terran and zerg ( very useful late game zvp tho ) It 's pretty much gateway & gt ; cybernetics core & gt ; stargate , then maybe reavers , or else just templars . Not too crazy of a build . What I meant with `` all tech buildings '' is that as terran , you can hold stop when you get factory for a while . Armory you wan na get later for upgrades and vessels because they are crazy good , but you do n't need much more . Zerg build induvidual buildings just for the tech , still create from hatcheries . So it 's like , a terran can just build to factory and stop for a while , protoss can skip stargate tech for a while , but zerg , you just really wan na get to that late game tech because it 's useful . Obviously there are many different builds and so on . But I do n't think it 's too out of the way to say that terrans = less tech buildings , than zerg tech .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; but you 're not going to be producing mutas and lurkers together . Yea , that was kinda my point tho in the first post . Zergs often get mutas , but do n't stay on it unless they plan a lurker/muta/zergling combo against a terran , but this can be a meta from like , 10 years ago , that is just stuck in my head . But I agree , yea , either they skip mutas or create 11 mutas then stick to lurker . But my point still stand : Zerg get most tech buildings .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Well , maybe they have to . Only big pulls I can think of is `` WC4 '' or `` Blizzard is making an entire new RTS ! '' We 'll see soon enough .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; you 're never building more than 2 different combat units at once , there 's never a time where you build both muta and lurker , you just choose one . Have to excuse me for not remembering it fully , I just talk from all the year that I 've been watching , so the builds are all up in my head a bit mixed . Like , I know I 've seen pro games where you get both mutas and lurkers , so you do n't need to tech to defilers so quick or something . Mostly because 3 hatch-muta is more an opener to get the 11 mutas to harrass , and then you still need to get lurkers . Hydra-bust is kinda seen as cheesy tho , is n't it ? Because you kinda go for that bust , but if it fails , you are behind in tech etc . Well , I just have the impression over the years that Zerg really wan na try to get all tech , to have more options .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"He 's a solid actor , no doubt , but him being a superstar is making people view his acting in a better light .

It was just a bit annoying how people said `` he deserves it , he deserves , Wow leo has n't an oscar , he really deserves it '' , when I find non of his performances Oscar-worthy and tons of other actors with great performances get no credit at all , or have a long career with great performances , and has no `` he deserves an Oscar ! -fanclub '' Last year there was n't a huge competition . Still do n't think his performance in `` The Revenant '' is Oscar worthy ( love the film btw ) , and him winning it purely because of his name is kinda getting me fired up .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Non of the performances in those films listed are Oscar worthy to me ( except maybe Gilbert ) Never said he was bad , and he certainly has flashes of great when playing on his strenght , seen in `` Django Unchained '' And those years he has been nominated for the Oscar , he has lost to a worthy and much better performance . I just have never watched a movie where after I saw it I went `` wow , that 's was an Oscar worthy performance for di Caprio '' And there is my point ; He 's just a likeable guy that people start talking about `` deserve an Oscar '' because he has been a star for more than 2 decades , in similiar way to Buffon this year when people say he deserves a top 3/nomination .",Germanic,Norwegian

Your winning is still 1600 , because you made the bet when it was 16/1 chance . `` We all know Ronaldo will win it '' is fair to say , and why his odds are the lowest ( lowest return ) Some people gamble and put money on Messi now .

29255DaysToGo,reddevils,"Even this season we had flashes of his brilliance from last year , but it 's very easy to see , at the start of the season , he was burned out and very tired .

29255DaysToGo,reddevils,"Yes he is . It 's your opinion to say otherwise , but to me atleast he is , and no matter what he achieve with Real will change my mind about it . First United player to win Ballon d'Or with us since the holy trio , 50 years prior , best player in the world for us and was a huge reason to the teams success when he played here . I neither care what the casual person know/associate players with , anyone with some knowledge would know Ronaldo became the kind of player he is at United . He might not be `` the '' legend or a legend in the way Giggs is for his longevity , or the biggest legend , but a legend non the less .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Not many players that rely on speed/pace have a career past their 30s at a top club thoug .

Unless he was a freak of nature like Ronaldo .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Players that rely on pace decline faster when hitting their 30s , and Rooney was such a player . Not many players at a top club that is past 30 rely on speed and type of play that Rooney did . And I never said Rooney did n't hit his potential , or compare to Ronaldo , not at all . But you act like his last couple of years ruined his career , and also that he should be in his prime right now , when his style of play heavly fall with age .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,reddevils,"Just because Ronaldo left for Real does n't make him any less of a legend . When he was at the club he gave us 110 percent and led us to domestic and European success , while being the world best footballer in the world ( first to win Balon in 50 years with the club ) , cementing us as the best and biggest club in the world at the time . Even when Real came knocking in the summer he decided to stay for another year and even extend his contract so we got as much as possible , and since then he has done nothing to respect the club . Would you blame a player for chasing his childhood dream and play for Real Madrid ? It 's not like money was a factor , and he had served the club . Also , we are fucking Manchester United and a player that leaves in his prime does n't factor into how we should think about them if they served the club rightfully .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,First OD pick from IG in 3 months ( if anyone wondered ),Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"They did have a winning condition ; Get ahead early , get all the roshans and use aegis/cheese to push highground with Bristle and lifestealer in front and Bloodseeker aghs Rupture forcing the cores on IG to having to stand and fight . By that time your line-up should be far enough ahead to win the team fights . What failed was the lifestealer , and somewhat bloodseeker , being underfarmed despite the more towers/map control from Secret , because they farm so slow compared to IG 's cores . When you farm slow , it does n't matter if you got both jungels open . Lifestealer spending time infested in a Rubick is never a great idea . Maybe if they had a faster farming carry they could have closed it earlier , but what other carry can you send alone botlane ( since they played CM jungel/RubickBristle off ) , when IG has n't picked their offlaner yet ? Probably just life .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"And the more melee cores that get popular , the stronger he gets . The hardest part about playing a melee core is if someone just run away with all the utility items . Having rupture on you make that not an option , and then the melee core on the enemy team just wreck you . Bloodrite is such a good spell too .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"It was a good pick for what they did though , they went Rubick/Bristle top with CM in the jungel , what other carry can you send bot alone there ? What really broke Lifestealer this game was the constant fighting . Lifestealer farm so slow compared to many other cores , and even though Secret was ahead and had the whole map , Life just farms so slow . You saw the same with Bloodseeker , they both were behind the cores on IG even if they had the full map . They are just slow farmers compared to Razor/DP/Void .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Their line up had 1 stun , casting cold feet and getting a 3.5 sec stun is pretty big actually . No AA player would expect Rubick to go for your ice blast , for the reason you mentioned . Why would rubick be in position to try getting iceblast from an AA in the back ... Just good plays from Yapzor really .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,He went in to use cold feet on a melee hero in a fight . That 's why it was stolen .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,AA used ulti and went in to use cold feet I think . Yapzor had uphill vision so he was able to catch it .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"DP has cast animations , if a rubick player know he is in range , it 's a pretty easy pick up as soon as you spot the `` exorcism animation '' The time window is short , but not instant as it is for Void . I would put the Void not using W as a , well , `` cocky '' move , as he throw down his ulti and see him catching the cores , thinking they are so far ahead in the fight and just dropped using W. But misplay by Void , but Yapzor being in position to steal it and then throw it down on 3 enemey heroes is big plays anyway .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Nope , Blood was essential to the win . Rupture forced DP/Razor/Void to stand still and not able to just run away from Lifestealer and Bristle . Blood was a great last pick .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"https : //www.dotabuff.com/matches/3234831963 Lifestealer picked after a Nyx , DP , AA . However , Secret played dual top/CM jungel strat , maybe they figured they needed a strong solo bot-lane carry , and lifestealer is one of the best at that .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Midone build him completly right now though , going for the spell dmg talents and just standing back with casting spells and ruptures . Atos probably is n't needed when you will just rupture a target and it will need to stand still . I guess in pubs Atos is a fair pickup because the lack of team coordination and TP reactions when a blood iniate .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"So secret pick a line-up that gets a 15k lead , but apperantly it 's a bad one ? If you were n't blind , you would see every time Secret wanted to push highground , IG 's ulties was off cooldown , and when even then it 's hard to push highground vs. non-ulti with 3 cores . IG had a superior team-fight draft , but they still lost the game because of the Rubick draft from Puppey . It 's so fucking stupid to say `` Secret won because of Yapzor 's absured plays '' , when Puppey drafted Rubick with him in mind stealing the team fighting abilities that Secret did n't have ... .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,Bloodseeker was almost as good as Rubick this game because Rupture forced IG 's cores to stand still and not being able to just run away from the Secret players .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Lol , see the 3k mmr player talking .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Christ , seeing highlights of the game and how rupture can just force a 20k networth core to having to stand still , it 's insane , probably an underrated spell by most people",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Are you shitting me ? The bloodseeker pickup was an incredible call , the rupture was as game winning as Yapzor 's plays .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,Probably imagined they would just have Rubick being caught inside the chrono .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Bloodseeker was an insanely good pickup , Puppey need credit for that . The rupture did insanely much for Secret this game , even tho Yapzor is obviously MVP this match .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"YAPZOR STOLE CHRONO AND THEN STOLE DP ULTI , WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS GUY ? !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"That 's why he is going the build he is . Aghs give him extra rupture , which force the cores on IG to stand still . That allows Bristle and Life to not be kited the whole fight by having razor/dp/void just run away . His silence deal pure dmg and is a huge AOE silence . And now he have dagon with his bloodrage , dealing lots of magic dmg vs. a armor-heavy line up .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"They ran a Rubick/Bristle offlane with CM jungel . Any other carry you would pick and send alone botlane , when the enemy team has n't picked an offlane yet ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Lifestealer is a slow farmer , and he spend a lot of time infested and participating in fights ( which they needed because of IG 's superior team fight ) Lifestealer and also Bloodseeker was behind IG 's core , even though Secret had the whole map . It 's because they farm slow . But what other carry do you pick to go solo botlane vs. a lineup that has n't revealed their offlane ? Secret played with CM heavely in jungel and Bristle/Rubick offlane . Lifestealer was n't a horrible pick ... If IG picked an offlane that would rape a solo-botlane , Life is one that can just go into the jungel to recover .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,IG came 3/4th at Kiev Major and won DAC this year . Meanwhile Secret had nothing to show for . The other 4 invites were also teams that had either performed at or won premier tournaments in 2017 . Secret invite would be an insult to the rest of the premier tournament winners that did n't get one .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Let me correct myself ; having Lifestealer/Blood trying to farm the whole map like they were a Sven/flash farmer , would not be the best soloution . Yes , lifestealer/blood could probably be 2k networth higher , but sharing the farm with CM/Rubick and having Bristle get a lot of it is a better choice than having Blood/Lifesteaer slowly farming . If it was a carry that could actually clear the jungel or take stacks , they would probably do it differently .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Seriously , EG 's players are some of the chillest dudes , True sight showed that . I really like Arteezy too . Many of the EG fans however , seems like horrible `` fans '' in the sense that they are horrible to be around whenever EG play .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"My point with that was that IG has had a stable roster since september , and all the wins/achivements/games since then was won and played by the same players . Why take Secret 's game 6-12 months back into consideration when they were a completly different team ? And by that , you need to have a shorter time period to take into consideration . That was just my point . If Secret win this + Summit , an invite can be justified over some other team . Because then they have actually won something , at their best .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Trying to counter point this : Despite having a lackluster season , 25 matches without losing is a feat in itself IMO . If we did n't have to struggle with injuries , and especially not having Zlatan completly out in one of the more important stages of the season , I 'm sure we would finish top 4 . We are obviously still a step below Chelsea/Tottenham this season , but I think we was fairly hanging on with Liverpool/City . We already had one of the best defense in the league , and with building on the team into the next season , we could probably get a top 4 finish fairly comfortable . Maybe , if the window was amazing enough and all buys fit in perfectly , we could go for a title challenge . Mourinho know how to win a league , and the team got the defense to do so , and with the right buys going forward , the team looked capable . However , obviously would need to improve in many areas and especially against top 6 . Is the team a decade away from winning ? Who knows . The best in the league are always so good . Transfer windows gets harder and more important , but all buys last windows turned out fairly good . & gt ; Throwing money at stars without having the right balance in the squad wo n't get you anywhere Also , what the fuck does this mean , because as I said , the buys were all fine , the team got great defense and just lacked finishing this season . I understand the point of view , but you are just writing stuff that is repeated again and again about teams that do n't perform . Right balance ? ? ? Liverpool finished 2 points away from the title some years ago with having 50 goals let in . Chelsea won it a couple years ago scoring only 73 goals . Chelsea this year had a balance and just performed every week , maybe due to not having to be concerned about European football ? How todays game work , it 's impossible to say how even next season is going to be . & gt ; And missing that many chances is n't bad luck but actual lack of quality . So ... buying a striker that finish chances and then we have a shot at the title ? Because that 's the only big thing the team is missing . Finishing chances .",Germanic,Norwegian

Dota is and will be a game that is always battling to keep it 's players interested , just like every other game ever . Games struggle always to stay fresh , to evolve , to be on top , and it 's even harder to do so when you have a game where you just play 1 match , and that 's it , compared to an RPG . Dota has and never will be a `` casual '' game . It 's not something whoever can pick up and enjoy . So go for most MOBA games , it 's just that some are easier than others . And Dota is the hardest . And when it battles with other Mobas , like LoL , which more plays and is easier to pick up , it will always struggle to get new player . 7.00 was n't a step to , how can one put it , `` become casual '' , neither to become a better and more interesting game . It was to refresh the game . And it did , for many people . For many people , it drove them away , but that 's because many , like me , was `` afraid '' of this change , when I see now that it was a great and interesting move to refresh something stale . I 've played Dota for many years . When 7.00 came out , I thought it was a hugely drastic change . But playing Dota now , it 's not that different from what it was a year ago . Those that stop playing the game , will stop playing the game no matter what happens . And there will be some new players , but just like Wow , the player base will go up and down . https : //www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/ Just look at wow , and look at any other games ever , and realise the facts ; A video game is always living at a limited time , and will always need to work and evolve to stay fresh , but no matter what it do , it will eventually die . All Valve can do is try to keep it 's player base now , and hope that enough young people are interested in MOBA 'S , but get tired or bored of the more casual ones . But the time of the Moba-games are slowly fading . We will see how long they can keep it up , but just like every other thing , it will eventually collapse by it 's own weight , and I think Dota is heading there . & gt ; No , not this old game horseshit again . Saying it is an old game is 100 percent legit . You know how many young people do n't see old movies because `` they are not good , they are black and white '' ? That is 100 percent legimate reason for them themselves to say . They do n't think black and white movies can be good , and why is that wrong to say ? If that 's what they think , it 's what they think and it ca n't be changed unless they activly watch the movies themselves and see they are wrong . But it does n't happen , because `` they are old '' Dota is getting old . Young people can look it up and see `` Dota 2 released 2013 '' and immediatly be turned off by it , because they want something released this year . And comparing sports to it is just ridiculous . Sports are sports , it 's the most casual thing and it 's also fun . There will always be sports . But do every person growing up take an interest in Basketball ? No , but lets say 5 or 10 percent do . That 's millions of people all around the world . And when you have that high number of people , you do n't need 50 percent to take an interest to keep it alive and big .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Dota is an old , old game . Many that play Dota 2 has played Dota for far longer than Dota 2 has been out ( remember that it became available for everyone long after it 's first release ) A big portions of players have just gotten older and do n't spend time on games anymore or have just become bored . Dota 2 was n't a fresh games with a completly new player base , it was old and Dota as a whole is over 10 years old .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,soccer,"I 'm a big Tom Hardy fan and have to agree , he played the character so good , and as you said , killed it ( it may be my favorite performance of his ) His character is really only the interesting one in the film ( even though as a whole I really like The revenant , watched it multiple times ) He is the main villian/antagonist in the movie , but he is one of the least `` villainous '' movie-characters I 've seen recently . He is a man , living in the 1820s , just trying to survive and get by . Obviously lived a very rough life . Some people might think `` oh , he treats Leo 's son bad , he is obviously bad '' , but this was the 1800s , where most people probably had a vile encounter with Indians and they were universially looked as `` bad '' , and it 's not like he was more racist/bad towards Indians than what a normal man would be . Especially after some flayed your head . Then , all he really is motivated by is getting some cash after a lot of hard work went to nothing , to see over Leo until he dies . Thing is , Leo do n't die , the Indians chasing them are getting close , and Hardy 's character try to save himself . And one things lead to the next , but never did I feel his character did something out of evil or something I would n't do myself . And what 's difficult for an actor is to portrait that , but every look and sound Tom Hardy made in the movie was leaning towards `` he is just doing this to survive '' I do n't know if the one that won `` supporting actor '' , Mark Rylance , did a good job , but if his performance was good enough to beat Hardy 's , it must have been . Because Tom Hardy just brought a character from the 1820s to life in a way I have n't seen before . Maybe he would have won if the movie was done a bit differently and did n't stretch out and focused more on the characters than showing Leo 's journey , but still a bit mad Hardy did n't get an Oscar . Especially considering his performance outdid the one that won an Oscar for his . `` Outdone '' is n't even a strong enough word for it . He outdid the whole movie .",Germanic,Norwegian

It 's the most fun I 've had playing a game just casually ( I would still be playing it if it was n't for the fact my PC broke and have n't replaced it with a proper one yet ) It 's as you say , Dota is not a game you will enjoy if you are rusty or a new player . It appeal to a certain type of person that enjoy the struggle and wanting to improve . Most games can be very fun , even if you are very bad at them . But Dota is such a hard game when you are new , it 's hard to pick up , and why pick it up when you got more casual , easier game you just want to play 1-2 games a night at ?

When one of the players try to break the tank lines , they need to win the fight so overly , or else it will not be worth it and the losing player is still in it because the following push is too weak . When the dropships come into play , it 's just pure fun to watch . Only thing that I might compare is late game ZvZ , however , it 's such a rarity it 's not really a thing .

Because no game since it has managed to recreate it 's insanely addicting and loveable features . It 's pretty clear you have never put in much time to it . And let me guess ... Going out on a limb here , you do n't fancy movies older than 30 years , do you ? Looks too old ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"No one is denying it , it 's a reason many even tune in . However , last season had enough interested to have them bring it back for a S2 . Many of the players that entered military was allowed to play pro-games , they had the Air-force 1 pro-team , even tho they fell off . If the seasons ahead will follow the structure of ASL , a short period of time with some games a week , at the starts it can be a month apart , the players might be allowed to feature in it . It 's also the between the age of 18-31 . Flash is 24 , Jaedong is already 27 so he got ta go soon , and I did not know Bisu was already heading there . However , all we need are these players keeping it up for a couple of years maybe , and it might come a new generation of pros that people are interested in watching play . I would imagine 2-3 youngsters that compete with and even beat the old guys will harvest some excitment . The problem is that it 's not anyone it seem , however , with the pro 's returning to the scene , it will maybe make some young enter the scene . Many will say `` oh , but they were so young back in the day , all they play now a days are the new games '' , but I 'm a 21 year old Norwegian that was just a kid 10 years ago , loving to watch some koreans play video game on youtube . I imagine there is a whole generation of 18-21 year olds in Korea that played the hell out of SC1 , and are willing to try their luck in the greatest Esport ever , at a time there is a nice possibility . I imagine the possibility to play a live match on a scene with an audience against Flash , Jaedong and Bisu would have many pick it up again .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"As a biased viewer , Brood War is the most beautiful game ever made . It 's definetly will drive many away because `` OMG it looks so old ! `` , but people who have played and felt the satisfaction of the game will not be bothered . I 've been into it for over 10 years , half of my life , I remember spending time on youtube 9-8 years ago and listening to korean commentators of pro-games , specific Pringles MSL . The units sound , the hotkeys , abilities , they are all burned into my brain . Brood war coming back when I 'm in my 20s is a dream come true . I hope it make more people spend some time trying it out , because it is , IMHO , the greatest game ever . It might undermine the `` epicness '' , but consider this : 19 years after it release , people who know the game still watch it and is awed by the matches .

But Brood War , almost 20 years after it release , is still a game people want to watch . The biggest thing is it being a offline tournament and having a show around it . Having the old boys around for a couple of years will help it being in peoples mind , and if we are lucky , we will get a portion of good players that can slowly take over and become `` want to watch '' players for the fans .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What you want to do is cut off reinforcements and give yourself a lot of time , haulting the push with lurkers and force scans and slow push into your base . Since the zerg force is very mobile , you can pick off reinforcements coming and eventually kill a push with bringing all your forces down on the main army eventually . You saw Jaedong doing this in the last game especially , however , Flash never commited to the push , and had his forces in smaller squads , but it did delay the push . However , for some reason Jaedongs lurker tech was very slow . It 's a bad thing when you go both muta and lurker and the muta harrass has done nothing . The bio stream is not as scary as it seems , because what you do as zerg is keeping your third alive , getting you tech to defilers . When you have swarm , a push is almost out of question from the terran before you have a lot of science vessels .

People pour hours into watching and learning timings and builds , but if they do n't get on the levels of the pro 's , not even close , because the execution is what is lacking . Day9 , being a former pro at one of the hardest games to execute , will just need to get what you mentioned down , and will not struggle with execution because of his abilities he already has .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Also help the `` culture '' of having offline events , many qualifiers and group stages is online in the western world because of distances . And it all leads up to one big main event where players or teams come and play out some brackets . I do n't think any organization in the west would do like ASL and be over several months with games being played 2 times a week . Just is n't viable . And also , yea , SCBW is just too damn hard for most people to get into , but it can be a lot of fun to watch . But you need to understand the basics , and people wo n't care to install a 20 year old game . I 'm hoping for a comeback , but it 's more realistic that this will be for a couple of years and it will slowly die out at the same time of SC2 . What can be the saving grace however , is if SC2 dies and BW remains the biggest RTS and no competition is coming in . I watched some WC3 tournaments not long ago , so that 's kinda on the rise again too , but do n't think it will have the core audience BW still has . BW biggest hope is that every other RTS dies .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The beauty is that all mirror match up late game is amazing , it 's just a matter of the map allowing it . Cross spawn positions on the biggest maps allow for longer ZvZ games for example . The true beauty of BW comes in the late-late game . Just massive armies all over the map fighting . The mirror match ups late game always gets fun IMO . Even tho it 's a rarity in ZvZ and PvP , it always happens in TvT and it 's great .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Fighting spirit is one of the most balanced maps , it had almost 50 percent through all match ups . However , it suits the `` turtling '' Terran kinda . I do n't really know how balanced it is if Terran just go that style of `` 2 base turtling '' Flash is the king of responsive play , and it 's just really strong game style to turtle 2 base + respond to your opponent . 2 base Terran is scary , and can do pretty much anything when scouting the opponent . Arbiter tech , lurker , muta , the turtle terran has a lot of option because in all situations you will tech up to science vessel and you never `` lose '' out on anything going there . Some builds , like protoss for instance , when going arbiter , it 's pretty strong because you get Templars and storm with doing it . Zerg is in the roughest spot , since getting a spire wo n't help you get lair , nor will Hydralisk Den . And you need that defiler tech . So Terran is in the easiest place when it get to `` teching '' , Protoss can do it fairly easy , only bad thing for them is that they need robotic facility to get observers , as well as the stargate , citadel of adun , templars archive and then arbiter tribunal , and it 's the last tech unit for protoss . Defiler mount is n't that rough , but you still need to choose between hydralisk den and spire on the way , which stops you from straight teching . However , Terran just get barrack - & gt ; factory - & gt ; stargate - & gt ; science facility . And that 's all the tech they need ( + armory ofc ) With 4 buildings they have teched up as far as they need . All relevant units unlocked . Can even get dropships from it . That 's where the power of 2 base turtling Terran is . And why they seem so OP towards Zerg . Zerg need to choose lurkers or muta often , but the Terran will do the same build to counter both play style , which means they can practice the same build over and over again and master it , countering the 2 main builds ( which make it seem like Zerg need to do some cheese to win ) However , if the map makes for the expansion being vulnerable to aggression or harrass , the Terran ca n't turtle each game without being punished . However , take it too far , and the Terran ca n't get an expansion , and then it 's auto lose against both races . Of the three races , Terran seems like the most limited in options to go builds , however , they also got the easiest way to do those builds , which makes for practising an easy time for the pros . Throughout ASL , Tastosis/Rabbit wondered why Protoss had to do the `` awful arbiter rush build '' , but I think it 's the only way the pro 's can get enough arbiters and tech/energy to use spells and actually win fights , before the terrran have 10 vessels out and emp 's all your arbiters . Terran is in the easiest spot atm , but I do n't think they are overpowered . Just need the maps to have less chokes for all the tanks and just an harder expansion to hold .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 'm a huge fan of TvT , it 's a lot of interesting aspect to it that many do n't consider . Also , IMO , it 's the best of the mirror match ups , and it always feels like the one that played the very best wins in the end . I know a Bo5 gets long tho with TvT , it 's going to be tiring if it goes to 5 games ( I think it will be either 3-0 or 3-1 win for Flash ) , but consider we have n't had any mirror in the quarter , I do n't mind a mirror and especially not TvT in the final .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Effort went out in the Ro24 group stages , he beat Light ( T ) , but lost against Rain ( P ) , he then lost to Light in the decider . What 's funny with discussing TvZ taking Jaedong vs . Flash as an example , is that Jaedong was 4-0 through the group stages against Terran . I do n't think he had an issue to `` figure out '' Terran , I just think he had a tough time to play against Flash . Flash is also the best `` responder '' in the history of BW , and vs. Zerg that need to be the aggressor in a way , he 's dominating . It 's not weird he beat a Jaedong that has recently returned , and that is a big deal , Jaedong has n't as much practice as many other joining in , and he still went 6-3 , mostly because Flash is just so good . In the group stages , Zerg went 9-5 against Terran . Yes , it 's Jaedong and herO that make up most of the wins , but it shows it 's a quality thing rather than balance issue . With Flash vs. Jaedong , it ended 11-8 in favor of Zerg . I know it 's a too small sample size to use it as an argument in favor of balance being alright , but many here make it seem like Zerg ca n't beat Terran unless you are incredible . I think it 's all down to the two other races getting a huge return of very good pros , and zerg being kinda a bit `` lost '' on how to deal with the maps .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"TvZ has always been viewed on as the classic match up , and throughout my year watching it I have n't thought about it as unbalanced in favor of Terran . Even though when the turtling style of Terran became popular , taking a quick expansion , it 's put a lot of pressure on Zerg to do something , while the Terran can be pretty safe . You might be referring to Jaedong vs Flash too , but that 's more Flash doing right things and Jaedong ending up being sloppy in the last match . A big factor many do n't consider is the maps too . Zerg want to expand away from the terran , and `` unlucky '' spawns can make it easier for the Terran . I 'm not sure if the maps throughout ASL have been good on Zergs in that case . I 'm not sure how `` flawed '' I would called TvZ . The big deal is Zerg having to be the aggressor , and have pretty much only option of Mutas or lurker + fast tech to defilers . If the Muta harrass fails , you are pretty much so far behind and pretty much dead . If you go lurker , the timing push on the terran is just too strong . I think an `` answer '' to it is a better map pool , where the expansion ca n't be defended with 2 buildings from the Terran . However , that makes Protoss dragoon/zealot push strong , so it 's kiiiinda needed to be like that ... If a Zerg can hold on to get his bases and tech up , it 's a more even playing field . Dark swarm , ultras , taking out the terran 's vessel , and it 's looking good . But it 's getting to that point without falling too far behind that probably is the problem . I think if you want to fix some flaws in TvZ , you 'll need some better maps where getting an `` unsafe '' expansion can be punished by Zergs .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Looking at racial distruption throughout ASL is really interesting . http : //wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Afreeca_Starleague_Season_2 # Racial_Distribution ( Keep in mind there was no mirror matchups from Quarter and throughout before the finale ) Zerg seemed to be rolled over in the group stages , but 4 of the 8 were in 2 groups ( 2 in each ) and they all 4 lost out . On top of that , 2 more single zergs lost . Probably the quality of the players are a bit lacking , and the format of ASL does n't really favor `` balance '' aspect of the game . A bad day , and you might go out . Jaedong was n't far away from being eliminated either . Terran has always been the strong race , but OP ? I know you say it tongue in cheek , but it 's no denying Terran is in a strong spot , however , Flash is like the greatest player ever , and Sea reached the semi 's last year and been training a lot , so I 'm not suprised they both reached the finale . Sea showed his skill when he 3-0 Bisu . And Best almost steamrolled him , he did an incredible job winning that match . Flash do what Flash do , but Jaedong had him on his ropes too .

0x424242,india,"Well , in TN Higher Secondary Boards , there are a select set of schools , the usual suspects ( S.V Mandhir , SRV , SKV , DAV ) that get State Ranks . I studied at S.V Mandhir , almost a Decade back , and trust me I know how these schools work . They start teaching 12th right from your 11th grade . School hours are 7:00 to 20:00 ; If you 're in hostel then your hours are 4:00 to 22:00 . So , yeah . I could say with confidence that you ca n't buy your way out to get state ranks .

0x424242,india,Why does it have to be fishy ? Perhaps it might come off as a surprise to people who are n't from TN . But there are a bunch of schools in TN where everyone scores really well . Check this [ one ] ( https : //results.reportbee.com/2016/tn/12/school/34KGI425 ) out . Consistent 90 % + school average for the last 7 years . It is very common to see 20-30 students from this school every year in each of the state 's top 5 Engineering colleges .,Germanic,Swedish
0x424242,india,"90 percent average is on their total score , which includes language papers . Engineering Cut-Off for the state 's best college ( College of Engineering , Guindy ) are CS - 199/200 , ECE - 199.25/200 , EEE - 198.75/200 , Medical Cutoff for Government Colleges in TN is 198.25/200 , which as you see are all above SRCC 's 99 . Appreciate the sarcasm . Perhaps I was n't clear enough . I do n't think them of as genius either . They just know how to score marks in their higher secondary boards without cheating . They spend 18 hours a day for over 2 years reading the same books . They get slut shamed if their cut-off in the billion mock exams which happens throughout a year is less than 190 . So , yeah , more than 50 in a school scoring 99 % ( 198 ) cutoff is not a huge surprise . It has been happening for years . So , you claiming it to be 'fishy ' based on your 'instincts ' is too 'Donald Trump-esque ' and not fair to the students , though they had spent 2 years doing meaningless shit .",Germanic,Swedish
0x424242,india,"I totally agree that TN board is rather shitty with the syllabus . And I agree it is unfair for students from other boards or CBSE . I appreciate if SRCC , or even TN Engineering colleges start conducting entrance examiniations , so that it can be a fair game .

The best months of Sweden are June , July , and August . The whole of Sweden shuts down during July ( I kid you not ) to spend their time with their families .

Other smaller cities like Karlstad , Jonköping are situated on the borders of two gigantic lakes , which are several thousand sq km in size . Most other cities are university towns , Lund , Linköping , Uppsala , and are even smaller . The major source of subcontinent people are the Universities . Free education to non-eu students was cancelled around 2010/11 , I think . But then the Universities started providing shit tons of scholarships for non-eu folks that would entail you almost a free ride for the whole two years , making it a very cheap destination for a Masters Degree when compared to The US , or The UK . 4 years ago when I started school here in Gothenburg , around 60 out of these 80 scholarships went to the Indians .

Getting in at 8th grade or earlier , gives you a guaranteed 9th admission . However , kids gets thrown out all the time , if they consistently score below 80 % . 11th admission is a bit different . TCs are handed out to every 10th passed out , and you start fresh this time , with 90 % in Matriculation Board as criteria for admission .

I flew with them for about 9 months before finding an offer from a local major which needed pilots for the ATR-72 . Because I already had some flying time and a type rating , I was basically hired on the spot . I worked with them in the ATR for about 6 months also , when I learned that many pilots operating the 737 would soon be retiring . So I reached out to the company , asking if it would be possible to transition to the 737 . Low and behold , they said yes !

Trading and teamplya is vital . If you see a teammate peaking or that 's about to peak , ask if he needs a flash or something . Be ready to step out and trade ; a 4v4 will help you a lot , a 4v5 is quite a disadvantage . You do n't have to take positions at the beginning of the round .

Holding off a retake : if you 've played by the book , and no shenanigans have happened ( they will happen , trust me ) so it 's a normal 3v3 retake , both bombsites ( especially A ) are very hard to retake just due to the sheer amount of angles a CT has to check .

1008oh,battlefield_one,"I have n't touched it since before the release of TSNP , exept for a 6 hour session 3 weeks ago . Then I realized that this game was in a way different than BF3/BF4 . Nowadays I rather play BF4 than BF1 . These are the reasons I can think about why I left this game : 1 . Customization . I was a big fan of all the attachments/weapons/camo/gadgets that existed in BF4 . Even though most attachements had the exact stats , I liked the ability to choose between different weapons , and changing them according to the map and the faction I was playing ( US on Siege of Shanghai - & gt ; Run M16A4 w/o any attachments and UCP camouflage for example ) . This is the biggest point for me , and probably the # 1 reason I left BF1 . 2 . Conquest . Ever since I first touched the BF3 beta in 2011 ( wew , was that really 6 years ago ) , I 've been breathing and living conquest . It combines infantry , armored , aerial , and with BF4 also naval combat into one gamemode . What more can be asked for ? With BF1 and the changes to conquest , almost all my joy for that gamemode has been lost . I feel like vehicles have less of an effect on the objectives , and that it 's more infantry fighting infantry . The points system is also a step down from the previous one , where it is usually very easy to tell who is going to win only after a team reaches 200 points . This point also leads nicely into the next one : 3 . Map design . The maps are all so linear , leading into both teams clashing down 25vs25 on the central objective . This makes the fights way more chaotic and means that the first team to capture the central point goes on to win the match . 4 . The trend towards a more `` casual '' game . I guess this is more of a personal opinion , and that DICE had to make the game more casual in order to appeal to a larger audience . I do n't blame them for this . This does n't mean that I did n't like the game ; it 's just that I enjoy BF4 a lot more . BF1 did have some really nice stuff to offer : * Behemoths . I loved the concept , I just think that they have a little too little HP , as they are easily destroyed by a team that makes destroying the behemoth their primary goal , where it does n't have the time to have a significant impact on the game and help the losing team recover and come back . * Sound design . I could mention graphics , but I feel as if we could have had BF1 level graphics in BF4 , but that the average PC/console ( XB1/PS4 released in 2013 ) would not have handled it . The sound however has less to do with specs and more with what of a great job DICE has done in BF1 . The guns , the screams , the steps , the vehicles and the ambient sounds are all just so much better . * Limpet charges . No one ever sees them coming : ) Edit : formatting",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,TownofSalemgame,"So , I 'm playing as Vet Bait . Vet Bait the survivor . I claim D1 in hope of being left alone . One guy immediately screams out `` Kill all D1 surv claims , they only side with evil ! '' . D2 : 5 people are dead . The vet got 1 mafia ( consig ) , 1 escort , 1 lookout and a witch . Mafia killed another lookout . In the discussion phase , everyone is just talking over eachother , whispers are going everywhere , it 's impossible to read . From what I can see , 3 different people are claiming mayor . No one reveals . D3 : 3 guys are dead . BG protected me , kills the GF and dies . A WW kills the jailor . Town is still in chaos , however the mayor reveals , and they manage to lynch the other mayor claim , who was WW . D4 : 2 guys are dead . The last mafia attacked randomly and got the RT vig . That vig thought that it would be a good idea to shoot *the REVEALED mayor* . His death note ? `` Random shot , we lost anyways '' . D5 : We are still 4 left . Mafia did n't dare attack the vet I suppose . D6 : The any arsonist turns the whole town to ashes , only leaving him alone left . If you see this , GG to you Mr Pudding .",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake Inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with Inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until Inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could Inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty . Instead , i see many benifits with bringing in Inferno without removing any map , effectivly increasing the map pool to 8 maps . Firstly , it is the only logical move to do . As I ’ ve said multiple times already , no map deserves to be taken out of active duty . Inferno was remade to make it more viable in professional matches , and will make its way back into the pro scene . If no map can be removed , just expand the pool . Secondly , it allows for other maps to come back to CS : GO , or evn for brand new maps like overpass to be born . Before overpass was introduced , no one would have thought that Valve would create a map from scratch to then force it into professional play . With a bigger map pool , the addition of a new map has a lesser impact on the current professional scene . One new map in a map pool of eight maps in total is going to stagnate the pro scene a lot less than the swap of a map in a pool of seven maps . A valid point to make is the burden placed upon the professional teams . As the number of maps increase , the amount of work required by the pro teams also increases . This may seem like a concern , but this is only due to the bad map draft cutrrently used at major events , where the last map is always selected randomly which requires a team to be very sharp on at least four maps : their own pick , and all three that remain in the randomizer . By increasing the map pool to eight maps , the pick-ban system can be redesigned to work in a very favorable way . Valve ’ s argument for the random third map has been to increase the diversity of maps played , while in CS 1.6 , the maps were banned down until one was remaining . With eight maps , the system could look like this : -First , both team get to ban a map , their “ permaban ” . -Then , both teams pick a map out of the six remaining . -Now , both teams get to ban a map again , reducing the remaining amount of maps to two . -The last map is selected randomly . Technically , by putting in the same work of studying four maps , a team can learn an own favorite map , the favorite map of their opponents as well as both the maps in the randomizer . This should lead to much more interesting BO3 series with closer games , since the teams are given more opportunity to study each other . **Conclusion** The current CS : GO map pool is fairly balanced , with all maps , exept nuke which still should be given time to grow , are quite enjoyed by the community as well as the professional scene . Before the reintroduction of Inferno to competitive play , it is worth considering the possibilities surrounding the active duty map pool . As no map has a real valid reason to be taken away from professional play , a good alternative is to add Inferno without removing any other map , effectivly increasing the map pool to eight maps . In the process , the pick-ban system at major and minor events should be changed in order togive the teams more control over the third map whilst retaining the randomizer for the purpose of variation : let each team ban once , pick once , ban once again and randomize between the last two maps remaining . This should lead to teams being more capable of preparing for events , as well as giving the spectators a better viewing experience , as a consequence of closer map scores . TL ; DR : Reading a TL ; DR is not enough to participate in a discussion I feel like , but if you want to just quickly realize what my thoughts are , just read the conclusion .",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"Valve does n't go after these sites because they are using bots . They go after them because they use the steam services commercially .

After 30 minutes or so , they decide to bring the most shitfaced people and the ones on drugs to the police station .

You are totally PTFO : ing if you 're at C and fending the enemies off when they are coming from D. You do n't have to ( and should n't ) be rushing in as the first guy , you 'll just die . If you however want to play aggressively , as everyone else says , use your sidearm after a hit . i like the Mars Automatic since it almost always finishes them off in one shot . Also , play with your team . you should n't be the first point of contact as a scout , or you 'll find 5 supports with BARs shooting at you . instead , let your teammates move up , check out the area while you spam spotting flares . Spam the `` Need Ammo '' button to get more . Make sure you take advantage of your range superiority . An automatico can do serious damage at 20m , but is almost useless at 40m . I would recommend you to use a marksman variant ( I use the gewehr 98 , good at long range while still excellent close up ) at lowest zoom since you can still get close and personal , while getting those 80-100m shots .

He says Tiger 's sound is unique on his mixtape . He says it 's his one of his own favourites and that he does n't care about people who say they do n't understand what he 's saying in it . _____ After Migos he says he loves their flow , that it 's like Future 's but more on-point , also enjoys their lyrics . They are real trendsetters with their flow . He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording . ___ After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much , like Hard in da Paint and Versace . He 's apparently called Sweden 's Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone ( Sad Boys manager ) , and Thaiboy himself agrees on that . ___ He loves auto-tune , it makes things better . Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who ca n't sing are able to by using auto-tune , like Chief Keef . People hate auto-tune because they 're conservative and need things to be `` real '' in order to enjoy it , and that you need talent to be able to sing . Auto-tune allows you to be creative in a new way and it 's modern . The interviewer asked if he ever feels like he 's crossing boundaries when he makes music , and he says he feels like he does that a lot , examples being Fuck U . The lyrics make no sense , the melody makes no sense , but the song 's feeling makes sense and that 's all his music is about , the feeling . ___ He started making music in a serious way last summer , people started hating because it sounded pretty bad . Last winter he decided to add auto-tune and now you can catch him on podcasts . Started from the bottom now he here . He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out . First he thought they 'd be like Migos , everybody featured on every track , but now it 's more like GBE with Chief Keef , everyone doing their own thing and occasiounally helping each other out on tracks . ___ Nothing really happens after the Kevin Gates song . ___ Describing boppin , he says it 's an easy dance where you just go low with them knees and go left to right . There are several levels of boppin : the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right , the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around , and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff . She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin . Yung Sherm is very good at it , but Ecco2k is the best one , Bladee and Whitearmor are probably the worst . ___ Conclusively , he says the mixtape will be finished when Whitearmor returns from the tour .",Germanic,Swedish

16dollars,SuicideWatch,"This reply is intended for you OP but I hope that some other lurker out there as well will benefit of it . 1 . In a relationship , be it a love , friendly or family one , there is a minimum of two persons . What a lot of us tend to forget is the amount of responsibility you have to take , or should *not* take , to maintain one . If you 're the one who is always calling your `` friend '' , maybe you should reconsider your friendship with this person ? Move on and try to find someone who cares for you . It may be a cliché but look at it from another perspective . You 're not boring - the people who do n't want to spend time to get to know you are . Basically - **if they do n't want to be your friend - fuck 'em . Their loss and not yours . ** Try contacting someone you have n't spoken to in a long time . I can almost guarantee that they 'll be happy that you reach out . Just have a chat and if it feels good take it a step further and meet . Just have a beer together , play some xbox or whatever you enjoy . And then you repeat . And repeat . And repeat . And then you reconnect with another person . And repeat . 2 . Have you tried internet dating ? It may sound a bit cheesy but it seems that a lot of people get something out of it . And if a date does n't work out , maybe you 've at least made a new friend ? 3 . Do you play any video games ? Voice chat is a minor social interaction but it still makes you connect with other people . Plus you 'll have something to talk about . A big warning though - excessive amount of playing video games can send you down an evil spiral ... Use it as a compliment and **not** a complete substitute for social interaction . 4 . Get out and do stuff . Take a cooking class , learn how to scuba dive , join the local bowling team . It 's the small things that keep you from killing yourself . Just think of it for a second . Suppose you actually took a cooking class . Ok , so you have to get there . You have to meet a bunch of new people and you get to cook something . Talk to some of the people there . Try something like `` hey , we should team up next week since our meatballs were so damn good '' . This means that you have to show up next week . Or one person will wonder what happened to you . You learn how to scuba dive . Sign up for a day trip with your club . Your [ buddy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_diving ) is going to ask you to pick him up at 11am . If you do n't show up two people will now wonder what happened to you . You join the local bowling team . Next sunday is your first game . If you do n't show up 10 people will wonder what happened to you . Maybe you feel that you have nothing in life that is worth living for .
