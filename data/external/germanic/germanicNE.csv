0x126,Amd,This is some choking pattern . I get that with my Fury on WOW since this game sometimes even pushes my 16thread cpu to 100 % ... In your case it 's clearly a underpowered CPU . ( Can also be RAM speed/size . BF1 consumes about 7GB ( 9.5 in total ) on my system . On 4K the 4GB vram is not enough . Have to lower stuff to medium for 4k @ 60fps ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Have that on my system too ( in wattman ) . Happens only on shitty programmed games ... WOW Legion in my case . BF1 is always 90-100 % on wow it jumps from 0 to 100 and back cause the gamecode is shitty optimized and way outdated . They ported ftom DX 8 to 9 and then from 9 to 11 . Wrapping and changing is not optimizing . My 16 threads are at 100 % in wow at some places and gpu drops to 5 % usage ... that is really sad since no difference can be seen .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Same here like dragnar . I have my fury now and 800€ for a TI that does 10fps more on 4k ultra is n't a reason to upgrade at that insane costs . Vega may lower prices , support freesync 4k @ 60 ( which is what i need ) and be 100€ cheaper . Nobrainer to wait another 5 months till vega is on sale before Christmas .

0x126,Amd,"Use search function , read QVL list on Mobo site and buy accordingly . There are a trillion Mem OC threads already . There is a tech support thread . Have fun .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Basically : 2133MHz is the base frequency of DDR4 everything above is an overclock . Setting only the mem . frequency or using XMP is not a OC . XMP is for Intel platform . on AMD it is called DOCP . You have to set - frequency , DDR-voltage , the DDR reset voltage , the calculated timings ( yes , calculate them or try & amp ; error them ) and the SOC voltage ( only AMD afaik ) . The QVL gives you tested setups that work . Better would be to get certified RAM . If you have a 3200MHz rated kit , you should easily get 3000MHz OC ( use XMP , set only the MHz to 3000 - worth a try ) . I use a RAM kit that is not even listed on my QVL and running it at 2666MHz of it 's rated 3000 ( rated Vendor* ) . I have lower MHz but could do a CL14 instead of a CL15 ; ) The most importand thing is to use the latest bios with AGESA 1.0.0.6 because there are much moch settings and more stable OC possible . Hope this helps you somehow .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Idk about the PLUS but on the B350-A Prime I ran the RAM at 2666MHz pre AGESA 1006 . On my current board ( Fatal1ty x370 K4 ) the CMK16GX4M2B3000C15 runs at 2666MHz with CL14 ! So I 'm happy .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,that is the more pragmatic approach which I picked too ( get the cheapest with highest MHz and run it at best speed ) . This is the way to go for advanced users who can adjust their OC themselfs and not relay on XMP or auto OC,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Since 1700 = 1700x = 1800x i guess with good air cooling 150W+ it should be possible . A good 1700 silicon should clock to 4GHz like the 1800X does . XFR idk if I need that ^^,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"Ok so there are many reasons that could happen . First of all it does not seem to be a power throttling ( but you can always go to full % since it only consumes what it needs ) . Temp throttle at 76°C is also excluded . So the most common thing left is that the VRAM is full or the RAM . 8GB of VRAM are only maxed out on AAA titles in 4k with AA fully on so - nope . Since your paging file is 11GB ? ? ? I think that this is the problem . Mine is mostly 0-200MB with 32GB RAM Close all other apps and play around with the settings of the game . Vertical Sync may also be leading to downclocking or some other target setting for FPS . The card seems fine , there has to be some periferal problem ( HDD , RAM ) . Do you often switch to the desktop ? or how do you play ? windowed or full-widowed or fullscreen ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,no it 's not normal . As a wrote this may have nothing to do with the GPU but rather the RAM/Paging/HDD read/write . open the task manager and look at the performance graph of RAM and HDD . Even huge number of page faults or read/write errors may be a hint ; ),Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,I gave back the reference 480 and getting the Red Devil too . Best after market cooler after intensive research .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you did n't change the fan curve and throttle at 85-90°C in the best case . in the worst you throttle because of power draw ^^ if you have some G/V/Free-sync at 1080p on it does n't matter but when I used the reference card with 4k it jumped from 40 to 28 and up to 35 FPS in seconds . horrific . stable clock with power limit up and fan ramped up got me to 70° ... and a vacuum right next to my head . going for custom cooler now .,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,This makes total sense . Vega 11 is maybe between 6TF of 480 and Vega 10 . Paired with HBM 2 Vega 10 has to compete with Future Titan X . Going from Furys TF is considering better architecture and or higher clocks feasable .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,The reason is stability . My old GT 8800 ruined my PCIe slot while hanging in there ( case screws were not enough ) .

0x126,Amd,"This is a new architecture .

Since I just wanted to check the headroom , I now have clocked all cores to 3.5GHz at 1.18V with ~35°C idle since I do n't need the power yet . All games I play are limited by the GFX card . All applications I use are 1.5-3times faster than with my old 2500k . Ryzen Master does not set the VCC correct ( HW monitor showed other than was set , higher ! ! ) - so do it in bios ! It is sufficient to set the voltage offset +0.12V for ~3.8GHz was it for me and the multiplier to 38.5 ( or play around with the multiplier and divider values till you get there ) Edit : only crashes I experienced were to low voltage or to high temps .

0x126,Amd,"It 's not pointless . It 's better binned ( other thread with analysis of 90cpus ) and clocked higher to start with .

0x126,Amd,Mine does 3.8GHz at 1.28V So I guess if you do n't get the lottery silicon you just have to put +0.05V on it - which with your watercooling is no problem . I run that on the Wraith Stealth ( I think it is the stealth ! ),Germanic,German

So I could push it up there with 1.35v , CL 15-17-17-17-36 and 2933 ( 3000 ) MHz . My mobo does n't store that correctly ( works for one boot fully stable . Then it gets reset - buggy ) .

0x126,Amd,WoW ok no b350 will have the vrms to oc 1800x to max . I ordered the asus board since it supports up to 3200. there is the plus that supports two cards but not mATX anymore . Is that even possible in sizes ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Maybe not boosted to max ? running on 4.5GHz while boost should be 5GHz could mean 100 % but overall ( of possible ) only 80 %,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Still thereis the issue of not utilizing the power of 1700 . Even well threaded games seem to underperform currently . My guess is microcode ( windows fix needed ) or caching problem ( bios fix needed ) .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Software Problem ! Bios - windows- microcode - threading - optimized only for intel ? We will know soon hopefully !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Well preventing windows from randomly switching tasks between ccx would be sufficient for most purposes .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess not outbound,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Mindfactory.de has numbers . Hundreds there . Problem is , that was the best supplied seller . So my bet is shortage too .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,There is a full thread on the problem . Windows switches tasks from core to core but even over the core complexes ( ccx ) where it is slow . This does not happen with cpu only tasks ( therefore good benchmarks ! ) . Additionally powersaving features and memory bios problems . Wait some days for fixes . Then come back for new benchmarks ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"No no this sub clearly always stated that its 5 % below skylake and best for general use , not gaming special . Anyway if you keeping it , wait for the memory , scheduler and microcode fixes that reduce the gaming performance compared to benchmarks . For me it 's a huge upgrade from 2500k . But if gaming would be my focus i 'd get a 6600k and a 1070 for 1080p and a 1080 ti for 4k",Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Yes he is good at what he does . Works at caseking.de btw 8auer means Bauer which means builder ( edit : constructor ? ) or farmer in german . So I like to read it as The Farmer : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,In normal conditions yes but amd cpus are voltage torture resistant . So LN2 and 1.6volt do n't kill it ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I put 16GB ram ontop of my 1700 box but still 0.0GHz and 0 fps . Ordered 3000MHz ram but does not help !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Me not since bios ( memory ) , microcode and windows scheduler patches still need to fix many issues . after that it should be 5-10 % better in games ( that are shitty optimised if at all for intel ) . After these improvements R7 should be in games too where it belongs : - on par with 6900k - 5-8 % lower than 7700k in 4c max engines",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,currently with all the broken bios and scheduling problems yes . but non gaming ( GPU communication and CCX switching ) are the same or ahead so there are some software problems open !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,downvote without a comment ? thats lame guys . nothing wrong with my comment . look up the CCX thread moving issue yourself . holy crap : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Have n't seen these . Thanks mate ! But it does not help to deactivate the whole CCX haha That is nice to see more clear that Ryzen has lower IPC than Kaby but what prevents gaming performance like a 6900k is that switching threads from one ccx to another goes by RAM and not L3 which makes a difference in time in the order of a magnitude . Since windows does this automatically ( god why ? keep temps lower ? idk.. ) this is a problem on fps but not on usual benchmarks ( one task per core , overall delays are fine cause end result counts ! )",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Should have bought a better gfx card..,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Delivery probably 9.march or 16.march Only in germany there are plenty but would cost me 20€ shipping : (,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Ok so that is what can be zen 2 - 5ghz on air,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,So what do you suppose ? Test at 480p at 500+fps to take out the gpu of the equation ? 1080p with a 1080 is a better setup than 80 % of gamers would get since a 1070 is already suited better for 1440p I still do n't get why the benchmarks are that off on GN . Sure IPC is lower but that crippled result seems to be some caching problem or motherboard problem . Will see the next days,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,It 's fake or 1700 @ 4GHz is only 50points behind a 7700k @ 4.2GHz in single core . http : //imgur.com/a/JWYaI So I do n't see any reason other than the OC space ( for DX11 gaming only builds - who does that ? ) on the 7700k to go for the 7700k ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,A single compile is never the problem but like in media editing you have to check what shit you did . 5seconds can add up to weeks that are lost . Testing environments ( emulators for mobile ) are resource eaters . The more the better !,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"yeah but you get +4c +8t for all the workload ahead and games are maxed out with 4cores currently ( DX11 are fine even with 2c ) So why bother ? in 2 years even 1700 & gt ; & gt ; 7700k ; ) Edit : what I mean is , i buy a 1700 over a 7700k cause more cores , almost same 1080p be better next 4-6 years . that simple .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Hi /u/AMD_Robert , first thanks for your work . Second : will it be possible to store or share OC profiles ( Edit : online ) for games and applications ? e.g . disabling 4 cores and oc others higher ? Since it is possible with Ryzen Master to store those localy will there be a import/export function ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Got the 1700 still happy I preordered since my 2500k had to go anyway . Mainboard not yet chosen - since this is the real critical thing . Does it support 3200MHz DDR yet ? Do I go for a B350 or the X370 for future upgrades / APU use on one ? How do prices react the next few days ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess it is more a software or mainboard problem with the review all over the place . it makes no sense that these CPUs die in games like flies . Anyway why would you choose 4c over 8c ? because of 5fps ? That is crazy stupid,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,With a mid range CPU and a SSD yes sure . If not you got a CPU bottleneck or in another place . Totally correct . He elaborated it again later .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you should have wrote that somewhere ; ) the minimum are HUGE btw,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,there is another thread that states other issues currently not solved . This is only one of them but can be seen as you mentioned in the 4+0 and 2+2 fps . 12fps are about 10-12 % which in turn would be 16fps with all cores . only this problem alone : ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Cache management seems off the rail on some boards ( other thread looked it up ) . Which would be reasonable : in fully threaded benchmarks only the core cache is used heavily ; in games the commom cache SHOUD be used too since multiple threads work with same materials . Hence the issue could be windows driver or bios . Iff there is any . Idk . Plz asus let me buy the mobo and do my build . Please .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Waiting for stock in germany/austria of anything currently . Only some shops have mobos with 20€ shipping costs ... that is too much,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"If you game , why would you get a Ryzen ? This is a workload CPU not a high clocked gaming CPU : ) You may have to wait till all problems are sorted out ( May ? ) to use full capability of ryzen .

0x126,Amd,"Low FPS not dropping like shit . So with ryzen you get lower average and peaks but higher consistent lows .

0x126,Amd,"So why does it in some games and others not ? LOL yes . Games use the same resources as other applications but are crafted to supply specifically the gpu . Hence it depends on HOW it is done and if the architecture is suited for this .

We had water in our basement ( about one inch in some places ) and very low water pressure in the house ( it was pretty infuriating trying to shower on the top floor ) . We thought the water in the basement was caused by cracks in the foundation and missing drainage of the soil around causing rainwater to be pushed through the floor . We also thought the low pressure was caused by an old and probably clogged meter , and because noone in our household REALLY cared we did n't do anything about it . But after the pressure did n't change after we replaced our meter as advised by our water supplyer my dad figured out the two problems might be connected . We hired a company to look into it and sure enought , after digging about four feet down we hit water .

Not many players will use that feature , im certain , but i don´t think it would be hard to add . * **Fix the DotA-TV camera** I think I dont have to say much about this . Just go watch a replay and try to change the camera to player-perspective . * **Please add a key-overlay to DotA-TV** I think an optional overlay in player-perspective that shows you what keys are being pressed by the player at the moment would be pretty nice .

17DF53E,skyrim,"They came without warning . Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound , and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count , wielding flame and foul sorcery , slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose . Of once-mighty Stonehall 's military strength only the Bronze Legion , led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin , was near enough to answer the call of battle . They rode into their city , fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets , cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion : an ethereal rift within the city square , and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion . Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer , the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade , cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil . Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast . It turned , smiling at her through a maze of teeth . Heedless of the battle raging around them , they charged one another . Deflecting blow after blow , the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them . Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her . The odds turned . The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly , a brutal thrust from the side , but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke . Blade scraped on blade , beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below , carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood . The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack , driving her blade through her foe 's flesh into the stampeding heart within . With a scream that split the clouds above , the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish . The stygian portal wavered , the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared . The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel . Though victorious , the survivors saw little to celebrate : the city lay in ruins , and survivors were few . Fires continued to spread . Unfurling her banners of war , Tresdin gathered what allies she could . Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss , and damned be any who would dare stand in her way .",Germanic,German

1L4V,DotA2,"**IT WAS THE REFLECT OF DUEL WITH AGHS ! COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT^so^so^so^sorry** We played against an Anti-Mage with Aghs and everytime our Necrophos ulted him he took 0 DMG from the ult . It did n't matter how much HP he had left . I could n't find any reason , he does n't take any dmg from Reaper Scythe . MatchID : 2989133401 Examples of what I am talking about : ( Time equals the Clock ingame ) **first time** Time : 63:31 on bot lane . He was duelled and ulted from Necrophos with around 1/4 of his HP . Reaper 's Scythe deals 0 DMG . In the combat Log only the debuff is stated , but nowhere any dmg . Spell Shield is on CD ( got popped by LC Duel ) . Lion Ult also does n't show up as dmg in combat Log , only as debuff and seems to deal no dmg . **game deciding time** Time : 65:27 mid lane where Dire Tier 2 would 've been . Again AM had Spell Shield on CD because of Duel and again he was Necro ulted with around 1/4 of his HP . In the **Combat Log** following is always written : > Anti-Mage receives modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff from Necrophos . > Anti-Mage loses modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff . There is no DMG in the combat Log and 0 dmg was taken . Do I miss something completely obvious ? Or is there actually something broken ? Please someone look into this matter , because if this is true , then AM Aghs is bugged . REALLY bugged . Matchlink : dota2 : //matchid=2989133401 & matchtime=4004 **Edit 1 : ** LC had no Aghs . So that could n't be the problem **Edit 2 : ** CLEARED IT UP ! Thanks to u/Drakesfjord and u/DimitrijaT !

0_0_0,worldnews,"The change has to do with the allocation of dual language status to municipalities . The status is normally determined every ten years based on the language data in the population register . ( Minimum 8 % or 3000 residents minority language speakers . ) This status is set by government decree for ten years . There was a change in the law that directs extra government funds to dual language muncipalities . Basically some municipalities that are designated single language suffered in the change . However , the determination of language status is next made in 2023 and the government was not allowed to make special determinations . The new form of the law allows the government ( i.e . cabinet ) to assign a municipality dual language status **during** the ten-year period it had been determined to have a single language , if the municipal council asks for the change . This apparently fixes the income loss .

Game publishers that wish to sell in brick and mortar chains ( that would be basically all of the publishers ) mostly have to agree to charge the same base price online as the physical copies in the stores . Otherwise the stores would not agree to sell the game due to competititon from cheaper online offerings . And dropping the price in the physical copies would not be in their interest since products in those stores are subject to the high cost of living present in Australia , it would just cut into their profit . And as the publishers must price their products in the currency they do business in , they are kinda slaves to the exchange rate , irrespective of any hedging they may do . Another thing that keeps the prices higher - at USD equivalent terms - in non-USD currencies is stability of the price as observed by the consumer . Consumers have formed a general idea about the cost of games ( cost of everything ) . They are not going to assimilate very well to price changes if they followed the exchange rate , especially when the observed niominal price goes UP .

0_0_0,TrueReddit,"Is n't ~~he~~ Coward claiming that the methodology itself was manipulated to find no significance ? & gt ; Fourth , the performance of my students from Math 1A was evaluated in the subsequent course in the sequence , Math 1B . The score gain for my students averaged 0.17 grade points over the three Math 1B classes , with a sample size of approximately 1000 students . This raises the question of whether this is statistically signifiant . Your colleague Philip Stark , the chair of the Statistics Department , and someone who has gone on the record saying that student evaluations are not indicative of teaching effectiveness , wrote in his analysis : & gt ; '' The test statistic was the following : For each section of 1B , calculate the three average grades corresponding to each of the three 1A sections . Take the standard deviation of those three numbers . Add those numbers for the three sections of 1B . '' & gt ; While it takes some time to understand this statement , it amounts to the following : My students were divided into 9am and 11am groups corresponding to my two Math 1A class , and then a test statistic was used that penalized consistency in performance between the students from my two classes . Stark 's analysis went on to obtain a p-value of 0.13 and he concluded : `` There is no _statistical_ basis for concluding that any differences in the 1B performance -- to the extent that such differences exist -- are attributable to differences in what they learned in 1A .

0_0_0,wikipedia,"Nope . It means there are no *atoms* left over from the duck liver , never mind molecules . The dilution is so ridiculously over-over-over-over-overdone , the probability of any original atom remaining in the resulting solution completely disappears . Read the whole linked article . Choice quote : & gt ; '' 30C : Dilution advocated by Hahnemann for most purposes : on average , this would require giving two billion doses per second to six billion people for 4 billion years to deliver a single molecule of the original material to any patient . ''",Germanic,Finnish
0_0_0,wikipedia,"`` 5 times '' is incorrect . Also the definition is not about molecules per bottle , the bottles was only mentioned by /u/LWschool . Are you sure how scientific notation and the homeopathic `` system '' works ? The dilution in this case is described as `` 200C '' . This means a solution of one unit of original substance in 10^400 [ one followed by four hundred zeroes ] units of diluent . The approximate number of *atoms* ( not molecules^1 , mind ) in the observable universe is ~10^80 . Therefore , dividing 10^400 atoms by ~10^80 atoms per universe leaves ~10^320 universes required to have **a single atom remaining in the solution** , on average . So the amount of diluent e.g . water required in this solution , is equivalent to the atoms of these 10^320 universes and the amount of active ingredient is one atom . The difference between 10^80 and 10^320 is not `` 5 times '' . It 's 10^240 [ one followed by 240 zeroes ] . Footnote^1 : The orginal analysis in the wiki ignores the difference between molecules and atoms to give a rough sense of scale . This means that the 10^320 number is actually not enough , because it needs to be multiplied by the number of atoms in the particular molecule . Really complex proteins can have up to 10^6 atoms . So the upper limit is more like ~10^326 universes . : )",Germanic,Finnish

These persons are affected by thyroid cancer or goitres , and have filed lawsuits alleging that the French government , at the time led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac , had not adequately informed the population of the risks linked to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout . The complaint contrasts the health protection measures put in place in nearby countries ( warning against consumption of green vegetables or milk by children and pregnant women ) with the relatively high contamination suffered by the east of France and Corsica . Although the 2006 study by the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety said that no clear link could be found between Chernobyl and the increase of thyroid cancers in France , it also stated that papillary thyroid cancer had tripled in the following years . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_Chernobyl_disaster Basically since the 60s the French put a very large part of their resource into nuclear energy and they are ready to lie to their population about it 's danger .

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,Trust me ... you find another one . Had 1000+CP Pidgeot at work today . Tried to catch him a few times but then went to lunch . Didn´t want to spent more balls on a Pokémon I have easily the resources for to envolve .,Germanic,German

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,"Since you are Level 6 , you can conquer a gym . Pokémon is about collecting . So if a Pokémon appears on your Radar you haven´t collected yet , you go for a hunt and try to find it . Walking around in your neighborhood and joining others on the hunt . Unfortunately the Radar is bugged and not working properly . If you find a lure on a Pokestop , go there and join the others sitting there and have a nice conversation .

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,"The rage isn´t just based on the tracker Issue . What Niantic does is keeping it´s customers in the dark . If you´re a company and not listening to your customers wishes and don´t communicate , you´re about to go down . Niantic is learning this the hard way . For myself , I really miss the Tracker . I remember tracking Pokemons in the first week . It was so much fun . Now all I have is [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/c9uMdBK.png ) . In the first week , I would have selected one from the list to locate it . Now all I can do is walking around in hope to walk in the right direction . If I walk in the wrong direction I will only notice it when it´s already to late and the Pokemon is gone . That makes the Nearby List completly useless . Another Issue is removing basic elements like the xp Bonus for great and excellent throws . Niantics policy is like `` Oh you like this feature , let´s remove it '' . Edit : minor text fixes",Germanic,German
0711Picknicker,pokemongo,I think the pogo community should focus more on the lack of communication by Niantic . The removed features currently may be based on a decission what Niantic thinks is good for the concept of Pokemon Go .

0bi,medicalschool,"Survey taken . About the questions : 1 . Yes , most definitely . When I go to see patients , I see them by myself . Both history and exam . I then summarize this for my attending , who will only check a few things but will take my word for most . This of course requires that I admit when I 'm not sure about stomething etc . but they are generally fine with that . Sometimes in acute cases when there is nothing to really add to the process , I like to talke with the family of the patient to explain everything to them etc . Also because I see less patients than the attendings , I 'm able to spend more time with them which sometimes reveals more underlying issues or causes , or allows to focus on the impact of the disease more . So a definite yes , in several ways . 2 . Sometimes this has happened . I find it annoying , because it often coincided with very little learning moments . Fortunately it has n't happened in my fields of interest . No problems with self-worth , but that 's probably mostly due to there being nothing to do in general . 3 . Two things : confidence ( /assertiveness ) and space . We work with six week rotations in several fields . The first week , you 're learning a lot and ask for a lot of direct supervision . If you 're well prepared , you can pick things up quickly . Once I 'm confident about my abilities to see patients by myself ( for example ) , I make the suggestion to the attending . If they are confident enough in their indirect supervision skills , they 'll let me/you . That 's the space part . Also , try to be a good colleague . In my evaluations I 've been told that people like to give me space to grow , because I claim it and because I offer to do the meaningless tasks as well , just to reduce the workload on the attending . So , to summarise : be prepared , try to be confident . Try to learn a lot at the start of a rotation , offer to do a lot of things and claim learning/individual moments when possible . And then it comes down to a bit of luck with your patients and attending . Hope this helps !",Germanic,Dutch

The pressure , the time-sink , no application or explanation of why what you 're learning is relevant ( which I wanted because it was just so much ) , not doing nearly as much of the fun stuff outside of school as your friends ... It was during this time that I also developed a period of depression . Fortunately enough , I got help for that .

And because cancer is such a high-risk diagnosis , it is always listed . Most DDX programs offer two columns : one with the most likely diagnoses ( e.g . the flu ) and one with diagnoses that are n't ( very ) likely , but because of their serious nature need to be excluded ( e.g . cancer ) . Important note though : diagnostic programs are meant to be used by physicians and are **all** still in their testing phases .

0bi,AskReddit,"I 'm kind of in the opposite situation . My girlfriend and I had known eachother for a year before we officially became a 'thing ' . When we got to know eachother first , we went on a couple of dates and I pretty much fell for her- she did n't quite fall for me . During that year , there were a couple of occasions where I thought there was something more than 'just friends ' as well . When we finally started dating , I asked her pretty quick if she wanted to be my girlfriend and I told her I loved her quite soon after , because , as I figured out , I never quite got over her during that year . This is ~2 months ago now . She has n't said it back yet- I 've said it twice . I do n't want to crowd her with it , and I do n't like the idea of saying it again and again getting no verbal response . The reason I do n't really mind it though , and the one that keeps me patient is this : when I said it , we looked eachother in the eyes and I could see pure joy in hers when I said it . So I know that even if she does n't ( know she ) love ( s ) me yet , I 'm sure she likes me and that she 's comfortable with how I feel and not at all freaked out by it . Moral of the story : be honest and even more so : be sincere . I have to respect that I was pretty darn quick in saying it and that she ca n't say it back yet , even if I want her to . And I can do that , because she made it clear that she does n't mind . So in your case , OP , tell her that you appreciate it and that you unfortunately do not yet feel that way . But also let her know that you 're comfortable with her saying it first- I think most girls are afraid they 'll chase their guy away by saying it too soon . Then hug her . Nothing like hugs .

0bi,AskReddit,"That 's not true either though . IBD and IBS are two different types of condition entirely . IBD is an umbrella term for two diseases ( Chron 's and ulcerative colitis ) , whereas IBS is just the syndrome . The difference is that both forms of IBD have a known pathogenesis ( that means we know how the process that causes the disease and its symptoms works ) , which IBS does not . That 's why Chron 's and ulcerative colitis are diseases , and IBS is a syndrome . This difference is most clearly illustrated by the treatment options : there are drugs available for IBD ( next to lifestyle changes etc . ) , but not for IBS .

0bi,AskReddit,"Hey dude , I think you 're skipping a couple of steps here ! First of all : most forms of skin cancer are local laesions . There is only one form of skin cancer that is malignant and causes metastases . This means that *if* one of your moles is cancer , this says nothing about all your other moles . Secondly : as stated before , most forms of skin cancers are benign ( i.e . they remain local ) and can be removed on the spot . ( this is preferable to leaving them be , because further growing can cause other issues ) Thirdly : they do n't have to remove all of your moles to see if you 've got cancer or not . Basic inspection by a dermatologist or GP ( if possible assisted by a dermatoscope , a certain type of lens ) can tell whether a mole is 'suspect ' or not . Only suspect moles need to be sampled for lab analysis . Finally : moles can come and go naturally . So getting checked out is just a precaution , not a guaranteed death sentence . To summarise : getting checked out is the doctor looking at your moles really closely , if possible assisted by a lens . If he thinks something looks funny , he 'll take that certain mole out and send it in for analysis . Most likely diagnosis : not cancer . If the diagnosis is cancer , that taking away the mole was most likely your treatment . Getting checked out can give you ( and those around you ) peace of mind and in the unlikely case of it being the shitty type of cancer : the best treatment for all types of cancer is catching it in its early stages . TL ; DR - get it checked out . If not cancer : yay ! If cancer : most likely 'meh ' or at least yay that you found out now instead of in two years when you 're dying of it ( which is n't necessary ) .",Germanic,Dutch

Just being hungry and eating more =/= addiction . Start eating less and excercising more ( it also helps to keep your mind off the food ) . Pills etc . are all scams .

Making an appointment one month from now and maintaining [ the diary ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale ) would make you a model patient and would you put you on the perfect track to finding a diagnosis .

0bi,medicalschool,"So , the post currently on the front page about number of procedures done during rotations got me thinking about what 's considered 'normal ' in the U.S. and over here . I started comparing the procedures I 've done to some listed in that post and figured it was like comparing apples and oranges and that people first needed to understand the architecture of medical school over here . I figured that warranted its own post , I hope you find it interesting . I 've made it specifically about The Netherlands , because I 'm not aware of all the specific differences between the EU countries . Maybe people from those countries can chime in on that . **So , general outline first . ** Medical school in The Netherlands is six years , but requires no premed . You can enroll straight out of high school at 18 . The education is then grossly divided in two parts of three years , the first three focus on anatomy , physiology , biochem etc . The latter three focus on rotations in increasing manner . My faculty is unique in The Netherlands due to the fact that we have full-fledged rotations during third year ( a big advantage IMO ) . You have two weeks of Christmas holidays and 8 weeks of summer leave , though this decreases each year as you advance . In turn , you get two weeks twice off at randomly designated periods during the year from fourth year onwards . **The Netherlands is a small country** ( [ 16040 sq mi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands ) ) but has [ eight university hospitals with ~300 first years each ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_hospitals # Netherlands ) , so due to student density you 'll never have to travel very far during away rotations . Door to door it rarely exceeds 1,5 hours and in those cases ( and often sooner ) you 'll most often have the option to be boarded locally ( paid for by your faculty ) . **Most medical schools** in The Netherlands have adopted a 'thematic curriculum ' . This means that instead of separate courses of anatomy , physiology etc . you get a course 'GI ' , or 'Circulation ' . You will then learn about anatomy , physiology , pathology etc . of relevant organs to that theme . The only 'traditional ' course I can think of that we have is biochem , though that 's already angled a bit towards onco . **So , the first three years** ( your 'Bachelor's ' ) consist of above mentioned 'themes ' . In general , this takes place in the faculty building and is made up of lectures , so called workgroup settings , practical sessions ( e.g . histo ) and live-patient lectures . You are also trained in scientific literacy and do an actual test-study and have ethics classes . If you 're an average or above-average student studying nine to five should be enough to pass with decent grades here . We do n't have the STEP-system , though each faculty has some version of 'progress exams ' where you take the same exam ( not the same questions ) at set intervals during med school but have to perform better as you progress . **The second portion** ( your 'Master's ' ) is mostly rotations with designated prep courses in advance . The length of each rotation differs per faculty , at mine most rotations are six weeks each . In general your first rotations will be at your faculty hospital or very close and as you advance you can have rotations further away ( this is relative though , see above ) . Most rotations are set , though you have several electives as well . Now , about the prep courses : these consist of repition and more in-depth study of most-common diseases , anatomy etc ; practical tools ( such as basic management of post-op surgical patients , heart failure pts , ATLS etc . ) ; more diseases within the field and practice patients and cases . In general you 'll be studying more than 40 hours/week during these prep courses as they are very short . **Rotations at my faculty** are ( with different prep course length , not listed ) : * IM 2 x 6 weeks * Surgery 2 x 6 weeks * Neuro 6 weeks * Psych 6 weeks * Ob/Gyn 6 weeks * Peds 6 weeks * GP 5 weeks * Ophto 2 weeks * Derm 2 weeks * ENT 3 weeks * Public health 4 weeks * Elective 6-10 weeks * 12 weeks of warding in one dpt of choice ) * Elective 12 weeks or 2 x 6 weeks All in all almost two full years of rotations . The last two bullets are both in sixth year , which is called the 'switch year ' nowadays as it has no more prep courses and focuses on actual clinical work . Rotations are generally 8-17.30 with several call duties added ; with of course the exceptions of surgery and [ derm ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/52elsz/i_dont_get_why_everybody_says_derm_hours_are_easy/ ) . **And afterwards ? ** You 're a licensed physician . You can either work as an *ANIOS* ( physician *not* in training for specialist ) , or if you 're lucky/very good/have work experience as an ANIOS you can enter a 3-6 year residency program , which will make you an *AIOS* ( you see the 'n ' for 'not ' is missing ) . There is no match system , you have to apply for a spot through regular means . After that , you 're a full fledged specialist and have to find work somewhere . Please note that to become a GP you also have to specialise . **Other notes . ** At a lot of faculties it 's possible to do a rotation abroad . At some faculties , there is a special 4-year med school programme for people who degrees in e.g . biochem- which is a lot more like your premed/med structure . I 'm not completely with all the differences between this programme and the US programme . However , they generally accept less than 30 students each year ( compared to ~300 regular 1st years ) . **So , I hope you enjoyed this read . ** Ask any question you like !",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,medicalschool,"So , today I started my dermatology rotation . I have to say , it was not like I expected . To start off , they made us come in at 8.30 . 8.30 ! ! That means I had to go to bed by 22.30 to get my minimum of nine hours of sleep as I have to bike 15 minutes to get to the hospital . Absolutely ridiculous . Rounds then took almost two hours , which left me with a measly hour for my coffee break followed by the mandatory two hours for lunch . But the afternoon was worse . I was seeing outpatients , and because my supervisor was slow ( he was supervising multiple people at once ) I finished 1.5 hours later than planned . This meant that after preparing all my cases for the coming two days , I could only go home at four and drink beer in the sun for a mere two hours before I 'll have to start cooking dinner . And the worst part of it all ? My attending said that *every day is like this . * I have no idea why you guys all say that derm life is easy , this is my toughest rotation by far .",Germanic,Dutch

0bi,depression,"Hi , I may or may not be using this mainly as a step-up to seeking professional help . I have n't decided . I 'm just looking to hear someone 's thoughts , because I ca n't really talk to anyone about it IRL . I apologise if I 'm using this place for something it 's not intended for . Basically , nothing has been working out for me lately . Or at least , it feels that way . None of the things I worked hard for have yielded results , nor have the things I wished for come true . I do n't know why . All I do know is that I find it very hard to deal with- especially as a person who 's had a lot of things 'handed to him/going his way ' until the last year . It started about a year ago , but has only gotten serious the last 3 months . Nothing working out has made me apathetic , and it 's a self-enforcing loop I ca n't really get out of . The only times I 'm not having depressed thoughts are when I 'm out with my 'friends ' doing things that bear no relation to normal functioning- i.e . when I 'm keeping my mind off things . Lots of times , alcohol is involved . I always stay till closing , because I do n't want to go home . I put 'friends ' in quotes , because I have no one I can tell everything . They 're more like acquaintances , just people I have small talk with and know a little about . Over the past months , it 's gotten to the point where I do n't know what I 'm doing any more and how to stop this nonsense . I fail to see the point of life . The only thing that 's kept my from killing myself the last weeks is what it would do to my parents and some of my 'friends ' . I considered posting this to SW , but I figured I 'm feeling more depressed than suicidal . I 'm sorry if this is hard to follow or reads like a rant , I just needed to get my thoughts out somewhere . I really do n't know what I 'm looking for with this post , I guess acknowledgement would be enough . Thanks for reading . -0bi [ EDIT ] Thanks for all the kind words everyone .

Not being respected by patients is fine . Nothing being improved about logistics is fine . Not making a lot of money ( yet ) is fine . Having student loans is fine . etc . etc . However *stacking those* becomes a problem . In other words : working long hours for little pay in shitty conditions with patients who are not helpful and who do n't respect you or what you do and who do not take responsibility for their own health but blame you for them not getting better is **definitely** something to be unhappy about . And blowing off steam every once in a while is healthy .,Germanic,Dutch

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"I 'm not 100 % on the Australian system , but this should basically explain it : Public healthcare is a hospital . Lots of different patients , many doctors and nurses . Partially paid for by the government . Private healthcare is a called a practice . It 's a lot smaller , and often targets one specific type of patient , e.g . those who need a knee replacement . # # # Warning : complicated stuff below that explains the underlying 'problem ' with private practice . # To understand why private practitioners make so much money , it 's important to understand the following . Hospitals can do two types of treatment : treatment that makes them money and that costs them money . Insurance companies are not willing to pay the huge costs for cancer treatment for a patient directly . It 'd mess up their statistics or something . So if that treatment costs 10X money , they get 2X from the insurance and have to pay the rest themselves . To be able to pay that treatment they need money , so they 'overcharge ' the insurance companies for the 'cheap ' treatments ( note : this is all regulated and consensual ) . So instead of charging X ( the cost ) , they charge 2X . So they make 1X profit per treatment to cover for the expenses of cancer treatment . A private practice offers only specific types of treatment- and you guessed it- those who make money . Since they do n't need the excess amount to cover for radiation therapy , they can charge less than 2X and still more than 1X . Result : they make more money , whilst being cheaper for the insurance companies . That results in more patients being sent there , and less 'cheap ' patients to the hospital . Eventually the hospitals will no longer be able to pay for the expensive treatment if this continues . That 's why doctors often dislike private practitioners- they 're money wolves and mes sup the system at the same time .",Germanic,Dutch
0bi,explainlikeimfive,"About radiation ( I do n't think that was addressed in the other threads ) : radiation damages a cell . If you damage it enough , the cell will die . So they concentrate several radiation beams upon the tumor , to kill the cells there .",Germanic,Dutch

Will that chest have different loot , or will it just not be there ? Or maybe it is there , what happens then ? I guess what Im really wondering about is whether I should buy as many unique items ( recipes/diagrams/cards ) as possible , because I will just get different/new items later on when looting/winning cards , OR , if I should save my money and count on finding most of the stuff by looting/winning cards etc .

1337w4rri0r,AdviceAnimals,"The dictionary defines an assault rifle , in addition to being an automatic weapon , as 'a nonmilitary weapon modeled on the military assault rifle , usually modified to allow only semiautomatic fire . ' ( http : //www.dictionary.com/browse/assault-rifle ) So a semi-automatic rifle can be correctly classified as an assault rifle , even though it lacks an automatic firing mode , making the premise for this dank meme faulty . Further on , I think the distinction is meaningless , because it 's not the firing mode that makes the difference for which rifles should be sold over the counter to millions of civilians , it 's the magazine capacity , the ammunition and the designed purpose of the weapon . An AR15 is not made for hunting , it 's made for warfare/security and it 's very powerful at that effect . Now , by all means , you can still argue that you should be able to own those types of guns , because Murica and freedom and stuff , but diverting the core of the debate to the definition of an 'assault rifle ' is just.. weird..",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,AdviceAnimals,"Alright , but my point was really that the definition does n't really matter . You can call it a stick , and its still an extremely powerful weapon .

For you , your family , and your community . It 's a fact , right ?

1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"As far as I know , meditation and hypnosis is scientifically proven to alter brainwave frequency when practiced , especially in more experienced individuals . I dont find it very unlikely that audio could help in achieving a desired mental state more easily , especially considering buddhist monks have chanted in groups for ages . Whether or not that is true , I find it pretty far fetched that you compare the use of audio to drugs , hyperventilation , crystal vibrations etc . You also seem to be implying that OP 's practice is not 'valid ' , because he/she happened to do so while listening to certain sounds , and that is just silly . All in all , I find your rant about what is right or wrong to be judgemental , non-constructive and quite random . I really think the meditation community would be doing itself a favor by distancing itself from this kind of thing .",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Yeah . Here 's the thing . Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . It is not meaningless at all . Every single thing you do might alter brainwave activity , but the relevant part is in which direction , how much , and for how long . When sleeping , the brain wave frequencies dramatically changes when compared to being awake . Why should it not be measurable on the opposite side of the scale , when highly focused and attentive ? & gt ; I did n't say OP 's practice is not valid , I have no idea what the studies are ( I would guess they 're inconclusive ) . All I 'm saying is that it 's not meditation . Why would listening to certain sounds prevent meditation ? Even if all this audio at certain hz ' is just mumbo jumbo , it could certainly act as merely whitenoise , which many people find useful to prevent distraction .",Germanic,Norwegian
1337w4rri0r,Meditation,"& gt ; Provide some study demonstrating that inducing certain brainwave frequencies brings about some kind of benefit . I did not claim that inducing certain brainwave frequencies provides benefits , and I will thus not defend said non-claim . I merely disagreed with your idea that meditation has nothing to do with brainwave frequencies because 'Every single thing you do alters brainwave frequency . So that 's kind of meaningless . ' However , my opinion as a layman and # not-an-actual-neuro-scientist , is that brainwaves have a lot to do with meditation , including its benefits . Here is an article about meditation that does not talk about benefits , but changes in brainwaves during meditation . http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100319210631.htm Feel free to read that or google 'hokey new age drug psychedelic buzz seekers studies ' to find your own sources . & gt ; First of all , I did n't say certain sounds prevent meditation My interpretation of your initial post was that you strongly disregarded OP 's meditation as valid , because he/she listened to certain audio while practicing . The title of this thread is 'Found this video to *meditate to* ' . Neither OP or I have claimed that the audio itself can be poured into anyones ears and it can be regarded meditation . & gt ; Also , you 're contradicting yourself here . *Audio does not prevent meditation* and *blocking out audio fascilitates meditation* is not a contradiction , even if reworded by you . I suggest we leave this matter for now , as we seem to not agree even on what we are discussing . You seem pissed off about 'new age stuff ' and I will certainly agree with you on a lot of things in that regard , but I found your initial post to be somewhat insulting , because my opinion is that there were no reason to bring up all that stuff in such a negative retoric , just because OP said he/she meditated while listening to certain audio , which he/she found useful or helpful .",Germanic,Norwegian

Happy House : I liked the song , but I 'm not that fan of female vocal . In Dulce Decorum : A good song and the kind of rock I like . The Chameleons : I have already heard a lot from this band before . A good suggestion , thanks . First Chapter : I heard the songs 'Tomorrow Never Knows ' , 'Garden of Delight ' and '1969 ' . My first impression was that it was a little slow-paced , but I liked it and will probably listen to the whole album another day . I liked 1969 the most . Sisters of Mercy : I started by listening to 'Marian ' and it was one of the better songs I 've heard today , even though I 'm not the biggest fan of songs that last over five minutes . There was something I liked about 'Alice ' but the melody was n't that good in my opinion , but as you said their earlier EPs are better . The two last songs I listened to was 'Walk Away ' and 'Train ' . I really liked both song , especially 'train ' and its different kind of sound . Nick Cave and the bad seeds : I liked the way the vocal talks instead of singing in 'Rings of Saturn ' , really unique . I also listened to 'Into My Arms ' which was totally different . I also liked this song , however it was more of a time-to-relax kind of music , and not what I looked for now . Nick Cave and Warren Ellis : After I had listened to the first two songs I realized that maybe I was listening to the wrong Nick Cave , so I checked out another Nick Cave I found on Spotify . I guess this was the Nick Cave you meant , since this was a more punk like band .

I think HotS is doing a much better job stretching the game mechanics . Just want to add on anskie 's comment , the game mechanics of Dota 2 has not really been streched that much , if at all , as Monkey King is the only hero that was made originally for that game engine . All the other heroes were created in the Warcraft 3 map editor , for DOTA 1 , and that limited what you could do and could n't do with spells . Some spells have been reworked and only exists in Dota 2 , but no hero has had `` huge '' changes that warrant stretching the game mechanics .

I know you have used 3 in midfield for a long time , I 've watched Real a lot since 2013 . Kovacic and Casemiro is different players and Casemiro fit that DM role nicely , leaving Kovacic out of the starting 11 . & gt ; He is the natural heir to Modric who will turn 32 later this year and has shown signs of regression this season . Modric has n't though ... only think is that he might not be able to play that often when it becomes 2-3 games in a week , but he still outperform most midfielders in the world .

It really depends on the system , and yes he is young and all that , but if United comes knocking , saying they would like either Isco or Kovacic , Real could sell with a reason . Asensio is n't sub for those 3 midfielders , and James already seems to be on his way out . Turning 22 , but can be a guranted started at United if he wants to come and play . Real does n't have a big reason to sell because they can just keep him for depth , but the question is if he wants to wait until either of the 3 midfielders right now stop playing for Real , or become a starter for a club ( with possible CL ) I do n't think it 's too out there to suggest a transfer for him , and I think it 's a bigger chance getting him than either of the others ( the reason I suggested it in the first place was because I rather have United spend money on Kovacic than James , not that he was a very realistic buy )",Germanic,Norwegian

I just expressed that I hope we can snatch him up , because I think he would be a great addition and while the chances are low it 's the sole reason that he is behind those 3 that I think United can get him .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Every FA has 5 spots . Meaning they can send 5 teams to the CL . However , the premier league can only give away 3 direct spots and one qualifying spot . So if United win EL and finish outside top 4 , there will be 5 english teams in CL next season . However , if another team outside top 4 won the CL , it would mean England had 6 clubs that qualified and would need to remove one spot from the league , so only top 4 got it . The rule changed a couple years ago , last time it happened in PL was when Chelsea won CL and finished 6th . Tottenham lost their CL spot because they finished 4th .

It could be that in RM contract , he has to be in some ads , while Nike 's contract have to allow CR to be in RM related ads , but he is still sponsered by Nike . This means whenever Ronaldo is with RM , he is `` under a Adidas contract '' while when he does things on his own , he is with Nike . Nike still has his shoes , whenever Ronaldo do interviews on his own he is covered in Nike etc . It benefits Nike more to have Ronaldo on a contract , and also allowing Adidas/RM to use his image rights , than not have him at all . If Adidas had both Ronaldo and Messi , it would blow for Nike not being able to front any so profilic as them . So Ronaldo being in Adidas ads & lt ; Having Ronaldo on contract to use him in private , for Nike . Just my take on it though ...",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; BW an e-sports that had been going for 10 years had almost 0 scene outside of korea , sure in korea it was THE e-sports but korea was just one country . & gt ; or at least for a time , something BW never managed to do . Because the game came out in 1998 , a time where it would have been impossible . What people point out is that BW made the way for every single other game to develope a pro-scene . People saw how in Korea , BW had a competetive scene with many many pros , and saw it would be possible in their own country . Maybe not with BW , but with other , new games . BW showed people that if you organized and the game was good enough , it could be an e-sport . Not just a tournament at your local school , but a country-wide , even worldwide e-sport . It allowed games and developers to push toward this . Starcraft 2 became `` the esport globally '' , no one denies that , but the godfather of all esport is BW . Anyone saying that SC2 could become what it did without BW is n't seeing it right .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Doubt it will be that expensive , hopefully not . I will get it either way I think , but not sure how much I will use grapichs ( as they look now , I 'm just too in love of the old look , but can accept HD with some improvements ) I 'm more exicted for ladder system and all that really .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Sorry , completly misread your comment . Or maybe I misread Emu401 , and it lead to me thinking you meant `` grapichs is disabled for ladder '' , but I see what you mean now . Did they comment on it ? I saw it and thought they would update it , as it 's not that big a change and probably wont affect gameplay that much , and is a result of monitors at the time being 4:3 , and in their tests they did n't see it as a big change . However , if they already said it 's disabled for ladder , it 's pretty clear .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"BW is still a better game , and also a more fun game for many people . The limitations are something you improve on , it 's not like a new player is as good as a veteran at controlling their army . Of course , not like that in SC2 either , but it 's not as damning to have all your units in 1 hotkey . Which is why BW have a bigger `` compete with yourself '' aspect that many enjoy in games . Look how big MOBA games are when people feel they are competing with themselves to be better , and not feel like the game is unbalanced to favor the other race/player . There is something satisfying to us to get better at things that is harder . Getting better at army control or macro in SC2 is not as good as feeling as getting better at it in BW , so BW just gives a better impression . & gt ; What is toxic though is people arguing that having interface limitations is something positive at a point you can contemplate a community that bashes a more recent game because it has actually evolved and does provide less interface limitations , while improving tons of other aspects to the game . It 's a balance to people bashing older games because they ca n't control the whole army with 1 hotkey . Some see it as interface limitations , other see it as `` the game '' BW is a game where you control 12 units at a game and need to select each induvidual building . It 's the game , it 's not a `` limitation '' in any way , because the game do n't wish you to be able to select more than 12 units . A limitation is how the game was 4:3 , because that 's what the computer screen was . Now , the game is updated to modern standard . That is what a limitation is , not `` being able to only select 12 units '' Also , `` while improving tons of other aspects to the game , what do you mean by that ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; if you could just mass ling 1A it would be wayyyy to easy . Remember that pathing in BW matters . You wont have a ball like in SC2 , however , the 12 unit balances out someone being ahead , it 's more tasks to do therefor harder to be ahead in BW than SC2 . But deathballs are never a good thing in Brood War , and would be a pathing nightmare .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"How would reavers ruin the game ? Other than harrass , they are n't a big deal for Terran , just be sure to have 1 goliath in your army if they use dropships in fights . Or keep 4 marines or so in your base when the timing hits . PvP is different issue . Doubt he would rage about just a random unit like Reaver . Actually , in my many years of playing BW , I 've never raged about a specific unit . However , I can see how Vultures are cancerous for many people .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Yeah you just want broken balance in your favor . Actually , not always . Have someone deathball Protoss and attack a land mine/vulture/siege tank army . Yea , that protoss lost the game easly . Even tho the units pathing in BW make it hard to create a deathball .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,Atleast SC2 BW custom map .,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; with regards to deathballs I highly doubt it . Also , in BW you do n't want to approach any army using a deathball . Imagine having a deathball and then a fungual hits , only that the fungual is big enough to hit all your units and it puts every unit , except your strongest , to 1 hp . Yea , that 's Plague for you . Have fun with 1 muta coming in killing 3 of your units with 1 shot . Or have a death ball and 1 storm hits . Or try attacking a siege line-up with a deathball . Deathball is a disadvantage in BW . A protoss having deathball Zealots would never be able to attack a Terran set up with mines and siege tanks .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"1 building select is part of the balance too tho , just like 12 units select . Look at is as , the further ahead you get , the harder it gets to control everything and be effective . Thats why pro 's are so incredible good , they do both the micro and the macro to an incredible extend .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; but if your looking to add more people to your scene i am not so sure your really moving things forward here . Blizzard 's video , before showing HD remaster , at the event was basically a video how people in Korea talked how they used to play BW and spend hours and hours of it . It 's basically marketing old fans that HD is coming out . I think they know their target group : People who used to play BW and/or SC2 that look to play some RTS again . I doubt they are working to get many new players into the BW scene , but I have a theory that they want to develop a new RTS in a new setting/universe , and try to get some RTS hype going again . But changing the gameplay for BW would be a pretty big decision , and big in a bad way . The game already survived 19 years in it 's current interaction , that living through it 's sequel . I do n't think it will change the pull of the game that much .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I respect sc2 for what it is and I would n't see it work if it had the limitations bw has . It would n't . But SC2 is balanced around being able to select your whole army at once . BW is balanced around having only 12 . That 's the point people try to make and why people do n't want to have being able to select more units . A big part of the interest of BW is how difficult it is mechanically . SC2 issue with many BW fans is how the mechanically skill disappered , and it went more down to balance issues that was n't properly fixed the first years of SC2 , and lower ranked players felt the game worked against them in a bad way . BW works against it 's players in a good way , with being mechanically hard , not bad balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"No , it will not . The games will most likely be played through the new game client Blizzard has , so all that happens is that someone starts the game in HD and some in the BW , and they play eachother on the same server , kind of thing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"As Tastosis like to point out , when you can only control 12 units at a time , being far ahead is really difficult to make a big advantage out of , because it gets more and more things to do . Not being able to select your whole army at once is a big balance point .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Yea , I noticed that too when I looked a bit tonight on some videos . The Battlecruiser looks insanely good and what I think they are going to aim for with most units . Hopefully . Zerglings look a bit iffy to me , same with marines . Zealots looked pretty good tho . Terran-buildings , definetly need shadowing .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think so , yes , because what it looks like is that BW is moving to the client that SC2/HOTS and so is . In this video , he talks how people with old users will be able to log in/connect the user to the modern one . As I see it , we who now owns BW will need to download it on the new client . And because of that , all I can see is that in the summer , the HD remaster will be sold on that new client , and all play will happen on that client . Meaning people who have BW now outside of the client will not be able to play with people on the new client . But remastered will not replace the BW out now if that 's what you are thinking of . It 's not like they put out a patch that updates the grapichs . The game ( I think , but not sure ) will be out on the client now soon , and then Remastered will be released on the client as a sellling item ( which will be like a DLC to the game on the client ) and it will just be updated grapichs , and everone that play BW , either in its original form or HD , will be able to play together since everyone use the same client ( this last part im 100 percent sure of ) So yea , we will need to buy HD remastered anyway , 100 percent sure , but it 's probably not expensive .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I 've always wondered why people disregarded these The gameplay in BW is very unique to it 's game and engine . The SC2 engine just makes the balance all messed up , and it feels very off putting . It 's nothing like BW , where the gameplay `` flaws '' , or just commanding 12 units at a time , or needing to select 1 and 1 building , is part of the balance .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; You seem to have completely missed the point of SC : R. SC : R is not meant to replace SC2 and make BW great again , it 's meant to give lifelong fans and ex-players something that can provide a ton of nostalgia and enjoyment by updating an ancient game and giving it modern day features and support for modern software . Anyone that watched the event would see the video Blizzard played before the Remastered trailer . It was basically a `` nostalgia '' thing , and Blizzard knows that . They do n't aim to revieve BW as a globabl esport , but it will definetly help the scene again . I 've been loving the revive for BW the last couple of years , because I loved the game as a kid . But never got to see any live events as in streams . Just VODS on youtube . Now , I can watch Flash livestream himself for every game he plays . Even Nal_ra . It 's amazing . But I do n't expect Blizzard to try push the scene more . I have thought that Blizzard is more trying to get more and more people back into RTS before they release a new RTS set in a new universe . Would be very exciting .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What he meant was that when SC2 came out , Kespa still had tournaments in Korea , but even tho it was BW tournament in the proleague , they added a `` SC2 match '' into the best of 5 series , meaning it was quite forced . Everybody thought SC2 would be the big thing , but it was still a bit more time left for BW really , as it was still big , but with forcing in into the BW scene , it just looked rather disrespectful . Should just have let time pass and the scene make the transition itself , not have a poor SC2/BW hybrid . Probably what he meant .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The coaches stand right behind them in the booth , have n't you seen the International ? & gt ; If timeouts gave better strategic games then that could add value to the game . But it 's ... real time strategy ... People want to see RTS , not a pause screen and someone filming the players for 1 minute . Nobody want to see the best of the best having to take a 1 minute timeout to strategy ... They want to see them being capable of playing at the highest level while coordinate at the highest level and strategy at the highest level , all at once . It 's why the game is so fucking hard to play with 5 individuals with no communication . Just leave timeouts out of the scene , seriously . Nothing kills the experience and flow of a game more than a pause screen and a minute of watching nothing happens , or commentators just talking , or watching the players just talk . It 's a real time strategy game . You play and strategy at real time speed , not with timeouts . If a team need timeout to talk and strategy , they are not a good team .",Germanic,Norwegian

As a Toss player , Reach and Nal_ra were incredible fun to watch . But neither had the `` dominance '' factor . Crazy to think that the careers of Flash , Jaedong etc . have now passed , by a good margin , the amount of time the older pros career was .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"& gt ; but lots of professional sports use them and I could see it being a good experiment . But in Dota 2 , there are 5 players all constantly talking with each other . In sports , it can be difficult for coaches and managers to talk to all it 's players at once . & gt ; Certainly the team using it could take some time to calmly re-assess when they do n't have to focus intently on the micro and decision making of their hero for a few seconds . But that 's the RTS part ... You play , you strategy , you do the micro at the same time as the macro , you plan your next move while doing something else . It 's a big part of the genre . Would every team in Dota 2 say `` Yes , please '' to a timeout ? Yea , definetly . Should it be like that ? Definetly no . It 's what makes the team better and a team with players of less induvidual skill can beat a better team or a team that is ahead in terms of farm and items , because they are better at playing and strategy at the same time .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The game was 8 years old when this happened . It been 5 years without any patches .

And 5 years without a patch is crazy when we are thinking todays standard .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"Why ? Tactical timouts ? ? ? Video games mix them together , you play and strategy at the same time . ARTS , action real time strategy , which Dota is . Being able to have tactical timouts just ruins a big aspect of the game .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Maybe , but changing it is not a great idea , since it 's part of the balance of the game . No kidding , it would be a huge difference if you had unlimited selection and you could just keep all your production in one hot-key , it would just make the game unbalanced . Which they did n't want , they wanted to keep the same gameplay , appealing to the older fan-base ( people who have played BW ) , and maybe some new people would wan na try it . But the decision to not add it is the correct one .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think every choice they did , about what to add and not to add , and what to change and what not to change , are the correct ones . They have just touched the grapichs and bugs , and let the game be as it is . Changing a lot of the mechanics will change the balance , and while it 's obviously more comfortable playing with the newer features like SC2 have , it 's part of the game in BW and a big part of the `` feel '' of the game . Keeping everything as it has been is not a bad choice , consider how highly the game is rated . I was very happy to hear most of their changes being non-gameplay related . With you saying that you hoped it should be in the SC2 engine , what do you mean with that ? Do you mean like many of the mods in SC2 that is BW ? Or that the game just was playable in the SC2 engine ?",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think the biggest selling point would be that it 's a fresh universe , really . Blizzard making an RTS outside Warcraft/Starcraft . & gt ; '' It 's like SC2 , but with cannons instead of lasers ? '' Simplifying it a bit too much , are n't we ? See the huge difference between the Warcraft series and Starcraft series , despite both being RTS from Blizzard . They will find a way to do it different enough . Overwatch is something completly new and outside Blizzards comfort zone , and it 's amazing . A new RTS game soon , and with soon we are talking 2-3 years to announcment , will be a fitting time . Soon , as in `` 4-5 years from now '' , and by then SC2 will be , what , 10 years old ? Actually , 11-12 years . So why would n't they try to make a new , big RTS ? Selling points : Set in a completly new universe , it 's 12 years since the release of their last big RTS ( biggest difference in their RTS release are just 7 years with WC3- & gt ; SC2 ) , try to bring back the fans that have left Blizzard because they do n't play any of their games ( because RTS are the only ones they are interested in )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Tell them , BW is a game where you compete a lot with yourself in terms of getting better . Yes , you can only select 12 units , and yes , only build from 1 building at a time . It 's really hard . But the better you get at it , the more fun is it . It 's really rewardful getting better at the mechanics . Tell them , this is not a limitation of the game , but rather rules of the game , just like most sports have rules about how big of a field you play on , or how many people can be on one team at a time . Also , I ca n't remember I 've lost a game and felt it was because the game fucked me over , rather that I played badly or the opponent play better . There are no balance-whining .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; People do not understand that at this point , any RTS game that pulls some attention is good for any of us . I love that Blizzard did a BW HD remake , and my hope is that it 's to get more `` older fans '' , aka . those who stopped playing BW and SC2 , to get some feel for the RTS genre again ( I 've been playing RTS my whole life , from BW to SC2 to WC3 and now back to BW , so I love the genre ) I hope with increased interest in BW HD , they are `` making a fan base '' before launching their new RTS , set in a completly new and fresh universe . But since it wont have `` Warcraft '' or `` Starcraft '' attached to it , it 's biggest pull must be `` Blizzard RTS game '' , and it will be a wider base of fans if as many as possible play a RTS Blizzard game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I 've seen a couple of comments on here about players doing some sort of `` tutorial '' , but nothing recent . But the game has n't been patched since 2001 , and most builds are viable even tho some are preferred than others . Day9 dailies are many BW videos , check them out maybe . Other than that , just watch many pro-games , as the action is often slow in the start and you will pick up some openers and build orders .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; No multiple building select and manually rallying workers to mine makes it unfun to play for me . No multiple building select is part of the balance . And , you might enjoy getting good at it . Part of the satisfaction with BW is how you compete with yourself at getting better at the game , at it 's mechanic . It 's not a limiation , it 's part of the game . Imagine going on a football pitch and complaining that the field could be a lot bigger so you have more area to run around on . Yes , that 's true , but the rules of the game decide you have to stay on it . But I can definetly see it being less fun for many since it takes focus away from controlling the army and doing more `` acitve '' stuff , but it 's just part of the game . Workers automatically mining was actually a change I would like to see , but it 's not really a big deal in the end . Keybindings are really sweet to have , but I realised that all buildings and units current hot-keys are so burned into my brain , that I 'm more sure I will be able to handle it better using legacy hotkeys ... Will be hard to change , even tho key-bindings are a lot better ofc .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I remember playing a lot of BW and thinking back , I was so horrible ( to my defense , I was like 10 and only had played it for myself ) , think 1 worker per mineral , in the mineral lines . Then I found the pro-scene , and oh boy , did I learn a lot . Just watching the pros play will make someone a lot better , and now we live in an era where most pro 's stream every day and you get FPVOD of anyone ( back in the days , up until SC2 release , it was unheard of having FPVOD of the pros , it was as holy grails )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Lol , not in BW . A move into a tank/vulture army that is correctly setup ? Yea , your zealots are dead and your dragoons will most likely die . I think you are likely joking , but it 's interesting to see how a BW fight can be changed just with adding some flavor . Fast arbiter tech has been popular in recent meta , and works wonders most often . But a Toss army A-moving into a sieged up , mine-laid terran army are just too weak , unless it 's the toss catching the terran army off-guard . 200/200 army Terran will crush most things in the game , but the strenghts of Zerg/Toss is how they have spell-casters to even the scale .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Definetly looks better in your edit , and my `` theory '' is that they have made everything to look remastered , and will polish with comparing the models now , the ones they made and the old , and add details/changes ( like your edit has done ) to make them more similiar . I think the issue I have with remaster is how everything looks really `` shiny '' , or too flat , definelty needs the hard shading that BW have . Still , really excited to try it with new grapichs , but it will be really , really hard to move away from the current BW look , if the HD do n't `` improve '' My biggest fear is the HD remaster kinda staying too `` weird looking '' for me , and throw me too much off , and then the pro-scene use the HD look . I 'm actually quite interested in how that is going to turn out . I 'm just so in love with the BW look that I hope it stays that way ... And it 's something poetic that a game is being broadcasted with the same look for 20 years and going strong .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Bugs develop into features , but they are releasing some fixes , like Dragoons will stop and not do any commands . The pathing issue is a feature in the old engine , not a bug . The engine used in BW have a `` timer '' that updates the pathing every few second . Every x second , the unit will `` update '' it 's pathing , but it can cause for weird movements when a unit try to , say , go down a ramp because it 's pathing gets `` blocked '' when the timer updates . This is not bugs . This is the engine . People like the engine and they wo n't fix it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s Day9 demonstrates it here . Also , just because some of us like the weird mechanics and pathing , does n't make us `` neckbeards '' , it 's just something satisfying with flaws like that . The smooth movement in SC2 is great , it 's works really good for that game . But if one have played BW , one could easly see how the smooth pathing and units clumping up would not work for the game . And as you can see in Day9 's video , it 's possible to counter this if you are good enough .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If true , I can see BW coming back big . Some of the best with it was after losing a game you would just jump into a custom game and relax for a bit . It might be old tech , but so many of the maps are fun .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Not really , and who knows , maybe Blizzard is n't that caught up in making big bucks for BW HD , and it does n't seem so with BW free patch ( even tho making BW free and have many come back to it , reliving how amazing it is , will have them buy BW HD , is a great move ) I think they most likely just want to have so many as possible back , and making BW free and releasing BW HD is going to have 2 games drawing people back into the scene .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Really a selling point for me , together with classic gameplay . Do n't care much for updating the grapichs , but the rest is so good to see being implemented .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"If you have ever wondered why pathing is bad , check out Day9 video on it . https : //youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU ? t=17m33s It 's not a `` Pathing issue '' , it 's literally how the engine is .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Its a fucking video game . Most people excited for this do n't care if BW does n't have a flawless engine with perfect pathing . Few that played BW back in the day is at an age or level that they can become any sort of profesional in it . & gt ; Did n't realize the SC community had completely fossilized at this point . It 's a 20 year old game . I 'm probably one of the younger people putting several hours into the game , and I 'm 22 . The target audience just want to play BW with a good match-making system and is happy they did n't change any of the gameplay . If you watched the event , they even had the lead up to it being people in their late 20s to late 30s talking about how much they enjoyed playing it back in the day , and this is just to bring a new looking BW to those who wants it . If you read up , you will also know that BW players playing 1.18 will be able to play against 1.18 BW players , which is why they wo n't change the big gameplay features like pathing . Is the pathing bad ? Obviously , the engines 20 years ago are like that . Does it need fixing ? Not really . It 's the game , and if you do n't like it , just do n't play it ? Many other games out there you can play , do n't see why you latch on this or even take time to comment if you do n't like what they are doing . Just do n't play BW . Surely you have better things to do . Also , if with pathing you also mean how the units move and with clumb up like in SC2 , you have not an eye for gameplay features like that , because it 's essential for lots of the BW gameplay to be like that .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,samuraijack,Thank you !,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Overwatch Blizzard releasing a game like Overwatch was definetly a big , big risk . Usually you make a game after your reputation and fanbase , and while Hearthstone was kinda `` out there '' , it 's not so weird for the fanbase to see Blizzard making a card-game based on Warcraft . However , Overwatch was one not in any genre Blizzard was familiar with , was even a FPS , and on top of that , a whole new universe and franchise . And it was great !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Well , this is just an issue because Avilo is a new account , surely ? He will play up to getting his rank , but will need to play D 's first . It 's been like this for ages and the BW community always wanted that matchmaking system new games have . Obviously did n't `` desperatly '' need that new system , seeing how it all turned out , but it 's a big deal to keep lower ranked players staying and improving .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I think , the biggest atmosphere factors will the sounds and the music . Seriously , sit down and just listen ( without eyes open ) during a fight and it 's all about the music and the sounds effect of every shot fired , or death sounds or spawn sounds or the music playing in the background . I think HD can really get a BW feel if you have all elements included .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"I will be very impressed if they have , or well , I can see they `` updating it to 4k '' , but remaking completly new cutscenes , same quality as SC2 ? Doubt it .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; because this game will only push the downfall of SC2 ... . When the HD announcement was made , they played a video that was basically people in Korea recalling their time when they used to play SC ( as in SC1 ) and talk about all their memories . Very marketet at `` remember SC1 ? Why not come back for a bit , watching it again , and play it again with updated grapichs ! `` , and not so much about getting new players into it . However , SC2 got it 's big chance and it 's been amazing that it has lasted so long . Few games ( as games that you have to buy to purchase ) has lasted so long . Think about games that came out in 2010 , and how many have big tournaments as of lately ? There are not many RTS out now , so we might be able to have all BW and SC2 , other options I can think of is WC3 and Age of empires 2 , but not many others . If Blizzard is willing , they can support both a BW scene and SC2 scene , and many people will be playing both . And nice thing with BW is that all balance is done and they basically wont need to use time or money to work on it anymore . I also doubt many that already left SC2 community will come back to BW if they did n't come back to SC2 already . Idk , just think the RTS genre is on it 's way down , and BW HD might be a sort of plan to get more people back into the RTS genre , before Blizzard is dropping a new RTS . What would be amazing is a new RTS game in a new universe/setting , in the same way Overwatch is its own universe . I think Blizzard have seen that , a problem with SC2 might not be gameplay or balance , just that people are sick of playing in the same universe for 20 years . Maybe it 's time for something completly new and fresh . At one point , people just need to accept that SC2 has had it run , and do n't talk bad or think bad of BW growing . BW is an amazing game , better than SC2 ( coming from someone that loved playing it and rate it highhy ) , but a revive of BW might mean we get another RTS soon !",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The grapichs of WC3 is pretty alright , but I do think some would welcome some balances . As far as 1v1 go , there are most likely more about `` the races themselves '' that really have the issue , like the Blademaster being incredible strong , so not going him as first hero is ... well , it 's cheesy not to , which makes it a bit , idk , boring ? Same with Demon hunter for night elves . And the meta is kinda stale , the same builds vs. the same races , but I still find the game very fun to play and watch , mostly because of the heroes coming into effect and changing up each game ( as with item drop or good spells/hero combos )",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; If the BW esport scene thrives it will hold a unique position in that it is one of rare , if not only game that has `` settled down '' . Blizzard just got incredible lucky with the `` flaws '' of the game . Like the developer here brought up , it 's okay that not every reaver shot connect . The reason for this is if it did , the reaver would be so incredible strong in harrass . It would mean as soon as reaver landed in your base , you would not be able to run away with your workers ( as the pro 's do now , and is an incredible skill to jump between the bases to move the workers quickly ) With every shot connecting , the reaver shot would hit however , even if it landed behind the minerals patch or far away . So that 's a flaw that just is needed to stay it , or the balance gets a bit icky . E : Also a point that Tastosis likes to bring up , is how the game balances its self with limitation . Being able to just select 1 building or just 12 units at a time , means that the further you get ahead , the harder it gets ( an army with many , many units and spellcasters are difficult to handle , vs a smaller army ) so it 's nicely balanced that you can sacrifice and come back without having to straight up fight a stronger army .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Probably for the best that back in 1999 the developers did n't get a message from thousands of people over every single change and every singel one with an opinion , a disagreeing opinion , would be able to talk shit to them over how they ruined the game .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,That 's a hilarious story haha,Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"The game will become free , as in , Starcraft Brood War out now will get a patch , 1.18 , that makes it free ( basically , free to download ) Then , Starcraft BW HD will come out in the summer . I 'm not 100 procent sure , but look at is as an expansion pack , or a DLC , that allows you to play with the updated grapichs . However , you still play on the same servers as the ones just playing BW . So the community will not be split between the two 's . Most likely it will be in the same client as SC2 , but we will see . All it means is that us that play it now will just have to DL it in the client . Nothing biggy . I think the only thing that is redone is the grapichs . Doubt they would put the money into new cutscenes , as it is very expensive and they do n't expect a huge income probably . There are also not that many cutscenes , so we are n't really losing out ( the old ones still look great IMO ) , however , as it is so few , so why not ? But my quess i no .",Germanic,Norwegian
29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; I figured it was a shading issue , but it 's probably in it 's polishing stages . Yea , I hope what they got now is kinda what they have `` build up '' themselves , and now they will look at their models , compare it to the BW models , and then shade/change to make it look more alike , but keeping the new style .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"& gt ; Along with the dramatically improved visuals , StarCraft : Remastered will also bring modern connectivity to the game , including full Battle.net ( now Blizzard App ) support for matchmaking and chat , enhanced ladder functionality , and support for friends lists , streaming , and cloud saves . The new matchmaking feature will automatically connect players of equal skill based on their chosen race , but the game will also continue to support the original matchmaking system—which is to say , no matchmaking at all . & gt ; '' If you remember , the original StarCraft didn ’ t have a button like Warcraft III , '' Stilwell said . `` Players threw down a gauntlet in chat channels or hosted open game lobbies for other players to join and discuss terms . We ’ re retaining that style of interaction as an option . That is an essential element of the game ’ s culture . '' What they are saying is that the game will get a new matchmaking system like that , but they will also keep the old style for those who wan na do that , and it basically keeps custom games as they are . So we get both , but I do n't think the lobby-based system will count towards your rank .",Germanic,Norwegian

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"What OP do n't seem to understand it 's all about exposure and maintaining a fan base . There are some that currently enjoy both SC2 and Brood war , and some that enjoy neither . And also those who enjoy SC2 only , and those who enjoy BW only . Blizzard know there are many people in that BW-only category , fans of Blizzard games that have left SC2 . Giving that category of people a new and fresh start will make them continue use a Blizzard product , which is important and will allow Blizzard to produce new product in the future because they have a big fanbase . Ignore the current BW fanbase , and you might lose out on people who will be excited for new products . OP also dont seem to see this is a rare phenomenon , a 19 year old game having a huge fanbase and a viable market . Only other thing that comes close is Age of empire 2 HD . BW HD wo n't make huge sales , so it 's not a `` greedy company '' thing , I think they truly love SC1 at Blizzard , and this is something they want to do for the game . Also , maybe they will get some feedback and ideas that can apply to SC2 on how to make it a more longevity game .",Germanic,Norwegian

The eldians that fight for Marley ( Reiner/Bertholt ) know their attack was a horrible thing to do , but thet view it as a necessesary thing to do , so the marley change their view on the eldians in the Marley nation . Also , the marleys need to titan powers to fight back other nations . And other nations are probably scared of the Marley because of they hold the titan power . And the Paradise Island inhabitants now view Marley as the enemy , because of the attack . But isnt Marley 's action reasonable consider what history say ? A people all capable to become huge titans should not hold much power and control others . But what if that history is fake ? I think we will end SNK without having a `` good '' outcome , and many lives were lost for no good reason , just like real life . History is written by the victor after all .

So when I found the streams showing Proleague and Jin Air OSL I was catching pro-games again . That Jin Air OSL finale , plus Proleague finale during the same period , were amazing . And now , many years later , I 'm able to catch every pro-game played . Truly amazing having BW come back during a time period where streaming is so accessable and I 'm older and not just a kid sitting on youtube listening and watching koreans play video game ( I discovered the english casters later , like 2010 time , and continued watching people like Sayle after the korean scene disappeared ) BW have been such big part of me growing up , despite I 've never been good at it , and I do n't know anyone else that play it .

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"& gt ; But , physical harm should be punished to higher degree than verbal abuse . But it is . Verbual `` harm '' to the refree will get you banned for 4 games , physical harm will get you a life-ban . Verbal harm towards other players get you nothing , elbowing them gives you 3 or so . If elbowing a player is 3 matches banned , then dangerous tackles should be atleast 3 too . That 's my whole point . You cant compare the situations and justify that the dangerous tackles should have bigger bans . Because Messi did nothing to another player . He was disrepecting over the match officials , and that stuff is taken seriously by every FA in the world . Which is why OP 's title is just stupid .

And the player gets a red card . & gt ; It 's a horrible tackle and Taylor disregarded the safety of Coleman when made that tackle . At no point did I defend Taylor , and I think that is a tackle that is way beyond what should be allowed in the game . My main point is that you ca n't compare a ban given for something one did to a refree , and something that a player did to another player . Refree-punishments will always be harsher . No matter what .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Terran has the easiest way teching up , as you need just barrack - & gt ; factory - & gt ; starport and you have pretty much teched up as far you need ( need add-ons tho , and if you are getting vessels , science facility ) They have a pretty alright build and not difficult to build up an army , however , they need a big force and that tech to be able to go out on the map , without just having vultures running around . Toss and Zerg pretty much overrun them early without their tech . Protoss you got many options . Teching to dragoon is just one mineral-only building , and then you can just pump zealots and dragoons . They also do n't need that much tech , however , you need to kinda choose if you want to get reavers , or get templars . So you got kinda a choice there , before late-late game when you will have pretty much everything . Fast arbiter tech has been popular lately , which mean you get templars . The most important thing for protoss really is just expand , atleast vs. Terran , and just get that income to create lots of dragoons and zealots as you will most often not do favourable trades . Zerg got it the hardest . You kinda need everything . It 's popular to either get just hydras/lurkers or just mutas , but you also kinda want a zergling/lurker/muta tech . And late game tech you also need everything , like ultras , defilers , lurkers , zerglings . Mutas are too expensive to keep building tho , but they are really good to have mid game . Need to expand far away from your main base is your key , as it will take longer time for the other races to attack you , and you can just out-swarm them . As far as the play styles go , Terran is a lot turtling , Zerg is very swarming and Protoss is a middle-thing , can do alright on 2 bases , but unfavourable trades on 2-bases loses them the game . It 's really hard to compare them at all . Only thing you can really keep in mind is how units a relativly the same strenght , as in how much hp one zealot have or a zergling or a marine .

Not too crazy of a build . What I meant with `` all tech buildings '' is that as terran , you can hold stop when you get factory for a while . Armory you wan na get later for upgrades and vessels because they are crazy good , but you do n't need much more . Zerg build induvidual buildings just for the tech , still create from hatcheries . So it 's like , a terran can just build to factory and stop for a while , protoss can skip stargate tech for a while , but zerg , you just really wan na get to that late game tech because it 's useful .

Have to excuse me for not remembering it fully , I just talk from all the year that I 've been watching , so the builds are all up in my head a bit mixed . Like , I know I 've seen pro games where you get both mutas and lurkers , so you do n't need to tech to defilers so quick or something .

0x424242,india,Why does it have to be fishy ? Perhaps it might come off as a surprise to people who are n't from TN . But there are a bunch of schools in TN where everyone scores really well .

Appreciate the sarcasm . Perhaps I was n't clear enough . I do n't think them of as genius either . They just know how to score marks in their higher secondary boards without cheating . They spend 18 hours a day for over 2 years reading the same books . They get slut shamed if their cut-off in the billion mock exams which happens throughout a year is less than 190 . So , yeah , more than 50 in a school scoring 99 % ( 198 ) cutoff is not a huge surprise . It has been happening for years .

0x424242,Cricket,"I do n't see why Srini , or CSK , or the host city has to be blamed here . We 've had SL players , since the beginning of the IPL . There is no animosity against SL players in Chennai , irrespective of the Politics . Yes , there is hatred against the previous Rajapaksa ( SL ) govt , but people in Chennai are n't protesting against SL players , except the political outfits . The ban was due to the current state government overstepping its limit to please/capitalize on the existing hatred . ( I see you 've got an Indian flair , so I suppose , you know how this works ) Now , should the home crowd suffer , because their state govt pulled something similar to what the central govt did ? I know that Srini in particular , is not a saint , but I do n't see why he gets the blame on this ? 1 ) Banning SL players is as stupid is as banning Pakistani players . 2 ) Politics must be kept out of the sport . 3 ) Blaming the host city for 1 is as stupid as 1 .",Germanic,Swedish

Honestly there are somethings that happen in TN/CSK , which has got nothing to do with Srini , Is that so hard to believe ? **Finishing Arguments : ** * Banning SL players is a bad political stunt . * It is not fair to deprive the home crowd of some action because of 3 players , think rationally . * Srini has got nothing to do with this , even if we move to Jharkand and play with SL players , he makes the same money as he would have done in Chennai . edit : formatting",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,battlefield_one,"I have n't touched it since before the release of TSNP , exept for a 6 hour session 3 weeks ago . Then I realized that this game was in a way different than BF3/BF4 . Nowadays I rather play BF4 than BF1 . These are the reasons I can think about why I left this game : 1 . Customization . I was a big fan of all the attachments/weapons/camo/gadgets that existed in BF4 . Even though most attachements had the exact stats , I liked the ability to choose between different weapons , and changing them according to the map and the faction I was playing ( US on Siege of Shanghai - & gt ; Run M16A4 w/o any attachments and UCP camouflage for example ) . This is the biggest point for me , and probably the # 1 reason I left BF1 . 2 . Conquest . Ever since I first touched the BF3 beta in 2011 ( wew , was that really 6 years ago ) , I 've been breathing and living conquest . It combines infantry , armored , aerial , and with BF4 also naval combat into one gamemode . What more can be asked for ? With BF1 and the changes to conquest , almost all my joy for that gamemode has been lost . I feel like vehicles have less of an effect on the objectives , and that it 's more infantry fighting infantry . The points system is also a step down from the previous one , where it is usually very easy to tell who is going to win only after a team reaches 200 points . This point also leads nicely into the next one : 3 . Map design . The maps are all so linear , leading into both teams clashing down 25vs25 on the central objective . This makes the fights way more chaotic and means that the first team to capture the central point goes on to win the match . 4 . The trend towards a more `` casual '' game . I guess this is more of a personal opinion , and that DICE had to make the game more casual in order to appeal to a larger audience . I do n't blame them for this . This does n't mean that I did n't like the game ; it 's just that I enjoy BF4 a lot more . BF1 did have some really nice stuff to offer : * Behemoths . I loved the concept , I just think that they have a little too little HP , as they are easily destroyed by a team that makes destroying the behemoth their primary goal , where it does n't have the time to have a significant impact on the game and help the losing team recover and come back . * Sound design . I could mention graphics , but I feel as if we could have had BF1 level graphics in BF4 , but that the average PC/console ( XB1/PS4 released in 2013 ) would not have handled it . The sound however has less to do with specs and more with what of a great job DICE has done in BF1 . The guns , the screams , the steps , the vehicles and the ambient sounds are all just so much better . * Limpet charges . No one ever sees them coming : ) Edit : formatting",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake Inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with Inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until Inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could Inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty . Instead , i see many benifits with bringing in Inferno without removing any map , effectivly increasing the map pool to 8 maps . Firstly , it is the only logical move to do . As I ’ ve said multiple times already , no map deserves to be taken out of active duty . Inferno was remade to make it more viable in professional matches , and will make its way back into the pro scene . If no map can be removed , just expand the pool . Secondly , it allows for other maps to come back to CS : GO , or evn for brand new maps like overpass to be born . Before overpass was introduced , no one would have thought that Valve would create a map from scratch to then force it into professional play . With a bigger map pool , the addition of a new map has a lesser impact on the current professional scene . One new map in a map pool of eight maps in total is going to stagnate the pro scene a lot less than the swap of a map in a pool of seven maps . A valid point to make is the burden placed upon the professional teams . As the number of maps increase , the amount of work required by the pro teams also increases . This may seem like a concern , but this is only due to the bad map draft cutrrently used at major events , where the last map is always selected randomly which requires a team to be very sharp on at least four maps : their own pick , and all three that remain in the randomizer . By increasing the map pool to eight maps , the pick-ban system can be redesigned to work in a very favorable way . Valve ’ s argument for the random third map has been to increase the diversity of maps played , while in CS 1.6 , the maps were banned down until one was remaining . With eight maps , the system could look like this : -First , both team get to ban a map , their “ permaban ” . -Then , both teams pick a map out of the six remaining . -Now , both teams get to ban a map again , reducing the remaining amount of maps to two . -The last map is selected randomly . Technically , by putting in the same work of studying four maps , a team can learn an own favorite map , the favorite map of their opponents as well as both the maps in the randomizer . This should lead to much more interesting BO3 series with closer games , since the teams are given more opportunity to study each other . **Conclusion** The current CS : GO map pool is fairly balanced , with all maps , exept nuke which still should be given time to grow , are quite enjoyed by the community as well as the professional scene . Before the reintroduction of Inferno to competitive play , it is worth considering the possibilities surrounding the active duty map pool . As no map has a real valid reason to be taken away from professional play , a good alternative is to add Inferno without removing any other map , effectivly increasing the map pool to eight maps . In the process , the pick-ban system at major and minor events should be changed in order togive the teams more control over the third map whilst retaining the randomizer for the purpose of variation : let each team ban once , pick once , ban once again and randomize between the last two maps remaining . This should lead to teams being more capable of preparing for events , as well as giving the spectators a better viewing experience , as a consequence of closer map scores . TL ; DR : Reading a TL ; DR is not enough to participate in a discussion I feel like , but if you want to just quickly realize what my thoughts are , just read the conclusion .",Germanic,Swedish

You are totally PTFO : ing if you 're at C and fending the enemies off when they are coming from D. You do n't have to ( and should n't ) be rushing in as the first guy , you 'll just die . If you however want to play aggressively , as everyone else says , use your sidearm after a hit . i like the Mars Automatic since it almost always finishes them off in one shot . Also , play with your team . you should n't be the first point of contact as a scout , or you 'll find 5 supports with BARs shooting at you . instead , let your teammates move up , check out the area while you spam spotting flares . Spam the `` Need Ammo '' button to get more . Make sure you take advantage of your range superiority . An automatico can do serious damage at 20m , but is almost useless at 40m . I would recommend you to use a marksman variant ( I use the gewehr 98 , good at long range while still excellent close up ) at lowest zoom since you can still get close and personal , while getting those 80-100m shots .

He says Tiger 's sound is unique on his mixtape . He says it 's his one of his own favourites and that he does n't care about people who say they do n't understand what he 's saying in it . _____ After Migos he says he loves their flow , that it 's like Future 's but more on-point , also enjoys their lyrics . They are real trendsetters with their flow . He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording . ___ After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much , like Hard in da Paint and Versace . He 's apparently called Sweden 's Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone ( Sad Boys manager ) , and Thaiboy himself agrees on that . ___ He loves auto-tune , it makes things better . Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who ca n't sing are able to by using auto-tune , like Chief Keef . People hate auto-tune because they 're conservative and need things to be `` real '' in order to enjoy it , and that you need talent to be able to sing . Auto-tune allows you to be creative in a new way and it 's modern . The interviewer asked if he ever feels like he 's crossing boundaries when he makes music , and he says he feels like he does that a lot , examples being Fuck U . The lyrics make no sense , the melody makes no sense , but the song 's feeling makes sense and that 's all his music is about , the feeling . ___ He started making music in a serious way last summer , people started hating because it sounded pretty bad . Last winter he decided to add auto-tune and now you can catch him on podcasts . Started from the bottom now he here . He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out . First he thought they 'd be like Migos , everybody featured on every track , but now it 's more like GBE with Chief Keef , everyone doing their own thing and occasiounally helping each other out on tracks . ___ Nothing really happens after the Kevin Gates song . ___ Describing boppin , he says it 's an easy dance where you just go low with them knees and go left to right . There are several levels of boppin : the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right , the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around , and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff . She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin . Yung Sherm is very good at it , but Ecco2k is the best one , Bladee and Whitearmor are probably the worst . ___ Conclusively , he says the mixtape will be finished when Whitearmor returns from the tour .",Germanic,Swedish
