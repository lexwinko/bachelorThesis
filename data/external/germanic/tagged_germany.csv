0kreiselkreisel0,europe,"& gt ; I find those arrogant who care only about issues that affect themselves . Nothing to do with my opinion . Criticism about the lack of visionary policy concerning current and future developments is good and necessary.\\n & gt ; What is being done here , however , and on facebook , internet forums etc. , is paint a doomsday scenario where the SPD bought into a coalition with the devilish CDU which will no less destroy the party . That\\ 's a load of rubbish.\\n & gt ; It\\ 's a solid government that will bring some improvements and fall short of making any grand decisions . Not great but okay . The SPD didn\\'t betray anyone , they made the right play with the cards they had on their hand.\\n\\nWho cares about the SPD ? \\nBoth , the SPD and the CDU are parties I don\\'t want to see in the government because the outcome will be negative.\\nSure , it\\ 's extremely unrealistic that a government without those parties will happen anytime soon , but looking into the programs of both of them gives me shivers.\\n\\n & gt ; The countries who are much better at immigration policy and instilling positive cultural identification than Germany all allow it . \\n\\nLike which ones ? \\nThe problems are pretty much similar in all of western and northern Europe.\\nCountries like the US , Australia , Canada , and so on are a completely different case.\\nDu vergleichst \u00c4pfel mit Birnen.\\n\\n & gt ; Enforcing single citizenship is but an ill-fated attempt at showing cultural dominance . The only way is to reconcile the two identities in positive ways.\\n\\nWhen I immigrate to another country I try to fit in.\\nIf I don\\'t want to fit in , why did I immigrate in the first place ? \\nWhat I do in private is my thing , but when I immigrate to another country my kids born there won\\'t be german anymore.\\nEverything else would be disrespectful.\\n\\nWhich shows this pretty good is that the group in question in Germany is not Vietnamese , Polish , Ghanaian , Irish or whatsoever.\\nIt\\ 's always one certain group which wants to have more rights than everyone else.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The actual root of the problem is the fact that appearance is still the primary factor of identification in Germany ( and most of Europe ) . You don\\'t choose to be a Turk , you\\ 're being called one because of your name and looks.\\n\\nThink about it again.\\nYou make yourself a \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' in the first place.\\nIf they don\\'t call theirself german , they obviously won\\'t be seen as german.\\n\\nThere was never a doubt that , for example , Philipp R\u00f6sler , Robin Dutt , Felix Magath , Miroslav Klose , Patrick Owomoyela , and many many others , are german.\\nAnd most of them don\\'t look \ '' ethnic german\ '' .\\n\\nA huge part of our population in the Ruhrpott and surrounding areas is , at least partly , of polish origin . Though , all of them are without a doubt german.\\nLet\\ 's say their ancestors immigrated 100+ years ago . I don\\'t think that in 2060-70 all of the \ '' turkish\ '' population in Germany is considered german.\\nNot with the current fatal policies.\\n\\n & gt ; You\\ 're welcome to explain why dozens of very intelligent people made such a ridiculous and dangerous agreement then , my demagogue friend.\\n\\nYou have to be intelligent to make politcal decisions now ?

Why does a 3rd generation \ '' immigrant\ '' ( actually , someone should be german in 3rd generation . the term is part of the problem ) need the citizenship of the country where his/her parents came from ?

0xKaishakunin,europe,"Different schools and degrees can be compared in a scientific way , that\\ 's what my research is about . \\n\\nHowever , this is a very complex task even without corruption and bribery . Different countries have different educational systems . Due to our strong TVET system in Germany only ca . 25 % of population hold an academic degree . The Universit\u00e4ten in Germany do scientific training , not vocational training . The Unis in Germany also have the same high standards of teaching and research , there are no Mickey-Mouse-Colleges and Ivy Leagues as in other countries . \\n\\nOther countries have a different approach eg . Spain and France relying heavily on universities for training with a more differentiated university system . \\n\\nSo comparing an engineering degree from a German Universit\u00e4t and a Spanish Uni is a task on it\\ 's own . Very complex . \\n\\n & gt ; the fact that Michalovce with population of 40 000 has 3 ( or more ... ) universities ( by that I mean few departments of them and you do \ '' long distance\ '' studying ) is ridiculous.\\n\\nDepends on what those Unis are doing .

So if you study Marketing at a German Universit\u00e4t , you will get a lot of theory , models and math . \\n\\nSince the 1970s we also have Fachhochschulen in Germany , former Engineering Schools . They also follow scientific principles , but teach a more practical approach . They also don\\'t teach Humanities , Social Sciences , Law or Medicine . \\n\\nFachhochschulen are usually a bit smaller and also located in smaller towns . \\n\\nThe German companies know about the differences and use the graduates accordingly . \\n\\n\\nI really like the work done with EQF/ECVET , but I fear comparison will only be done on paper ignoring the different standards and training systems . \\n",Germanic,German

Saint-Denis has nothing to do with the Saint-Denis at the time . And the land of human rights refuses to look . In Saint-Denis , a gap has opened up , which brings back memories , it does so on the sidewalks , in the market on Sunday . And yet many citizens refuse to recognize that here gnaws a counter-project to the democratic foundations of the pluralistic society.\\n \\n*Veil for a four-year old*\\n\\nWhere , in this downright summery Sunday of November , are lightweight tops and short skirts ? Wherever I look , veil , veil , veil again - simple headscarves , shawls , also cover the forehead , and great for the whole body . Recently , there in the street that bears the name of the communist resistance fighter Gabriel P\u00e9ri , shops for Islamic dress . They are called Duba\u00ef Center or Daffah - a thriving Saudi company . This is the law of supply and demand , which is bad about it ? , ask the naive , to whom I can no longer count myself . My wife asks naively : \ '' Do you have a scarf for my eight year old granddaughter who is small for her age , \ '' The shop assistant shows her models : \ '' I\\ 've sold one to a four year old.\ '' \\n\\nIn between are books , they convey , together with the \ '' Wahhabi fashion\ '' , the proselytism of an Islamist fringe group , whose ideology many keep out of weakness or ignorance , for the message of the Qur\\'an . This aims to hold \ '' Muslims\ '' in the Islamist orbit , dominate and control the community , to promote the secession from the rest of society.\\n\\nIn addition to the giant fast-food business Mak d\\'Hal , that mimics the look and McDonald\\ 's hamburgers , one hundred percent halal , the hair salon Coiffure Mixte is hardly noticeable . The owner explained to me : \ '' Mixte is here that there is a separate room for veiled women , where they are hidden from view.\ '' This woman is like me from Oran . I say : \ '' How did this idea come from ? I have not even seen such a thing in Oran.\ '' Then the hairdresser : \ '' You will probably not compare Oran and Saint-Denis.\ '' Here in Saint-Denis , she told me that Muslims would live their faith without compromise.\\n\\nHow often have I not heard that lately ? Friends of mine come back in disbelief from Algerian cities like Algiers or S\u00e9tif . \ '' In the market of Bab-El-Oued lovers hold hands ! \ '' , A friend told me , as if he had seen an English speaking duck . \ '' Women who have a drink on a cafe terrace with girlfriends , they are normal , here we would wonder about it , \ '' complains another . French people who recognize my origins from my appearance and accent , ask me : \ '' And , you eat pork ? \ '' , as that would be weird . I do not ask neighbors or colleagues whether they fast or go to the Latin Mass ! Why does one lock me in a cage of religious identity ? When my daughter-in-law filed for her daughter at school , she crossed to the canteens questionnaire , the child eat \ '' everything\ '' . A few days after the start of school , a supervisor adressed her : \ '' You know that you have by having everything ticked , agreed that your daughter eats foods that are not halal ? \ '' \\n\\nMy city has re-instilled in me in recent years the suspicion that I wanted to leave on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea 21 years ago . The stream of people that every Friday pours into the Rue de Boulangerie is not an ordinary gathering of believers . From the Tawhid-center that attracts so many believers that their prayer rugs temporarily brought the traffic brought to a standstill , in 2000 the preacher Tariq Ramadan launched his France-activity . This prayer room , which some consider to be a simple mosque , is the center of those who follow the political ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\nI am in France , I go on a road that still daresto call itself Rue du Jambon , street of ham . I approach a newly opened bookstore , and despair . In the display are posters that teach children Islamic rules , such that you can not mock others , rest on the right side and make three breaks while drinking . On the book tables you see the celebrities of the political Islam , Hani and Tariq Ramadan , as well as the historical figureheads of the Muslim Brotherhood , Sayyid Qutb and Hassan al-Bana.\\n\\n*Music , says an imam , is for pigs*\\n\\nAll this reminds me uncannily to the Oran of the1990s , when the Islamist city government as a first measure closed the conservatory , forbade music and dance and condemned art as an imported sin . Was not an Imam filmed in the Brittany town of Brest a few weeks ago , when he told his small pupils , music is made for apes and pigs ? \\n\\nWhen the extreme right related organization Civitas organized a conference against the gender theory , the security service was not organized as conservative Catholics but of the bearded men of the Tawhid-center that are equally hostile towards marriage for all . How many such incidents will it take to open the eyes of the leftists of Saint-Denis ? \\n\\nAt the Institute of Technology of Saint-Denis , a stone\\ 's throw from the hair salon Coiffure Mixte away , a student organization has called for that lecture times shall not fall into the prayer times . Because he dared to remember the values of the Republic , the Institute Director became the victim of a brutal campaign of intimidation , received threatening letters , his car was damaged , he was beaten . What do the police do ? Where is the political left ? \\n\\nIn the nineties , I saw my fellow Algerian citizens equally helpless in the face of enormous intellectual and logistic machinery of Algerian Islamists . Islamism came treading softly , with small , successive audacities , initially very keen not to scare anyone - to finally plunge into terror and barbarism.\\n\\n*From Fewzi Benhabib ( The Press ) `This article was published on Monday in the French left magazine \ '' Marianne\ '' , two days before the anti-terrorism mission in Saint-Denis in connection with the terrorist attacks on 13 November .

2A1ZA,europe,"*Translation of the submission \ '' Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims\ '' by Zafer Senocak*\\n\\n**Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims**\\n\\nHow to describe great loneliness ? Greater than the one which occurs when one has been abandoned by a loved one . Unlike the loneliness to which the poetries care . A loneliness that no longer will be outweighed by the world in which we live , can no longer be mitigated by what you believe , by promise and hope.\\n\\nIt is about the loneliness of those who come from the Muslim peoples and cultures and grew up in enlightened families who are religious or not , but always knew one thing , that they belong to the large global family of the enlightened . They want to live in a secular and open society , in Turkey as well as in Egypt , in Syria as well as in Iran . These enlightened mostly formed the middle class in their countries . They had a happy childhood . Half a century has it been since.\\n\\nOn the Bosphorus , there was this happy childhood , and also in Tehran . The happy childhood of bastards . Where did the bastards belong to ? They listened to the Beatles and more and more often overheard the muezzin . Where would they be at home when the world was open to them ? Has happiness a home in the world ? \\n\\n*The happy days of youth*\\n\\nIt was lived outdoors . Back in Cairo , Ankara and Tehran . Joy was the name of a dance . You could feel the stranger\\ 's hand , that prepared meals , on your own skin . It was also a time in which the prisons were filled and emptied with political prisoners . But the air outside did not smell like grids.\\n\\nThe air smelled of light effects . In the movies it was talked , laughed , music made . As on the streets . The houses all had a window on the streets . One grew out of one\\ 's house , to discover the world . The world of different people , the world of the other gender , the world of strange odors.\\n\\nThe child grew up free , because the adults had not yet fully furnished their world . You searched for the course of events , found snippets of photos , tried in memories , but they did live in the future . They lived in their children that they had rather than the ideas in their heads , the wild and horny ideas , the dangerous and the harmless . It was a time when you went to Paris for a weekend , because in Paris was always spring , a spring of the fragrance and love.\\n\\nThe preacher , who accompanied the dead came back to life and smelled like roses . Life and joy belonged to the existence of mortals , because they had the time and leisure to think about themselves and others . It was a time of learning . Foreign languages , the art of numbers and the art of living.\\n\\nToday in many places people have no life any more . Why even the graves ? The people no longer have a home . Why even have a garden ? The people have no land . What still limits ? Freedom can be as homelessness . In childhood , freedom smelled like freedom . The muezzin sounded as if he would sing of freedom . He called the people to prayer . Prayer smelled like freedom . Now , where the muezzin calls for death , to death and to kill , it would be to remember the smell of the prayers . Can you remember smells ? Will prayers help ? \\n\\nYou do not smell good anymore . They smell musty . We will no longer be free , meet together , but not free and be together . We are prejudiced , lifeless or false . We have no more childhood . The trains no longer go to Europe . The ships that reach Europe pour children overboard . But also those who live on do not travel any more . They emigrate , emigrate from their childhood , their lives , their hopes , from the joy of living . Can you live with these people ? Or is the hope that they have lost our death sentence ? \\n\\n*The Disappearance of Childhood*\\n\\nThere is no longer this childhood , which one could remember together . The alphabets are without secret . Freedom is a word . Words give life . We split the words in our bodies and have no word left for the happy childhood . Who belongs Paris ? Who owns my childhood ? Mother Asia , Father Europe ? \\n\\nTo whom does the bastard belong ? It was a happy childhood , the childhood of the bastards . I want my childhood back , my spotted by executioners childhood . I want to put on like a torn dress . It\\ 's perfect for me today , my mood , for my heart torn , for my pain . Without childhood we are naked.\\n\\nThe enlightened experience for a generation how they are pushed back in their own countries , but increasingly also rejected and abandoned by their non-Muslim sympathizers . They learn how the memory of their childhood increasingly gets into oblivion.\\n\\n*Massacre of Ankara*\\n\\nNowhere is this amnesia , which is accompanied by great loneliness , so noticeable as in Turkey . And no other event makes this loneliness feel more than the assassinations by deluded Islamists . Only a month ago , a suicide bomber killed more than 100 people in the heart of Ankara.\\n\\nHundreds of people were injured . A massacre of people who had come to demonstrate for peace . This event is perhaps hardly remembered . Otherwise , the Turkish President would have a harder time after the Paris attacks with his self-assured , arrogant appearances before the world public.\\n\\nThe fight against terror he wants to receive , together with the leading nations of the world . Would it not be about time first to uncover the backers for Islamist terrorism in his own country ? \\n\\nThe performances of the Turkish President in recent years were not without effect . Turkey has gradually left the Western community of values . The law is broken , continuously . It is threatened and sweared , against critics , against all those who can not be put on line.\\n\\n*Erdogan\\ 's arrogance*\\n\\nNow the country shall again get closer to Europe ? How come ? Is it not rather true that the unsettled enlightened elites of Turkey stand in the rain just like the proponents of a European Turkey in Europe ? Where is there left any discussion about the common values that go beyond lip service ? \\n\\nThe press which is close to the Turkish government has denounced such a community of values for a long time . They served the masses with conspiracy theories . The situatuion of the journalists and intellectuals of the country is sufficiently well known.\\n\\nThe enlightened Turks were and are left alone in their opposition to the rancor of their President and his ruling clique . This also contributes to the great loneliness , whose shadow falls on the representatives of a free and open Europe . It is high time to rid our hearts of this solitude . Because there is a common world to which we must fight , a world as it has been built after 1945 in Europe.\\n\\n*The devastating impact of the Saudis*\\n\\nBut the inhuman ideology of the Nazis is wearing a Muslim caftan today . There is nothing to interpret . Unfortunately , to many Europeans today this caftan appears to be closer , for power political or other reasons , than the stuff of which the dreams of the Enlightenment are sewn.\\n\\nWould one otherwise be photographed , shortly after the Paris massacre , with the Wahhabit king , representing ideologically and economically the hinterland of what is now the Caliph State . Not only that , the young people from the suburbs in Paris , in Brussels and elsewhere are poisoned by Salafis , Wahhabis and other Islamic sects .
