These persons are affected by thyroid cancer or goitres , and have filed lawsuits alleging that the French government , at the time led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac , had not adequately informed the population of the risks linked to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout . The complaint contrasts the health protection measures put in place in nearby countries ( warning against consumption of green vegetables or milk by children and pregnant women ) with the relatively high contamination suffered by the east of France and Corsica . Although the 2006 study by the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety said that no clear link could be found between Chernobyl and the increase of thyroid cancers in France , it also stated that papillary thyroid cancer had tripled in the following years . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_Chernobyl_disaster Basically since the 60s the French put a very large part of their resource into nuclear energy and they are ready to lie to their population about it 's danger .

Maybe Habitats and Rover/Trucks have a build-in filter and thats´s why you have unlimited oxygen .

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,Trust me ... you find another one . Had 1000+CP Pidgeot at work today . Tried to catch him a few times but then went to lunch . Didn´t want to spent more balls on a Pokémon I have easily the resources for to envolve .,Germanic,German

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,"Since you are Level 6 , you can conquer a gym . Pokémon is about collecting . So if a Pokémon appears on your Radar you haven´t collected yet , you go for a hunt and try to find it . Walking around in your neighborhood and joining others on the hunt . Unfortunately the Radar is bugged and not working properly . If you find a lure on a Pokestop , go there and join the others sitting there and have a nice conversation .

0711Picknicker,pokemongo,"The rage isn´t just based on the tracker Issue . What Niantic does is keeping it´s customers in the dark . If you´re a company and not listening to your customers wishes and don´t communicate , you´re about to go down . Niantic is learning this the hard way . For myself , I really miss the Tracker . I remember tracking Pokemons in the first week . It was so much fun . Now all I have is [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/c9uMdBK.png ) . In the first week , I would have selected one from the list to locate it . Now all I can do is walking around in hope to walk in the right direction . If I walk in the wrong direction I will only notice it when it´s already to late and the Pokemon is gone . That makes the Nearby List completly useless . Another Issue is removing basic elements like the xp Bonus for great and excellent throws . Niantics policy is like `` Oh you like this feature , let´s remove it '' . Edit : minor text fixes",Germanic,German
0711Picknicker,pokemongo,I think the pogo community should focus more on the lack of communication by Niantic . The removed features currently may be based on a decission what Niantic thinks is good for the concept of Pokemon Go .

Its actually like they have no brain . To answer you question that will make you probably rage since it makes half of your post useless : I do not chat at all . In 99 % of my games i type /mute all before the 10 second mark , because i hate being talked to in total disrespect by players that could LITERALLY be my kids . That 1 % i do not mute all is when i duo . Then i mute 8 manually . But you are right , i act too emotionally . The reason is i ca n't carry , i can ONLY climb with proper teamwork wich is my strengh . But it is way too hard these days . It is my 4th ranked season , i ended my first two in bronze , last season in silver and this season will be silver too . And it makes me sad that my skill after 5 years of playing this game is below average . So i tend to tilt when people start doing dumb shit over and over . That being said , i am happy i am not bronze anymore . Silver 4 life !",Germanic,German

089_Parker,vinyl,"Most people wo n't approve , but i fixed A LOT of records by steamcleaning it with one of [ those ] ( http : //ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GDTLBwAAL.jpg ) . Procedure : put a towel on an even surface , record on top of it and put some weight in the label area , if you find something that covers the label it is even better ( i use a glass head ) . Use destilled water . Steam the record , wait until it 's room temperature until you take the weight away , and dry it with micro fibre .",Germanic,German

089_Parker,vinyl,"Thank you for that . I ca n't find any reviews to that player , only a few technical details , but reading that it has a friction wheel drive makes me wan na step back . I could get one for ~40€ , should i go for it ?",Germanic,German
089_Parker,vinyl,"It would definitely not act as main turntable , it would find its place in the kitchen for the occasional play when i find the time to cook myself . And cooking without music is torture .",Germanic,German
089_Parker,vinyl,"That 's the only reason i am hesitating . There are some models that provide the same ( Turntable , integrated amp and speakers directly connected ) that look much more promising .",Germanic,German

089_Parker,DJs,btw it 's british pounds ...,Germanic,German
089_Parker,DJs,But does it rotate at 33 or 45 RPM ?,Germanic,German
089_Parker,DJs,"Well , that heavily depends on the genre you are playing . EQ house/techno ? Every track . Playing 80 's ? Keep your fingers away from the EQ section .",Germanic,German
089_Parker,DJs,"You should consider another brand , Technics TT 's are going to be luxury . I had a few 1210 MK2 , a M3D and a M5G . Now i am spinning 2 Reloop RP8000 's and my VERY unpopular opinion : They are as good as the Technics , if not better . Ca n't say something about the durability yet since they are only 10 month old , but i am really surprised how good they are .",Germanic,German

089_Parker,vinyl,"I have cleand LOTS of records with this method , and as i said many wo n't approve . I get your concerns , but i have not ruined one record by doing this . Also , many skips are created by dust filled in scratches . You do n't have to give your approval , it is just what worked for me in the past . I am serious , some skipping records played perfectly fine after that . And the steam of a handheld steamer is far away from the temperature to melt a record .",Germanic,German
