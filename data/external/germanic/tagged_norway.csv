Antonskarp,europe,"& gt ; They\\ 're far more efficient at mass murdering animals than we were were . \\n\\nNope . The only reason cats kill more wild animals than us is because we\\ 've figured out how to domesticate animals before we kill them . 9 billion chickens are killed each year in the US alone . By human beings , not by cats . There are about 74 million cats in the US , which means to compete with humans , the average american cat would have to kill a new chicken every three days . And that\\ 's just chickens ! We kill turkeys , sheep , goats , cattle and pigs en masse as well . It\\ 's hard to visualize how much we kill animals because any wild animals we like to kill are extinct or close to extinction . \\n\\nTake the [ passenger pigeon . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon ) They used to travel in flocks so large they would blacken the sky . Competitions could consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock . The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition . Can you imagine a cat killing 30 000 birds even in its lifetime ? \\n\\nNot to mention the animals we kill by accident . Every day critters are mauled by cars on highways or combines on farms . Over 100 000 people were killed in Hiroshima . How many cats and dogs ? How many mice and cockroaches ? More than a cat could kill.\\n\\nToday domestic and wild cats perhaps kill more _wild animals_ than humans , but make no mistake - that is merely because we\\ 've changed the status of the animals we usually kill away from \ '' wild\ '' - not because of our capacity for murder is lower . Hell , we easily outkill them in wild animals too if we count whatever we haul up from the ocean . The ocean , which for most of humanity\\ 's existence has been seen as a limitless supply of food is being sucked dry . We are killing the creatures there so fast that they can\\'t keep up , and it\\ 's the goddamn ocean . \\n\\nEDIT : I used the US as an example because it\\ 's more relatable for most of reddit , and the numbers are easily accessible . I see now that I am in /r/europe and that\\ 's kind of weird , but I\\ 'm sure the numbers work either way.\\n\\nDOUBLE EDIT : Cats aren\\'t necessarily better than us at killing rats and snakes , we just value their time and lives less than our own . If a farm cat is bitten by a rat or a snake , who gives a shit ? You can just get a new cat . If a cat spends all day chasing rats instead of harvesting grain - no loss .

Aqwis,europe,"Why would that have anything to do with the Bologna reform ? Indeed , Wikipedia says the following : \\n\\n & gt ; However , students appear to feel that the workload has increased , and the new standards lead to micromanaged and too narrow curricula [ citation needed ] . The Bologna Process is said to lead to universities being \ '' diploma factories\ '' . [ citation needed ] Also , for example at Helsinki University of Technology , most students ( 85 % ) fail to achieve the official goal of 120 credits in two years \u2013 the average is 81 credits . The number of students failing to achieve the minimum credits to receive student benefit has risen 40 % following the implementation of the Process.\\n\\nThis indicates that it has become *more difficult* for students to finish their education on time than it was before . Of course , the text also indicates that this is might not be because standards of education have risen , but I see no suggestion that universities are \ '' easier\ '' than before . Indeed , I can only speak for my university , but the only major difference that Bologna led to seems to be that the grading system was changed from numbers to letters.\\n\\nMy guess is that it was your university ( or even just your study programme ) that became easier and not indeed European universities in general .",Germanic,Norwegian

The level of difficulty for those courses are about the same now as it was in the 80s.\\n\\n & gt ; A college degree doesn\\'t guarantee you an office job\\n\\nTwo points : In the countries that have gone through the economic crisis most unscathed , i.e . *not* Spain , Portugal , your own Hungary , etc. , degrees in traditionally \ '' safe\ '' fields like engineering and medicine still pretty much guarantee you a job . A degree in Media Science or whatever does obviously not guarantee you a relevant job , but this is *not* a new development . It has always been that way .",Germanic,Norwegian

I felt yours were flawed and inconsistent . \\n\\n & gt ; But I still consider it to be a part of the region because a part of it is in on the peninsula & amp ; it was a part of Sweden.\\n\\nThe peninsula was named for the Scandinavian countries that were on 90 % of it . You don\\'t cut a peninsula early just to fit borders . They could call it the Norwegian Swedish and part Finland peninsula but that wouldn\\'t roll of the tongue as well . Then someone realised there was a name for the people that lived on 90 % of it and it was named so . Scandinavia has nothing to do with location on the map but 3 countries . If you want to get fancy it\\ 's a \ '' historical and cultural-linguistic region\ '' . You can keep using geography as a point but then you can also bring in whatever other random metric you feel like using.\\n\\n & gt ; because of history yet this isn\\'t true with Finland , too\\n\\nThey have a history through us through proxy , aka being Swedish .

It doesn\\'t matter though , if you aren\\'t three for three then you\\ 're out of a scandi membership.\\n\\n & gt ; It seems like CGP Grey concurs with my assessment , there is a degree of subjectivity in deciding which is which . \\n\\nHe seems pretty clear about who Scandinavia is , but he says there is also confusion . I don\\'t deny that at all.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; My point simply is : Don\\'t tell people that they\\ 're wrong for saying Finland & amp ; Iceland are in Scandinavia because there are valid reasons for them to be considered a part of it.\\n\\nIf there were valid reasons they would be Scandinavian . It\\ 's as simple as that . We don\\'t even count Svalbard as Scandinavian and that\\ 's Norwegian with 70 % Norwegians . Why i\\ 'm sure you ask . Well it lacks the history , one of the three checkboxes it need .
