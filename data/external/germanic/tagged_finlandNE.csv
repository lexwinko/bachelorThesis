Game publishers that wish to sell in brick and mortar chains ( that would be basically all of the publishers ) mostly have to agree to charge the same base price online as the physical copies in the stores . Otherwise the stores would not agree to sell the game due to competititon from cheaper online offerings . And dropping the price in the physical copies would not be in their interest since products in those stores are subject to the high cost of living present in Australia , it would just cut into their profit . And as the publishers must price their products in the currency they do business in , they are kinda slaves to the exchange rate , irrespective of any hedging they may do . Another thing that keeps the prices higher - at USD equivalent terms - in non-USD currencies is stability of the price as observed by the consumer . Consumers have formed a general idea about the cost of games ( cost of everything ) . They are not going to assimilate very well to price changes if they followed the exchange rate , especially when the observed niominal price goes UP .

0_0_0,TrueReddit,"Is n't ~~he~~ Coward claiming that the methodology itself was manipulated to find no significance ? & gt ; Fourth , the performance of my students from Math 1A was evaluated in the subsequent course in the sequence , Math 1B . The score gain for my students averaged 0.17 grade points over the three Math 1B classes , with a sample size of approximately 1000 students . This raises the question of whether this is statistically signifiant . Your colleague Philip Stark , the chair of the Statistics Department , and someone who has gone on the record saying that student evaluations are not indicative of teaching effectiveness , wrote in his analysis : & gt ; '' The test statistic was the following : For each section of 1B , calculate the three average grades corresponding to each of the three 1A sections . Take the standard deviation of those three numbers . Add those numbers for the three sections of 1B . '' & gt ; While it takes some time to understand this statement , it amounts to the following : My students were divided into 9am and 11am groups corresponding to my two Math 1A class , and then a test statistic was used that penalized consistency in performance between the students from my two classes . Stark 's analysis went on to obtain a p-value of 0.13 and he concluded : `` There is no _statistical_ basis for concluding that any differences in the 1B performance -- to the extent that such differences exist -- are attributable to differences in what they learned in 1A .

0_0_0,wikipedia,"Nope . It means there are no *atoms* left over from the duck liver , never mind molecules . The dilution is so ridiculously over-over-over-over-overdone , the probability of any original atom remaining in the resulting solution completely disappears . Read the whole linked article . Choice quote : & gt ; '' 30C : Dilution advocated by Hahnemann for most purposes : on average , this would require giving two billion doses per second to six billion people for 4 billion years to deliver a single molecule of the original material to any patient . ''",Germanic,Finnish
0_0_0,wikipedia,"`` 5 times '' is incorrect . Also the definition is not about molecules per bottle , the bottles was only mentioned by /u/LWschool . Are you sure how scientific notation and the homeopathic `` system '' works ? The dilution in this case is described as `` 200C '' . This means a solution of one unit of original substance in 10^400 [ one followed by four hundred zeroes ] units of diluent . The approximate number of *atoms* ( not molecules^1 , mind ) in the observable universe is ~10^80 . Therefore , dividing 10^400 atoms by ~10^80 atoms per universe leaves ~10^320 universes required to have **a single atom remaining in the solution** , on average . So the amount of diluent e.g . water required in this solution , is equivalent to the atoms of these 10^320 universes and the amount of active ingredient is one atom . The difference between 10^80 and 10^320 is not `` 5 times '' . It 's 10^240 [ one followed by 240 zeroes ] . Footnote^1 : The orginal analysis in the wiki ignores the difference between molecules and atoms to give a rough sense of scale . This means that the 10^320 number is actually not enough , because it needs to be multiplied by the number of atoms in the particular molecule . Really complex proteins can have up to 10^6 atoms . So the upper limit is more like ~10^326 universes . : )",Germanic,Finnish
