It is common sense that smoking things is bad for your lungs , that is not what I\\ 'm denying . \\n\\n & gt ; Again , just for you : There are people in this world who only started smoking anything , because that\\ 's the way of consumption of cannabis of their choice . Some of those people die of smoking caused cancer . If cannabis wouldn\\'t exist , they wouldn\\'t have died.\\n\\nYou can say the same thing about people dying in car crashes , If there were no cars they wouldn\\'t have died . I don\\'t understand this reasoning.\\n\\n & gt ; Let me say this again for you too : The point is not that cannabis is bad because you can die from it . You can probably die from pretty much literally anything in this universe in some way . The point is that defending \ '' You can\\'t die from cannabis\ '' is making parts of the the legalisation movement seem ridiculous . Because it\\ 's factually wrong ( for whatever indirect reasons , cannabis smoking caused cancer , fatal crash from driving under the influence ) and unimportant ( lethality alone isn\\'t a valid argument , you can die from driving a car ) . \\n\\nI think I clearly said : \\n\\n & gt ; No , their deaths are not directly attributable to cannabis , but to smoking burning stuff . You can vape without burning . You can eat weed brownies/cakes/whatever . There is no one forcing you to smoke a joint/blunt . Just to be clear , I\\ 'll say it again : Cannabis can not kill you . **It is the smoking that kills you . **\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything else , of course you can die if you crash your car after you drove high , or if you were too high to notice the stairs and fell down , but that still does not make cannabis kill you . It is because you were impaired due to the cannabis . If someone dies during a drunk driving accident , people don\\'t say he died due to alcoholic beverages , but he died while driving drunk .

I am a big fan of science fiction and there are little Dutch alternatives so usually I just read the English version . Watching movies with friends we usually put on English subtitles , although my girlfriend prefers Dutch ones . So consuming English media and websites is quite common for the young people , there are no dubbed movies and games for example rarely get a Dutch translation ( only big EA titles sometimes ) .\\n\\nBecause the Netherlands are so small many niche books are not translated . For example , 95 % of my books at University were in English and in the end they switched fully to English ( although the main reason was to attract foreign students I think ) . \\n\\n ' } \n ''",Germanic,Dutch
53bvo,AskEurope,"If you plan on learning a new language , the Netherlands may be a difficult option because everyone ( at least the students ) will just switch to English if they see you struggling in Dutch . \\n\\nI studied applied physics in Groningen and alsmost everything was in English ( lectures/books ) . In my last year the University switched to full international and everything has to be available in at least English . I think it might be even more convenient for someone speaking only English than only Dutch.\\n\\nBut if you are planning to stay 3 or 5 years , please do learn Dutch ( or the local language of you pick a different country ) , it will be much easier to socialize with other Dutch people .

I\\ 'm afraid however they won\\'t sing really good live.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what this song is about ( and you have lived under a rock the past ~~100~~ 101 years ) , it\\ 's about the Armenian Genocide , which happened in 1915.\\nIn my opinion , political things like the Armenian Genocide shouldn\\'t be discussed on Eurovision . It also surprises me that this song is allowed to enter Eurovision without any changes , while Georgia had to change a song called \\'We don\\'t wan na Put In\\ ' ( similar to Vladimir Putin\\n^ ( sidenote : This song was first called \\'Don\\'t Deny\\ ' , but they changed it voluntarily to prevent the connection with _denying_ the Genocide ) \\n\\n\\n03 Belgium : Lo\u00efc Nottet - Rythm Inside [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=J9B3a7A7tbk ) \\n\\nAfter one of my least favorites , we go to one of my favorites .

There was however a lot discussion about the dress she was about to wear ( looked like someone played on it with a scissor ) , and I hope she won\\'t wear that tonight.\\n\\n\\n05 Finland : Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t - Aina mun pit\u00e4\u00e4 [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ePhjs-3q068 ) \\n\\nI can assure you , there aren\\'t any worse songs than this one this year . This is the definition of awful . The best thing about this punk song is that it\\ 's the shortest song ever in Eurovision : only 90 seconds long , so if you want to do a toilet pause you got to be quick.\\nNote that this band was made before Eurovision , so they didn\\'t group them for Eurovision alone . However , they only reason that this song will get any points is because of the fact they are mentally disabled ( and maybe some Bloc-voting ) . But for me , this song is a 1/10 . Finland , if you want to win with something _special_ , you have to make the song at least a bit good.\\n\\n\\n06 Greece : Maria Elena Kyriakou - One last Breath [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=v7xKMnNcVdM ) \\n\\nEvery year , there are one , maybe two songs that try to repeat the success of the top songs the previous year . Greece is one of the examples this year . \\nThe main reason this got to Eurovision is because all the other participants on the national final sing good.\\nBut she had a good voice . A very good voice . Talking about voice , she won the Voice of Greece . The first two minutes of this ballad are a tad boring , but then the song suddenly becomes pretty good.\\nBut of all ballads , I think the only ones that can beat her are Spain and Albania . It\\ 's very likely that this will reach the final.\\n\\n\\n07 Estonia : Elina Born & amp ; Stig R\u00e4sta - Goodbye to yesterday [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JNXtXZM0QcA ) \\n\\nSpeaking about repeating successes , this one is the other example . The first thing that came into my mind was Calm After the Storm , as this also is a country-ish song , but this not a copy or something.\\nI like this song very much , it has hit potential and , more importantly , it has winning potential . For me , the best song of this Semi.\\n\\n\\n08 Fyr Maceodnia : Daniel Kajmakoski - Autumn Leaves [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=t8QCt6CJCHc ) \\n\\na pretty good song , sung like it\\ 's a fairytale . However , I\\ 'm very afraid that the live performance will ruin this song and thus result in this song not getting to the final\\n\\n\\n09 Serbia : Bojana Stamenov - Beauty Never Lies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qJrJVsOQwEc ) \\n\\nIf you would mix Conchita Wurst and Susan Boyle , you\\ 'd hey Serbia\\ 's act this year . Her voice is astonishing , but there\\ 's is one thing that will probably affect thist song\\nnegatively : she\\ 's dressed \ '' very old-fashioned\ '' . It really depends on the act for whether she will get to the finals or not\\n\\n\\n10 Hungary : Boggie - Wars for Nothing [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=WETXc5Z7Cng ) \\n\\nCan soneone wake me up ? Seriously , this song is perfect for letting someone fall asleep . I feel bad for you Australians who will have to see this at 4AM or something , trying to stay awake . Very boring ballad about useless conflicts , which isn\\'t a bad subject but a bit standard ( don\\'t get why they put Ebola on the background though ) \\nnothing special . Not the way a ballad should be IMO.\\n\\n\\n11 Belarus : Uzari & amp ; Maimuna - Time [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dVv_BmOqPWg ) \\n\\nThe beginning of the song strongly reminds me of Not Alone ( Armenia\\ 's song last year ) , but at least this song is more upbeat than all other songs this Semi.\\nBut overall , this song is very medium , and is one of those song that you would easily forget about . Don\\'t really know what to think about this one\\n\\n\\n12 Russia Polina Gagarina - A Million Voices [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jBVY7Glcd84 ) \\n\\nShe looks like a crossing from Kate Ryan and Ellie Goulding . \\'Hopeful\\ ' ballad about humanity , but to me it comes over a bit hypocritical , \\nescpecially with those kids in the clip . This is a song you would hear when having breakfast in a hotel in another country . Sorry Russia , but this is not my favorite.\\nBut because it\\ 's Russia , this will be in the final 100 % sure.\\n\\n\\n13 Denmark : Anti Social Media - The Way You Are [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RA-A_uvE1ss ) \\n\\nLike last year , Denmark sends a \\'Poppy\\ ' song . It sounds similar to something , but I don\\'t know what His voice isn\\'t the best of tonight , and I worry that he will miss some tones tonight.\\nNot my favorite.\\n\\n\\n14 Albania : Elhaida Dani - I\\ 'm Alive [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=lZJdWUmxxZw ) \\n\\nWow . Just wow . This song got me from the first to the last second . Just beautiful . Her voice , divine . A cheerful upbeat ballad . One of the best songs this year . This must end in the top 5 in the final . If we\\ 're listening to voice alone in this Semi , she and Greece\\ 's singer are the winners.\\n\\n\\n15 Romania : Voltaj - De la cap\u0103t [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Nw6sKQbwQOM ) \\n\\nWhat the fuck is this staging in their national final ^ ( ( disclaimer : I don\\'t know how Romania\\ 's performance of tonight will look\\\\ ) ) . The singer looks like a TV chef , or that person you would see in those telemarketing commercials . but then it changes to a rock song.\\nOne of the few song that is not in English , and unfortunately it doesn\\'t do this song any good . This will stick in the Semis , \\nsorry Romania.\\n\\n\\n16 Georgia : Nina Sublatti - Warrior [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RZrRQSI_pcQ ) \\n\\nIf you said to me that Jessie J sung this song , I would believe it . This \\'upbeat ballad\\ ' gives you this feeling of \\'I can fight against it\\ ' , which explains the title Warrior . I like this song , it doesn\\'t bore me . This will go to to the final and in all probability reach the top 10 , but I can assure you it won\\'t be the winner\\n\\nMy personal Ranking of this Semi-Final\\n\\n1 Estonia\\n\\n2 Albania\\n\\n3 Greece\\n\\n4 Belgium\\n\\n5 Georgia\\n\\n6 Moldova\\n\\n7 FYR Macedonia\\n\\n8 The Netherlands\\n\\n9 Serbia ( Was higher first ) \\n\\n10 Denmark\\n\\n11 Belarus\\n\\n12 Russia\\n\\n13 Armenia\\n\\n14 Romania\\n\\n15 Hungary\\n\\n16 Finland\\t\\n\\nMy prediction of this Semi-Final\\n\\n1 Albania*\\n\\n2 Estonia*\\n\\n3 Russia\u00b2\\n\\n4 Georgia\\n\\n5 Greece*\\n\\n6 Belgium*\\n\\n7 The Netherlands\\n\\n8 Armenia\\n\\n9 Hungary\\n\\n10 Finland* ( they get first or get to place 10 or lower ) \\n\\n11 Serbia\\n\\n12 Fyr Macedonia\\t\\t\\n\\n13 Belarus\\n\\n14 Denmark\\n\\n15 Moldova\\n\\n16 Romania\\n\\n*= What I predict as potential winner of this year , Russia may win this Semi but not the Final\\n\\nWTL ; DR\\n\\nMoldova = Male version of Dirrty\\n\\nArmenia = Genocide\\n\\nBelgium = Male Lorde [ ( not this ) ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fGLoPDR.jpg ) \\n\\nNetherlands = Whyhyhyhyhy\\n\\nFinland = Toilet pause\\n\\nGreece = Rise like a Phoenix 2015\\n\\nEstonia = Calm After the storm 2015\\n\\nFyr Macedonia = violin + a fairytale\\n\\nSerbia = Conchita + Susan Boyle\\n\\nHunary = Peace Ballad , Nap time\\n\\nBelarus = just medium\\n\\nRussia = Peace Ballad + Ellie Goulding + Kate Ryan\\n\\nAlbania = Good upbeat ballad\\n\\nRomania = Toilet Pause 2\\n\\nGeorgia = Jessie J\\n\\nEDIT : \\nOkay so I got two entries wrong that I thought would go to the finals : \\nThe Netherlands ( overestimated it ) \\nFinland ( Actually I\\ 'm glad this didn\\'t pass ) \\n\\nInstead , these countries passed : \\nSerbia and Romania ( which both were better than I expected\\n",Germanic,Dutch

Ahrily,europe,"& gt ; During this period [ Islamic Golden Age ] , the Muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations that had been conquered . Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from Greek , Persian , Indian , Chinese , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations into Arabic and Persian , and later in turn translated into Turkish , Hebrew , and Latin . \\n\\n & gt ; With a new and easier writing system , and the introduction of paper , information was democratized to the extent that , for probably the first time in history , it became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books . [ 38 ] The use of paper spread from China into Muslim regions in the eighth century , arriving in Al-Andalus on the Iberian peninsula , present-day Spain in the 10th century . It was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries . [ 39 ] It was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . [ 40 ] \\n\\n & gt ; Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds . Ibn Sina and other philosophers such as al-Kindi and al-Farabi combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam .

I can\\'t recall any . How often has it gone wrong ? Too often already . The Nazis were keen on finding out who were loyal Aryans , and East Berlin wasn\\'t fun during the cold war either . Or how about Videla ? You didn\\'t want to be aligned with the political left under him ( or even criticise the government ) . Political criticism isn\\'t a good idea in today\\ 's China .

Amanoo,europe,"The UK has some policies , cultural aspects or traditions that are much more similar to American culture than the culture of most other European countries . For example , the UK employs a voting system based on First Past The Post . Ever seen people complain about UK politics being manipulable and all of that ? Things like gerrymandering ? That just FPTP at work . It\\ 's a system that\\ 's completely alien to most other non-English speaking countries , which often use parliamentary systems based on things such as Mixed Member Proportional Representation . FPTP is known by some for being highly manipulable , unrepresentative and for its tendency to degrade into a bipartisan system ( it hasn\\'t really done so in the UK yet , although the UK does have two big parties , one of which usually holds the majority ) . For detailed info , CGP Grey has a series of videos that explains things in a simple but very good manner . He\\ 's also been very vocal about it in his Hello Internet podcast ( can\\'t remember which episodes though ) . [ Dooblydoo ] ( http : //www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/ ) . \\n\\nAnother example would be the GCHQ , which quire a few would regard as barely more than the lackey of the NSA . Not exactly friendly to things like personal freedom or privacy ( which I\\ 'd argue is fundamental to freedom ) . People often forget that other countries\\ ' organisations , such as the AIVD , aren\\'t that great either . \\n\\nThe UK is also more likely to come up with proposals for draconian policies than the rest Europe . I can\\'t remember any specific policies , though , although I know there are some . Every so often , something pops up again . I\\ 'm willing to bet that there\\ 's something similar to SOPA or PIPA that , if it hasn\\'t been implemented , was at least proposed . I wish I had remembered more specific examples , though . I just don\\'t have the type of memory that holds on to that kind of specific information . \\n\\nI\\ 'd argue that English speakers also have a strong tendency to beat around the bush or to sugar-coat things . I might be a bit biased though , as I\\ 'm Dutch . My own culture has a tendency to just speak their minds . We have a blunt honesty that\\ 's often meant to be either helpful or efficient ( or possibly both ) . For example , if you were to try to speak Dutch , and told us that you sucked at it , you\\ 'd be fairly likely to hear \ '' yes , you really do suck\ '' . But it\\ 's often followed by tips to help you get better . We also don\\'t like too much chitter chatter or insincerity . A \ '' how are you\ '' by a supermarket worker is borderline offensive to us , as it\\ 's not a sincere question and may even be interpreted as prying into someone else\\ 's life .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Truth is , as an American to my ears only the top tier of speakers truly develop a distinctive marked accent in either direction .

Anyway , in spite of this as stated because of the prominence of US-English , the general European ( through the own languages typical accent ) tends to indeed err more on the side of US - spoken , but often writing more - British , with word-choice/slang being mixed between the two I\\ 'd say . \\n\\nBut for example I\\ 've had many Brits come to me and say Dutchies speaking English sound just like Americans , and to that I respond sure they pronounce aloud in a more US fashion , but if you\\ 're implying that they could almost fool you as a US native ( which some are ) then you must be completely tone-deaf because Dutchies definitely have their own distinct accent when speaking English !",Germanic,Dutch

Immigration officials are mostly knowledgeable , friendly , helpful and competent . A big key to getting the most out of Dutch service in any sector is to know **what** questions to ask , to figure out your parameters in a given interaction . They\\ 'll often be quiet until you ask the right question , and then all the sudden they\\ 're a fountain of information ... \\n\\nOther Dutch businesses , services , hotlines , ministries aside from the IND ( immigration ) tend to be a bit tricky if you don\\'t know Dutch . Despite the \ '' Amsterdam Attitude\ '' - all service-industry employees in the city speaking English by default ( even to other Dutchies often ) and often refusing to switch back to Dutch if your accent and general proficiency are not on point . Anyway despite that , when you have to call these government services , or more day-to-day industries ( health-care providers for example ) they\\ 're much less willing to speak to you in English and more or less expect you to speak Dutch , very interesting phenomenom . Also this occurs even in Amsterdam service industry workplaces if **you\\'re** the one working and thus *serving* the Dutch people , they\\ 're attitude 180s and they also expect you to engage with them in Dutch , makes sense but also weird contradictory attitude on the whole ...",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"The sun set on your empire a long time ago , so take off that Monocle Mr. Raj era settler\\n\\n",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Well that exists in the States to an extent . It\\ 's not as deeply entrenched into multiple facets of our society like in the UK , but referring to others as \ '' trash/white trash/trashy\ '' and looking down upon these individuals seems to be fairly commonplace .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,De puta madre ! Hostia tio !,Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Easy there , plenty of Brits ( and Irish ) abuse the language on a daily basis.\\n\\nCase in point - the colloquial normalization of using past participles such as \ '' stood\ '' or \ '' sat\ '' in place of present tense gerund ( verbs ending with \ '' -ing\ '' ) .\\n\\nE.g . We\\ 're currently sat at the table downstairs and my mate is stood on the corner out front.\\n",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"What about European Spanish versus various accents of *hispano\u00e1merica* ?

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Heard Morgan Freeman , coming from \ '' *morgen vrij man*\ '' ( tomorrow free , man ) as a reference to having fuck all to do the next or off work . But only heard it one group of people so I\\ 'm not sure if it\\ 's actually a thing or not .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,Is that related to \ '' Alter\ '' or stemming from it . I know Alter is also used in Austria ( despite not being mentioned by any Austrians ) because it was taught to me by an Austrian rather than a German .,Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,Finnish version is pretty close to what the Dutch call *pannenkoeken* \\n\\nEdit : meant to say the Swedish version .,Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Ah yes Spanish vs Mexican tortilla , ... imagine my disappointment to discover that the what I had in mind for my beloved Mexican tortillas , is not what I received when ordering said menu item my first time in Spain.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong , love Spanish cuisine , but Mexicans make a better tortilla ( if I\\ 'm honest I prefer Mexican overall too ) , now who makes a better Horchata is up for debate in Spain it\\ 's made with \ '' leche de chufas\ '' whereas in Mexico it\\ 's concocted from \ '' leche de arroz y canela\ '' , I do quite like both versions , though it\\ 's been some years since I\\ 've had a proper Mexican Horchata ... .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,Ok just long as that last \ '' i\ '' remains unpronounced ya dick ! \ud83d\ude1c,Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"I lived ( and skied ) Garmisch-Partenkirchen , which is considered by most to be the best in Germany as far as Alps and skiing , and while decent enough , I experienced much better in both Austria and Italy ( never skied France or Switzerland so can\\'t comment there ) .\\n\\nThe problem with Germany\\ 's share of the Alpine chain \ '' Bavarian Alps\ '' is that it\\ 's only a small northernmost sliver , so there\\ 's not nearly as much Alps ( ski-resorts , etc ) to choose from . \\n\\nSwitzerland and Austrian have the most mountainous/Alpine terrain percentage wise , though the highest percentage of the entire Alpine chain sits in Italy , of all the countries that it touches that is ...",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"In the US it\\ 's certainly arguable that a higher percentage of our \\'gringo\\ ' population will speak Spanish in certain areas where both geography and immigrant influx make it more a behooving skill . \\n\\nThe best examples hands down are Southern Florida and SoCal . Obviously it\\ 's not a crazy high percentage of \ '' gringos\ '' but in these regions , roughly 25-35 % ( \ '' Spanish speakers\ '' or *hispanohablantes* constitute roughly 13 % of the US population ) in of the population can speak Spanish to some degree ( this obviously includes those with \ '' hispanic\ '' heritage ) . Edit : also Texas , New Mexico and Arizona deserve mention to varying degrees , especially New Mexico as Spanish is a co-official language alongside English in the state ) . Second edit : in El Paso , Texas a border-city of around 650k , apparently 72 % of the population alleges to speak Spanish , so again America catches a lot of shit for not speaking a second language , but if you\\ 're liberal ( re : *open* ) in the way you define American , then a whole fuckload of us speak Spanish when you think about it ... \\n\\nIn Italy I lived in Veneto , but have spent time in the far North , snowboarding and such . So I know in Sudtirol ( or \ '' *alto adige* ) there seems to be varying degrees of bilingualism between Italian and German native-speakers , which is another situation that always fascinated me ... hopefully there\\ 's somebody here from there that can chime ( though never seen anyone repping said region on here tbh ) .\\n\\nIn Germany I lived deep in Southern Bavaria in the Alps ( thus very near the Austrian border ) and while the not only did the official language not change upon crossing the border , but as well the dialect remained hardly unchanged ( I imagine this is similar for the old-school Limburgish/Zeelandic dialects or whatever they\\ 're called between BE-NL ) ...",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Well you wording and articulation when saying it was \ '' neither of our language\ '' was not properly conveyed , so maybe that\\ 's your English showing its fourth place status in your linguistic arsenal.\\n\\nNonetheless , I measure anecdotally by most admitting on this thread that despite British English being taught in school , most seemed to indicate they erred more on the US side of things . Also the prominence of US terminology over British , ( ATM vs. Cash Point for example ) , and also hearing reactions from Europeans IRL that mostly mirror the responses on this thread concerning the increasing prominence of US English.\\n\\nDespite whatever preconceived notions you I\\ 'm not some typical ignorant , asshole , exceptionalist American , there\\ 's a reason I\\ 've lived in Europe for quite sometime ... oh English is the first language I learned but the first of five so ... .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"I lived in DE for a year , and now have been in NL for 3 years , with my \ '' Nederlands kennis\ '' which has now surpassed what my German ever was , I can currently read more German than I could when I lived in Germany - mutual intelligibility and dialect cotinuums are fabulous things , now aren\\'t they ? !",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"I hope you\\ 'll accept my apologies , that was certainly one of my poorly-worded , catty \ '' woke up on the wrong side of the bed posts\ '' \\n\\nTo be fair , you mostly articulated your points in a mature , clear and rational manner so kudos . I do still maintain that you did exemplify quite well this phenomena of Euros to deflect a little bit in these situations , but I don\\'t think it was any sort of intentional malice.\\n\\nI just get annoyed , that Europeans ( and in particular Dutch ) do seem to think that when they\\ 're compared to Americans they\\ 're exempt from this label of racist because they didn\\'t have slavery ( totally not true , because of Suriname ) and the current shitshow that is our law enforcement problem in the US.\\n\\nI would like to take my time to address that point now though , as it it seems our policing problem is the new scapegoat to point and cry racism over at the US ( I guess the Europeans finally accepted that slavery was over a century ago , and that they also had a large part in propping up the Transatlantic trade in the first place ) , anyway the police problem in the US is first and foremost just that , a **police** problem , let me asterisk the fuck out of this statement by saying I\\ 'm not downplaying the disadvantage minorities are at , especially when dealing with LEOs , nonetheless the police problem in the US stems ultimately from a pervasive attitude of brutality , excessive use of force , ego-tripping , control-freaks and lack of instilled deescalation techniques - that is to say ultimately a attitude problem pervading police forces across the country . Whites ( not nearly as often ) have also been subjected to some pretty gross displays of police brutality in the US - ex : 20 year drug dealer gets caught in undercover buy as cops rush to his parked car to arrest him he pull out and tries to drive off to which the officer sticks his gun in the window and shoots the kid point-blank killing him , citing to the recording camera bystander that he feared for his safety of being run over ( car was moving from 0 velocity to a reversal speed so not very fast at all ) . Case in point the police issue is much bigger than race , though the two have obviously become inextricably linked at this point , it doesn\\'t mean that our Police Problem is exclusively a race problem just to **reiterate** , so it shouldn\\'t always be pointed to as such , as it is something which does affect whites as well.\\n\\nI will say that I do respect Dutch cops for the most part ( probably the least intimidating but still competent police I\\ 've seen out of any country I\\ 've been to ) , and think they\\ 're much more competent than their American counterparts , and there is a reason I\\ 'm living in this country after all ( and not in the US ) . Groningen also sounds like a cool place , still need to make my way up there sometime . Anyway het spijt me for that last post !",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Bagged milk is also a thing in the US , which consequentially ( and sadly ) is where I think the absurdity started ...",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Addressed this point above , but no way - Berlin is distinct out of any of the German-speaking cities world-wide . With Tirol and Salzburgerland ( both culturally and linguistically - not to mention cuisine - similar to Bavaria ) being part of Austria , no way is Bavaria more similar to Berlin . PERIOD !",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"No English is the language of English speakers . In particular native English speakers I\\ 'm not sure if you\\ 're British or not but it is absolutely no more your language than mine , and that was again a beyond fucking ignorant statement on your part . \\n\\nAlso considering US version *is* ( really is already ) increasingly becoming the standard of international English then that serves as a much better argument than any of the drivel you\\ 're spewing ( already trying to decide my argument one step ahead of me , calling **my** mother tongue your own , now that\\ 's **fucking arrogant** ) that is closer to \ '' correct\ ''",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"I\\ 'm neither German nor Austrian but lived right on the border in deep Bayern ( Garmish-Partenkirchen ) and can confidently say you couldn\\'t be more wrong about the Bavarians being just as similar to Berliners as Austrians . Bavarian cuisine , dialect and aesthetic are very similar to what\\ 's found in Austria ( particularly Tirol and Salzburgerland ) , mentality is certainly a little different ( Tiroleans at least are more laid back than Bayerische ) but still far more similar to one another than Bavarians are to Berliners . Bavarians couldn\\'t be more different from Berliners , and they ( along with a sizeable chunk of the rest of the country ) look at the city as some degenerate capital of their \ '' Federal Republic\ '' .\\n",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Nope definitely a thing in US , seen it in School cafeterias all the way from Louisiana to New York .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"There\\ 's some quantity of months think it may even be *twelve months* that essentially sounds like \ '' cock tastes good\ '' when pronounced aloud in Estonian , this I know",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"French is the only one I can think of readily , in English , but there\\ 's is almost assuredly more which I\\ 'm drawing a blank on.\\n\\nSeen \ '' di Roma\ '' as an Italian surname , but only once , didn\\'t strike me as a particularly common thing , on also seen \ '' Tedesco\ '' ( German ) as an \ '' Italian-American\ '' last name . Also \ '' Pavan\ '' as a Veneto surname , derived origin in the city/province of Padova.\\n\\nI\\ 'm pretty sure Spanish has a lot too . Pretty sure I\\ 've seen Valencia as a last name before .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"So watched Vice Munchies guide to Berlin the other day , and apparently the original sausage invented in Berlin and used for the most traditional version of the recipe does/did resemble to a tee , the dubious Dutch \ '' Frikandel\ '' , however my experience having it in Berlin was with more traditional ( and tasty ) sausages.\\n\\nFrikandel has got to be the *worst* Dutch fried food-snack ( gim me a Kassouflee anyday ) .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Hahaha too funny the \ '' magnagatti\ '' ( in Veneto dialect , \ '' mangia gatti\ '' in Italian proper ) is actually from the city/province where I lived and where my family lives now ... Vicenza . Anyway as far as I know it\\ 's an very antiquated stereotype that was from times of war/famine/plague ( and thus allegedly at least partially true ) , but the stereotype is typically only ascribed to the province of Vicenza ( even though it\\ 's no longer remotely true , AFAIK ) .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,Thank you kindly . I often don\\'t know whether to feel proud or offended about \ '' for an American\ '' but indeed I do hear that one quite often . Hahaha oh boy might wan na nix that part about Dutch for for they rain down on you with the fury . Though ( and I now I have my own bricks to duck ) I feel that applies even more to the similarities between Catalan and Spanish.\\n\\nEdit : do you think Swiss German is just as far from hochdeutsche as Dutch then ?,Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Hmm \\n\\n**Preface/Disclaimer** : these don\\'t represent my viewpoint , but the ones I\\ 've heard anecdotally from both domestic Americans , and American expat communities in these countries . \\n\\nwell I\\ 'll play the reverse since I\\ 'm from the US .

I\\ 'll also try to balance and include positive/neutral stereotypes because hearing about how fat we are is just soooo funny the 5000th time over ( also I\\ 'm the opposite , so I guess I\\ 'm proud that I shatter almost every single nasty cliche stereotype recycled around these thread beyond the shadow of a doubt ) .\\n\\nwithout further ado -\\n\\nFrance : ( + ) good food/wine/gastronomy ( + ) fine/refined culture ; ( + ) pretty and sophisticated language ( - ) total pussies , the white flag should be their national flag ; ( - ) don\\'t bathe often ( this is general European stereotype yanks have as well ) .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"English - well , we say cheers in the States and so do the Brits , but as many of you are aware cheers has come to mean thanks in colloquial British-English . My theory on that is that the alcoholic Brits saw someone buying them a drink and the subsequent toast as good of a reason to be thankful as anything and thus it came to its current meaning . \\n\\nAlso we say \ '' chin-chin\ '' in the States fairly often ( or at least it\\ 's not uncommon or strange to say it ) so it\\ 's quite an international way to toast it would seem.\\n\\n",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Came to say this , in my experience salud is more common on every level , from internationally ( being a standard for other hispano-countries ) ; in Spain ( seemed more common in both Barcelona and Madrid ) and also I hear it used most by Spaniard expats/tourists here in Amsterdam .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Meh , it\\ 's ok , there\\ 's some pretty decent lyricists , no doubt ! And content-wise and intent-wise , it is better than a lot of contemporary American \ '' hiphop\ '' ( if you can call it that ) we\\ 're currently churning out , but the execution is still lacking , perhaps primarily because the British accent just doesn\\'t do the genre the justice a true US one does ( sorry it\\ 's just doesn\\'t , at least *imho* ) . It\\ 's creeping a bit , but again very minimal I would say . But I\\ 'm a kinda a cunt as 90s/early 2000s hiphop purist so ya know ... \\n\\nEdit : omg maybe it was subconscious but when I wrote the first few word of my last sentence I totally was not aware of you internet-handle , haha , ah too great ! Safe mate !",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Sorry the original post ( before edit ) made \ '' these Americans\ '' ( and therefore us as a whole ) seem really arrogant , as if they talking in absolutes of being everybody\\ 's favorite nationality in the country they reside , that\\ 's some Trump-esque bullshit talk , and simply not an accurate representation of our mentality ( nor are a lot of the other painfully stupid US op\\ 's that show up on this subreddit , but that\\ 's a whole other thing ) .\\n\\nI digress , as an American who\\ 's lived in four European countries I\\ 'll chime in.\\n\\nOnly in Germany and Italy were Americans a common \ '' immigrant/expat\ '' group and that\\ 's because I lived in towns with active US military bases . That said a lot of opinions were formed around typical brash young American GI\\ 's ( who are basically our one demographic on par with # BritsAbroad , as far as acting like obnoxious assholes goes ) which wasn\\'t a very favorable view . In addition the fact that they were employed by these bases that were \ '' intrusions on national sovereignty\ '' in the eyes of many , than you get a double-down effect by some local hardliners as far as anti-US sentiment goes ( though never had a really bad experience in Italy upon revealing my origins even from MENA and sub-Saharan immigrants , the latter in fact tended to prefer Americans to Italians seeing them as more direct , less \ '' truly racist\ '' i.e . more accustomed to black people ) .\\n\\nThat said there are many civilian support workers , contractors , senior officers and family members that did a better job and establishing a favorable image , and those in these groups especially civilian \ '' GS\ '' ( government service ) and contractors doing the best to often learn the language and integrate . \\n\\nActive Duty soldiers typically did much shorter tours , were much busier and were in a much more Anglo-centric work culture , thus rarely learned the language at all . \\n\\nI\\ 'd say this applies to the towns I lived in , in both DE & amp ; IT . As far as which local populace held a more favorable opinion of Americans , I\\ 'd say probably the Italians , or they maybe see American culture as a bit more \ '' cool\ '' than the Germans ( though German girls I maintain are probably the easiest for yanks to have success with ) .\\n\\nIn the Netherlands and Spain , I lived in Barcelona and Amsterdam ( currently ) which were bigger cities with less direct American influence , though there was a sizeable contingent of Americans studying abroad in both cities as well as tourists.\\n\\nI think there\\ 's more established American expats in Amsterdam than in Barcelona , or that\\ 's the feel I get anyway . The truly established American expats , I do think for the most part integrate pretty well . Out of all Anglo-nationalities , I think they\\ 're the most likely to learn Dutch , because we have to come the furthest and jump through the most hoops to get legitimate residency ( as opposed to say Brits , for the meantime ) so it seems more logical for us to just put in the extra effort to learn the language , since we already have to make so many other sacrifices to come here anyway.\\n\\nAlso my experience with the IND ( dutch immigration bureau ) and \ '' *Gemeente*\ '' ( local municipal government ) in getting my partnership and subsequent related visa has been very hands-off . Compared to the research I did on the strictness of both agencies during the process , I was hardly prodded for anything . Like the Gemeente didn\\'t investigate the history or legitimacy of our partnership ( which I heard was commonplace especially for Dutch nationals trying to spouse non-westerners ) . Even in situations where my potential overstay should have been verified they didn\\'t and seemed to just back off and take my word for it every time they saw my US passport . Was very weird , and clearly a bit \\'racist\\ ' ( maybe that\\ 's not the right word , some for of prejudice but suffice to say I doubt a Moroccan-national in those situations would have been afforded the same oversights or lack thereof rather ... ) .\\n\\nEdit : in Spain , once or twice I had someone express their discontent with my country when revealing my nationality , but that was in my eyes/experience , an anomaly and Spanish people really opened up , were generous and thought it was really cool that I came from the US and spoke Iberian Spanish ( and a little bit of Catalan to boot ) . Maybe the Italians are the favorite immigrant group in Barca actually , they\\ 're pretty prominent and adapt well with both local languages ( Catalan and Spanish ) since Italian is very similar to both languages .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Well I lived in Barcelona , where there\\ 's a lot more Spanish influence so it was a bit different , yes everyone ( even the predominantly Catalan-speakers I was friends with ) would write \ '' tio\ '' **never ever** seen \ '' tiu\ '' , tio ! I don\\'t doubt you of course it\\ 's your region of Spain but nonetheless in the city as stated the influence of Spanish still seeps in hard ( it\\ 's the main language of the city , whether Catalans wan na see it or not ; obviously Terragona , Girona and the like are another story ) .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"I think despite being a Germanic language on paper , in practice English falls somewhere between the Latin and Germanic language groups , meaning that when we actually put in the effort we native English speakers are at an advantageous starting point for learning most Western European languages .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Somebody else explained . There\\ 's indo which is mixed Euro-Dutch ancestry and ethnic-Indonesian from during the colonial-era . There\\ 's also a substantial amount of full-blood born and bred Indonesian immigrants , but they\\ 're still in smaller number than the \ '' indo\ '' group - furthermore they have varying levels of integration I would say . \\n\\nI\\ 'm interested to get a better perspective on perceptions of Surinamese in NL , since they\\ 're the one former colony that really maintained prominent use of the language ( you could argue the Antilles but hell they speak an awful lot of Papamiento , English and whatever the hell else in addition ) .",Germanic,Dutch
Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"The EU expats/immigrants are a lot more diverse ( in terms of nationality ) than the major groups of \ '' non-western migrants\ '' I\\ 've noticed ( as stated above Moroccan , Turkish , Indonesian , Surinamese , Antillean and bit of Chinese pretty much sums of that category for NL ) , but yes indeed there are a lot of Spaniards in ever increasing numbers it seems .

MDMA/x is almost exclusively produced in this country so the market on that is saturated and it\\ 's pretty accepted by young Dutch people to \ '' roll\ '' at shows , festivals , night clubs , etc.\\n\\nIn fact a Global Drugs Survey done a few years back indicated more Dutch youth tried MDMA for the first time than even weed.\\n\\nOn that note weed is particularly popular with Dutch , more expats that prop up the culture and scene ( Dutch stoner culture is surprisingly lacking ) . Drinking small pilsener beers for men and white wine for woman is common but not often done in excess . Dutch men are more likely to smoke weed than the women in my experience , conversely Dutch women seem to consume more cigarettes than their male counterparts.\\n\\nInterestingly in the social acceptability and tolerance of drug use , particularly in Amsterdam though I have to say it\\ 's rare find people here ( especially Dutch ) who seem to have any true problems with substance abuse.\\n\\nI have to say I applaud that as drugs do figure in rather prominently to the Amsterdam scene and seeing the harm prevention approach and lack of negative societal impact is a refreshing contrast to the US where excess is our middle name , and we love to get fucked up . With regard to weed only Canadians have a comparable cannabis culture . Americans are to weed as Russians are to vodka when it comes to smoking tolerance and \ '' hanging\ '' .\\n\\nAlas lets not forget our biggest societal scourge - the infamous ongoing opiate epidemic , heroin , synthetic pharmaceutical opiates ( pills like oxy ) , fentanyl laced OD inducing dope , etc , quite sad really.\\n\\nAnyway yeah that\\ 's my perspective anyway ...",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Minimum age and or legality ( if applicable ) , attitude and law on public consumption and how strictly are these controls enforced.\\n\\nEdit : also feel free to comment on social perception of these substances\\n\\nI\\ 'm using this as a comparison with the US and also a bit based on my experiences.\\n\\n**Netherlands**\\n\\nAlcohol - must be 18 to purchase , I think the \ '' perceived age for not carding\ '' is a lot lower than in the US , that is to say in the US most businesses have a policy of carding all customers purchasing tobacco/alcohol that look under 45-50 for example . Not sure of the policy businesses take here , but I\\ 'm 27 usually get guessed as a bit younger ( if I shave my beard I look 18 ) , and rarely get carded , but still do sometimes only at supermarkets though never bars . Sometimes at events or clubs if you look young IDs I can imagine will be checked , but I\\ 've been 24 years and up with a beard most of the time here so again , I seem to rarely be bothered . Not sure of the official stance of public consumption of alcohol.\\n\\nTobacco : I believe it\\ 's also 18 , I don\\'t smoke tobacco at all ( even for joints ) so not sure exactly on age and how strictly it\\ 's enforced . I doubt if cops see teens smoking after the fact that they care ( even in the US , cops don\\'t care typically ) . Probably for teens though ID checks are enforced . Lots of Dutch smoke , and view it as relatively normal . Weird counter-intuitive trend I\\ 've noticed oddly enough , seems like Dutch women smoke more than the men , but that\\ 's merely my anecdotal observation , I could statistically be entirely wrong ... \\n\\nCannabis - 18 to purchase unregulated and tolerated weed from coffeeshops . Though at least municipally here in Mokum , rule on the books says something about discretion of Gemeente and establishment to enforce a 21 year age minimum for entry and access to \ '' rookruimtes\ '' ( smoking-rooms ) though again rarely enforced and some of these rookruimtes are also found in bars . Public consumption can be done in coffeeshops and 420-friendly bars ( mostly an Amsterdam thing only ) , also in Amsterdam only more or less public consumption ( at least of joints and vapes ) is usually tolerated . Also coffeeshops are the place where ID checks are most strictly implemented , I imagine because they draw the most scrutiny of the law , so they try to tread carefully . Dutch themselves aren\\'t big smokers on average , and they don\\'t have nearly as strong of a \ '' stoner-culture\ '' as Americans ( or even other EU countries like the UK , Italy , Spain or Germany for that matter ) , more popular with expats , immigrants and tourists to be honest . The progression of this toleration is at a bit of a standstill , with increasing crackdown on grow gear and growing ( small-time or commercial ) at the same time with proposed legislation of actual regulation ( in-line with the US\\ 's current approach in the legal-states ) . Many say the local \ '' scene\ '' is in decline , but it\\ 'll be interesting to see what the future holds.\\n\\n**Italy**\\n\\nI\\ 've also lived in Germany and Spain but after being 21 years old so kinda moot to be honest . I lived in Italy from the ages of 13-16 so that provides some perspective ( mind you this is also circa 2003-2006 in the Veneto region ) .\\n\\nTobacco - not enforced at all . Age of purchase officially was 16 , but by 14 and looking maybe 12 in appearances I was able to purchase cigarettes no problem . Nevermind the ID-checkless vending machines the \ '' tabaccherie\ '' put out front after closing hours every night ( this has since changed you need an Italian ID to swipe ) . Maybe Italians smoke more than the Dutch , I think so , it\\ 's viewed as quite normal.\\n \\nAlcohol - also very rarely enforced at either bars , I believe wine and beer may have been like 16 y.o.a . and liquor was 18 . However my mischievous 8 year old brother had no problem buying beer simply so he and his friends could break the bottles rather than drink it ( dumb I know ) .\\n\\nCannabis - many smoke , obviously very illegal but not the worst , small amounts may only be confiscated if you get lucky . Was fortunate enough to never find out the full extent of the law . Though I have friends that have been screwed , and ultimately dicked around with driving rights and license suspensions if they didn\\'t comply with a 4 year long urinalysis scheme . In any matter , not exceptionally difficult to find , most bigger towns ( or cities ) have certain areas where street dealers will congregate ( often Sub-Saharan or Moroccan immigrants ) , for higher quality knowing Italians and speaking the language is usually necessary . The street dealing culture and prominence puts Italy ahead of countries like Germany where ( Berlin being an exception ) such a thing doesn\\'t really exist . \\n\\n\\n**US**\\n\\nTobacco : strictly enforced , federally 18 years of age , though some states or counties enforce higher ages of purchase all the way up to 21 years . ID checks , often with scanning machines to detect fakes , checking for holograms etc . However once purchased it is rarely prosecuted , only bored asshole cops with nothing better to do would ever dream of busting minors for tobacco possession/consumption , and cops often ignore teen smokers ( this has shown to be true from rural Louisiana to Brooklyn , NYC in my experience ) . In the South chew and dip ( smokeless oral tobacco , disgusting stuff ) are popular and also in some other rural areas . Smoking has been and is on a rapid decline , many university campuses are now smoke free for example and less and less young people are smoking . In Western cannabis-friendly states like California , tobacco is perceived with much more stigma than cannabis is by young people ( this is arguably the attitude for even most young people country-wide ) . \\n\\nAlcohol - 21 federally and in every state ( never older or younger anywhere else AFAIK ) the most strictly enforced on every front , bars , stores etc . I have on occasion found bars ( in say New Orleans ) or convenience stores ( in say Brooklyn ) but these are the hidden gems , unicorns and anomalies rather than even remotely commonplace . ID checks . Can be prosecuted for public consumption ( as a legal adult over 21 ) , or being intoxicated underage depending on circumstances . Definitely can get cited for MIP ( Minor in Possession ) . So overall much more strictly controlled than tobacco . \\n\\nCannabis : in some states highly illegal . In many medical , in which some of these the medical system is a farce and effectively a recreational loophole ( for example Montana , Michigan and others operate this way ) . And yet in others fully legal and regulated - Washington ( state ) , Oregon , California , Nevada , Colorado , Massachusetts , Maine , Washington DC , and Alaska . Minimum age for either medical or recreational might be 18 in some states or counties but I believe in most it\\ 's 21 , and ID checks are quite strictly enforced . Seems to be on the rise , and becoming increasingly accepted . The quality and advancement of the industry are bar non the best in the world , and only rivaled by Canada really .",Germanic,Dutch
