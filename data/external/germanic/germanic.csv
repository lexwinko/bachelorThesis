The extreme left btw not so much - that\\ 's the reason why Nicaragua didn\\'t accept the deal - it didn\\'t go far enough for them . \\n\\n\\nIt\\ 's just the far right nationalists under trump ( and Everyhwere else too ) who don\\'t agree - but that\\ 's the problem - Nationalists will never say a multi national deal is a good deal - since it\\ 's diametral to their agenda of \ '' xyz first\ '' - the idea of a greater good between nations just doesn\\'t exist in their vocabulary . \\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,So you want results that are worth it ? Like a total reduction in climate change ? Not a rise in average temperature at all but a decline.\\n\\nSee basically no problem . It just won\\'t work - cause for this to happen the carbon emissions would have to sink even more then planned in the Paris accord . \\n\\nEspecially by developing nations - basically meaning that they would either need to forgo development of their nations and revert to being even poorer then now - or an even bigger financial burden on the guys with money ( so us ) to help them meet their energy needs without carbon emitting fuels . \\n\\nPlus - at the same time the developed world would need to cut back even more radical - and that\\ 's not a question of \ '' we need to bring more electric cars on the street and shut down coal\ '' - then the goal would be - no cars other the electric and shut down gas too.\\n\\nThis deal is the best that is available at the moment - and it actually got possible cause green energy generations is making huge steps forward especially in developing nations - a reduction would need even more and actually brutal policies - which no nation would go for . \\n\\nSo yeah - the stabilization of global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels is a huge thing -\\nJust to compare - if nothing is done it will ( depending on the model ) raise by 4.5-5C in 2100 - and if you belive that we have mass migration now - wait till 1/4-1/3 of Asia is uninhabitable and the Sahara stretches to the Congo .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Russia gets this \ '' bonus\ '' cause it closed\\nPretty much all it\\ 's dirty industry after the fall\\nOf communism.\\n\\nChina and India get their bonus cause otherwise they would not be on board at all - but they are actually doing something - India has shelved its plans for more coal power plants and china has done the same and will in fact close down several beginning this year.\\n\\nWhich leaves the biggest point why one is against it the redestribution of wealth - that\\ 's the real reason why you don\\'t like it right ? Why should we give any of our hard earned cash to those people . \\n\\nWell the reason is very simple - take hurricane season - I think there is no doubt that global warming influences the strength of hurricane which hit the US every year - and\\nThey are getting stronger and the season is getting longer . \\nKatrina cost 150 billion $ - not including 120 billion federal aid\\n\\nOne hit like Katrina costs the US economy more then all the transfers that happen In the Paris accord over the next decades . \\n\\nAnd those will get more and more common . \\n\\nSame with rising sea levels - at the moment it\\ 's just a problem for Nauru - but soon it will become a problem for cities like Miami and states like Florida - which will need to invest billions into flood protection . \\n\\nAnd then we have displaced persons - large parts of Mexico will become uninhabitable for humans due to the increase of arid climate conditions - same with conditions in the Sahel zone in Africa and large parts of Central Asia . \\n\\nAll this will lead to mass migration which we haven\\'t seen since the fall of the Roman Empire . \\n\\nAnd all this will be way more expansive then transferring a bit of wealth now.\\n\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,The idea is to stop global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels - which is doable and will hold the worst symptoms at a manageable level . \\n\\nSure if you want to reverse the warming which has already happend - then it would mean investing more money and even harsher rules for carbon emissions in developed countries - but it would also mean telling 6 billion people \ '' sorry guys can\\'t have what we have - for at least 50\\nMore years\ '' \\n\\nSo yeah while the accord is not perfect - it\\ 's a step in the right direction - especially since most countries are going along with it . \\n\\nAnd sorry - just saying \ '' it\\ 's not good enough that\\ 's why we can\\'t accept it\ '' is a bad argument - cause it means that nothing will happen which will make it even worse in the long run . \\n\\nThis is the best option at the moment - finely balanced between the developed nations need and want to stop global warming for the reasons I said - and the developing worlds need for energy and well - development . \\n\\nI don\\'t know if you have ever been to china -\\nBut if you ever go - take a train and look out of the window at night - whole villages in darkness with just one or two light bulbs here and there . A stark contrast to shanghai or Guangzhou . \\n\\nSo the want they have a \ '' modern\ '' live to is hard to limit - and china tried the would have the next revolution at hand . Something we all don\\'t want for various reasons . Same\\nIn India . \\n\\nAnd thats why a certain leeway in their goals was searched for and found . \\n\\nIt\\ 's not perfect - but it can acchieve the set goal -,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,No what is the deal ? \\n\\nI mean the real goal of trump - what does he want - not a general guide to negotiations - what does he want / or what shall be written in a new agreement ? \\n\\nA general guide to negotiations is pretty useless - I want an idea what he / you want in the new deal - \\n\\nLet me guess - not much is coming ? Cause you have no idea besides \ '' a more fair one\ '' - so what is a fair deal ? How much does the US have to cut their emissions ? How much does china have to ? Who pays for clean energy incentives in developing countries ? \\n\\nPlease - just general outlines - and not \ '' read up how to make a deal\ '' - cause that is pretty useless in this discussion .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"I actually read it.\\n\\nBut there is nothing substantial - noting that says \ '' this is our plan\ '' - except that it will be fair and if it doesn\\'t work then to hell with it.\\n\\nI mean I am used to it from trump - but well - I expected more - I expected at least a goal - a post that says \ '' this is what we want instead\ '' but all\\nHe says is \ '' we want a better deal , and if we don\\'t get it we will continue as before and endanger ourselves cause we can\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's a bit childish . But ok.\\n\\nIt\\ 's grandstanding and blustering with no substance behind .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"Look I have closed contracts / deals . It\\ 's part of my job . \\n\\nAnd if it was just a Buisness deal I would agree - it\\ 's like 101y\\n\\nBut this is not a Buisness deal - he has to come out and give some idea what he wants - cause if he just says \ '' hey we want a fair deal\ '' everybody else will say \ '' well this is a fair deal\ '' and this is not some negotiation about some property on the upper east side.\\n\\nThese are negotiations with nearly 200 countries - all with their own interests and agendas - so just saying \ '' we want a fair deal\ '' won\\'t cut it - he has to have some ideas what he wants , lay out plans , set agendas - in short be constructive - but from what I have seen the last 5 months he can\\'t do\\nThat - all he can do is deconstruct and dismantle . \\n\\nI am not even sure if he grasp that this isn\\'t a 0 - sum problem - this is not a about \ '' I give you , you have more , I have less\ '' this is about creating something for the greater good which in the end will benefit everyone - and especially so the US and developed nations cause our wealth is incredibly endangered by global warming even if we don\\'t see it . \\n\\nAt the moment we can buy our way out and maybe enjoy longer summers - but this will end pretty soon for reasons I have mentioned above ( or maybe elsewhere - not sure about my comment trail ) \\n\\nAnyways - he won\\'t come forward with anything substantial - cause the moment he does he would have to leave his zero sum logic behind - and that\\ 's something I am not sure he can . \\n",Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're not taking into account most trade wars are tit-for-tat . \\n\\ni know - but the 6 % in trade that will partly be lost ( not totally just partly ) will not hurt the EU in total . Switzerland is bound to loose more and sooner or later its population will accept that . might be later though . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm not Swiss , but that is just plain wrong \\n\\nNo actually i am right . Lets just look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss \\n\\nTrue - and as soon as they start the feel that their products \ '' Made in CH\ '' are less cost competitive ( due to renewed certification for example needed to sell in the EU ) they will ramp up their production in the EU plants and cool down production in their swiss plants . Those are multinationals . They are not bound by borders where they produce and in large parts the infrastructure is already in place . \\n\\n & gt ; Nestle \\n\\nThe same in food . Of the 340.000 employees of Nestle 8900 work in Switzerland . Nearly half of those 9000 work in the HQ and research divisions in Switzerland . So if it gets harder to sell Swiss made Nesquik in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg - they will simply ship french made there . The bottom line wont be touched . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R & amp ; D as Germany , so there are a lot of research based companies there as well \\n\\nAbsolutley true . But if you look at the why that is - you will find that CH profited extremly from several EU programs which they were part of so far . Programs in which swiss participation or the negotiation about that have already been shelved as a result of this vote . If it stays like that expect this ratio to go down south pretty fast . \\n\\n & gt ; but Switzerland does produce things.\\n\\nnever said that they dont . \\n\\nI said that a lot of the stuff they do produce is mass produced and can be produced in the EU as well . Nobody is doing it now since the swiss have the market cornered . But if they cant offer their services to a competitive price anymore - well lets just say that new options arise .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,& gt ; Do you expect me to have a full list of Swiss products ? \\n\\nno that would be ridiculous . But lets have a look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland is leading in tunnel construction\\n\\nNot so much . Switzerland does built a lot of Tunnels . True . The companies that built them are not only swiss though . For example the Gotthard Base Tunnel is built by a consortium of 3 non swiss and 2 swiss companies . \\n\\n & gt ; exports specialties such as chocolate and cheese\\n\\nso does belgium . Plus chocolate exports are 650 Mio . \u20ac out of 90 Billions . Doesnt really count much . And chocolate is not really hard to produce . The last major technological advancement ( and the reason for swiss dominance in this field for a long time ) was the conche - but it was invented / discovered more then 100 years ago . \\n\\nAgricultural goods actually account for 1.5 % of the exports to the EU from Switzerland . \\n\\nAnd belive me - if Lindt looses buisness from this - they will start the produce \ '' as good as swiss chocolate\ '' in the EU . \\n\\n & gt ; is an important manufacturer of medical products and chemicals\\n\\nabsolutely no doubt about that . But chemicals can be produced anywhere in the EU . and when it comes to pharmaceuticals - If the guillotine clause is invoked they have to be recertified in the EU - a long and expansive endeavour . So why should Roche and all the others not just produce in the EU and get rid of that pesky little problem . \\n\\n & gt ; their research and development in all kinds of areas is outstanding.\\n\\ntrue - but as we speak here it seems that the EU already has stopped negotiation for the horizon program with Switzerland . a program ( which if as successful as its predecessor ) would bring nearly 2.5x the amount of money to swiss universities and research institutions as the swiss paid into the pot.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's pretty sweeping and simplified remark to say that we can simply copy these products and do without their R & amp ; D. This will also be painful for the EU.\\n\\nWe dont have to copy . The products already exist . What will be painful ( for some maybe ) is a bit less competition . But thats it . And when it comes to R & amp ; D ? The swiss research facilities are good - no question . But the money that fed them so far stays and will just be redistributed to other institutes within the EU . I wouldnt worry so much about that .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Please give me a list . \\n\\nOr just some examples . Of goods that are or can only be produced in Switzerland . No doubt that they exist . But they are only a tiny fraction of the 90 billion \u20ac export volume Switzerland has to the EU at the moment . \\n\\nBut lets have a look at what is the main mass of export goods from CH to the EU . \\n\\nMore then 50 % of the export goods fall into this categories : \\n\\nChemicals and related products - & gt ; so chemicals produced in large quanties and pharmaceutical products ( which can be produced anywhere in the world and which will have the additional hurdle of EU recertification if it comes to the worst ) \\n\\nManufactured goods classified chiefly by material - & gt ; which encompasses everything from simple plastics to High Technology goods . There is also office / telecom equipment in this category . While i guess that there will be some companies that produce unique goods in this category most of it can and is produced by other companies in the EU already . \\n\\nMachinery and transport equipment : Same as above . There might be some swiss companies that produce very specialised goods in this category . But most of it will be run of the mill more or less standard goods that can be bought from numerous sources in the EU . \\n\\nSwitzerland and swiss goods are not unique . ( well most are not ) and thus can be replaced . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Oh yeah . Absolutely . I am just saying that this could prove to be the classic example of why the will of the majority is not always the most beneficial way to follow . Depends on the EU reaction . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Not really : \\n\\nAs i stated above : \\n\\nActually they are the 4th largest ( 6.6 % of the trade ) \\n\\nWith an import volume of 121 Billion \u20ac and an export volumen of 90 Billion \u20ac.\\n\\nBut see - This doesnt matter so much . Since the import volume wont shrink - they still need the stuff we produce and at the moment they cant get it cheaper form a third source cause if they could they would buy it there.\\n\\nBut the export volume will shrink once the free market clauses get axed . \\n\\nIt will simply make buying stuff made in Switzerland more expansive then buying the same stuff from within the EU Market.\\nAnd they are not producing anything ( besides watches maybe ) that cant be produced at similar costs in the EU or worldwide.\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Thats fine . But i think that treaties are there to be kept - and as such the guillotine clause should be invoked by the EU . \\n\\nThey can have their opinion - no problem . But they have to live with the consequences .,Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,I wouldn\\'t say thought in school or that it is something that comes up in a conversation . For me it always seemed as if all girls know that there is a plan B that is an option - more so then in Austria for example where people often \ '' go on holidays\ '' to have an abortion - in the small village of my granny \ '' she went on a weekend trip to Vienna\ '' sometimes was really known to be code for \ '' getting an aboftion\ '',Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,There is a difference between \ '' not talking about it\ '' and \ '' if I do it I will go to hell\ '' - for example it is still hard for people in western Austria to find doctors who will perform aboftions - those people generally had to travel to Vienna until a few years ago . \\n\\nThis was as far as I know never a problem in the Eastern European states .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,It\\ 's a bit of carelessness cause you have the option abortion on the table and not just as a sort of last resort . \\n\\nMy ex was Romanian and although she was a very responsible girl wen it came to sex and contraceptives this carefulness was gone . It came to weird situations were she basically said \ '' lets fuck\ '' and I said \ '' we can\\'t cause no condoms\ '' and she responded with \ '' no worries abortions are cheap\ '' - well not word for word - but that\\ 's the mindset . \\n\\nIt\\ 's just a totally different view on the whole abortion debate that is going on there . Except of Poland - but that is a very special case on itself .,Germanic,German

There is no other option . \\n\\nItalians produced about [ 500 kg of trash per year / person ] ( http : //www.nationmaster.com/country/it-italy/env-environment ) in 2000 ( i doubt it got significantly less ) . So even if we apply the 85 % top rate that leaves 75 kg . of trash per person per year ( in reality as shown above its about 300 kg ) . Which means that a city like Parma would still produce 14.000 tons of trash per year which is not going to be recycled . ( In reality its more like 56.000 tons ) \\n\\nSo question : Where do you put that . \\n\\nAnd if you say \ '' Well we simply have to recycel 100 % - Sure i agree . But its not gon na happen soon .

Autogegner,europe,"Had there not been the immigration of 2015 , Hofer would not have gotten that far . The problem has reached a size , where public security can not be guaranteed any more in certain areas of the major towns , i.e . near the main station in Innsbruck . Noone wanted to allow nearly unlimmited immigration and there is zero understanding for paying immigrants who had gone through the asylum procedure as much as someone who is unemployed or more than conscripts in the army or the civil service and most students have.\\n\\nIf we would not have had the problem of too much immigration , the FP\u00d6 would not have gotten into that position .

Autogegner,europe,"The FP\u00d6 in its current form results mostly from J\u00f6rg Haider , who had studied the american far-right , i.e . Newt Gingrich in order to copy their platforms . Haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring .

Autogegner,europe,"Van der Bellen is clearly the better choice . In order to explain , i copy a previous comment of mine : \\n\\nHofer ( the right wing candidate ) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that Hofer and his supporters have shown . They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . At first , they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia . In the later phase of the campaign , they started calling VdB a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia ) and a neoliberal.\\n\\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . In an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel . The TV station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed . He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . He was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . A few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . When beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\\n\\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \ '' lies\ '' when VdB started citing him . There is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking Austria as a hostage with him.\\n\\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is , that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia . Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria . Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago .",Germanic,German

Autogegner,europe,"& gt ; As for his motivation , Assad has a long and well documented history of using fear to control the population.\\n\\nThe government does not require any other fear than that of the rebells winning . Assad still has widespread support . Despite predictions about a mass exodus from Aleppo in case of the expulsion of Al-Nusra , nothing like this happened . Before Aleppo was completely retaken , rumors of attrocities were spread in the media - 500.000 civilians were said to be starving , civilians were claimed to be murdered , so called \ '' activists\ '' were calling for a military intervention . Aleppo was retaken and none of these claims was ever attempted to be proven . The media and political instances have gone silent on Aleppo . I didn\\'t hear a single report about the per estimations 1 million people fleeing from the rebell-controlled parts of Aleppo , when it was still safely held by the so called Opposition . At no point did the media or the political decission makers complain about people having to flee from rebell-controlled areas , rebells calling for genocides against non-Sunnites . Before the insurgency , Syria was a mostly functioning state where people of various ethnic background could coexist . Neither the EU , the US or any single EU state have ever voiced concern about the cleansing of rebell-held areas from non-Sunnites . The \ '' people are scared of the Assad-Regime\ '' narrative only works , if the character of the insurgents is overlooked : They are sunnite extremists whose mission is to terrorise anyone who does not belong to their own sect . For the same reason , the christian population in Iraq has nearly vanished and due to similar motivations , the Lebanese Civil War has lead to a shrinking of non-Sunnite demographics . \\n\\nAny reason that could be given as a motivation for the government to conduct such an attack could also be used if such an attack was conducted in a planned manner . Southwards of the village in question , Rebels tried to push into the city of Hama two weeks ago . Taking Homs would allow the Rebels to reconnect to their areas between Homs and Hama . If chemical warfare agents were deployed , it would make much more sense to do so in an area where they would be of use and allow ground troops to take areas cleared of enemies . The insurgents on the other hand have much more reason to release toxic gas in an area held by them . For months , they have been asking for military action of western troops against the government . This time , they finally got it . However , it\\ 's not been the first time , The US supplied anti vehicle missiles to what they called the \ '' Free Syrian Army\ '' and an air raid conducted by american aircraft against the government held town of Deir-Ez-Zor that allowed Daesh to advance only happend a few months ago .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"A Financial Transaction Tax does not need to be very large to be effective . It simply needs to be large enough dissuade trading for gambling\u2019s sake but not so large it dissuades socially necessary business.\\nNaturally , it\u2019s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax in a way that it is harmonized across many markets . However , it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations . Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral . In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one . Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.\\n\\nIf the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT , the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous , volatile transactions towards other markets . Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile , so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets , which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.\\n\\nNaturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe . Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading . But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT ( but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized ) .\\n\\nAs far as Sweden goes , my understanding of Sweden\u2019s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected , they were less severely effected that less regulated markets . Furthermore their response was more effective , created a softer landing , and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets . Perhaps it\u2019s not perfect to be out front with a FTT . And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect . But it\u2019s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse , the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today . Perhaps , given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS , that\u2019s not an unqualified good thing\u2026 but that\u2019s another discussion.\\n\\nAnd yes , there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.\\n\\nlastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax .

Nor am I an expert in Austrian politics ... I\u2019m just an American expat living here . However , my understanding of the Austrian politicians stance on FTT is that it is based more on their ideological beliefs and how corrupt they are than it does from a sort of technocratic assessment of facts and metrics . The prominent exception are Maria Fekter & amp ; Andreas Schieder but I have the impression that the media has concluded that both are \u2018too boring\u2019 to be allowed to go on at length least they actually explain something important using long words which many people don\u2019t understand.\\n\\nAbout the exposure of Austrian banks to risky loans in Eastern Europe : A FTT does not directly effect the ability or likelihood that private financial institutions will engage in stupid and risky transactions and I have not heard a serious proposal from any competent person which would . However , one thing is certain : There isn\u2019t anything about the markets right now that is all that different than summer of 2008 , there is no technical reason that similarly unpleasant circumstance might come together now as they did then and cause similar catastrophic events . More importantly neither Germany or Austria has the resources today to deal with such a hypothetical event as they did in the end of 2008 to 2009 . This emphasizes the need in some folks minds to gather those resources . However , some politicians have a sort of ideological / religious stance : No new , more , or different taxes . No agreeing with anything having to do with the EU . No taxing people who have enough money to bribe me . No management or \u201cinterference\u201d in the markets . Then conversely \u201cNo taxing the poor\u201d \u201cTax the bastards that caused all this mess to begin with\u201d , etc ... \\n\\nHaving said all of that , from a technical point of view a FTT does not need to be a large tax , it needs to be a broad tax . Nor does it necessarily mean that the government must earn more in tax revenue . A skillful FTT could leave the government with as much taxes coming in as it had before ( or not ) . Therefore the questions \u201cShould we implement a Financial Transaction Tax\u201d and \u201cShould the government increase taxation\u201d are two separate questions.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that we should prefer taxation on things that have complicated negative impacts which are not borne by the parties in the transaction ( Negative Externalities ) like pollution , health risks , carbon , consumption ( VAT ) or ultra-high-speed trading than real income ( this means things like wages for real work and things like profit from selling goods ) . I also think that governments around the world are facing the absolute need to reduce their public debt and that means both reducing spending and increasing the taxes coming in . It would also help if the U.S. would refrain from invading and occupying any more nations ... but here in Europe the military spending issue is different and more complicated .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"Well , currently there is no \ '' EU B\u00f6rse\ '' there are only national ones , like the ones in London or Frankfurt and there is no \ '' EU tax collector\ '' or \ '' EU taxation\ '' . In that sense the structure of the EU is very different than the structure of the Federal Government in America and the relationships between the EU nations and the EU ( and other EU nations ) is very different between US states and the Federal Government ( and other US states ) .\\n\\nSo it would take substantially different sorts of treaties in the EU to create those sorts things . Which complicates matters because it\\ 's completely possible that a Italian owned company having a division located in Austria making money on the B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt , london , and Vienna . ( I just described my bank , Bank Austria which is owned by UniCredit SpA ) .\\n\\nAlso while the US is a transfer union ( States pay in to the Federal Government more or less than they receive from the Federal Government ) the EU is not . So not only does the mechanism for collecting a broad , EU wide tax , and then redistributing back to member nations not exist , the idea does not already exist either . However , EU governance does cost money to run and currently there are bidirectional payments going on in this regard ... so it\\ 's not a completely novel setup.\\n\\nHaving said all of that , in broad strokes a skillful FTT would be collected EU wide ( this probably means harmonized national FFT tax rates collected by member nations ) with some sort of offset ( which is probably a harmonized lowering of business income tax levied by member states ) . So the need for everything to be equal to prevent market distortion would be covered by harmonized tax rates and local collection ( where in the US the Federal Government could just do all of this in Federal Tax law and it would apply to all the states equally without the need for specific treaties or agreements ) .\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you follow US politics or are interested in US governance but I think this issue highlights the difference in the structure of governance between the EU member states and the EU and the US states and the Federal Government ( which I find very interesting ) .

Once the tax has raised sufficient funds to repay what got spent during the financial collapse , there is no real reason it can\\'t be revenue neutral either .

However , it obvious that the entire EU leadership is refusing to engage in actual leadership . Europe doesn\\'t need large and dramatic reforms , it needs minor reforms implemented skillfully .

Furthermore the disparity of CEO pay , while not as extreme as in America , is on that trajectory and is apart from the pay raises the rest of us face . And lastly there is evidence of malfeasance and incompetence of every description in Austrian banks .

0xKaishakunin,europe,"Different schools and degrees can be compared in a scientific way , that\\ 's what my research is about . \\n\\nHowever , this is a very complex task even without corruption and bribery . Different countries have different educational systems . Due to our strong TVET system in Germany only ca . 25 % of population hold an academic degree . The Universit\u00e4ten in Germany do scientific training , not vocational training . The Unis in Germany also have the same high standards of teaching and research , there are no Mickey-Mouse-Colleges and Ivy Leagues as in other countries . \\n\\nOther countries have a different approach eg . Spain and France relying heavily on universities for training with a more differentiated university system . \\n\\nSo comparing an engineering degree from a German Universit\u00e4t and a Spanish Uni is a task on it\\ 's own . Very complex . \\n\\n & gt ; the fact that Michalovce with population of 40 000 has 3 ( or more ... ) universities ( by that I mean few departments of them and you do \ '' long distance\ '' studying ) is ridiculous.\\n\\nDepends on what those Unis are doing .

It is common sense that smoking things is bad for your lungs , that is not what I\\ 'm denying . \\n\\n & gt ; Again , just for you : There are people in this world who only started smoking anything , because that\\ 's the way of consumption of cannabis of their choice . Some of those people die of smoking caused cancer . If cannabis wouldn\\'t exist , they wouldn\\'t have died.\\n\\nYou can say the same thing about people dying in car crashes , If there were no cars they wouldn\\'t have died . I don\\'t understand this reasoning.\\n\\n & gt ; Let me say this again for you too : The point is not that cannabis is bad because you can die from it . You can probably die from pretty much literally anything in this universe in some way . The point is that defending \ '' You can\\'t die from cannabis\ '' is making parts of the the legalisation movement seem ridiculous . Because it\\ 's factually wrong ( for whatever indirect reasons , cannabis smoking caused cancer , fatal crash from driving under the influence ) and unimportant ( lethality alone isn\\'t a valid argument , you can die from driving a car ) . \\n\\nI think I clearly said : \\n\\n & gt ; No , their deaths are not directly attributable to cannabis , but to smoking burning stuff . You can vape without burning . You can eat weed brownies/cakes/whatever . There is no one forcing you to smoke a joint/blunt . Just to be clear , I\\ 'll say it again : Cannabis can not kill you . **It is the smoking that kills you . **\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything else , of course you can die if you crash your car after you drove high , or if you were too high to notice the stairs and fell down , but that still does not make cannabis kill you . It is because you were impaired due to the cannabis . If someone dies during a drunk driving accident , people don\\'t say he died due to alcoholic beverages , but he died while driving drunk .

Starting with the first five seconds , making you think this is going to be a upbeat song when suddenly *there\\ 's a piano* . \\nThat \ '' No.\ '' gets me every time . Then you get this Sammarinese Rebecca Black , with a voice that totally doesn\\'t fit that boy\\ 's voice.\\n The way she says \ '' Wa-ays\ '' makes me cringe and laugh at the same time . And the moment those shining smartphones appeared , I just lost it . Then their failed \ '' rap part\ '' ... \\n\\nThis whole song is like San Marino just pulled two kids from the street , and obligated them to sing in Eurovision . With lyrics that look like a four-year-old made them.\\n\\n & gt ; Just light up the candles . Let them shine on deep inside.\\n\\n & gt ; a chain of lights for you , and a chain of lights for me\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe we\u2019ll find out that many people feel the same \u2013 oh yeah\\n\\n & gt ; Together hand in hand , we will feel the love inside\\n\\n & gt ; If we all walk together we will feel the love inside\\n\\nAnd so on and so on ... I know it\\ 's hard for a country for a country with only 30 000 people to find someone good for Eurovision , \\nbut instead of doing this sending Valeria Monetta is a better choice , and will likely break some records too.\\n^ ( I was astonished when I saw the credits . How the fuck do you need 50 people to make this song ? ? ? ) \\n\\nPotenial nul-pointer\\n\\n***\\n\\n04 Montenegro : Knez - Adio [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4giAO-2aICo ) \\n\\nI would call this Montenegro\\ 's impression on [ Zeljko Joksimovic ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=z7OvpjplJ_8 ) . \\nA very beautiful opening , but the song becomes a bit worse when he starts to sing . Not bad , just worse.\\nI\\ 'm glad Montenegro is singing in their own language , if this was in English I wouldn\\'t like it.\\n\\n***\\n\\n05 Malta : Amber - Warrior [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dZe75LUKIto ) \\n\\nOh hey , there\\ 's another Warrior this year . This song has parts she sounds like Duffy.\\nA lot of unecessary screaming in this song . Overall this ballad is _OK_ , but will it qualify ?

Would be a nice and accurate slogan for them at Eurovision.\\n\\nA good duet ballad that sounds like a boring song the first 20 seconds , but you just feel something\\ 's gon na happen.\\nIn the year of ballads this is one of the better ones.\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n07 Portugal : Leonor Andrade - H\u00e1 um mar que nos separa [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xowMYNzYWbE ) \\n\\nPortugal , No . Would be a nice and accurate slogan for them at Eurovision . With 46 previous participations their best result is 6th.\\n\\nThis song is not going to change anything about that . \\nThe singer is standing really strange , like she wants to show her vagina ( espacially from [ 1:42 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xowMYNzYWbE & amp ; t=1m42 ) ) .\\nBut this rock ballad is doomed to fail and to stay in the semis , I cringed during the last refrain.\\n***\\n\\n08 Czech Republic : Marta Jandov\u00e1 & amp ; V\u00e1clav Noid B\u00e1rta - Hope Never Dies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=s31Ho7I64Os ) \\n\\nThis is the best song Czech Republic has ever sent to Eurovision . This song will guaranteed get their best result ever in Eurovision , \\nsince their best result right now is 18th in the Semi ( which isn\\'t possible this year ! ) . So congratulations ! \\n\\nBut about the song : It doesn\\'t really amuse me . This is a too mediocre , standard ballad.\\nAlso , they don\\'t really suit together for a duet . I\\ 'm afraid this will stay in the Semis too\\n\\n***\\n\\n09 Israel : Nadav Guedj - Golden Boy [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=BQNNtbdZ4Zg ) \\n\\nMy thoughts when I first heard this song : \\n\\n0:00 Oh no , not a stupid ballad again . This reminds me of Belgium last year ... \\n\\n0:35 Thank god this isn\\'t a ballad . Doesn\\'t this sound like Ed Sheeran\\ 's Sing ? \\n\\n0:50 I hear a build-up coming ... \\n\\n1:05 Oh yes ! This is the Mid-Eastern sound I\\ 've been missing this Eurovision\\n\\n1:30 Here\\ 's Ed Sheeran again\\n\\n1:35 NOOO NO [ ICEJJFISH ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iq_d8VSM0nw & amp ; t=15s ) ! ! ! STOP \\n\\n1:40 Phew , you almost ruined your song\\n\\nHe may not look like that , but he\\ 's just 16 years old . Yes , 16.\\n\\nThis is my favorite song this Semi-Final , this song saves this semi for me ( together with Sweden ) . This MUST be in the final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n10 Latvia : Aminata - Love Injected [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=fnVbR98J7Q4 ) \\n\\n*That beat is really stolen from Lean On* . Weird thing is , Lean On was released two weeks after this won Latvia\\ 's final\\nThe chorus is a Latvian combination of Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Katy Perry\\ 's Roar.\\n\\nThat beat gives a strange touch to this song , but it also removes the boredom in this ballad ( if you could called it a ballad ) \\n\\nProbably in the Final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n11 Azerbaijan : Elnur H\u00fcseynov - Hour of the Wolf [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kYsj1fFE1Xw ) \\n\\nA well-thought Eurovision song like only Azerbaijan and Sweden can . \\nFor me , this song is the border tonight between the songs that I like and I don\\'t like , nothing special.\\n\\nThis will reach the final for sure ( it\\ 's Azebaijan ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n12 Iceland : Mar\u00eda \u00d3lafs - Unbroken [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8pYueOpzswg ) \\n\\nAfter Iceland\\ 's Teletubbie band last year , they sent a song this year that I quite like . \\nI wouldn\\'t classify this as a ballad , but more as a medium fast pop song . I hope this will be in the Final , but I\\ 'm not sure if they will pass.\\n\\n***\\n\\n13 Sweden : M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w - Heroes [ link - with free tolk ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MaDob2RQldM ) \\n\\nLooking at the act alone , Sweden it by far the best . However there are accusations of plagiarism for the stickymen they use in the performance.\\n\\nAbout the song itself : Many people say this sounds like Lovers On the Sun , but I don\\'t think so . It\\ 's only a very small part that sounds like it.\\n\\nThis song is the favorite at the bookmakers , but I doubt if they were first if the act was less spectacular . But all in all , this song one of my personal favorites.\\n\\n***\\n\\n14 Switzerland : M\u00e9lanie Ren\u00e9 - Time to Shine [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ooDmr3Jtw5o ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n15 Cyprus : John Karayiannis - One Thing I Should Have Done [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=W39Qrusgp5E ) \\n\\nIf John Mayer sung this song , it would probably be a big hit .

854850,europe,"THE FINAL IS SATURDAY , TONIGHT IS THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL\\n\\nIn just a couple of hours the first Semi-Final of Eurovision will start in Vienna . In this \\'summary\\ ' , I have listed the songs in tonight\\ 's performance order , and added my own thoughts on the songs , being neutral.\\n\\nThe links next to the songs won\\'t spoil the performances of tonight ( no rehearsals and such ) , abut if available will go to a good-quality live performance ( mostly performances of national finals ) , but you don\\'t have to see them to understand me.\\n\\n\\n01 Moldova : Eduard Romanyuta - I Want Your Love [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=mz655avMYyo ) \\n\\nIf you watch Eurovision and see this as the first song , you will probably think \\'What the fuck is this show\\ ' , but don\\'t worry , this is one-of-a-kind.\\nWith this song Eurovision goes back 10 years in time . It reminds me a lot of [ Dirrty by Christina Aguilera ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4Rg3sAb8Id8 ) . \\nBut this song is different than all other entries , and maybe that\\ 's why I like it . I would be really surprised though if this will finish top 10 and get through the finals , many people dislike this one\\n\\n\\n02 Armenia : Genealogy - Face The Shadow [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=VVVvgD0-Mu0 ) \\n\\nThis is the first of many ballads you\\ 'll hear this Eurovision , and definitely not the best one . It\\ 's sung by a group of six singers made for Eurovision , who come from 5 different continents , and Armenia itself . I\\ 'm afraid however they won\\'t sing really good live.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what this song is about ( and you have lived under a rock the past ~~100~~ 101 years ) , it\\ 's about the Armenian Genocide , which happened in 1915.\\nIn my opinion , political things like the Armenian Genocide shouldn\\'t be discussed on Eurovision . It also surprises me that this song is allowed to enter Eurovision without any changes , while Georgia had to change a song called \\'We don\\'t wan na Put In\\ ' ( similar to Vladimir Putin\\n^ ( sidenote : This song was first called \\'Don\\'t Deny\\ ' , but they changed it voluntarily to prevent the connection with _denying_ the Genocide ) \\n\\n\\n03 Belgium : Lo\u00efc Nottet - Rythm Inside [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=J9B3a7A7tbk ) \\n\\nAfter one of my least favorites , we go to one of my favorites . This \ '' Lorde-y\ '' song ^ ( no not Lordi ) is pretty refreshing in Eurovision . The first couple of seconds will make you think you are listening to Royals , but after that it just sound like a very good song you could easily hear on a hit station . This will definitely go to the final.\\n\\n\\n04 Netherlands : Trijntje Oosterhuis - Walk Along [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JO1cqzPWrVI ) \\n [ For those who don\\'t know to pronounce that name , here\\ 's how she pronounces it herself ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KdApGEC7fmM & amp ; t=5s ) \\n\\nThis year The Netherlands has sent one of their more famous artists to Eurovision , with a song that hasn\\'t any climax or something . This song , written by 2013 participant Anouk , could be best described as \\'medium\\ ' . It\\ 's not going to end very high , but I think ( and hope ) it will go the finals . There was however a lot discussion about the dress she was about to wear ( looked like someone played on it with a scissor ) , and I hope she won\\'t wear that tonight.\\n\\n\\n05 Finland : Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t - Aina mun pit\u00e4\u00e4 [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ePhjs-3q068 ) \\n\\nI can assure you , there aren\\'t any worse songs than this one this year . This is the definition of awful . The best thing about this punk song is that it\\ 's the shortest song ever in Eurovision : only 90 seconds long , so if you want to do a toilet pause you got to be quick.\\nNote that this band was made before Eurovision , so they didn\\'t group them for Eurovision alone . However , they only reason that this song will get any points is because of the fact they are mentally disabled ( and maybe some Bloc-voting ) . But for me , this song is a 1/10 . Finland , if you want to win with something _special_ , you have to make the song at least a bit good.\\n\\n\\n06 Greece : Maria Elena Kyriakou - One last Breath [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=v7xKMnNcVdM ) \\n\\nEvery year , there are one , maybe two songs that try to repeat the success of the top songs the previous year . Greece is one of the examples this year . \\nThe main reason this got to Eurovision is because all the other participants on the national final sing good.\\nBut she had a good voice . A very good voice . Talking about voice , she won the Voice of Greece . The first two minutes of this ballad are a tad boring , but then the song suddenly becomes pretty good.\\nBut of all ballads , I think the only ones that can beat her are Spain and Albania . It\\ 's very likely that this will reach the final.\\n\\n\\n07 Estonia : Elina Born & amp ; Stig R\u00e4sta - Goodbye to yesterday [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JNXtXZM0QcA ) \\n\\nSpeaking about repeating successes , this one is the other example . The first thing that came into my mind was Calm After the Storm , as this also is a country-ish song , but this not a copy or something.\\nI like this song very much , it has hit potential and , more importantly , it has winning potential . For me , the best song of this Semi.\\n\\n\\n08 Fyr Maceodnia : Daniel Kajmakoski - Autumn Leaves [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=t8QCt6CJCHc ) \\n\\na pretty good song , sung like it\\ 's a fairytale . However , I\\ 'm very afraid that the live performance will ruin this song and thus result in this song not getting to the final\\n\\n\\n09 Serbia : Bojana Stamenov - Beauty Never Lies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qJrJVsOQwEc ) \\n\\nIf you would mix Conchita Wurst and Susan Boyle , you\\ 'd hey Serbia\\ 's act this year . Her voice is astonishing , but there\\ 's is one thing that will probably affect thist song\\nnegatively : she\\ 's dressed \ '' very old-fashioned\ '' . It really depends on the act for whether she will get to the finals or not\\n\\n\\n10 Hungary : Boggie - Wars for Nothing [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=WETXc5Z7Cng ) \\n\\nCan soneone wake me up ? Seriously , this song is perfect for letting someone fall asleep . I feel bad for you Australians who will have to see this at 4AM or something , trying to stay awake . Very boring ballad about useless conflicts , which isn\\'t a bad subject but a bit standard ( don\\'t get why they put Ebola on the background though ) \\nnothing special . Not the way a ballad should be IMO.\\n\\n\\n11 Belarus : Uzari & amp ; Maimuna - Time [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dVv_BmOqPWg ) \\n\\nThe beginning of the song strongly reminds me of Not Alone ( Armenia\\ 's song last year ) , but at least this song is more upbeat than all other songs this Semi.\\nBut overall , this song is very medium , and is one of those song that you would easily forget about . Don\\'t really know what to think about this one\\n\\n\\n12 Russia Polina Gagarina - A Million Voices [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jBVY7Glcd84 ) \\n\\nShe looks like a crossing from Kate Ryan and Ellie Goulding . \\'Hopeful\\ ' ballad about humanity , but to me it comes over a bit hypocritical , \\nescpecially with those kids in the clip . This is a song you would hear when having breakfast in a hotel in another country . Sorry Russia , but this is not my favorite.\\nBut because it\\ 's Russia , this will be in the final 100 % sure.\\n\\n\\n13 Denmark : Anti Social Media - The Way You Are [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RA-A_uvE1ss ) \\n\\nLike last year , Denmark sends a \\'Poppy\\ ' song . It sounds similar to something , but I don\\'t know what His voice isn\\'t the best of tonight , and I worry that he will miss some tones tonight.\\nNot my favorite.\\n\\n\\n14 Albania : Elhaida Dani - I\\ 'm Alive [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=lZJdWUmxxZw ) \\n\\nWow . Just wow . This song got me from the first to the last second . Just beautiful . Her voice , divine . A cheerful upbeat ballad . One of the best songs this year . This must end in the top 5 in the final . If we\\ 're listening to voice alone in this Semi , she and Greece\\ 's singer are the winners.\\n\\n\\n15 Romania : Voltaj - De la cap\u0103t [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Nw6sKQbwQOM ) \\n\\nWhat the fuck is this staging in their national final ^ ( ( disclaimer : I don\\'t know how Romania\\ 's performance of tonight will look\\\\ ) ) . The singer looks like a TV chef , or that person you would see in those telemarketing commercials . but then it changes to a rock song.\\nOne of the few song that is not in English , and unfortunately it doesn\\'t do this song any good . This will stick in the Semis , \\nsorry Romania.\\n\\n\\n16 Georgia : Nina Sublatti - Warrior [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RZrRQSI_pcQ ) \\n\\nIf you said to me that Jessie J sung this song , I would believe it . This \\'upbeat ballad\\ ' gives you this feeling of \\'I can fight against it\\ ' , which explains the title Warrior . I like this song , it doesn\\'t bore me . This will go to to the final and in all probability reach the top 10 , but I can assure you it won\\'t be the winner\\n\\nMy personal Ranking of this Semi-Final\\n\\n1 Estonia\\n\\n2 Albania\\n\\n3 Greece\\n\\n4 Belgium\\n\\n5 Georgia\\n\\n6 Moldova\\n\\n7 FYR Macedonia\\n\\n8 The Netherlands\\n\\n9 Serbia ( Was higher first ) \\n\\n10 Denmark\\n\\n11 Belarus\\n\\n12 Russia\\n\\n13 Armenia\\n\\n14 Romania\\n\\n15 Hungary\\n\\n16 Finland\\t\\n\\nMy prediction of this Semi-Final\\n\\n1 Albania*\\n\\n2 Estonia*\\n\\n3 Russia\u00b2\\n\\n4 Georgia\\n\\n5 Greece*\\n\\n6 Belgium*\\n\\n7 The Netherlands\\n\\n8 Armenia\\n\\n9 Hungary\\n\\n10 Finland* ( they get first or get to place 10 or lower ) \\n\\n11 Serbia\\n\\n12 Fyr Macedonia\\t\\t\\n\\n13 Belarus\\n\\n14 Denmark\\n\\n15 Moldova\\n\\n16 Romania\\n\\n*= What I predict as potential winner of this year , Russia may win this Semi but not the Final\\n\\nWTL ; DR\\n\\nMoldova = Male version of Dirrty\\n\\nArmenia = Genocide\\n\\nBelgium = Male Lorde [ ( not this ) ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fGLoPDR.jpg ) \\n\\nNetherlands = Whyhyhyhyhy\\n\\nFinland = Toilet pause\\n\\nGreece = Rise like a Phoenix 2015\\n\\nEstonia = Calm After the storm 2015\\n\\nFyr Macedonia = violin + a fairytale\\n\\nSerbia = Conchita + Susan Boyle\\n\\nHunary = Peace Ballad , Nap time\\n\\nBelarus = just medium\\n\\nRussia = Peace Ballad + Ellie Goulding + Kate Ryan\\n\\nAlbania = Good upbeat ballad\\n\\nRomania = Toilet Pause 2\\n\\nGeorgia = Jessie J\\n\\nEDIT : \\nOkay so I got two entries wrong that I thought would go to the finals : \\nThe Netherlands ( overestimated it ) \\nFinland ( Actually I\\ 'm glad this didn\\'t pass ) \\n\\nInstead , these countries passed : \\nSerbia and Romania ( which both were better than I expected\\n",Germanic,Dutch

It was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries . [ 39 ] It was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . [ 40 ] \\n\\n & gt ; Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds . Ibn Sina and other philosophers such as al-Kindi and al-Farabi combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam . [ citation needed ] Arabic philosophic literature was translated into Latin and Ladino , contributing to the development of modern European philosophy . \\n\\nI can keep going if you want to ...",Germanic,Dutch

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Good to see that Asscher his proposals are getting some attention and that Corbyn responded in a positive way . Using Brexit as a means to make some new reforms could be really helpful . Asscher wants to level the playing field for European workers and address tax avoidance issues.\\n\\nHe also makes an appeal for progressive patriotism which is to say that national pride and identity is something which is part of the progressive movement . Newcomers should accept basic values such as freedom of speech and religion in order to be accepted in society .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,That is not true . It is more a case of being in a race with other countries . You can either decide to do business or give it to someone else .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,How is that at all relevant ? Selling weapons comes with a whole range of other issues than handling taxes .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,"That is all based on the premise that raising taxes is by itself an immoral act , which I do not agree with . Raising taxes is what governments do .

That is the statement that I made and nothing more .",Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,And where did I imply that it would ? Please also tell me how selling weapons is somehow the same as processing taxes .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,"Stated policy is to not start negotiating before Article 50 is invoked , so you are not going to hear any definitive views from European leaders about what the negotiation strategy should be until that point.\\n\\nHaving said that , my guess would be that it will go to WTO rules , because it will not be possible to make a deal which is acceptable to all parties within the time limit .",Germanic,Dutch

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,The article mentions that the command center needs to be stopped . What you are asking about is horrible .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Interesting article because it refutes the notion that the terror attacks are retaliation to the ongoing attacks against ISIL . It has more to do with attacking the European model for co-existence and trying to elicit a response which will help their recruitment efforts . The part about ISIL its frustration with being unable to hit Germany for a long period also says a lot about the whole strategizing mentality that are behind the attacks . It ends with an ominous message saying that as long as Raqqa stands Europe will continue to suffer from attacks like these .,Germanic,Dutch
AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Then I misunderstood you . Perhaps it is better to refer to it as a ban on extremism .,Germanic,Dutch

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,"The Dutch government responded swiftly here , which is a good thing . A two-man party asking questions is quite irrelevant .

I don\\'t consider myself a nationalist , I criticise things around here a lot and my friends will tell you that I\\ 'm not a nationalist ( and as a matter of fact really have something against them ) , but in the end , I\\ 'm really a part of this place , as much as bricks are part of a building . It simply doesn\\'t belong anywhere else . A brick isn\\'t proud of what it is part of , but it\\ 's still certainly a part . \\n\\nEven after everything that happened , I\\ 'm still arguably in favour of the EU , although I\\ 've never given it too much thought . No one could argue that it shouldn\\'t have been governed differently . Mistakes have been made but it does seem like the way things should be .",Germanic,Dutch

Amanoo,europe,"The UK has some policies , cultural aspects or traditions that are much more similar to American culture than the culture of most other European countries . For example , the UK employs a voting system based on First Past The Post . Ever seen people complain about UK politics being manipulable and all of that ? Things like gerrymandering ? That just FPTP at work . It\\ 's a system that\\ 's completely alien to most other non-English speaking countries , which often use parliamentary systems based on things such as Mixed Member Proportional Representation . FPTP is known by some for being highly manipulable , unrepresentative and for its tendency to degrade into a bipartisan system ( it hasn\\'t really done so in the UK yet , although the UK does have two big parties , one of which usually holds the majority ) . For detailed info , CGP Grey has a series of videos that explains things in a simple but very good manner . He\\ 's also been very vocal about it in his Hello Internet podcast ( can\\'t remember which episodes though ) . [ Dooblydoo ] ( http : //www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/ ) . \\n\\nAnother example would be the GCHQ , which quire a few would regard as barely more than the lackey of the NSA . Not exactly friendly to things like personal freedom or privacy ( which I\\ 'd argue is fundamental to freedom ) . People often forget that other countries\\ ' organisations , such as the AIVD , aren\\'t that great either . \\n\\nThe UK is also more likely to come up with proposals for draconian policies than the rest Europe . I can\\'t remember any specific policies , though , although I know there are some . Every so often , something pops up again . I\\ 'm willing to bet that there\\ 's something similar to SOPA or PIPA that , if it hasn\\'t been implemented , was at least proposed . I wish I had remembered more specific examples , though . I just don\\'t have the type of memory that holds on to that kind of specific information . \\n\\nI\\ 'd argue that English speakers also have a strong tendency to beat around the bush or to sugar-coat things . I might be a bit biased though , as I\\ 'm Dutch . My own culture has a tendency to just speak their minds . We have a blunt honesty that\\ 's often meant to be either helpful or efficient ( or possibly both ) . For example , if you were to try to speak Dutch , and told us that you sucked at it , you\\ 'd be fairly likely to hear \ '' yes , you really do suck\ '' . But it\\ 's often followed by tips to help you get better . We also don\\'t like too much chitter chatter or insincerity . A \ '' how are you\ '' by a supermarket worker is borderline offensive to us , as it\\ 's not a sincere question and may even be interpreted as prying into someone else\\ 's life .",Germanic,Dutch

The only reason cats kill more wild animals than us is because we\\ 've figured out how to domesticate animals before we kill them . 9 billion chickens are killed each year in the US alone . By human beings , not by cats . There are about 74 million cats in the US , which means to compete with humans , the average american cat would have to kill a new chicken every three days . And that\\ 's just chickens ! We kill turkeys , sheep , goats , cattle and pigs en masse as well . It\\ 's hard to visualize how much we kill animals because any wild animals we like to kill are extinct or close to extinction . \\n\\nTake the [ passenger pigeon . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon ) They used to travel in flocks so large they would blacken the sky . Competitions could consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock . The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition . Can you imagine a cat killing 30 000 birds even in its lifetime ? \\n\\nNot to mention the animals we kill by accident . Every day critters are mauled by cars on highways or combines on farms . Over 100 000 people were killed in Hiroshima . How many cats and dogs ? How many mice and cockroaches ? More than a cat could kill.\\n\\nToday domestic and wild cats perhaps kill more _wild animals_ than humans , but make no mistake - that is merely because we\\ 've changed the status of the animals we usually kill away from \ '' wild\ '' - not because of our capacity for murder is lower . Hell , we easily outkill them in wild animals too if we count whatever we haul up from the ocean . The ocean , which for most of humanity\\ 's existence has been seen as a limitless supply of food is being sucked dry . We are killing the creatures there so fast that they can\\'t keep up , and it\\ 's the goddamn ocean . \\n\\nEDIT : I used the US as an example because it\\ 's more relatable for most of reddit , and the numbers are easily accessible . I see now that I am in /r/europe and that\\ 's kind of weird , but I\\ 'm sure the numbers work either way.\\n\\nDOUBLE EDIT : Cats aren\\'t necessarily better than us at killing rats and snakes , we just value their time and lives less than our own .

Aqwis,europe,"The only reason why that is a problem is that as I understand it in Hungary both the old and new degrees go by the name \ '' bachelor degree\ '' , which is indeed unfortunate.\\n\\nIn Norway we don\\'t have that problem because the old degrees had different names , so you can put that name on your CV and the recruiter will understand what it is.\\n\\nIf I understand you correctly this is mostly a Hungary-specific problem since most countries in Europe had different names for their degrees before the Bologna reform , and it hasn\\'t been long enough since the reform that employers don\\'t know the names of the old degrees or how long they were .",Germanic,Norwegian
Aqwis,europe,"Why would that have anything to do with the Bologna reform ? Indeed , Wikipedia says the following : \\n\\n & gt ; However , students appear to feel that the workload has increased , and the new standards lead to micromanaged and too narrow curricula [ citation needed ] . The Bologna Process is said to lead to universities being \ '' diploma factories\ '' . [ citation needed ] Also , for example at Helsinki University of Technology , most students ( 85 % ) fail to achieve the official goal of 120 credits in two years \u2013 the average is 81 credits . The number of students failing to achieve the minimum credits to receive student benefit has risen 40 % following the implementation of the Process.\\n\\nThis indicates that it has become *more difficult* for students to finish their education on time than it was before . Of course , the text also indicates that this is might not be because standards of education have risen , but I see no suggestion that universities are \ '' easier\ '' than before . Indeed , I can only speak for my university , but the only major difference that Bologna led to seems to be that the grading system was changed from numbers to letters.\\n\\nMy guess is that it was your university ( or even just your study programme ) that became easier and not indeed European universities in general .",Germanic,Norwegian

The level of difficulty for those courses are about the same now as it was in the 80s.\\n\\n & gt ; A college degree doesn\\'t guarantee you an office job\\n\\nTwo points : In the countries that have gone through the economic crisis most unscathed , i.e . *not* Spain , Portugal , your own Hungary , etc. , degrees in traditionally \ '' safe\ '' fields like engineering and medicine still pretty much guarantee you a job . A degree in Media Science or whatever does obviously not guarantee you a relevant job , but this is *not* a new development . It has always been that way .",Germanic,Norwegian

5tormwolf92,europe,"& gt ; The reality is that for five centuries much of the Balkans found itself under the Ottoman yoke , under an occupation that the locals resented at all levels , and for good reason . Under the millet system , the collective rights of Christians as a community were severely constrained compared to their Muslim counterparts . In the early days of this occupation , they were subjected to the worst injustices imaginable , including the forced enslavement of their children under the dev\u015firme system . Moreover , economically speaking the status of Christians came close to what can rightfully be called servitude . Christians were subjected to a highly discriminatory tax , they were shut out many professions , and often were in practice precluded from owning any sizeable amount of land . In effect , a large fraction of Christians in the Ottoman Empire were forced to work the land as laborers , while the profit of their work went to landholders who were almost invariably immigrants from other parts of the Ottoman Empire or local Muslim converts.\\n\\nAt the same time we had the spansih inquisition where non-christians had to flee al Andalus .

Some may be , some may be sexual harassment.\\n\\nHere are the arguments from the quoted wiki paragraph alone : \\n\\n* Police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics.\\n\\n* The Swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately.\\n\\n* The Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported.\\n\\nI\\ 'll say again that I am not arguing for or against immigration or integration , but what you say is not the \ '' only\ '' argument at all . I won\\'t comment on the ethnicity of the criminals since I wasn\\'t , for the third time , arguing for or against immigration/integration . I\\ 'm only discussing how stats can be used to paint different images of reality.\\n\\n & gt ; So , are swedes reporting real crimes or are they just making stuff as they go along to pin them on innocent immigrants ? \\n\\nAgain , the ethnicity of criminals are irrelevant when discussing the application of statistics . You\\ 're trying to turn my post about statistics into a post about immigration/integration , that\\ 's not what I came here to discuss.\\n\\n & gt ; Furthermore , you talk about deceiving people with statistics , but here you are trying to pull the wool over everyone\\ 's eyes by distorting a single piece of statistics while trying desperately to ignore all facts and even all crimes being committed by immigrants . How ? By trying to argue that some rapes aren\\'t really rapes , only \ '' swedish-rapes\ '' , which aren\\'t really rapes.\\nAre you really trying to make this argument ? \\n\\nEasy with the accusations here . Once again , I used that \ '' fact\ '' as an example of how stats can be interpreted in more than one way .

7Seyo7,europe,"& gt ; Immigrants/refugees commit crimes disproportionately is what I said , and yes it is an undeniable , empirical fact.\\n\\nI did not dispute that . \\n\\n & gt ; You are wrong because your original statement was worded as one would word an accusation , don\\'t you dare try to back away from that.\\n\\nIt was a question , a fair one in my eyes . The way you worded your original post it sounded like \ '' Do you want raping immigrants to come to your country ? \ '' which is a rather aggressive standpoint so I asked you to clarify . \\n\\n & gt ; Indeed . You responded to me with an accusation which I do happen to consider a personal attack , and then get passive aggressive with me and back away acting as if I\\ 'm the one attacking you . Cute.\\n\\nAgain , it was not meant to be an accusation but because of the rather unorthodox statement I asked you to clarify . It was in no way mean as a personal attack . However , due to your followup : \ '' Nice reading comprehension , but I\\ 'm used to the old strawman when dealing with pro-immigration types.\\nI specifically said disproportionately , would you like a dictionary ? \ '' I did get more defensive since it was nothing but a personal attack that in no way contributed to discussion . Also , I feel compelled to point out that you again resort to the very same thing you\\ 're accusing me for , passive agressiveness , personal attacks , whatever you want to call it . Though I\\ 'm not denying that I haven\\'t either but I do not consider myself to be the instigator.\\n\\n & gt ; No , that\\ 's a logical fallacy used to falsely bolster ones argument . I think one who has a sound argument would stand on his argument and his argument alone , not taking the easy road as many do and saying look guys , he posted in European !

I did not \ '' dig through\ '' your post history to find something incriminating , nor am I judging you for posting in European . I do , however , note the general tone of your posts and see how you handle arguments to see if our discussion is the norm or the exception . Not to use it against you , but more out of curiousity . I admit that it might not be fair to mention it but I was simply defending myself . Also , I think you are mistaken . All I disagree with is the fact that you in your original post worded it in a way as to equalize immigrants with rapists .

However , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics .

Segregated suburbs with repatriated foreign fighters pose an acute threat , says migration officer Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' The district Hj\u00e4llbo is the Swedish answer to Molenbeek , Brussels , where terrorists from Paris hid while they were planning new actions . We must prepare ourselves , \ '' says the policeman . \\n\\nJust three hours drive from Oslo are six neighborhoods in Gothenburg characterized by parallel society , crime and strong elements of extreme , violent Islamists , according to a recent police report . \\n\\nAftenposten stands outside the door to a so-called garage mosque named \ '' Blue Door\ '' district in Hj\u00e4llbo , Angered , Gothenburg . Terror scientists from National Defence College in Stockholm have characterized the place as a meeting place for extreme Islamists and were warned by the police about going too close . \\n\\n**Carpeted washroom converted into a mosque** \\n\\nAftenposten found the blue door that has given the mosque its name . The venue is a disused laundry in an apartment building close to Hj\u00e4llbo center . The door is open and we enter . \\n\\nThe nearly 20 square meter room is covered with carpeting . On the walls there are a few bulletin boards and posters in Arabic . Two easy chairs make up the furniture . \\n\\n\ '' No shoes ! \ '' \\n\\nA young man with a dark beard reminds us to take off our shoes before entering a mosque . He sits alone on the carpet in a corner and reads a book . He does not want to say his name , but says in English that he is a computer science student and that he does not speak Swedish . He cringes away when we retrieve the camera . \\n\\n\ '' Why do you visit exactly this mosque ? \ '' \\n\\n\ '' I visit all sorts of mosques , \ '' he said . \\n\\nHe summons an elderly man who presents himself as a Palestinian named Ahmed Abdelrazek , and emerges as a kind of leader on site . When we ask him about the terrorist researchers\\ ' claim that there is recruitment to ISIS , he shakes his head . He does not like people from here travel to war . \\n\\n\ '' It\\ 's insane to train people to commit acts of terror , \ '' says Abdelrazek . \\n\\nThe young man may not speak Swedish , but he understands a certain amount of the Swedish language . He enters into the conversation with the elderly man who suddenly did not want to talk more with us . \\n\\n\ '' They don\\'t like visits from the media , \ '' concludes police inspector Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n**Fosters foreign fighters in isolated pockets** \\n \\nWe meet the policeman at the police station in the district Hj\u00e4llbo , where the audience is operated behind bulletproof glass . Bostr\u00f6m has worked in the police for 38 years . He takes us to a meeting where he draws and tells on a blackboard on developments taking place in the northeastern parts of Gothenburg . \\n\\n\ '' Gothenburg are among those places that are recruited most foreign fighters per capita in Western Europe , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nThe terror in Paris and Brussels have focused on isolated pockets of parallel societies in Europe that fosters foreign fighters and terrorists hiding on the run . Intelligence information indicates that IS has trained 400 people to attack on European soil . Sweden is specifically designated as a target . \\n\\n\ '' The official alert level is currently at level 3 . I would say that it is at 5 , almost on top . When we hear how the mosques here reviewing the terror in the rest of Europe , I am not in doubt , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m , showing that there was a failed suicide attack in Stockholm in 2010 . \\n\\nJohan Walter sitting in the same meeting room . He is employed in Migrationsv\u00e4rket but pronounces himself as a private person . He has worked in the vulnerable districts in almost 20 years . \\n\\n\ '' I am convinced that it is only a matter of time before it slams , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**A segregated society with violent extremism** \\n \\nA Swedish police report that came just before Christmas last year , states that 15 residential areas in Sweden is characterized by a parallel society with a strong presence of violent religious extremism and criminals . Six of the worst areas are located in Gothenburg . \\n\\nThese are residential areas where much of the population has little confidence in the police and judiciary . They will not testify in court . Conflicts are resolved out of the ordinary justice system , sometimes within clans . Many people who live here , have over time been living in a sort of state of emergency with serious crime and shooting in broad daylight . Threats and violence are perceived as normal by many , and measures that are inserted , have had little effect.\\n\\nThe backdrop is record unemployment , drug crimes , ethnic segregation , stigmatization and sometimes extreme overcrowding . There are examples of 20 people sleeping in shifts in a two bedroom apartment . \\n\\n**Young criminals are recruited** \\n\\nIt is the development of clean immigrant ghettos that worries Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' We have even created the segregated city . A third of the population in Gothenburg are immigrants . 80 percent of those living in neighborhoods in the northeast . These are places authorities are absent.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m points out that eight out of ten drop out of primary school in some of these neighborhoods . Figures for crime and unemployment are ominous high . \\n\\n\ '' It goes without saying that young people in this environment becomes easy prey for people who want to recruit them . We should remember that this is young people who are not even welcome in his own family because they are criminals . They drink . They see no future . They are then invited into the fire . Over time , they get to hear about Islam , but only those parts of the religion that suits them who enlists them.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m says that these young people who rule without the basic knowledge of Islam , even if the parents are devout Muslims . \\n\\n\ '' First generation are the most stable . But what happens when the elderly fall from ? The potential for even more foreign fighters is enormous , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nAlready last autumn warned the Swedish security police Sapo about terrorist risk in Sweden , and the Gothenburg pointed out by many foreign fighters . \\n\\n**Lifetime for beheading two Swedes** \\n \\nTwo men from Gothenburg , a 30 year old and a 32 year old , were in a Swedish court recently sentenced to life in prison for beheading in Aleppo in Syria . A few weeks ago , four men with ties to Sweden stopped in Turkey as they were supposedly on their way to Syria to join the IS . \\n\\nNo youngsters Aftenposten meetings Hj\u00e4llbo will take foreign fighters in defense . Two young boys stirs up sharply , but they want to be anonymous . One of them is a Kurd . They say they know many who have traveled , but no one has returned . \\n\\n\ '' They are jerks traveling . If they survive and come back , I\\ 'll beat them , \ '' says Kurd Alex ( 19 ) . \\n\\nBuddy Arber ( 19 ) are Albanian and says : \ '' Foreign warriors pigs to Islamic religion.\ '' \\n\\n**Notified of developments in the suburbs** \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m claims he has seen the danger signs long . \\n\\n\ '' We see that gifted fundamentalists gain more and more control in these suburbs . The less we do to support those Muslims who want to approach our democracy , the better breeding ground there for parallel society . People in these suburbs live as social hostages , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nJohan Walter nods . \\n\\n\ '' There has been a shift in recent years . Niqab was never used before , but it has come after influence of fundamentalists . We see changes in Somalis who previously had sufi traditions of dance and music . Now they do not dare to perform this public anymore because they can meet reactions , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**Major challenge to reverse the trend** \\n \\nZan Jankovski coordinate efforts against communities with violent extremists in Gothenburg municipality . He would not comment on the terrorist danger . \\n\\n\ '' But it is clear that we have too many Syria explorers from the city . Of 130 who have traveled , is around 25 dead and 25 have returned . We have received information that fewer trips now , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\nHe points out that they also have foreign fighters to Ukraine and greater extreme-right in town . \\n\\n\ '' It is clear that the challenge with a segregated and polarized city is a major challenge . Reversing a trend that has come over time is not easy . We have a long-term cooperation between several agencies where we work at schools and youth groups in these neighborhoods , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\n**Build more housing and focuses on children** \\n\\nKommunalr\u00e5d for Social Affairs in Gothenburg , Marina Johansson ( Social Democrats ) , says that they have taught 3,000 people to pick up signs of radicalization among young people . When they see these signs , contact the parents and school . \\n\\n\ '' But there is much that has gone wrong in these residential areas , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\nNew migrants are now located in other districts , and new housing will alleviate overcrowding . \\n\\n\ '' Moreover , we will initiate long-term measures within the living conditions and health to reduce social inequalities between districts . With a long-term effort can we stop segregation and create good conditions for the children , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\n**Fears for kids** \\n\\nDistrict Bergsj\u00f6n was planned for industrial workers at Volvo and SKF . Now Bergsj\u00f6n marked by drug and gang crime , and two years ago was one of the first foreign fighters from district killed in Syria . \\n\\nSomali coach Jama Abdisataar ( 41 ) has lived in Bergsj\u00f6n for several years . He has four children , and also has two asylum seekers on 16 and 17 living with them . Now he\\ 's upset for the young . \\n\\n\ '' Some people hang around the mosques , and we know that recruitment takes place . It is bad that they leave people who have fled the war into new violence , \ '' says Abdisataar who himself says he hates Islamists Al Shabaab . \\n\\nHe likes it in town , but it seems there is little evidence of Sweden . \\n\\n\ '' Swedes move . I do not know why , \ '' he smiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Germanic,Swedish

AFAIAA,europe,"& gt ; Compared to the U.S. , countries in Europe are extremely homogeneous . Being a Swede with blond hair and blue eyes that speaks a certain dialect vs. a brown hair , green eyed Swede speaking a different dialect isn\\'t exactly diversity . Definitely not the same as an Guatemalan-American and Vietnamese-American.\\n\\nLet\\ 's look at this comparison . The Guatemalan-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans have been in the US for what , a few decades . Well , then we\\ 'll look at a Chilean-Swede and a Chinese-Swede who\\ 've been here for a few decades . \\n\\nNotably , Sweden\\ 's foreign-born population ( 16.5 % ) [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) is large than the US\\ 's foreign-born population [ ( 14.3 % ) ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) . \\n\\nSweden is a bigger immigrant country than the United States and has been this way for years . In 2014 , 21.5 % of Sweden\\ 's population was either born abroad or had both parents born abroad . [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) \\n\\n & gt ; What I mean is that unless an immigrant strips themselves of all heritage , they will not fit in to most European countries . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not true . Europe is very diverse and these issues will depend , to begin with , on where you are in Europe . Second , you have to define \ '' fit in\ '' to get anywhere with this.\\n\\n & gt ; Your statement even highlights it . You are taking a group that has a ton of commonalities and separating them into different groups based on minor language differences . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not the case . The differences are much more than linguistic and go right into hundreds of years of traditional , religion and even where they live and what they surivive on . It\\ 's like speaking of the Amish or Texas Germans to some extent ( though a deceptive comparison ) in that these two groups are also American . \\n\\n & gt ; Any time a distinction like that HAS to be made shows how closely one holds on to even a regional identity and will alienate those not sharing that identity . \\n\\nYes , but your are missing this : that identity can still be included in the conservative national identity , just like variations within nation states elsewhere .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"Yeah , foreign aid workers . In any case , that was not the effect of your argument , so you\\ 're being dishonest .

It is accurate that it is recommended by certain style guides used in the UK . However , English has many different styles guides where rules on hyphenation differ based on a ) country/reigion , b ) field of discourse , c ) publication/in-house editing , d ) hyphenation in many cases being left to the writer\\ 's judgment and so on .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"I did not write that the euro destabilized the economy of Sweden , I wrote \ '' create a destructive economic unit to destabilise national economies\ '' . The EU has , for instance , ruined Greece , which I mentioned . Largely this was facilitated by a system in which monetary policy is controlled by unaccountable bureaucrats at the European Central Bank . After the 2008 Financial Crisis a series of enoromous transfers of wealth from taxpayers to financial institutions took place , but they were not enough to stabilise the system because the fundamental structures surrounding the euro aren\\'t capable of doing that . The EU needs to either completely restructure its financial institutions or put checks and balances in place to prevent destroying the very economic zone it hopes to create . But there\\ 's hope there , the EU is so undemocratic and poorly structured it is currently destroying itself from within . \\n\\nConcerning Sweden , the EU constitutes a big economic investment with a relatively small economic return . Its policies towards Greece have directly affected Swedish banking , industry and stock markets . It has paralysed Swedish agriculture and it has given Sweden a large population of unemployable , antisocial Romani . Due to its own idiocy and the influence of its overlords in the EU , Sweden has been hugely affected by the migrant crisis , which is crippling the country\\ 's police force and social services , among other state functions . Swedish export and employment have been affected by the EU\\ 's monetary policies and so on . \\n\\nThe majority of laws and regulations that decide over Sweden today come from the EU : Sweden pays a fee every year to let the EU decide more and more over Sweden , which has undermined Swedish representative democracy . The EU inefficiently places decision-making powers at a supranational level when these same powers can and have long been efficiently carried out at national level . The EU is thus not only undemocratic but also inefficient . This supranational structure in itself entails that power is moved further and further away from Swedish voters and that the EU does not have Sweden\\ 's best interests in mind . As mentioned above , economic sovereignty has been profoundly undermined by the EU , which in turn means that local economies and socio-economic policies increasingly fall into the hands of supranational EU bureaucrats who do not have a particular nation state\\ 's best in mind .",Germanic,Swedish

What\\ 's relevant in this case is how that thing functions . The Third Reich was democratically elected , but according to your reasoning , it is incorrect to call the Third Reich\\ 's Reichstag undemocratic.\\n\\nRegarding EU\\ 's so-called democracy , there are problems with things like accountability , representation and legitimacy . The problems include low trust in the EU , low voter turnouts in EU elections , and national elections for EU seats that focus on national issues when the EU is a supranational organisation . There are no EU-wide parties and there are no actual EU elections . National issues voted on that get national politicans voted into the EU only have indirect influence on actual EU-level issues .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"This one is quite recent ( 1981 ) , but is interesting , and could have led to a war with the Soviet Union.\\n\\nI\\ 'm talking about [ Whiskey on the rocks ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363 ) .\\n\\nOne late Tuesday evening in October of 1981 a Soviet submarine , armed with nuclear wapons , went aground in the archipelago near Karlskrona naval base . The submarine was discovered by two local fishermen in the morning after . \\n\\nThey contacted the Swedish navy , which didn\\'t believe the reports , but went to investigate anyway . The patrol ship *HMS Smyge* was first to arrive and laid anchor next to the submarine . The commander of HMS Smyge climbed aboard the submarine and managed to make contact with the commander ( they had to communicate in german ) . \\n\\nAccording to the Soviet commander the navigation equipment on board was \ '' Kaputt\ '' and that Soviet tugs would come and pull it afloat . However , the swedes naturally said \ '' no way\ '' , the ball was rolling.\\n\\nTwo recon fighters from Sweden did indeed spot Soviet ships on their way to the stricken sub . Among the ships were modern frigates . Later that evening the Soviets asked for permission to send four ships to rescue the sub , again the swedes said \ '' Nope\ '' .\\n\\nThe Swedish prime minister told the Swedish command to keep te Soviets away with what they got . The problem was that at the time they really didn\\'t have that much in that specific area . The coastal battery , which was the main defence weapon was missing its fire control system due to maintenance ! Luckily they did manage to get a new fire control system , one which was very modern and mobile , in place by the evening . \\n\\nThe personell at the battery followed the Soviet ships advance towards the border . \ '' *1000 meters , three minutes ! *\ '' Was called out and the mood was tense in the control room.\\n\\nThe next call out was \ '' *700 meters , two minutes ! \ '' , and at about that time the Major in charge thought \ '' *We are probably at war now*\ '' . The decision was made to put the battery into war-mode , which included changing the radio operations into frequency-hopping , a feature that at the time wasn\\'t allowed to be used in peacetime in Sweden . \\n\\nWithin a minute after that the Soviet ships had stopped , just outside the border . Apparently they sent out a transmission saying that something wasn\\'t right and that they were waiting for new orders . \\n\\nThe Soviets did try to make a dash with a tug the day after , but it was stopped by the Swedish sub *HMS Neptun* . Swedish *J\u00e4gare* , basically Swedish commandos/rangers , were guarding the sub at all times as well . They also had the commander , who liked to stand on the tower of the sub , in a sniper sight at all times . If anything were to happen they would board the ship.\\n\\nMore Soviet ships were arriving at the border , and they planned to take the sub by force at 03.00 the next night . However the attack was called off at 02.30 the same night . The reason is supposed to be that Sweden has had the time to mobilize a much larger force at the site at that time . \\n\\nIn the end Swedish tugs got the Soviet sub afloat again and it was escorted to the border.\\n\\nWiki article : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363\\n\\nA short film made by the Swedish Military shows how it looked at the site : https : //vimeo.com/11072021",Germanic,Swedish

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"& gt ; Certain countries have \u201cunwritten constitutions , \u201d a group of separate documents which , taken together , functions as a whole . Ours is simply a single document for all fundamental laws.\\n\\nMainly the UK in the first case . \\n\\nI can only do a comparison to the Swedish constitution since I\\ 'm fairly familiar to that one . We have four fundamental laws , but the definition of the word \ '' law\ '' is a bit different . I get the feeling n the internet a \ '' law\ '' is mostly referring to an \ '' article\ '' . The most important fundamental law is the instrument of government , and that\\ 's the one I will refer to from this moment on.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know . You said your newest constitution was put in place to avoid amending an older one , and it\\ 's just a comparison.\\n\\nIn that case I wasn\\'t clear enough . The main reason was that a big part of it had fallen into obsolescence . Therefore it was rewritten from the ground up . A big change was the move from a two chamber parliament to a unichamber . \\n\\nIt has then been amended many times , latest in 2014 . In order to amend it you need a simple majority , but two times and have a general election in between.\\n\\n & gt ; In any case , I still don\\'t see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution.\\n\\nWriting a new constitution doesn\\'t have to mean that you do away with everything old . Sure , you can amend it but there are some pretty troublesome parts in your constitution , such as the electoral college.\\n\\n & gt ; Is that not similar to your country\\ 's highest courts ? \\n\\nActually , no . But I know that we\\ 're the odd ones here . Courts ( any court ) can test if the application of a law is in accordance of the fundamental law in each specific case . But they can not dismiss a law as \ '' unconstitutional\ '' . Before a law comes into effect it passes through the \ '' council on legislation\ '' which may point to problems with the laws . The government is being watched by the \ '' Committee on the Constitution\ '' . But as I said , we\\ 're pretty odd in that . \\n\\nThe point I was trying to make was that instead of interoperating old laws it might be better to rewrite them so they make sense . \\n\\n & gt ; I did say that . The Bill of Rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default.\\n\\nHmm , the only thing which remotely resembles that is [ allemansr\u00e4tten ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam ) , which isn\\'t defined what it includes or not . But it is granted by the constitution by the 2nd chapter , 15th article , 4th paragraph : \\n\\n\ '' Everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public\\naccess , notwithstanding the above provisions.\ '' \\n\\nBut then again , doesn\\'t that make it the other way around ?

There is also a big part on alcohol , what impacts it has on you and others in both short and long-terms . You can get imprisoned from as low as 0.02 % BAC in Sweden.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou also have to take a practical test where you drive slalom , test braking and do evasive manoeuvres on slippery surfaces . These tests are done both with and without stability control systems and ABS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe actual test is in two parts , first a theoretical test about traffic rules and risks .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"About Swedish healthcare.\\nSweden is divided into 20 countys , and it\\ 's the county that\\ 's responsible for healthcare and the insurance of its inhabitants . This means that there are some variations throughout the country . But generally speaking a visit to the ER will cost you about 100 SEK . When you reach 1100 SEK over a 12-month period you don\\'t have to pay the fees for the reminder . The same is also true if you reach 2200 SEK for prescription drugs.\\nThere is also a lot of private health care in Sweden . However most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . Meaning it\\ 's funded through the countys and you don\\'t pay anything extra just because it\\ 's private . Also , according to law you have the right to choose your \ '' home clinic\ '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here.\\nThere exists some private healthcare that isn\\'t funded by the countys as well . And because of that there also exists private health insurance . These cost between 90 and 450 SEK/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what\\ 's included.\\n\\nNow , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc . I for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually I can go there the next day . At the ER it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . But yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times.\\n\\nI have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . Also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the National Board of Health and Welfare.\\n\\nAnd lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . You can also access it on the web att [ 1177.se ] ( http : //www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time..",Germanic,Swedish
Abrovinch,AskEurope,"There are several ways to go from the *gymnasium* to university . \\n\\nThe simplest way is to have done the courses required with grades decent enough to be accepted to the university programme ( and university ) you want to attend . What decent grades are is decided by the amount of applications each year . \\n\\nIf you have done the required courses , but your grades aren\\'t good enough you can do *h\u00f6gskoleprovet* - \ '' Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test\ '' , which is a test with questions from varying subjects . You get graded from 0 up to 2.0 . The test result is valid up to 5 years , and you can do the test how many times you like .

Generally houses in the Nordics are bigger than in the rest of Europe , which makes sense as land isn\\'t an issue here . \\n\\nThe other half lives in apartments . Mostly by themselves or just two . Sweden has the largest amount of single person households in Europe . When you start a family you generally move to your own house.\\n\\nAverage wage is 32.000 SEK /month ( $ 3470 ) , on which you pay ( on average ) about 24,3 % income tax before deductions . Income tax levels are highly progressive so a wage of 30.000 SEK equals 23,8 % tax and 34.000 equals 24,8 % . One interesting thing is that Sweden ( together with the other Nordic countries ) lacks a minimum wage . Wages are individual but the base levels are set by collective bargaining . But in theory you can pay as little as you want , in practise this is of course totally impossible . Unions are super strong here ( but they generally work with , not against , the employer ) \\n\\nPublic services available include ( but are not limited to ) practically \ '' free\ '' healthcare , subsidized dental care , 100 % tuition free education including university , 480 days parental leave ( to split between both parents ) , sick leave , allowances for children and if you are studying etc . etc.\\n\\nAnnual leave is at least 25 days , and popular vacation destinations include the Mediterranean and Thailand.\\n\\nMost families own a car , some two . Station wagons are by afar the most popular type of car , preferably a [ Volvo ] ( http : //cdn1.mestmotor.se/YTo2OntzOjI6ImlkIjtpOjEyMzc0MzE7czoxOiJ3IjtpOjI0MDA7czoxOiJoIjtpOjE2MDA7czoxOiJjIjtpOjA7czoxOiJzIjtpOjA7czoxOiJrIjtzOjQwOiJkY2Y1YmFkNTc5ODAxYzU3MjZiYjliMzUwM2QxMmVlMWI0M2I3ODljIjt9 ) .\\n\\nHunting , fishing , camping , skiing etc . are all very popular activities to take part in during free time .",Germanic,Swedish
