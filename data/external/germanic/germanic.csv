The extreme left btw not so much - that\\ 's the reason why Nicaragua didn\\'t accept the deal - it didn\\'t go far enough for them . \\n\\n\\nIt\\ 's just the far right nationalists under trump ( and Everyhwere else too ) who don\\'t agree - but that\\ 's the problem - Nationalists will never say a multi national deal is a good deal - since it\\ 's diametral to their agenda of \ '' xyz first\ '' - the idea of a greater good between nations just doesn\\'t exist in their vocabulary . \\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,So you want results that are worth it ? Like a total reduction in climate change ? Not a rise in average temperature at all but a decline.\\n\\nSee basically no problem . It just won\\'t work - cause for this to happen the carbon emissions would have to sink even more then planned in the Paris accord . \\n\\nEspecially by developing nations - basically meaning that they would either need to forgo development of their nations and revert to being even poorer then now - or an even bigger financial burden on the guys with money ( so us ) to help them meet their energy needs without carbon emitting fuels . \\n\\nPlus - at the same time the developed world would need to cut back even more radical - and that\\ 's not a question of \ '' we need to bring more electric cars on the street and shut down coal\ '' - then the goal would be - no cars other the electric and shut down gas too.\\n\\nThis deal is the best that is available at the moment - and it actually got possible cause green energy generations is making huge steps forward especially in developing nations - a reduction would need even more and actually brutal policies - which no nation would go for . \\n\\nSo yeah - the stabilization of global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels is a huge thing -\\nJust to compare - if nothing is done it will ( depending on the model ) raise by 4.5-5C in 2100 - and if you belive that we have mass migration now - wait till 1/4-1/3 of Asia is uninhabitable and the Sahara stretches to the Congo .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Russia gets this \ '' bonus\ '' cause it closed\\nPretty much all it\\ 's dirty industry after the fall\\nOf communism.\\n\\nChina and India get their bonus cause otherwise they would not be on board at all - but they are actually doing something - India has shelved its plans for more coal power plants and china has done the same and will in fact close down several beginning this year.\\n\\nWhich leaves the biggest point why one is against it the redestribution of wealth - that\\ 's the real reason why you don\\'t like it right ? Why should we give any of our hard earned cash to those people . \\n\\nWell the reason is very simple - take hurricane season - I think there is no doubt that global warming influences the strength of hurricane which hit the US every year - and\\nThey are getting stronger and the season is getting longer . \\nKatrina cost 150 billion $ - not including 120 billion federal aid\\n\\nOne hit like Katrina costs the US economy more then all the transfers that happen In the Paris accord over the next decades . \\n\\nAnd those will get more and more common . \\n\\nSame with rising sea levels - at the moment it\\ 's just a problem for Nauru - but soon it will become a problem for cities like Miami and states like Florida - which will need to invest billions into flood protection . \\n\\nAnd then we have displaced persons - large parts of Mexico will become uninhabitable for humans due to the increase of arid climate conditions - same with conditions in the Sahel zone in Africa and large parts of Central Asia . \\n\\nAll this will lead to mass migration which we haven\\'t seen since the fall of the Roman Empire . \\n\\nAnd all this will be way more expansive then transferring a bit of wealth now.\\n\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,The idea is to stop global warming at 2C compared to pre industrial levels - which is doable and will hold the worst symptoms at a manageable level . \\n\\nSure if you want to reverse the warming which has already happend - then it would mean investing more money and even harsher rules for carbon emissions in developed countries - but it would also mean telling 6 billion people \ '' sorry guys can\\'t have what we have - for at least 50\\nMore years\ '' \\n\\nSo yeah while the accord is not perfect - it\\ 's a step in the right direction - especially since most countries are going along with it . \\n\\nAnd sorry - just saying \ '' it\\ 's not good enough that\\ 's why we can\\'t accept it\ '' is a bad argument - cause it means that nothing will happen which will make it even worse in the long run . \\n\\nThis is the best option at the moment - finely balanced between the developed nations need and want to stop global warming for the reasons I said - and the developing worlds need for energy and well - development . \\n\\nI don\\'t know if you have ever been to china -\\nBut if you ever go - take a train and look out of the window at night - whole villages in darkness with just one or two light bulbs here and there . A stark contrast to shanghai or Guangzhou . \\n\\nSo the want they have a \ '' modern\ '' live to is hard to limit - and china tried the would have the next revolution at hand . Something we all don\\'t want for various reasons . Same\\nIn India . \\n\\nAnd thats why a certain leeway in their goals was searched for and found . \\n\\nIt\\ 's not perfect - but it can acchieve the set goal -,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,No what is the deal ? \\n\\nI mean the real goal of trump - what does he want - not a general guide to negotiations - what does he want / or what shall be written in a new agreement ? \\n\\nA general guide to negotiations is pretty useless - I want an idea what he / you want in the new deal - \\n\\nLet me guess - not much is coming ? Cause you have no idea besides \ '' a more fair one\ '' - so what is a fair deal ? How much does the US have to cut their emissions ? How much does china have to ? Who pays for clean energy incentives in developing countries ? \\n\\nPlease - just general outlines - and not \ '' read up how to make a deal\ '' - cause that is pretty useless in this discussion .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"I actually read it.\\n\\nBut there is nothing substantial - noting that says \ '' this is our plan\ '' - except that it will be fair and if it doesn\\'t work then to hell with it.\\n\\nI mean I am used to it from trump - but well - I expected more - I expected at least a goal - a post that says \ '' this is what we want instead\ '' but all\\nHe says is \ '' we want a better deal , and if we don\\'t get it we will continue as before and endanger ourselves cause we can\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's a bit childish . But ok.\\n\\nIt\\ 's grandstanding and blustering with no substance behind .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,"Look I have closed contracts / deals . It\\ 's part of my job . \\n\\nAnd if it was just a Buisness deal I would agree - it\\ 's like 101y\\n\\nBut this is not a Buisness deal - he has to come out and give some idea what he wants - cause if he just says \ '' hey we want a fair deal\ '' everybody else will say \ '' well this is a fair deal\ '' and this is not some negotiation about some property on the upper east side.\\n\\nThese are negotiations with nearly 200 countries - all with their own interests and agendas - so just saying \ '' we want a fair deal\ '' won\\'t cut it - he has to have some ideas what he wants , lay out plans , set agendas - in short be constructive - but from what I have seen the last 5 months he can\\'t do\\nThat - all he can do is deconstruct and dismantle . \\n\\nI am not even sure if he grasp that this isn\\'t a 0 - sum problem - this is not a about \ '' I give you , you have more , I have less\ '' this is about creating something for the greater good which in the end will benefit everyone - and especially so the US and developed nations cause our wealth is incredibly endangered by global warming even if we don\\'t see it . \\n\\nAt the moment we can buy our way out and maybe enjoy longer summers - but this will end pretty soon for reasons I have mentioned above ( or maybe elsewhere - not sure about my comment trail ) \\n\\nAnyways - he won\\'t come forward with anything substantial - cause the moment he does he would have to leave his zero sum logic behind - and that\\ 's something I am not sure he can . \\n",Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're not taking into account most trade wars are tit-for-tat . \\n\\ni know - but the 6 % in trade that will partly be lost ( not totally just partly ) will not hurt the EU in total . Switzerland is bound to loose more and sooner or later its population will accept that . might be later though . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm not Swiss , but that is just plain wrong \\n\\nNo actually i am right . Lets just look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss \\n\\nTrue - and as soon as they start the feel that their products \ '' Made in CH\ '' are less cost competitive ( due to renewed certification for example needed to sell in the EU ) they will ramp up their production in the EU plants and cool down production in their swiss plants . Those are multinationals . They are not bound by borders where they produce and in large parts the infrastructure is already in place . \\n\\n & gt ; Nestle \\n\\nThe same in food . Of the 340.000 employees of Nestle 8900 work in Switzerland . Nearly half of those 9000 work in the HQ and research divisions in Switzerland . So if it gets harder to sell Swiss made Nesquik in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg - they will simply ship french made there . The bottom line wont be touched . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R & amp ; D as Germany , so there are a lot of research based companies there as well \\n\\nAbsolutley true . But if you look at the why that is - you will find that CH profited extremly from several EU programs which they were part of so far . Programs in which swiss participation or the negotiation about that have already been shelved as a result of this vote . If it stays like that expect this ratio to go down south pretty fast . \\n\\n & gt ; but Switzerland does produce things.\\n\\nnever said that they dont . \\n\\nI said that a lot of the stuff they do produce is mass produced and can be produced in the EU as well . Nobody is doing it now since the swiss have the market cornered . But if they cant offer their services to a competitive price anymore - well lets just say that new options arise .",Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,& gt ; Do you expect me to have a full list of Swiss products ? \\n\\nno that would be ridiculous . But lets have a look at the examples you gave . \\n\\n & gt ; Switzerland is leading in tunnel construction\\n\\nNot so much . Switzerland does built a lot of Tunnels . True . The companies that built them are not only swiss though . For example the Gotthard Base Tunnel is built by a consortium of 3 non swiss and 2 swiss companies . \\n\\n & gt ; exports specialties such as chocolate and cheese\\n\\nso does belgium . Plus chocolate exports are 650 Mio . \u20ac out of 90 Billions . Doesnt really count much . And chocolate is not really hard to produce . The last major technological advancement ( and the reason for swiss dominance in this field for a long time ) was the conche - but it was invented / discovered more then 100 years ago . \\n\\nAgricultural goods actually account for 1.5 % of the exports to the EU from Switzerland . \\n\\nAnd belive me - if Lindt looses buisness from this - they will start the produce \ '' as good as swiss chocolate\ '' in the EU . \\n\\n & gt ; is an important manufacturer of medical products and chemicals\\n\\nabsolutely no doubt about that . But chemicals can be produced anywhere in the EU . and when it comes to pharmaceuticals - If the guillotine clause is invoked they have to be recertified in the EU - a long and expansive endeavour . So why should Roche and all the others not just produce in the EU and get rid of that pesky little problem . \\n\\n & gt ; their research and development in all kinds of areas is outstanding.\\n\\ntrue - but as we speak here it seems that the EU already has stopped negotiation for the horizon program with Switzerland . a program ( which if as successful as its predecessor ) would bring nearly 2.5x the amount of money to swiss universities and research institutions as the swiss paid into the pot.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's pretty sweeping and simplified remark to say that we can simply copy these products and do without their R & amp ; D. This will also be painful for the EU.\\n\\nWe dont have to copy . The products already exist . What will be painful ( for some maybe ) is a bit less competition . But thats it . And when it comes to R & amp ; D ? The swiss research facilities are good - no question . But the money that fed them so far stays and will just be redistributed to other institutes within the EU . I wouldnt worry so much about that .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Please give me a list . \\n\\nOr just some examples . Of goods that are or can only be produced in Switzerland . No doubt that they exist . But they are only a tiny fraction of the 90 billion \u20ac export volume Switzerland has to the EU at the moment . \\n\\nBut lets have a look at what is the main mass of export goods from CH to the EU . \\n\\nMore then 50 % of the export goods fall into this categories : \\n\\nChemicals and related products - & gt ; so chemicals produced in large quanties and pharmaceutical products ( which can be produced anywhere in the world and which will have the additional hurdle of EU recertification if it comes to the worst ) \\n\\nManufactured goods classified chiefly by material - & gt ; which encompasses everything from simple plastics to High Technology goods . There is also office / telecom equipment in this category . While i guess that there will be some companies that produce unique goods in this category most of it can and is produced by other companies in the EU already . \\n\\nMachinery and transport equipment : Same as above . There might be some swiss companies that produce very specialised goods in this category . But most of it will be run of the mill more or less standard goods that can be bought from numerous sources in the EU . \\n\\nSwitzerland and swiss goods are not unique . ( well most are not ) and thus can be replaced . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Oh yeah . Absolutely . I am just saying that this could prove to be the classic example of why the will of the majority is not always the most beneficial way to follow . Depends on the EU reaction . \\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Not really : \\n\\nAs i stated above : \\n\\nActually they are the 4th largest ( 6.6 % of the trade ) \\n\\nWith an import volume of 121 Billion \u20ac and an export volumen of 90 Billion \u20ac.\\n\\nBut see - This doesnt matter so much . Since the import volume wont shrink - they still need the stuff we produce and at the moment they cant get it cheaper form a third source cause if they could they would buy it there.\\n\\nBut the export volume will shrink once the free market clauses get axed . \\n\\nIt will simply make buying stuff made in Switzerland more expansive then buying the same stuff from within the EU Market.\\nAnd they are not producing anything ( besides watches maybe ) that cant be produced at similar costs in the EU or worldwide.\\n\\n,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,Thats fine . But i think that treaties are there to be kept - and as such the guillotine clause should be invoked by the EU . \\n\\nThey can have their opinion - no problem . But they have to live with the consequences .,Germanic,German

Aberfrog,europe,I wouldn\\'t say thought in school or that it is something that comes up in a conversation . For me it always seemed as if all girls know that there is a plan B that is an option - more so then in Austria for example where people often \ '' go on holidays\ '' to have an abortion - in the small village of my granny \ '' she went on a weekend trip to Vienna\ '' sometimes was really known to be code for \ '' getting an aboftion\ '',Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,There is a difference between \ '' not talking about it\ '' and \ '' if I do it I will go to hell\ '' - for example it is still hard for people in western Austria to find doctors who will perform aboftions - those people generally had to travel to Vienna until a few years ago . \\n\\nThis was as far as I know never a problem in the Eastern European states .,Germanic,German
Aberfrog,europe,It\\ 's a bit of carelessness cause you have the option abortion on the table and not just as a sort of last resort . \\n\\nMy ex was Romanian and although she was a very responsible girl wen it came to sex and contraceptives this carefulness was gone . It came to weird situations were she basically said \ '' lets fuck\ '' and I said \ '' we can\\'t cause no condoms\ '' and she responded with \ '' no worries abortions are cheap\ '' - well not word for word - but that\\ 's the mindset . \\n\\nIt\\ 's just a totally different view on the whole abortion debate that is going on there . Except of Poland - but that is a very special case on itself .,Germanic,German

There is no other option . \\n\\nItalians produced about [ 500 kg of trash per year / person ] ( http : //www.nationmaster.com/country/it-italy/env-environment ) in 2000 ( i doubt it got significantly less ) . So even if we apply the 85 % top rate that leaves 75 kg . of trash per person per year ( in reality as shown above its about 300 kg ) . Which means that a city like Parma would still produce 14.000 tons of trash per year which is not going to be recycled . ( In reality its more like 56.000 tons ) \\n\\nSo question : Where do you put that . \\n\\nAnd if you say \ '' Well we simply have to recycel 100 % - Sure i agree . But its not gon na happen soon .

Autogegner,europe,"Had there not been the immigration of 2015 , Hofer would not have gotten that far . The problem has reached a size , where public security can not be guaranteed any more in certain areas of the major towns , i.e . near the main station in Innsbruck . Noone wanted to allow nearly unlimmited immigration and there is zero understanding for paying immigrants who had gone through the asylum procedure as much as someone who is unemployed or more than conscripts in the army or the civil service and most students have.\\n\\nIf we would not have had the problem of too much immigration , the FP\u00d6 would not have gotten into that position .

Autogegner,europe,"The FP\u00d6 in its current form results mostly from J\u00f6rg Haider , who had studied the american far-right , i.e . Newt Gingrich in order to copy their platforms . Haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring .

Autogegner,europe,"Van der Bellen is clearly the better choice . In order to explain , i copy a previous comment of mine : \\n\\nHofer ( the right wing candidate ) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . Never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that Hofer and his supporters have shown . They had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . At first , they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia . In the later phase of the campaign , they started calling VdB a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia ) and a neoliberal.\\n\\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . In an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel . The TV station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed . He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . He was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . A few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . When beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\\n\\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \ '' lies\ '' when VdB started citing him . There is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking Austria as a hostage with him.\\n\\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is , that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia . Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria . Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago .",Germanic,German

Autogegner,europe,"& gt ; As for his motivation , Assad has a long and well documented history of using fear to control the population.\\n\\nThe government does not require any other fear than that of the rebells winning . Assad still has widespread support . Despite predictions about a mass exodus from Aleppo in case of the expulsion of Al-Nusra , nothing like this happened . Before Aleppo was completely retaken , rumors of attrocities were spread in the media - 500.000 civilians were said to be starving , civilians were claimed to be murdered , so called \ '' activists\ '' were calling for a military intervention . Aleppo was retaken and none of these claims was ever attempted to be proven . The media and political instances have gone silent on Aleppo . I didn\\'t hear a single report about the per estimations 1 million people fleeing from the rebell-controlled parts of Aleppo , when it was still safely held by the so called Opposition . At no point did the media or the political decission makers complain about people having to flee from rebell-controlled areas , rebells calling for genocides against non-Sunnites . Before the insurgency , Syria was a mostly functioning state where people of various ethnic background could coexist . Neither the EU , the US or any single EU state have ever voiced concern about the cleansing of rebell-held areas from non-Sunnites . The \ '' people are scared of the Assad-Regime\ '' narrative only works , if the character of the insurgents is overlooked : They are sunnite extremists whose mission is to terrorise anyone who does not belong to their own sect . For the same reason , the christian population in Iraq has nearly vanished and due to similar motivations , the Lebanese Civil War has lead to a shrinking of non-Sunnite demographics . \\n\\nAny reason that could be given as a motivation for the government to conduct such an attack could also be used if such an attack was conducted in a planned manner . Southwards of the village in question , Rebels tried to push into the city of Hama two weeks ago . Taking Homs would allow the Rebels to reconnect to their areas between Homs and Hama . If chemical warfare agents were deployed , it would make much more sense to do so in an area where they would be of use and allow ground troops to take areas cleared of enemies . The insurgents on the other hand have much more reason to release toxic gas in an area held by them . For months , they have been asking for military action of western troops against the government . This time , they finally got it . However , it\\ 's not been the first time , The US supplied anti vehicle missiles to what they called the \ '' Free Syrian Army\ '' and an air raid conducted by american aircraft against the government held town of Deir-Ez-Zor that allowed Daesh to advance only happend a few months ago .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"A Financial Transaction Tax does not need to be very large to be effective . It simply needs to be large enough dissuade trading for gambling\u2019s sake but not so large it dissuades socially necessary business.\\nNaturally , it\u2019s more effective to implement A Financial Transaction Tax in a way that it is harmonized across many markets . However , it is possible to implement an excise tax on firms who do business in the economic area the FTT is operating in but do a majority of the speculative trading in a market with fewer regulations . Additionally the effected markets can use the revenues of the excise tax to lower corporate tax such that the overall policy is revenue neutral . In this way the vast majority of businesses will see no substantial advantage of fleeing the regulated market for a much more volatile unregulated one . Though clearly some firms will increase their trading in such markets.\\n\\nIf the entire EU was to adopt a skillful FTT , the effect would be to shunt the most dangerous , volatile transactions towards other markets . Some the smaller markets in South America and East Asia are already intolerably volatile , so the most logical step for them when faced with incoming highly volatile speculators is to investigate harmonizing their regulations with more stable markets , which in turn makes the FTT more effective and benefits all of us.\\n\\nNaturally there will always be markets who shun regulations in a bid to attract trading away from Europe . Naturally there will always be firms who desire to speculate in frequent high frequency trading . But this is no reason to prevent the EU from implementing a FTT ( but it is a reason to put effort into making sure it is well designed and optimized ) .\\n\\nAs far as Sweden goes , my understanding of Sweden\u2019s dealing with the last financial crisis is that while they were severely effected , they were less severely effected that less regulated markets . Furthermore their response was more effective , created a softer landing , and a broader base for recovery than these less regulated markets . Perhaps it\u2019s not perfect to be out front with a FTT . And perhaps the initial implementation in Sweden was not perfect . But it\u2019s clear to me that if the rest of Europe had pursued roughly similar policies around and following the collapse , the current debt crisis would be less severe and less urgent than it is today . Perhaps , given the strong need for reform in the PIIGS , that\u2019s not an unqualified good thing\u2026 but that\u2019s another discussion.\\n\\nAnd yes , there were quite a few countries making money hand over fist just prior to collapse but it hardly does us any good if it starts a conflagration like what we experienced and most of that money vaporizes in a flash.\\n\\nlastly I want to emphasize that I am not advocating for a punitive tax .

Nor am I an expert in Austrian politics ... I\u2019m just an American expat living here . However , my understanding of the Austrian politicians stance on FTT is that it is based more on their ideological beliefs and how corrupt they are than it does from a sort of technocratic assessment of facts and metrics . The prominent exception are Maria Fekter & amp ; Andreas Schieder but I have the impression that the media has concluded that both are \u2018too boring\u2019 to be allowed to go on at length least they actually explain something important using long words which many people don\u2019t understand.\\n\\nAbout the exposure of Austrian banks to risky loans in Eastern Europe : A FTT does not directly effect the ability or likelihood that private financial institutions will engage in stupid and risky transactions and I have not heard a serious proposal from any competent person which would . However , one thing is certain : There isn\u2019t anything about the markets right now that is all that different than summer of 2008 , there is no technical reason that similarly unpleasant circumstance might come together now as they did then and cause similar catastrophic events . More importantly neither Germany or Austria has the resources today to deal with such a hypothetical event as they did in the end of 2008 to 2009 . This emphasizes the need in some folks minds to gather those resources . However , some politicians have a sort of ideological / religious stance : No new , more , or different taxes . No agreeing with anything having to do with the EU . No taxing people who have enough money to bribe me . No management or \u201cinterference\u201d in the markets . Then conversely \u201cNo taxing the poor\u201d \u201cTax the bastards that caused all this mess to begin with\u201d , etc ... \\n\\nHaving said all of that , from a technical point of view a FTT does not need to be a large tax , it needs to be a broad tax . Nor does it necessarily mean that the government must earn more in tax revenue . A skillful FTT could leave the government with as much taxes coming in as it had before ( or not ) . Therefore the questions \u201cShould we implement a Financial Transaction Tax\u201d and \u201cShould the government increase taxation\u201d are two separate questions.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that we should prefer taxation on things that have complicated negative impacts which are not borne by the parties in the transaction ( Negative Externalities ) like pollution , health risks , carbon , consumption ( VAT ) or ultra-high-speed trading than real income ( this means things like wages for real work and things like profit from selling goods ) . I also think that governments around the world are facing the absolute need to reduce their public debt and that means both reducing spending and increasing the taxes coming in . It would also help if the U.S. would refrain from invading and occupying any more nations ... but here in Europe the military spending issue is different and more complicated .",Germanic,German

Bhima,europe,"Well , currently there is no \ '' EU B\u00f6rse\ '' there are only national ones , like the ones in London or Frankfurt and there is no \ '' EU tax collector\ '' or \ '' EU taxation\ '' .

( I just described my bank , Bank Austria which is owned by UniCredit SpA ) .\\n\\nAlso while the US is a transfer union ( States pay in to the Federal Government more or less than they receive from the Federal Government ) the EU is not . So not only does the mechanism for collecting a broad , EU wide tax , and then redistributing back to member nations not exist , the idea does not already exist either . However , EU governance does cost money to run and currently there are bidirectional payments going on in this regard ... so it\\ 's not a completely novel setup.\\n\\nHaving said all of that , in broad strokes a skillful FTT would be collected EU wide ( this probably means harmonized national FFT tax rates collected by member nations ) with some sort of offset ( which is probably a harmonized lowering of business income tax levied by member states ) . So the need for everything to be equal to prevent market distortion would be covered by harmonized tax rates and local collection ( where in the US the Federal Government could just do all of this in Federal Tax law and it would apply to all the states equally without the need for specific treaties or agreements ) .\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you follow US politics or are interested in US governance but I think this issue highlights the difference in the structure of governance between the EU member states and the EU and the US states and the Federal Government ( which I find very interesting ) .

Pharmacies and notaries come to mind . Until the mid-80s , many industries were regulated in that way , including bookstores , grocery stores and taxis . This is called \ '' Gebietsschutz\ '' ( regional protection ) and if you wanted to open e.g . a bookstore , there was first a \ '' Bedarfspr\u00fcfung\ '' ( necessity check ) if another one was necessary in that particular area . If there was already a bookstore nearby and that store didn\\'t exceed a certain number of customers ( population density was also factored in AFAIK ) , you would not get a license to open a store there . \\n\\nI would imagine other countries had and have similar rules for certain industries . \\n",Germanic,German

Chefdiplomat,AskEurope,"It is funny how you talk about people supposedly being misinformed yet you spew almost nothing but nonsense and propaganda.\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is actually corrupt and working for Wall Street . Your comment is 1:1 the defense of the Clinton campaign and not even accurate as Bernie Sanders did bring up Wall Street reform as one issue where she was clearly influenced by Wall Street donations . By the way this is not even a new accusation just listen to what people of her own party had to say about this in the past : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=12mJ-U76nfg\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is using Colin Powell as an excuse . She set up her own E-Mail server , which is unprecetented . There is simply no comparable case.\\n\\n* The generals working with her have described her as extremely hawkish and as always going for the most hawkish option . She is a war criminal and also responsible for the war in Libya , which was based on nothing but lies . One of the lies she kept peddling about Libya , the lie about black mercenaries , actually led to black genocide in Libya , which was conducted by the people she was supporting there and she didn\\'t stop peddling that lie when she was informed about that fact as her E-Mails prove.\\n\\n* Trump also did not go bankrupt personally four of his over five hundred businesses did and they were put into bankrupcy for restructuring . This is not about incompetence but using thebankruptcy laws for personal gain . It might not be the right thing to do but it is quite common and says little about the competence of an individual.\\n\\n* Trump would not have more money if he would gave invested the money he has received from his father in an index fund anyone , who knows a little bit about finance knows this . This is a completely bogus claim that has been falsified many times . Here is a good breakdown on why this claim is nonsense : https : //www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-03/should-donald-trump-have-indexed- .\\n\\n* There are legitimate criticisms about Trump University but the accusations about the Trump Foundation are mostly without real substance if you look into them f.e they accuses him of donating 100000 $ to veterans through the foundation as part of a settlement when the settlement said that that was exactly what he was obliged to do . If you want to talk about Scams you should look at the Clintons , who by the way have not only used dubious schemes to make money themselves but also have supported scams . Also if you want to talk about morality you should talk about how Hillary Clinton fought hard to keep the minimum wage in Haiti below 0,61 $ , how she is a war criminal , hiw ger husban starved over 500k Iraqi children with sanctions etc..\\n\\n* It is hard to argue that Trump is a sexist for treating men the same as women . He has also more women working for him in senior positions than men and has been hiring women for executive positions when that was practically unheard of in the building industrie . \\n\\n* He has not credibly been charged with rape . His Ex-Wife accused him of rape when they were getting a divorce , which she later admitted was a bogus claim and there were a couple lawsuits in which he was accused of rape , which turned out to be fraudulent . If you want to talk about rape and abusive men you should talk Bill Cinton and Hillary Clinton , who has not only bashed people inclusing Monica Lewinsky for talking about Bill Clinton\\ 's abusive behavior and let\\ 's talk about Hillary Clinton accusing a twelve year old girl of lying while defending a pedophile , who has raped that girl : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? =1 & amp ; v=Tor00iWUhDQ.\\n\\n* There is no actual evidence that Trump is a racist and he is actually quite the contrary as he has supported Jessie Jackson , affirmative action , the Civil Rights Movement etc . in the past and has put people of minorities in charge of big projects for his company for decades . Meanwhile you got Clinton calling black youth \ '' Superpredators\ '' in the past , which is an actual racist statement . People claim that Trump is a racist based on a statement about illegal immigrants coming from Mexico , which is not a race and a lawsuit about a building project he wasn\\'t even directly in charge of.\\n\\nStop criticising other people about supposedly believing in propaganda when all you pretty much do as I said in the beginning is repeating propaganda and spin .

We speak Austrian German , which is one of the three Standard German language variaties and there are several dialects of Austrian German , which compared to each other are quite different in itself . The differences also depend on the region though as Bavarian German , which some also call Austro Bavarian is also different from the language the other parts of Germany speaks and more similar to some Austrian dialects but also Austrian German itself . Generally speaking if you compare the German that is spoken in Germany there are differences in the vocabulary , word and grammar usage as well as the pronunciation . Of course we usually understand each other as there are quite a ton of similarities but they are not as similar as it is sometimes portrait . I actually sent a Northern German something I had written and he understood most of the text but not all of it and said that I was missing words , that my word usage was way off and that the sentences partly made no sense when in fact all there was to it was just the difference between Austrian German and German Standard German .

Harris for example wrote a book about Islam while not even knowing the most basic teachings of Islam and he even thought that you get the death penalty according to Sharia for saying something that is actually Islamic doctrin . Fact of the matter is that by far the most people have died and suffered at the hands of atheist leaders wanting to erradicate all religions as they thought that their ideologie f.e Communism , National Socialism , other variations of Fascism or variations of Socialism are incompatible with any kind of religion and a religious society . In addition to that financial , territorial , geopolitical and political interests are the real reason for most if not all conflicts . These interests will most likely always be there hence there will always be conflicts regardless of religion or not . Judging by your profile you seem to know nothing about world affairs f.e you claim that ISIS attacks are not retaliations , which they are as the attackers and ISIS say themselves etc . and you seem to be an extreme left winger , who spews a lot of unverified drivel and ignores facts that you don\\'t like .

Critics described the measures as a \u201csticking plaster\u201d . \\n\\nAfter a fourth night of disorder at Calais , when the French authorities faced more than 1,000 attempts by migrants to reach the tunnel , striking French ferry workers added to the misery by burning tyres to block routes to the port . \\n\\nWith the average queueing time for lorry drivers on this side of the tunnel at 18 hours , and congestion on Kent\u2019s roads hitting local businesses and residents\u2019 daily lives , trucks will now be diverted onto Ministry of Defence land near Folkestone to keep the roads clear.\\n\\nMr Cameron called the situation \ '' unacceptable\ '' and said : *\ '' This is going to be a difficult issue right across the summer .

Mr Cameron was due to discuss the problem with the French president Francois Hollande on Friday night.\\n\\nThe migrants\u2019 desperation to get to Britain was typified by photographs of two men clinging to the top of a lorry coming out of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone . \\n\\nThe lorry belonged to the Belgian rental firm ATL , which said it had not been contacted by the British authorities or the rental driver , and did not even know about the incident until contacted by The Telegraph .

Arquinas,europe,"Well , really hard to think of many things . Most stereotypes are only half true.\\n\\nI guess I should say , \ '' lack of politeness\ '' . Finnish language has a different plural and singular form for \\'you\\ ' . Plural rarely gets used . And we don\\'t generally call anyone mr/mrs/miss ( Unless you\\ 're on super official business/dealing with high-value foreigners like hotel receptionist or your boss just suffers from some delusions ) For example , people working for the president probably call him Mr. President or some variant but if he\\ 's visiting or talking to random people they\\ 'll just probably call him by his nickname.\\n\\nMost people subconsciously use the plural form when talking to old people ( I do ) , but it\\ 's not necessary . Teachers are mostly referred by their first name or their occupation by slang unless your school is so big that referring them to by surname is easier.\\n\\nNow I might be talking out of my ass but this extends into work life too . Nobody really talks to their boss like a superior . They talk to their boss like he\\ 's just another dude working there.\\n\\nIf I\\ 'm travelling this is really the only rule I stick to . I don\\'t want to come off as rude to any foreigner but I think referring to other people consciously as sir or madam or plural you is humiliating.\\n\\n\\nThis really only came to my mind because someone once told me a story about a german CEO who was hired into a finnish company and was really confused at first because nobody referred to him like he expected to . Heard that he ended up loving the idea so much that he brought his family with him and stayed here .",Germanic,Finnish

0xKaishakunin,europe,"Different schools and degrees can be compared in a scientific way , that\\ 's what my research is about . \\n\\nHowever , this is a very complex task even without corruption and bribery . Different countries have different educational systems . Due to our strong TVET system in Germany only ca . 25 % of population hold an academic degree . The Universit\u00e4ten in Germany do scientific training , not vocational training . The Unis in Germany also have the same high standards of teaching and research , there are no Mickey-Mouse-Colleges and Ivy Leagues as in other countries . \\n\\nOther countries have a different approach eg . Spain and France relying heavily on universities for training with a more differentiated university system . \\n\\nSo comparing an engineering degree from a German Universit\u00e4t and a Spanish Uni is a task on it\\ 's own . Very complex . \\n\\n & gt ; the fact that Michalovce with population of 40 000 has 3 ( or more ... ) universities ( by that I mean few departments of them and you do \ '' long distance\ '' studying ) is ridiculous.\\n\\nDepends on what those Unis are doing .

So if you study Marketing at a German Universit\u00e4t , you will get a lot of theory , models and math . \\n\\nSince the 1970s we also have Fachhochschulen in Germany , former Engineering Schools . They also follow scientific principles , but teach a more practical approach .

Here , a few kilometers from Paris , I have found asylum in 1994 . My friend , Professor Abderrahmane Fardeheb , was assassinated on September 26 of that year in Oran in front of his daughter , whom he had accompanied to school , by Islamists . At that time I had decided to leave my country.\\n\\nIn Saint-Denis , this situated on the River Seine city of diversity , hospitality and tolerance , I could be at home with my family , finally free from the threats of the Islamists , who piled up in my mailbox . I was 48 years old and left a beloved radiant city where I had worked as a physicist and taught - full of pain , but convinced that I would no longer be exposed to the horrors of political Islam in France.\\n\\nIn recent years , the fear grabbed me again . Saint-Denis has nothing to do with the Saint-Denis at the time . And the land of human rights refuses to look .

My wife asks naively : \ '' Do you have a scarf for my eight year old granddaughter who is small for her age , \ '' The shop assistant shows her models : \ '' I\\ 've sold one to a four year old.\ '' \\n\\nIn between are books , they convey , together with the \ '' Wahhabi fashion\ '' , the proselytism of an Islamist fringe group , whose ideology many keep out of weakness or ignorance , for the message of the Qur\\'an . This aims to hold \ '' Muslims\ '' in the Islamist orbit , dominate and control the community , to promote the secession from the rest of society.\\n\\nIn addition to the giant fast-food business Mak d\\'Hal , that mimics the look and McDonald\\ 's hamburgers , one hundred percent halal , the hair salon Coiffure Mixte is hardly noticeable . The owner explained to me : \ '' Mixte is here that there is a separate room for veiled women , where they are hidden from view.\ '' This woman is like me from Oran .

I approach a newly opened bookstore , and despair . In the display are posters that teach children Islamic rules , such that you can not mock others , rest on the right side and make three breaks while drinking .

Was not an Imam filmed in the Brittany town of Brest a few weeks ago , when he told his small pupils , music is made for apes and pigs ? \\n\\nWhen the extreme right related organization Civitas organized a conference against the gender theory , the security service was not organized as conservative Catholics but of the bearded men of the Tawhid-center that are equally hostile towards marriage for all . How many such incidents will it take to open the eyes of the leftists of Saint-Denis ? \\n\\nAt the Institute of Technology of Saint-Denis , a stone\\ 's throw from the hair salon Coiffure Mixte away , a student organization has called for that lecture times shall not fall into the prayer times .

2A1ZA,europe,"*Translation of the submission \ '' Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims\ '' by Zafer Senocak*\\n\\n**Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims**\\n\\nHow to describe great loneliness ? Greater than the one which occurs when one has been abandoned by a loved one . Unlike the loneliness to which the poetries care . A loneliness that no longer will be outweighed by the world in which we live , can no longer be mitigated by what you believe , by promise and hope.\\n\\nIt is about the loneliness of those who come from the Muslim peoples and cultures and grew up in enlightened families who are religious or not , but always knew one thing , that they belong to the large global family of the enlightened . They want to live in a secular and open society , in Turkey as well as in Egypt , in Syria as well as in Iran . These enlightened mostly formed the middle class in their countries . They had a happy childhood . Half a century has it been since.\\n\\nOn the Bosphorus , there was this happy childhood , and also in Tehran . The happy childhood of bastards . Where did the bastards belong to ? They listened to the Beatles and more and more often overheard the muezzin . Where would they be at home when the world was open to them ? Has happiness a home in the world ? \\n\\n*The happy days of youth*\\n\\nIt was lived outdoors . Back in Cairo , Ankara and Tehran . Joy was the name of a dance . You could feel the stranger\\ 's hand , that prepared meals , on your own skin . It was also a time in which the prisons were filled and emptied with political prisoners . But the air outside did not smell like grids.\\n\\nThe air smelled of light effects . In the movies it was talked , laughed , music made . As on the streets . The houses all had a window on the streets . One grew out of one\\ 's house , to discover the world . The world of different people , the world of the other gender , the world of strange odors.\\n\\nThe child grew up free , because the adults had not yet fully furnished their world . You searched for the course of events , found snippets of photos , tried in memories , but they did live in the future . They lived in their children that they had rather than the ideas in their heads , the wild and horny ideas , the dangerous and the harmless . It was a time when you went to Paris for a weekend , because in Paris was always spring , a spring of the fragrance and love.\\n\\nThe preacher , who accompanied the dead came back to life and smelled like roses . Life and joy belonged to the existence of mortals , because they had the time and leisure to think about themselves and others . It was a time of learning . Foreign languages , the art of numbers and the art of living.\\n\\nToday in many places people have no life any more . Why even the graves ? The people no longer have a home . Why even have a garden ? The people have no land . What still limits ? Freedom can be as homelessness . In childhood , freedom smelled like freedom . The muezzin sounded as if he would sing of freedom . He called the people to prayer . Prayer smelled like freedom . Now , where the muezzin calls for death , to death and to kill , it would be to remember the smell of the prayers . Can you remember smells ? Will prayers help ? \\n\\nYou do not smell good anymore . They smell musty . We will no longer be free , meet together , but not free and be together . We are prejudiced , lifeless or false . We have no more childhood . The trains no longer go to Europe . The ships that reach Europe pour children overboard . But also those who live on do not travel any more . They emigrate , emigrate from their childhood , their lives , their hopes , from the joy of living . Can you live with these people ? Or is the hope that they have lost our death sentence ? \\n\\n*The Disappearance of Childhood*\\n\\nThere is no longer this childhood , which one could remember together . The alphabets are without secret . Freedom is a word . Words give life . We split the words in our bodies and have no word left for the happy childhood . Who belongs Paris ? Who owns my childhood ? Mother Asia , Father Europe ? \\n\\nTo whom does the bastard belong ? It was a happy childhood , the childhood of the bastards . I want my childhood back , my spotted by executioners childhood . I want to put on like a torn dress . It\\ 's perfect for me today , my mood , for my heart torn , for my pain . Without childhood we are naked.\\n\\nThe enlightened experience for a generation how they are pushed back in their own countries , but increasingly also rejected and abandoned by their non-Muslim sympathizers . They learn how the memory of their childhood increasingly gets into oblivion.\\n\\n*Massacre of Ankara*\\n\\nNowhere is this amnesia , which is accompanied by great loneliness , so noticeable as in Turkey . And no other event makes this loneliness feel more than the assassinations by deluded Islamists . Only a month ago , a suicide bomber killed more than 100 people in the heart of Ankara.\\n\\nHundreds of people were injured . A massacre of people who had come to demonstrate for peace . This event is perhaps hardly remembered . Otherwise , the Turkish President would have a harder time after the Paris attacks with his self-assured , arrogant appearances before the world public.\\n\\nThe fight against terror he wants to receive , together with the leading nations of the world . Would it not be about time first to uncover the backers for Islamist terrorism in his own country ? \\n\\nThe performances of the Turkish President in recent years were not without effect . Turkey has gradually left the Western community of values . The law is broken , continuously . It is threatened and sweared , against critics , against all those who can not be put on line.\\n\\n*Erdogan\\ 's arrogance*\\n\\nNow the country shall again get closer to Europe ? How come ? Is it not rather true that the unsettled enlightened elites of Turkey stand in the rain just like the proponents of a European Turkey in Europe ? Where is there left any discussion about the common values that go beyond lip service ? \\n\\nThe press which is close to the Turkish government has denounced such a community of values for a long time . They served the masses with conspiracy theories . The situatuion of the journalists and intellectuals of the country is sufficiently well known.\\n\\nThe enlightened Turks were and are left alone in their opposition to the rancor of their President and his ruling clique . This also contributes to the great loneliness , whose shadow falls on the representatives of a free and open Europe . It is high time to rid our hearts of this solitude . Because there is a common world to which we must fight , a world as it has been built after 1945 in Europe.\\n\\n*The devastating impact of the Saudis*\\n\\nBut the inhuman ideology of the Nazis is wearing a Muslim caftan today . There is nothing to interpret . Unfortunately , to many Europeans today this caftan appears to be closer , for power political or other reasons , than the stuff of which the dreams of the Enlightenment are sewn.\\n\\nWould one otherwise be photographed , shortly after the Paris massacre , with the Wahhabit king , representing ideologically and economically the hinterland of what is now the Caliph State . Not only that , the young people from the suburbs in Paris , in Brussels and elsewhere are poisoned by Salafis , Wahhabis and other Islamic sects .

It is common sense that smoking things is bad for your lungs , that is not what I\\ 'm denying . \\n\\n & gt ; Again , just for you : There are people in this world who only started smoking anything , because that\\ 's the way of consumption of cannabis of their choice . Some of those people die of smoking caused cancer .

I don\\'t understand this reasoning.\\n\\n & gt ; Let me say this again for you too : The point is not that cannabis is bad because you can die from it . You can probably die from pretty much literally anything in this universe in some way . The point is that defending \ '' You can\\'t die from cannabis\ '' is making parts of the the legalisation movement seem ridiculous . Because it\\ 's factually wrong ( for whatever indirect reasons , cannabis smoking caused cancer , fatal crash from driving under the influence ) and unimportant ( lethality alone isn\\'t a valid argument , you can die from driving a car ) . \\n\\nI think I clearly said : \\n\\n & gt ; No , their deaths are not directly attributable to cannabis , but to smoking burning stuff . You can vape without burning . You can eat weed brownies/cakes/whatever . There is no one forcing you to smoke a joint/blunt . Just to be clear , I\\ 'll say it again : Cannabis can not kill you . **It is the smoking that kills you . **\\n\\nI don\\'t say anything else , of course you can die if you crash your car after you drove high , or if you were too high to notice the stairs and fell down , but that still does not make cannabis kill you . It is because you were impaired due to the cannabis . If someone dies during a drunk driving accident , people don\\'t say he died due to alcoholic beverages , but he died while driving drunk .

For this year one of the better songs.\\n\\n\\nBut there\\ 's one thing that annoys me a bit in this song : \\n\\n & gt ; How \\'bout , we just go out for a drink .

Starting with the first five seconds , making you think this is going to be a upbeat song when suddenly *there\\ 's a piano* . \\nThat \ '' No.\ '' gets me every time . Then you get this Sammarinese Rebecca Black , with a voice that totally doesn\\'t fit that boy\\ 's voice.\\n The way she says \ '' Wa-ays\ '' makes me cringe and laugh at the same time . And the moment those shining smartphones appeared , I just lost it . Then their failed \ '' rap part\ '' ... \\n\\nThis whole song is like San Marino just pulled two kids from the street , and obligated them to sing in Eurovision . With lyrics that look like a four-year-old made them.\\n\\n & gt ; Just light up the candles . Let them shine on deep inside.\\n\\n & gt ; a chain of lights for you , and a chain of lights for me\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe we\u2019ll find out that many people feel the same \u2013 oh yeah\\n\\n & gt ; Together hand in hand , we will feel the love inside\\n\\n & gt ; If we all walk together we will feel the love inside\\n\\nAnd so on and so on ...

Would be a nice and accurate slogan for them at Eurovision . With 46 previous participations their best result is 6th.\\n\\nThis song is not going to change anything about that . \\nThe singer is standing really strange , like she wants to show her vagina ( espacially from [ 1:42 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xowMYNzYWbE & amp ; t=1m42 ) ) .\\nBut this rock ballad is doomed to fail and to stay in the semis , I cringed during the last refrain.\\n***\\n\\n08 Czech Republic : Marta Jandov\u00e1 & amp ; V\u00e1clav Noid B\u00e1rta - Hope Never Dies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=s31Ho7I64Os ) \\n\\nThis is the best song Czech Republic has ever sent to Eurovision . This song will guaranteed get their best result ever in Eurovision , \\nsince their best result right now is 18th in the Semi ( which isn\\'t possible this year ! ) . So congratulations ! \\n\\nBut about the song : It doesn\\'t really amuse me . This is a too mediocre , standard ballad.\\nAlso , they don\\'t really suit together for a duet .

STOP \\n\\n1:40 Phew , you almost ruined your song\\n\\nHe may not look like that , but he\\ 's just 16 years old . Yes , 16.\\n\\nThis is my favorite song this Semi-Final , this song saves this semi for me ( together with Sweden ) . This MUST be in the final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n10 Latvia : Aminata - Love Injected [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=fnVbR98J7Q4 ) \\n\\n*That beat is really stolen from Lean On* . Weird thing is , Lean On was released two weeks after this won Latvia\\ 's final\\nThe chorus is a Latvian combination of Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Katy Perry\\ 's Roar.\\n\\nThat beat gives a strange touch to this song , but it also removes the boredom in this ballad ( if you could called it a ballad ) \\n\\nProbably in the Final.\\n\\n***\\n\\n11 Azerbaijan : Elnur H\u00fcseynov - Hour of the Wolf [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kYsj1fFE1Xw ) \\n\\nA well-thought Eurovision song like only Azerbaijan and Sweden can . \\nFor me , this song is the border tonight between the songs that I like and I don\\'t like , nothing special.\\n\\nThis will reach the final for sure ( it\\ 's Azebaijan ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n12 Iceland : Mar\u00eda \u00d3lafs - Unbroken [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=8pYueOpzswg ) \\n\\nAfter Iceland\\ 's Teletubbie band last year , they sent a song this year that I quite like . \\nI wouldn\\'t classify this as a ballad , but more as a medium fast pop song . I hope this will be in the Final , but I\\ 'm not sure if they will pass.\\n\\n***\\n\\n13 Sweden : M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w - Heroes [ link - with free tolk ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=MaDob2RQldM ) \\n\\nLooking at the act alone , Sweden it by far the best . However there are accusations of plagiarism for the stickymen they use in the performance.\\n\\nAbout the song itself : Many people say this sounds like Lovers On the Sun , but I don\\'t think so . It\\ 's only a very small part that sounds like it.\\n\\nThis song is the favorite at the bookmakers , but I doubt if they were first if the act was less spectacular . But all in all , this song one of my personal favorites.\\n\\n***\\n\\n14 Switzerland : M\u00e9lanie Ren\u00e9 - Time to Shine [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ooDmr3Jtw5o ) \\n\\n***\\n\\n15 Cyprus : John Karayiannis - One Thing I Should Have Done [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=W39Qrusgp5E ) \\n\\nIf John Mayer sung this song , it would probably be a big hit .

I really don\\'t like those Duffy-sounding singers , but that\\ 's just my personal taste.\\nI like the rest of this song though , at least no ballad , but more upbeat .

In this \\'summary\\ ' , I have listed the songs in tonight\\ 's performance order , and added my own thoughts on the songs , being neutral.\\n\\nThe links next to the songs won\\'t spoil the performances of tonight ( no rehearsals and such ) , abut if available will go to a good-quality live performance ( mostly performances of national finals ) , but you don\\'t have to see them to understand me.\\n\\n\\n01 Moldova : Eduard Romanyuta - I Want Your Love [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=mz655avMYyo ) \\n\\nIf you watch Eurovision and see this as the first song , you will probably think \\'What the fuck is this show\\ ' , but don\\'t worry , this is one-of-a-kind.\\nWith this song Eurovision goes back 10 years in time . It reminds me a lot of [ Dirrty by Christina Aguilera ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=4Rg3sAb8Id8 ) . \\nBut this song is different than all other entries , and maybe that\\ 's why I like it . I would be really surprised though if this will finish top 10 and get through the finals , many people dislike this one\\n\\n\\n02 Armenia : Genealogy - Face The Shadow [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=VVVvgD0-Mu0 ) \\n\\nThis is the first of many ballads you\\ 'll hear this Eurovision , and definitely not the best one . It\\ 's sung by a group of six singers made for Eurovision , who come from 5 different continents , and Armenia itself . I\\ 'm afraid however they won\\'t sing really good live.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what this song is about ( and you have lived under a rock the past ~~100~~ 101 years ) , it\\ 's about the Armenian Genocide , which happened in 1915.\\nIn my opinion , political things like the Armenian Genocide shouldn\\'t be discussed on Eurovision . It also surprises me that this song is allowed to enter Eurovision without any changes , while Georgia had to change a song called \\'We don\\'t wan na Put In\\ ' ( similar to Vladimir Putin\\n^ ( sidenote : This song was first called \\'Don\\'t Deny\\ ' , but they changed it voluntarily to prevent the connection with _denying_ the Genocide ) \\n\\n\\n03 Belgium : Lo\u00efc Nottet - Rythm Inside [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=J9B3a7A7tbk ) \\n\\nAfter one of my least favorites , we go to one of my favorites . This \ '' Lorde-y\ '' song ^ ( no not Lordi ) is pretty refreshing in Eurovision . The first couple of seconds will make you think you are listening to Royals , but after that it just sound like a very good song you could easily hear on a hit station . This will definitely go to the final.\\n\\n\\n04 Netherlands : Trijntje Oosterhuis - Walk Along [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JO1cqzPWrVI ) \\n [ For those who don\\'t know to pronounce that name , here\\ 's how she pronounces it herself ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KdApGEC7fmM & amp ; t=5s ) \\n\\nThis year The Netherlands has sent one of their more famous artists to Eurovision , with a song that hasn\\'t any climax or something . This song , written by 2013 participant Anouk , could be best described as \\'medium\\ ' . It\\ 's not going to end very high , but I think ( and hope ) it will go the finals . There was however a lot discussion about the dress she was about to wear ( looked like someone played on it with a scissor ) , and I hope she won\\'t wear that tonight.\\n\\n\\n05 Finland : Pertti Kurikan Nimip\u00e4iv\u00e4t - Aina mun pit\u00e4\u00e4 [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ePhjs-3q068 ) \\n\\nI can assure you , there aren\\'t any worse songs than this one this year . This is the definition of awful . The best thing about this punk song is that it\\ 's the shortest song ever in Eurovision : only 90 seconds long , so if you want to do a toilet pause you got to be quick.\\nNote that this band was made before Eurovision , so they didn\\'t group them for Eurovision alone . However , they only reason that this song will get any points is because of the fact they are mentally disabled ( and maybe some Bloc-voting ) . But for me , this song is a 1/10 . Finland , if you want to win with something _special_ , you have to make the song at least a bit good.\\n\\n\\n06 Greece : Maria Elena Kyriakou - One last Breath [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=v7xKMnNcVdM ) \\n\\nEvery year , there are one , maybe two songs that try to repeat the success of the top songs the previous year . Greece is one of the examples this year . \\nThe main reason this got to Eurovision is because all the other participants on the national final sing good.\\nBut she had a good voice . A very good voice . Talking about voice , she won the Voice of Greece . The first two minutes of this ballad are a tad boring , but then the song suddenly becomes pretty good.\\nBut of all ballads , I think the only ones that can beat her are Spain and Albania . It\\ 's very likely that this will reach the final.\\n\\n\\n07 Estonia : Elina Born & amp ; Stig R\u00e4sta - Goodbye to yesterday [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=JNXtXZM0QcA ) \\n\\nSpeaking about repeating successes , this one is the other example . The first thing that came into my mind was Calm After the Storm , as this also is a country-ish song , but this not a copy or something.\\nI like this song very much , it has hit potential and , more importantly , it has winning potential . For me , the best song of this Semi.\\n\\n\\n08 Fyr Maceodnia : Daniel Kajmakoski - Autumn Leaves [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=t8QCt6CJCHc ) \\n\\na pretty good song , sung like it\\ 's a fairytale . However , I\\ 'm very afraid that the live performance will ruin this song and thus result in this song not getting to the final\\n\\n\\n09 Serbia : Bojana Stamenov - Beauty Never Lies [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qJrJVsOQwEc ) \\n\\nIf you would mix Conchita Wurst and Susan Boyle , you\\ 'd hey Serbia\\ 's act this year . Her voice is astonishing , but there\\ 's is one thing that will probably affect thist song\\nnegatively : she\\ 's dressed \ '' very old-fashioned\ '' . It really depends on the act for whether she will get to the finals or not\\n\\n\\n10 Hungary : Boggie - Wars for Nothing [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=WETXc5Z7Cng ) \\n\\nCan soneone wake me up ? Seriously , this song is perfect for letting someone fall asleep . I feel bad for you Australians who will have to see this at 4AM or something , trying to stay awake . Very boring ballad about useless conflicts , which isn\\'t a bad subject but a bit standard ( don\\'t get why they put Ebola on the background though ) \\nnothing special . Not the way a ballad should be IMO.\\n\\n\\n11 Belarus : Uzari & amp ; Maimuna - Time [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dVv_BmOqPWg ) \\n\\nThe beginning of the song strongly reminds me of Not Alone ( Armenia\\ 's song last year ) , but at least this song is more upbeat than all other songs this Semi.\\nBut overall , this song is very medium , and is one of those song that you would easily forget about . Don\\'t really know what to think about this one\\n\\n\\n12 Russia Polina Gagarina - A Million Voices [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jBVY7Glcd84 ) \\n\\nShe looks like a crossing from Kate Ryan and Ellie Goulding . \\'Hopeful\\ ' ballad about humanity , but to me it comes over a bit hypocritical , \\nescpecially with those kids in the clip . This is a song you would hear when having breakfast in a hotel in another country . Sorry Russia , but this is not my favorite.\\nBut because it\\ 's Russia , this will be in the final 100 % sure.\\n\\n\\n13 Denmark : Anti Social Media - The Way You Are [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=RA-A_uvE1ss ) \\n\\nLike last year , Denmark sends a \\'Poppy\\ ' song . It sounds similar to something , but I don\\'t know what His voice isn\\'t the best of tonight , and I worry that he will miss some tones tonight.\\nNot my favorite.\\n\\n\\n14 Albania : Elhaida Dani - I\\ 'm Alive [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=lZJdWUmxxZw ) \\n\\nWow . Just wow . This song got me from the first to the last second . Just beautiful . Her voice , divine . A cheerful upbeat ballad . One of the best songs this year . This must end in the top 5 in the final . If we\\ 're listening to voice alone in this Semi , she and Greece\\ 's singer are the winners.\\n\\n\\n15 Romania : Voltaj - De la cap\u0103t [ link ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Nw6sKQbwQOM ) \\n\\nWhat the fuck is this staging in their national final ^ ( ( disclaimer : I don\\'t know how Romania\\ 's performance of tonight will look\\\\ ) ) .

Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from Greek , Persian , Indian , Chinese , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations into Arabic and Persian , and later in turn translated into Turkish , Hebrew , and Latin . \\n\\n & gt ; With a new and easier writing system , and the introduction of paper , information was democratized to the extent that , for probably the first time in history , it became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books . [ 38 ] The use of paper spread from China into Muslim regions in the eighth century , arriving in Al-Andalus on the Iberian peninsula , present-day Spain in the 10th century . It was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries . [ 39 ] It was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . [ 40 ] \\n\\n & gt ; Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds . Ibn Sina and other philosophers such as al-Kindi and al-Farabi combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam .

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Good to see that Asscher his proposals are getting some attention and that Corbyn responded in a positive way .

AllesIsVoorBassie,europe,Interesting article because it refutes the notion that the terror attacks are retaliation to the ongoing attacks against ISIL . It has more to do with attacking the European model for co-existence and trying to elicit a response which will help their recruitment efforts . The part about ISIL its frustration with being unable to hit Germany for a long period also says a lot about the whole strategizing mentality that are behind the attacks . It ends with an ominous message saying that as long as Raqqa stands Europe will continue to suffer from attacks like these .,Germanic,Dutch

Amanoo,europe,"The UK has some policies , cultural aspects or traditions that are much more similar to American culture than the culture of most other European countries . For example , the UK employs a voting system based on First Past The Post . Ever seen people complain about UK politics being manipulable and all of that ? Things like gerrymandering ? That just FPTP at work . It\\ 's a system that\\ 's completely alien to most other non-English speaking countries , which often use parliamentary systems based on things such as Mixed Member Proportional Representation . FPTP is known by some for being highly manipulable , unrepresentative and for its tendency to degrade into a bipartisan system ( it hasn\\'t really done so in the UK yet , although the UK does have two big parties , one of which usually holds the majority ) . For detailed info , CGP Grey has a series of videos that explains things in a simple but very good manner . He\\ 's also been very vocal about it in his Hello Internet podcast ( can\\'t remember which episodes though ) . [ Dooblydoo ] ( http : //www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/ ) . \\n\\nAnother example would be the GCHQ , which quire a few would regard as barely more than the lackey of the NSA . Not exactly friendly to things like personal freedom or privacy ( which I\\ 'd argue is fundamental to freedom ) . People often forget that other countries\\ ' organisations , such as the AIVD , aren\\'t that great either . \\n\\nThe UK is also more likely to come up with proposals for draconian policies than the rest Europe . I can\\'t remember any specific policies , though , although I know there are some . Every so often , something pops up again . I\\ 'm willing to bet that there\\ 's something similar to SOPA or PIPA that , if it hasn\\'t been implemented , was at least proposed . I wish I had remembered more specific examples , though . I just don\\'t have the type of memory that holds on to that kind of specific information . \\n\\nI\\ 'd argue that English speakers also have a strong tendency to beat around the bush or to sugar-coat things . I might be a bit biased though , as I\\ 'm Dutch . My own culture has a tendency to just speak their minds . We have a blunt honesty that\\ 's often meant to be either helpful or efficient ( or possibly both ) . For example , if you were to try to speak Dutch , and told us that you sucked at it , you\\ 'd be fairly likely to hear \ '' yes , you really do suck\ '' . But it\\ 's often followed by tips to help you get better . We also don\\'t like too much chitter chatter or insincerity . A \ '' how are you\ '' by a supermarket worker is borderline offensive to us , as it\\ 's not a sincere question and may even be interpreted as prying into someone else\\ 's life .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Despite the total ripoff of my previous thread , I\\ 'll answer for shits and giggles . \\n\\nHmm , I think the UK has a lot of distinct accents , and usually I can pick out Scottish , Welsh actually throws me off because there\\ 's a lot of variance in their accent , some have an accent that is distinct , others sound quite English imho , North-South distinction usually isn\\'t too difficult .

I can recognize the difference between the major regional accents no problem though . \\n\\nI think the major regional US accents can be divided into a few families though : \\n\\n* Southern ( Texan , Cajun , Creole , Southern-ebonics , Appalachian , Gulf Coast and Atlantic coast being the main groups but some of these are only subtly distinct to the untrained ear ) ; \\n\\n* Great Lake States ( Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan being the most distinct sub-accents ) .\\n\\n* Northeast ( New York - further divided into Brooklyn , Long Island , there\\ 's more sub-accents but those are arguably the most distinct ) ; New Jersey basically like NY accent but with everything bad about it amplified ; Boston ) \\n\\n* General ( neutral but not a geographical but linguistic area , States like the generally neutral accent ones mentioned above ) Sub-category SoCal accent - because of vocal fry .",Germanic,Dutch

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Hmm gon na have to at least partially disagree with that . \\n\\nFirst of all , in Spain the second highest level ( after federal/central ) of governance/administrative regions is an \ '' Autonomous Community\ '' , that\\ 's just the nomenclature they use , just like we say States , Canada say provinces , Italy says Regions , Germany also says state . \\n\\nAndalusia for example , is also an \ '' autonomous community\ '' meaning that it is on the same level of governance as Catalonia .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Truth is , as an American to my ears only the top tier of speakers truly develop a distinctive marked accent in either direction . I think since general American tends to be more \ '' neutral\ '' ( re : unmarked ) it\\ 's also harder to find late learners that can imitate the accent as well , I\\ 've met many more second-language speakers that have mastered UK accents than US ( obviously not counting those that were either born , or lived in either country for 5+ years ) . Anyway , in spite of this as stated because of the prominence of US-English , the general European ( through the own languages typical accent ) tends to indeed err more on the side of US - spoken , but often writing more - British , with word-choice/slang being mixed between the two I\\ 'd say . \\n\\nBut for example I\\ 've had many Brits come to me and say Dutchies speaking English sound just like Americans , and to that I respond sure they pronounce aloud in a more US fashion , but if you\\ 're implying that they could almost fool you as a US native ( which some are ) then you must be completely tone-deaf because Dutchies definitely have their own distinct accent when speaking English !",Germanic,Dutch

This attitude tends to seep even into the \ '' public\ '' sector ( i.e . gov offices/services/admin . ) , but let so than in the dining industry for example . Immigration officials are mostly knowledgeable , friendly , helpful and competent . A big key to getting the most out of Dutch service in any sector is to know **what** questions to ask , to figure out your parameters in a given interaction . They\\ 'll often be quiet until you ask the right question , and then all the sudden they\\ 're a fountain of information ... \\n\\nOther Dutch businesses , services , hotlines , ministries aside from the IND ( immigration ) tend to be a bit tricky if you don\\'t know Dutch . Despite the \ '' Amsterdam Attitude\ '' - all service-industry employees in the city speaking English by default ( even to other Dutchies often ) and often refusing to switch back to Dutch if your accent and general proficiency are not on point . Anyway despite that , when you have to call these government services , or more day-to-day industries ( health-care providers for example ) they\\ 're much less willing to speak to you in English and more or less expect you to speak Dutch , very interesting phenomenom . Also this occurs even in Amsterdam service industry workplaces if **you\\'re** the one working and thus *serving* the Dutch people , they\\ 're attitude 180s and they also expect you to engage with them in Dutch , makes sense but also weird contradictory attitude on the whole ...",Germanic,Dutch

Edit : also Texas , New Mexico and Arizona deserve mention to varying degrees , especially New Mexico as Spanish is a co-official language alongside English in the state ) . Second edit : in El Paso , Texas a border-city of around 650k , apparently 72 % of the population alleges to speak Spanish , so again America catches a lot of shit for not speaking a second language , but if you\\ 're liberal ( re : *open* ) in the way you define American , then a whole fuckload of us speak Spanish when you think about it ... \\n\\nIn Italy I lived in Veneto , but have spent time in the far North , snowboarding and such . So I know in Sudtirol ( or \ '' *alto adige* ) there seems to be varying degrees of bilingualism between Italian and German native-speakers , which is another situation that always fascinated me ... hopefully there\\ 's somebody here from there that can chime ( though never seen anyone repping said region on here tbh ) .\\n\\nIn Germany I lived deep in Southern Bavaria in the Alps ( thus very near the Austrian border ) and while the not only did the official language not change upon crossing the border , but as well the dialect remained hardly unchanged ( I imagine this is similar for the old-school Limburgish/Zeelandic dialects or whatever they\\ 're called between BE-NL ) ...",Germanic,Dutch

I do still maintain that you did exemplify quite well this phenomena of Euros to deflect a little bit in these situations , but I don\\'t think it was any sort of intentional malice.\\n\\nI just get annoyed , that Europeans ( and in particular Dutch ) do seem to think that when they\\ 're compared to Americans they\\ 're exempt from this label of racist because they didn\\'t have slavery ( totally not true , because of Suriname ) and the current shitshow that is our law enforcement problem in the US.\\n\\nI would like to take my time to address that point now though , as it it seems our policing problem is the new scapegoat to point and cry racism over at the US ( I guess the Europeans finally accepted that slavery was over a century ago , and that they also had a large part in propping up the Transatlantic trade in the first place ) , anyway the police problem in the US is first and foremost just that , a **police** problem , let me asterisk the fuck out of this statement by saying I\\ 'm not downplaying the disadvantage minorities are at , especially when dealing with LEOs , nonetheless the police problem in the US stems ultimately from a pervasive attitude of brutality , excessive use of force , ego-tripping , control-freaks and lack of instilled deescalation techniques - that is to say ultimately a attitude problem pervading police forces across the country . Whites ( not nearly as often ) have also been subjected to some pretty gross displays of police brutality in the US - ex : 20 year drug dealer gets caught in undercover buy as cops rush to his parked car to arrest him he pull out and tries to drive off to which the officer sticks his gun in the window and shoots the kid point-blank killing him , citing to the recording camera bystander that he feared for his safety of being run over ( car was moving from 0 velocity to a reversal speed so not very fast at all ) . Case in point the police issue is much bigger than race , though the two have obviously become inextricably linked at this point , it doesn\\'t mean that our Police Problem is exclusively a race problem just to **reiterate** , so it shouldn\\'t always be pointed to as such , as it is something which does affect whites as well.\\n\\nI will say that I do respect Dutch cops for the most part ( probably the least intimidating but still competent police I\\ 've seen out of any country I\\ 've been to ) , and think they\\ 're much more competent than their American counterparts , and there is a reason I\\ 'm living in this country after all ( and not in the US ) .

Amsterdab16,AskEurope,"Sorry the original post ( before edit ) made \ '' these Americans\ '' ( and therefore us as a whole ) seem really arrogant , as if they talking in absolutes of being everybody\\ 's favorite nationality in the country they reside , that\\ 's some Trump-esque bullshit talk , and simply not an accurate representation of our mentality ( nor are a lot of the other painfully stupid US op\\ 's that show up on this subreddit , but that\\ 's a whole other thing ) .\\n\\nI digress , as an American who\\ 's lived in four European countries I\\ 'll chime in.\\n\\nOnly in Germany and Italy were Americans a common \ '' immigrant/expat\ '' group and that\\ 's because I lived in towns with active US military bases . That said a lot of opinions were formed around typical brash young American GI\\ 's ( who are basically our one demographic on par with # BritsAbroad , as far as acting like obnoxious assholes goes ) which wasn\\'t a very favorable view . In addition the fact that they were employed by these bases that were \ '' intrusions on national sovereignty\ '' in the eyes of many , than you get a double-down effect by some local hardliners as far as anti-US sentiment goes ( though never had a really bad experience in Italy upon revealing my origins even from MENA and sub-Saharan immigrants , the latter in fact tended to prefer Americans to Italians seeing them as more direct , less \ '' truly racist\ '' i.e . more accustomed to black people ) .\\n\\nThat said there are many civilian support workers , contractors , senior officers and family members that did a better job and establishing a favorable image , and those in these groups especially civilian \ '' GS\ '' ( government service ) and contractors doing the best to often learn the language and integrate . \\n\\nActive Duty soldiers typically did much shorter tours , were much busier and were in a much more Anglo-centric work culture , thus rarely learned the language at all . \\n\\nI\\ 'd say this applies to the towns I lived in , in both DE & amp ; IT . As far as which local populace held a more favorable opinion of Americans , I\\ 'd say probably the Italians , or they maybe see American culture as a bit more \ '' cool\ '' than the Germans ( though German girls I maintain are probably the easiest for yanks to have success with ) .\\n\\nIn the Netherlands and Spain , I lived in Barcelona and Amsterdam ( currently ) which were bigger cities with less direct American influence , though there was a sizeable contingent of Americans studying abroad in both cities as well as tourists.\\n\\nI think there\\ 's more established American expats in Amsterdam than in Barcelona , or that\\ 's the feel I get anyway . The truly established American expats , I do think for the most part integrate pretty well . Out of all Anglo-nationalities , I think they\\ 're the most likely to learn Dutch , because we have to come the furthest and jump through the most hoops to get legitimate residency ( as opposed to say Brits , for the meantime ) so it seems more logical for us to just put in the extra effort to learn the language , since we already have to make so many other sacrifices to come here anyway.\\n\\nAlso my experience with the IND ( dutch immigration bureau ) and \ '' *Gemeente*\ '' ( local municipal government ) in getting my partnership and subsequent related visa has been very hands-off . Compared to the research I did on the strictness of both agencies during the process , I was hardly prodded for anything . Like the Gemeente didn\\'t investigate the history or legitimacy of our partnership ( which I heard was commonplace especially for Dutch nationals trying to spouse non-westerners ) . Even in situations where my potential overstay should have been verified they didn\\'t and seemed to just back off and take my word for it every time they saw my US passport . Was very weird , and clearly a bit \\'racist\\ ' ( maybe that\\ 's not the right word , some for of prejudice but suffice to say I doubt a Moroccan-national in those situations would have been afforded the same oversights or lack thereof rather ... ) .\\n\\nEdit : in Spain , once or twice I had someone express their discontent with my country when revealing my nationality , but that was in my eyes/experience , an anomaly and Spanish people really opened up , were generous and thought it was really cool that I came from the US and spoke Iberian Spanish ( and a little bit of Catalan to boot ) . Maybe the Italians are the favorite immigrant group in Barca actually , they\\ 're pretty prominent and adapt well with both local languages ( Catalan and Spanish ) since Italian is very similar to both languages .",Germanic,Dutch

Not sure of the policy businesses take here , but I\\ 'm 27 usually get guessed as a bit younger ( if I shave my beard I look 18 ) , and rarely get carded , but still do sometimes only at supermarkets though never bars .

I doubt if cops see teens smoking after the fact that they care ( even in the US , cops don\\'t care typically ) . Probably for teens though ID checks are enforced .

Though at least municipally here in Mokum , rule on the books says something about discretion of Gemeente and establishment to enforce a 21 year age minimum for entry and access to \ '' rookruimtes\ '' ( smoking-rooms ) though again rarely enforced and some of these rookruimtes are also found in bars . Public consumption can be done in coffeeshops and 420-friendly bars ( mostly an Amsterdam thing only ) , also in Amsterdam only more or less public consumption ( at least of joints and vapes ) is usually tolerated . Also coffeeshops are the place where ID checks are most strictly implemented , I imagine because they draw the most scrutiny of the law , so they try to tread carefully . Dutch themselves aren\\'t big smokers on average , and they don\\'t have nearly as strong of a \ '' stoner-culture\ '' as Americans ( or even other EU countries like the UK , Italy , Spain or Germany for that matter ) , more popular with expats , immigrants and tourists to be honest . The progression of this toleration is at a bit of a standstill , with increasing crackdown on grow gear and growing ( small-time or commercial ) at the same time with proposed legislation of actual regulation ( in-line with the US\\ 's current approach in the legal-states ) . Many say the local \ '' scene\ '' is in decline , but it\\ 'll be interesting to see what the future holds.\\n\\n**Italy**\\n\\nI\\ 've also lived in Germany and Spain but after being 21 years old so kinda moot to be honest . I lived in Italy from the ages of 13-16 so that provides some perspective ( mind you this is also circa 2003-2006 in the Veneto region ) .\\n\\nTobacco - not enforced at all . Age of purchase officially was 16 , but by 14 and looking maybe 12 in appearances I was able to purchase cigarettes no problem . Nevermind the ID-checkless vending machines the \ '' tabaccherie\ '' put out front after closing hours every night ( this has since changed you need an Italian ID to swipe ) . Maybe Italians smoke more than the Dutch , I think so , it\\ 's viewed as quite normal.\\n \\nAlcohol - also very rarely enforced at either bars , I believe wine and beer may have been like 16 y.o.a . and liquor was 18 . However my mischievous 8 year old brother had no problem buying beer simply so he and his friends could break the bottles rather than drink it ( dumb I know ) .\\n\\nCannabis - many smoke , obviously very illegal but not the worst , small amounts may only be confiscated if you get lucky . Was fortunate enough to never find out the full extent of the law . Though I have friends that have been screwed , and ultimately dicked around with driving rights and license suspensions if they didn\\'t comply with a 4 year long urinalysis scheme . In any matter , not exceptionally difficult to find , most bigger towns ( or cities ) have certain areas where street dealers will congregate ( often Sub-Saharan or Moroccan immigrants ) , for higher quality knowing Italians and speaking the language is usually necessary . The street dealing culture and prominence puts Italy ahead of countries like Germany where ( Berlin being an exception ) such a thing doesn\\'t really exist . \\n\\n\\n**US**\\n\\nTobacco : strictly enforced , federally 18 years of age , though some states or counties enforce higher ages of purchase all the way up to 21 years . ID checks , often with scanning machines to detect fakes , checking for holograms etc . However once purchased it is rarely prosecuted , only bored asshole cops with nothing better to do would ever dream of busting minors for tobacco possession/consumption , and cops often ignore teen smokers ( this has shown to be true from rural Louisiana to Brooklyn , NYC in my experience ) . In the South chew and dip ( smokeless oral tobacco , disgusting stuff ) are popular and also in some other rural areas . Smoking has been and is on a rapid decline , many university campuses are now smoke free for example and less and less young people are smoking . In Western cannabis-friendly states like California , tobacco is perceived with much more stigma than cannabis is by young people ( this is arguably the attitude for even most young people country-wide ) . \\n\\nAlcohol - 21 federally and in every state ( never older or younger anywhere else AFAIK ) the most strictly enforced on every front , bars , stores etc . I have on occasion found bars ( in say New Orleans ) or convenience stores ( in say Brooklyn ) but these are the hidden gems , unicorns and anomalies rather than even remotely commonplace . ID checks . Can be prosecuted for public consumption ( as a legal adult over 21 ) , or being intoxicated underage depending on circumstances . Definitely can get cited for MIP ( Minor in Possession ) . So overall much more strictly controlled than tobacco . \\n\\nCannabis : in some states highly illegal . In many medical , in which some of these the medical system is a farce and effectively a recreational loophole ( for example Montana , Michigan and others operate this way ) . And yet in others fully legal and regulated - Washington ( state ) , Oregon , California , Nevada , Colorado , Massachusetts , Maine , Washington DC , and Alaska . Minimum age for either medical or recreational might be 18 in some states or counties but I believe in most it\\ 's 21 , and ID checks are quite strictly enforced . Seems to be on the rise , and becoming increasingly accepted . The quality and advancement of the industry are bar non the best in the world , and only rivaled by Canada really .",Germanic,Dutch

Antonskarp,europe,"& gt ; They\\ 're far more efficient at mass murdering animals than we were were . \\n\\nNope . The only reason cats kill more wild animals than us is because we\\ 've figured out how to domesticate animals before we kill them . 9 billion chickens are killed each year in the US alone . By human beings , not by cats . There are about 74 million cats in the US , which means to compete with humans , the average american cat would have to kill a new chicken every three days . And that\\ 's just chickens ! We kill turkeys , sheep , goats , cattle and pigs en masse as well . It\\ 's hard to visualize how much we kill animals because any wild animals we like to kill are extinct or close to extinction . \\n\\nTake the [ passenger pigeon . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon ) They used to travel in flocks so large they would blacken the sky . Competitions could consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock . The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition . Can you imagine a cat killing 30 000 birds even in its lifetime ? \\n\\nNot to mention the animals we kill by accident . Every day critters are mauled by cars on highways or combines on farms . Over 100 000 people were killed in Hiroshima . How many cats and dogs ? How many mice and cockroaches ? More than a cat could kill.\\n\\nToday domestic and wild cats perhaps kill more _wild animals_ than humans , but make no mistake - that is merely because we\\ 've changed the status of the animals we usually kill away from \ '' wild\ '' - not because of our capacity for murder is lower . Hell , we easily outkill them in wild animals too if we count whatever we haul up from the ocean . The ocean , which for most of humanity\\ 's existence has been seen as a limitless supply of food is being sucked dry . We are killing the creatures there so fast that they can\\'t keep up , and it\\ 's the goddamn ocean . \\n\\nEDIT : I used the US as an example because it\\ 's more relatable for most of reddit , and the numbers are easily accessible . I see now that I am in /r/europe and that\\ 's kind of weird , but I\\ 'm sure the numbers work either way.\\n\\nDOUBLE EDIT : Cats aren\\'t necessarily better than us at killing rats and snakes , we just value their time and lives less than our own .

[ citation needed ] Also , for example at Helsinki University of Technology , most students ( 85 % ) fail to achieve the official goal of 120 credits in two years \u2013 the average is 81 credits . The number of students failing to achieve the minimum credits to receive student benefit has risen 40 % following the implementation of the Process.\\n\\nThis indicates that it has become *more difficult* for students to finish their education on time than it was before . Of course , the text also indicates that this is might not be because standards of education have risen , but I see no suggestion that universities are \ '' easier\ '' than before . Indeed , I can only speak for my university , but the only major difference that Bologna led to seems to be that the grading system was changed from numbers to letters.\\n\\nMy guess is that it was your university ( or even just your study programme ) that became easier and not indeed European universities in general .",Germanic,Norwegian

Aqwis,europe,"& gt ; because today\\ 's universities have become too easy thanks in part to the Bologna program\\n\\nDo you have any evidence that this is not pulled straight out of your ass ? I doubt it . Exams dating back to the 80s , long before the Bologna reform , are available on the Internet for the courses I take as part of my degree . The level of difficulty for those courses are about the same now as it was in the 80s.\\n\\n & gt ; A college degree doesn\\'t guarantee you an office job\\n\\nTwo points : In the countries that have gone through the economic crisis most unscathed , i.e . *not* Spain , Portugal , your own Hungary , etc. , degrees in traditionally \ '' safe\ '' fields like engineering and medicine still pretty much guarantee you a job .

I felt yours were flawed and inconsistent . \\n\\n & gt ; But I still consider it to be a part of the region because a part of it is in on the peninsula & amp ; it was a part of Sweden.\\n\\nThe peninsula was named for the Scandinavian countries that were on 90 % of it . You don\\'t cut a peninsula early just to fit borders . They could call it the Norwegian Swedish and part Finland peninsula but that wouldn\\'t roll of the tongue as well . Then someone realised there was a name for the people that lived on 90 % of it and it was named so . Scandinavia has nothing to do with location on the map but 3 countries . If you want to get fancy it\\ 's a \ '' historical and cultural-linguistic region\ '' . You can keep using geography as a point but then you can also bring in whatever other random metric you feel like using.\\n\\n & gt ; because of history yet this isn\\'t true with Finland , too\\n\\nThey have a history through us through proxy , aka being Swedish . They didn\\'t fight wars against us , they fought because Sweden told them to do it . Denmark and Sweden however are directly interacting and it\\ 's their state declaring wars with Norway being the battleground and reason for war in a bunch of those . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm astonished anyone would say Icelandic is not a Scandinavian language\\n\\nTotally agree , not sure what i was thinking on this one .

They , like the others , lack the history and language . Two of the three main things i keep going on about consistently . Culture i can\\'t really speak of as i don\\'t feel confident to comment on it but language and history yes . It doesn\\'t matter though , if you aren\\'t three for three then you\\ 're out of a scandi membership.\\n\\n & gt ; It seems like CGP Grey concurs with my assessment , there is a degree of subjectivity in deciding which is which . \\n\\nHe seems pretty clear about who Scandinavia is , but he says there is also confusion . I don\\'t deny that at all.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; My point simply is : Don\\'t tell people that they\\ 're wrong for saying Finland & amp ; Iceland are in Scandinavia because there are valid reasons for them to be considered a part of it.\\n\\nIf there were valid reasons they would be Scandinavian . It\\ 's as simple as that . We don\\'t even count Svalbard as Scandinavian and that\\ 's Norwegian with 70 % Norwegians . Why i\\ 'm sure you ask . Well it lacks the history , one of the three checkboxes it need .

5tormwolf92,europe,"& gt ; The reality is that for five centuries much of the Balkans found itself under the Ottoman yoke , under an occupation that the locals resented at all levels , and for good reason . Under the millet system , the collective rights of Christians as a community were severely constrained compared to their Muslim counterparts . In the early days of this occupation , they were subjected to the worst injustices imaginable , including the forced enslavement of their children under the dev\u015firme system . Moreover , economically speaking the status of Christians came close to what can rightfully be called servitude . Christians were subjected to a highly discriminatory tax , they were shut out many professions , and often were in practice precluded from owning any sizeable amount of land . In effect , a large fraction of Christians in the Ottoman Empire were forced to work the land as laborers , while the profit of their work went to landholders who were almost invariably immigrants from other parts of the Ottoman Empire or local Muslim converts.\\n\\nAt the same time we had the spansih inquisition where non-christians had to flee al Andalus .

Segregated suburbs with repatriated foreign fighters pose an acute threat , says migration officer Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' The district Hj\u00e4llbo is the Swedish answer to Molenbeek , Brussels , where terrorists from Paris hid while they were planning new actions . We must prepare ourselves , \ '' says the policeman . \\n\\nJust three hours drive from Oslo are six neighborhoods in Gothenburg characterized by parallel society , crime and strong elements of extreme , violent Islamists , according to a recent police report . \\n\\nAftenposten stands outside the door to a so-called garage mosque named \ '' Blue Door\ '' district in Hj\u00e4llbo , Angered , Gothenburg . Terror scientists from National Defence College in Stockholm have characterized the place as a meeting place for extreme Islamists and were warned by the police about going too close . \\n\\n**Carpeted washroom converted into a mosque** \\n\\nAftenposten found the blue door that has given the mosque its name . The venue is a disused laundry in an apartment building close to Hj\u00e4llbo center . The door is open and we enter . \\n\\nThe nearly 20 square meter room is covered with carpeting . On the walls there are a few bulletin boards and posters in Arabic . Two easy chairs make up the furniture . \\n\\n\ '' No shoes ! \ '' \\n\\nA young man with a dark beard reminds us to take off our shoes before entering a mosque . He sits alone on the carpet in a corner and reads a book . He does not want to say his name , but says in English that he is a computer science student and that he does not speak Swedish . He cringes away when we retrieve the camera . \\n\\n\ '' Why do you visit exactly this mosque ? \ '' \\n\\n\ '' I visit all sorts of mosques , \ '' he said . \\n\\nHe summons an elderly man who presents himself as a Palestinian named Ahmed Abdelrazek , and emerges as a kind of leader on site . When we ask him about the terrorist researchers\\ ' claim that there is recruitment to ISIS , he shakes his head . He does not like people from here travel to war . \\n\\n\ '' It\\ 's insane to train people to commit acts of terror , \ '' says Abdelrazek . \\n\\nThe young man may not speak Swedish , but he understands a certain amount of the Swedish language . He enters into the conversation with the elderly man who suddenly did not want to talk more with us . \\n\\n\ '' They don\\'t like visits from the media , \ '' concludes police inspector Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n**Fosters foreign fighters in isolated pockets** \\n \\nWe meet the policeman at the police station in the district Hj\u00e4llbo , where the audience is operated behind bulletproof glass . Bostr\u00f6m has worked in the police for 38 years . He takes us to a meeting where he draws and tells on a blackboard on developments taking place in the northeastern parts of Gothenburg . \\n\\n\ '' Gothenburg are among those places that are recruited most foreign fighters per capita in Western Europe , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nThe terror in Paris and Brussels have focused on isolated pockets of parallel societies in Europe that fosters foreign fighters and terrorists hiding on the run . Intelligence information indicates that IS has trained 400 people to attack on European soil . Sweden is specifically designated as a target . \\n\\n\ '' The official alert level is currently at level 3 . I would say that it is at 5 , almost on top . When we hear how the mosques here reviewing the terror in the rest of Europe , I am not in doubt , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m , showing that there was a failed suicide attack in Stockholm in 2010 . \\n\\nJohan Walter sitting in the same meeting room .

Six of the worst areas are located in Gothenburg . \\n\\nThese are residential areas where much of the population has little confidence in the police and judiciary . They will not testify in court . Conflicts are resolved out of the ordinary justice system , sometimes within clans . Many people who live here , have over time been living in a sort of state of emergency with serious crime and shooting in broad daylight . Threats and violence are perceived as normal by many , and measures that are inserted , have had little effect.\\n\\nThe backdrop is record unemployment , drug crimes , ethnic segregation , stigmatization and sometimes extreme overcrowding .

The Guatemalan-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans have been in the US for what , a few decades . Well , then we\\ 'll look at a Chilean-Swede and a Chinese-Swede who\\ 've been here for a few decades . \\n\\nNotably , Sweden\\ 's foreign-born population ( 16.5 % ) [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) is large than the US\\ 's foreign-born population [ ( 14.3 % ) ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) . \\n\\nSweden is a bigger immigrant country than the United States and has been this way for years .

Europe is very diverse and these issues will depend , to begin with , on where you are in Europe . Second , you have to define \ '' fit in\ '' to get anywhere with this.\\n\\n & gt ; Your statement even highlights it . You are taking a group that has a ton of commonalities and separating them into different groups based on minor language differences . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not the case . The differences are much more than linguistic and go right into hundreds of years of traditional , religion and even where they live and what they surivive on . It\\ 's like speaking of the Amish or Texas Germans to some extent ( though a deceptive comparison ) in that these two groups are also American . \\n\\n & gt ; Any time a distinction like that HAS to be made shows how closely one holds on to even a regional identity and will alienate those not sharing that identity . \\n\\nYes , but your are missing this : that identity can still be included in the conservative national identity , just like variations within nation states elsewhere .",Germanic,Swedish

AFAIAA,europe,"I did not write that the euro destabilized the economy of Sweden , I wrote \ '' create a destructive economic unit to destabilise national economies\ '' .

Largely this was facilitated by a system in which monetary policy is controlled by unaccountable bureaucrats at the European Central Bank . After the 2008 Financial Crisis a series of enoromous transfers of wealth from taxpayers to financial institutions took place , but they were not enough to stabilise the system because the fundamental structures surrounding the euro aren\\'t capable of doing that . The EU needs to either completely restructure its financial institutions or put checks and balances in place to prevent destroying the very economic zone it hopes to create . But there\\ 's hope there , the EU is so undemocratic and poorly structured it is currently destroying itself from within . \\n\\nConcerning Sweden , the EU constitutes a big economic investment with a relatively small economic return . Its policies towards Greece have directly affected Swedish banking , industry and stock markets . It has paralysed Swedish agriculture and it has given Sweden a large population of unemployable , antisocial Romani . Due to its own idiocy and the influence of its overlords in the EU , Sweden has been hugely affected by the migrant crisis , which is crippling the country\\ 's police force and social services , among other state functions . Swedish export and employment have been affected by the EU\\ 's monetary policies and so on . \\n\\nThe majority of laws and regulations that decide over Sweden today come from the EU : Sweden pays a fee every year to let the EU decide more and more over Sweden , which has undermined Swedish representative democracy . The EU inefficiently places decision-making powers at a supranational level when these same powers can and have long been efficiently carried out at national level . The EU is thus not only undemocratic but also inefficient . This supranational structure in itself entails that power is moved further and further away from Swedish voters and that the EU does not have Sweden\\ 's best interests in mind .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"This one is quite recent ( 1981 ) , but is interesting , and could have led to a war with the Soviet Union.\\n\\nI\\ 'm talking about [ Whiskey on the rocks ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363 ) .\\n\\nOne late Tuesday evening in October of 1981 a Soviet submarine , armed with nuclear wapons , went aground in the archipelago near Karlskrona naval base . The submarine was discovered by two local fishermen in the morning after . \\n\\nThey contacted the Swedish navy , which didn\\'t believe the reports , but went to investigate anyway . The patrol ship *HMS Smyge* was first to arrive and laid anchor next to the submarine . The commander of HMS Smyge climbed aboard the submarine and managed to make contact with the commander ( they had to communicate in german ) . \\n\\nAccording to the Soviet commander the navigation equipment on board was \ '' Kaputt\ '' and that Soviet tugs would come and pull it afloat . However , the swedes naturally said \ '' no way\ '' , the ball was rolling.\\n\\nTwo recon fighters from Sweden did indeed spot Soviet ships on their way to the stricken sub . Among the ships were modern frigates . Later that evening the Soviets asked for permission to send four ships to rescue the sub , again the swedes said \ '' Nope\ '' .\\n\\nThe Swedish prime minister told the Swedish command to keep te Soviets away with what they got . The problem was that at the time they really didn\\'t have that much in that specific area . The coastal battery , which was the main defence weapon was missing its fire control system due to maintenance ! Luckily they did manage to get a new fire control system , one which was very modern and mobile , in place by the evening . \\n\\nThe personell at the battery followed the Soviet ships advance towards the border . \ '' *1000 meters , three minutes ! *\ '' Was called out and the mood was tense in the control room.\\n\\nThe next call out was \ '' *700 meters , two minutes ! \ '' , and at about that time the Major in charge thought \ '' *We are probably at war now*\ '' . The decision was made to put the battery into war-mode , which included changing the radio operations into frequency-hopping , a feature that at the time wasn\\'t allowed to be used in peacetime in Sweden . \\n\\nWithin a minute after that the Soviet ships had stopped , just outside the border . Apparently they sent out a transmission saying that something wasn\\'t right and that they were waiting for new orders . \\n\\nThe Soviets did try to make a dash with a tug the day after , but it was stopped by the Swedish sub *HMS Neptun* . Swedish *J\u00e4gare* , basically Swedish commandos/rangers , were guarding the sub at all times as well . They also had the commander , who liked to stand on the tower of the sub , in a sniper sight at all times . If anything were to happen they would board the ship.\\n\\nMore Soviet ships were arriving at the border , and they planned to take the sub by force at 03.00 the next night . However the attack was called off at 02.30 the same night . The reason is supposed to be that Sweden has had the time to mobilize a much larger force at the site at that time . \\n\\nIn the end Swedish tugs got the Soviet sub afloat again and it was escorted to the border.\\n\\nWiki article : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363\\n\\nA short film made by the Swedish Military shows how it looked at the site : https : //vimeo.com/11072021",Germanic,Swedish

We have four fundamental laws , but the definition of the word \ '' law\ '' is a bit different . I get the feeling n the internet a \ '' law\ '' is mostly referring to an \ '' article\ '' . The most important fundamental law is the instrument of government , and that\\ 's the one I will refer to from this moment on.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know . You said your newest constitution was put in place to avoid amending an older one , and it\\ 's just a comparison.\\n\\nIn that case I wasn\\'t clear enough . The main reason was that a big part of it had fallen into obsolescence . Therefore it was rewritten from the ground up . A big change was the move from a two chamber parliament to a unichamber . \\n\\nIt has then been amended many times , latest in 2014 . In order to amend it you need a simple majority , but two times and have a general election in between.\\n\\n & gt ; In any case , I still don\\'t see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution.\\n\\nWriting a new constitution doesn\\'t have to mean that you do away with everything old . Sure , you can amend it but there are some pretty troublesome parts in your constitution , such as the electoral college.\\n\\n & gt ; Is that not similar to your country\\ 's highest courts ? \\n\\nActually , no . But I know that we\\ 're the odd ones here . Courts ( any court ) can test if the application of a law is in accordance of the fundamental law in each specific case . But they can not dismiss a law as \ '' unconstitutional\ '' . Before a law comes into effect it passes through the \ '' council on legislation\ '' which may point to problems with the laws . The government is being watched by the \ '' Committee on the Constitution\ '' . But as I said , we\\ 're pretty odd in that . \\n\\nThe point I was trying to make was that instead of interoperating old laws it might be better to rewrite them so they make sense . \\n\\n & gt ; I did say that . The Bill of Rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default.\\n\\nHmm , the only thing which remotely resembles that is [ allemansr\u00e4tten ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam ) , which isn\\'t defined what it includes or not . But it is granted by the constitution by the 2nd chapter , 15th article , 4th paragraph : \\n\\n\ '' Everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public\\naccess , notwithstanding the above provisions.\ '' \\n\\nBut then again , doesn\\'t that make it the other way around ? I should probably go to sleep now..",Germanic,Swedish

When you reach 1100 SEK over a 12-month period you don\\'t have to pay the fees for the reminder . The same is also true if you reach 2200 SEK for prescription drugs.\\nThere is also a lot of private health care in Sweden . However most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . Meaning it\\ 's funded through the countys and you don\\'t pay anything extra just because it\\ 's private . Also , according to law you have the right to choose your \ '' home clinic\ '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here.\\nThere exists some private healthcare that isn\\'t funded by the countys as well . And because of that there also exists private health insurance . These cost between 90 and 450 SEK/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what\\ 's included.\\n\\nNow , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc . I for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually I can go there the next day . At the ER it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . But yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times.\\n\\nI have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . Also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the National Board of Health and Welfare.\\n\\nAnd lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . You can also access it on the web att [ 1177.se ] ( http : //www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time..",Germanic,Swedish

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"About 50 % of the population lives in their own house , not very unlike an American suburb tbh . Houses are mostly bade out of wood , but stone houses are not unheard of .

Income tax levels are highly progressive so a wage of 30.000 SEK equals 23,8 % tax and 34.000 equals 24,8 % . One interesting thing is that Sweden ( together with the other Nordic countries ) lacks a minimum wage . Wages are individual but the base levels are set by collective bargaining . But in theory you can pay as little as you want , in practise this is of course totally impossible . Unions are super strong here ( but they generally work with , not against , the employer ) \\n\\nPublic services available include ( but are not limited to ) practically \ '' free\ '' healthcare , subsidized dental care , 100 % tuition free education including university , 480 days parental leave ( to split between both parents ) , sick leave , allowances for children and if you are studying etc . etc.\\n\\nAnnual leave is at least 25 days , and popular vacation destinations include the Mediterranean and Thailand.\\n\\nMost families own a car , some two .

At the time , a murder under Swedish law was subject to prescription in 25 years . The law was later changed to prevent the Palme case from expiring , and thus the police investigation remains active.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; # # # Yugoslavian connection\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; In January 2011 the German magazine Focus cited official German interrogation records in connection with another investigation from 2008 as showing that the assassination had been carried out by an operative of the Yugoslavian security service.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; # # # \ '' The 33-year-old\ '' \\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; A Swedish extremist , Victor Gunnarsson ( labeled in the media 33-\u00e5ringen , \ '' the 33-year-old\ '' ) , was soon arrested for the murder but quickly released , after a dispute between the police and prosecuting attorneys . Gunnarsson had connections to various extremist groups , among these the European Workers Party , the Swedish branch of the LaRouche Movement .

Picked out by Mrs Palme at a lineup as the killer , Pettersson was tried and convicted of the murder , but was later acquitted on appeal to the court of appeal . Pettersson\\ 's appeal succeeded for three main reasons : \\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; * Failure of the prosecution to produce the murder weapon ; \\n & gt ; * Lack of a clear motive for the killing ; \\n & gt ; * Doubts about the reliability of Mrs Palme\\ 's testimony and \ '' extremely gross errors\ '' by the police in arranging the lineup.\\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; Additional evidence against Pettersson surfaced in the late 1990s , mostly coming from various petty criminals who altered their stories but also from a confession made by Pettersson . The chief prosecutor , Agneta Blidberg , considered re-opening the case . But she acknowledged that a confession alone would not be sufficient , saying : \\n & gt ; \\n & gt ; & gt ; He must say something about the weapon because the appeals court set that condition in its ruling .
