5tormwolf92,europe,"& gt ; The reality is that for five centuries much of the Balkans found itself under the Ottoman yoke , under an occupation that the locals resented at all levels , and for good reason . Under the millet system , the collective rights of Christians as a community were severely constrained compared to their Muslim counterparts . In the early days of this occupation , they were subjected to the worst injustices imaginable , including the forced enslavement of their children under the dev\u015firme system . Moreover , economically speaking the status of Christians came close to what can rightfully be called servitude . Christians were subjected to a highly discriminatory tax , they were shut out many professions , and often were in practice precluded from owning any sizeable amount of land . In effect , a large fraction of Christians in the Ottoman Empire were forced to work the land as laborers , while the profit of their work went to landholders who were almost invariably immigrants from other parts of the Ottoman Empire or local Muslim converts.\\n\\nAt the same time we had the spansih inquisition where non-christians had to flee al Andalus .

Some may be , some may be sexual harassment.\\n\\nHere are the arguments from the quoted wiki paragraph alone : \\n\\n* Police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics.\\n\\n* The Swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately.\\n\\n* The Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported.\\n\\nI\\ 'll say again that I am not arguing for or against immigration or integration , but what you say is not the \ '' only\ '' argument at all . I won\\'t comment on the ethnicity of the criminals since I wasn\\'t , for the third time , arguing for or against immigration/integration . I\\ 'm only discussing how stats can be used to paint different images of reality.\\n\\n & gt ; So , are swedes reporting real crimes or are they just making stuff as they go along to pin them on innocent immigrants ? \\n\\nAgain , the ethnicity of criminals are irrelevant when discussing the application of statistics . You\\ 're trying to turn my post about statistics into a post about immigration/integration , that\\ 's not what I came here to discuss.\\n\\n & gt ; Furthermore , you talk about deceiving people with statistics , but here you are trying to pull the wool over everyone\\ 's eyes by distorting a single piece of statistics while trying desperately to ignore all facts and even all crimes being committed by immigrants . How ?

Once again , I used that \ '' fact\ '' as an example of how stats can be interpreted in more than one way .

The way you worded your original post it sounded like \ '' Do you want raping immigrants to come to your country ? \ '' which is a rather aggressive standpoint so I asked you to clarify . \\n\\n & gt ; Indeed . You responded to me with an accusation which I do happen to consider a personal attack , and then get passive aggressive with me and back away acting as if I\\ 'm the one attacking you . Cute.\\n\\nAgain , it was not meant to be an accusation but because of the rather unorthodox statement I asked you to clarify . It was in no way mean as a personal attack . However , due to your followup : \ '' Nice reading comprehension , but I\\ 'm used to the old strawman when dealing with pro-immigration types.\\nI specifically said disproportionately , would you like a dictionary ? \ '' I did get more defensive since it was nothing but a personal attack that in no way contributed to discussion .

Though I\\ 'm not denying that I haven\\'t either but I do not consider myself to be the instigator.\\n\\n & gt ; No , that\\ 's a logical fallacy used to falsely bolster ones argument .

I admit that it might not be fair to mention it but I was simply defending myself . Also , I think you are mistaken . All I disagree with is the fact that you in your original post worded it in a way as to equalize immigrants with rapists .

However , police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries , which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] For example , Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in 2005 , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ] [ 12 ] which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the ten-year period of 2004-2013 .

AFAIAA,europe,"Norwegian paper writes about situation in Sweden , auto-translated article : \\n\\n**Police : These segregated suburbs pose an acute terrorist threat** \\n\\nGOTHENBURG ( Aftenposten ) : Around 130 foreign fighters in Syria have been recruited from six risk areas in Gothenburg . Segregated suburbs with repatriated foreign fighters pose an acute threat , says migration officer Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' The district Hj\u00e4llbo is the Swedish answer to Molenbeek , Brussels , where terrorists from Paris hid while they were planning new actions . We must prepare ourselves , \ '' says the policeman . \\n\\nJust three hours drive from Oslo are six neighborhoods in Gothenburg characterized by parallel society , crime and strong elements of extreme , violent Islamists , according to a recent police report . \\n\\nAftenposten stands outside the door to a so-called garage mosque named \ '' Blue Door\ '' district in Hj\u00e4llbo , Angered , Gothenburg . Terror scientists from National Defence College in Stockholm have characterized the place as a meeting place for extreme Islamists and were warned by the police about going too close . \\n\\n**Carpeted washroom converted into a mosque** \\n\\nAftenposten found the blue door that has given the mosque its name . The venue is a disused laundry in an apartment building close to Hj\u00e4llbo center . The door is open and we enter . \\n\\nThe nearly 20 square meter room is covered with carpeting . On the walls there are a few bulletin boards and posters in Arabic . Two easy chairs make up the furniture . \\n\\n\ '' No shoes ! \ '' \\n\\nA young man with a dark beard reminds us to take off our shoes before entering a mosque . He sits alone on the carpet in a corner and reads a book . He does not want to say his name , but says in English that he is a computer science student and that he does not speak Swedish . He cringes away when we retrieve the camera . \\n\\n\ '' Why do you visit exactly this mosque ? \ '' \\n\\n\ '' I visit all sorts of mosques , \ '' he said . \\n\\nHe summons an elderly man who presents himself as a Palestinian named Ahmed Abdelrazek , and emerges as a kind of leader on site . When we ask him about the terrorist researchers\\ ' claim that there is recruitment to ISIS , he shakes his head . He does not like people from here travel to war . \\n\\n\ '' It\\ 's insane to train people to commit acts of terror , \ '' says Abdelrazek . \\n\\nThe young man may not speak Swedish , but he understands a certain amount of the Swedish language . He enters into the conversation with the elderly man who suddenly did not want to talk more with us . \\n\\n\ '' They don\\'t like visits from the media , \ '' concludes police inspector Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n**Fosters foreign fighters in isolated pockets** \\n \\nWe meet the policeman at the police station in the district Hj\u00e4llbo , where the audience is operated behind bulletproof glass . Bostr\u00f6m has worked in the police for 38 years . He takes us to a meeting where he draws and tells on a blackboard on developments taking place in the northeastern parts of Gothenburg . \\n\\n\ '' Gothenburg are among those places that are recruited most foreign fighters per capita in Western Europe , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nThe terror in Paris and Brussels have focused on isolated pockets of parallel societies in Europe that fosters foreign fighters and terrorists hiding on the run . Intelligence information indicates that IS has trained 400 people to attack on European soil . Sweden is specifically designated as a target . \\n\\n\ '' The official alert level is currently at level 3 . I would say that it is at 5 , almost on top . When we hear how the mosques here reviewing the terror in the rest of Europe , I am not in doubt , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m , showing that there was a failed suicide attack in Stockholm in 2010 . \\n\\nJohan Walter sitting in the same meeting room . He is employed in Migrationsv\u00e4rket but pronounces himself as a private person . He has worked in the vulnerable districts in almost 20 years . \\n\\n\ '' I am convinced that it is only a matter of time before it slams , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**A segregated society with violent extremism** \\n \\nA Swedish police report that came just before Christmas last year , states that 15 residential areas in Sweden is characterized by a parallel society with a strong presence of violent religious extremism and criminals . Six of the worst areas are located in Gothenburg . \\n\\nThese are residential areas where much of the population has little confidence in the police and judiciary . They will not testify in court . Conflicts are resolved out of the ordinary justice system , sometimes within clans . Many people who live here , have over time been living in a sort of state of emergency with serious crime and shooting in broad daylight . Threats and violence are perceived as normal by many , and measures that are inserted , have had little effect.\\n\\nThe backdrop is record unemployment , drug crimes , ethnic segregation , stigmatization and sometimes extreme overcrowding . There are examples of 20 people sleeping in shifts in a two bedroom apartment . \\n\\n**Young criminals are recruited** \\n\\nIt is the development of clean immigrant ghettos that worries Ulf Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\n\ '' We have even created the segregated city . A third of the population in Gothenburg are immigrants . 80 percent of those living in neighborhoods in the northeast . These are places authorities are absent.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m points out that eight out of ten drop out of primary school in some of these neighborhoods . Figures for crime and unemployment are ominous high . \\n\\n\ '' It goes without saying that young people in this environment becomes easy prey for people who want to recruit them . We should remember that this is young people who are not even welcome in his own family because they are criminals . They drink . They see no future . They are then invited into the fire . Over time , they get to hear about Islam , but only those parts of the religion that suits them who enlists them.\ '' \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m says that these young people who rule without the basic knowledge of Islam , even if the parents are devout Muslims . \\n\\n\ '' First generation are the most stable . But what happens when the elderly fall from ? The potential for even more foreign fighters is enormous , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nAlready last autumn warned the Swedish security police Sapo about terrorist risk in Sweden , and the Gothenburg pointed out by many foreign fighters . \\n\\n**Lifetime for beheading two Swedes** \\n \\nTwo men from Gothenburg , a 30 year old and a 32 year old , were in a Swedish court recently sentenced to life in prison for beheading in Aleppo in Syria . A few weeks ago , four men with ties to Sweden stopped in Turkey as they were supposedly on their way to Syria to join the IS . \\n\\nNo youngsters Aftenposten meetings Hj\u00e4llbo will take foreign fighters in defense . Two young boys stirs up sharply , but they want to be anonymous . One of them is a Kurd . They say they know many who have traveled , but no one has returned . \\n\\n\ '' They are jerks traveling . If they survive and come back , I\\ 'll beat them , \ '' says Kurd Alex ( 19 ) . \\n\\nBuddy Arber ( 19 ) are Albanian and says : \ '' Foreign warriors pigs to Islamic religion.\ '' \\n\\n**Notified of developments in the suburbs** \\n\\nBostr\u00f6m claims he has seen the danger signs long . \\n\\n\ '' We see that gifted fundamentalists gain more and more control in these suburbs . The less we do to support those Muslims who want to approach our democracy , the better breeding ground there for parallel society . People in these suburbs live as social hostages , \ '' says Bostr\u00f6m . \\n\\nJohan Walter nods . \\n\\n\ '' There has been a shift in recent years . Niqab was never used before , but it has come after influence of fundamentalists . We see changes in Somalis who previously had sufi traditions of dance and music . Now they do not dare to perform this public anymore because they can meet reactions , \ '' says Walter . \\n\\n**Major challenge to reverse the trend** \\n \\nZan Jankovski coordinate efforts against communities with violent extremists in Gothenburg municipality . He would not comment on the terrorist danger . \\n\\n\ '' But it is clear that we have too many Syria explorers from the city . Of 130 who have traveled , is around 25 dead and 25 have returned . We have received information that fewer trips now , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\nHe points out that they also have foreign fighters to Ukraine and greater extreme-right in town . \\n\\n\ '' It is clear that the challenge with a segregated and polarized city is a major challenge . Reversing a trend that has come over time is not easy . We have a long-term cooperation between several agencies where we work at schools and youth groups in these neighborhoods , \ '' says Jankovski . \\n\\n**Build more housing and focuses on children** \\n\\nKommunalr\u00e5d for Social Affairs in Gothenburg , Marina Johansson ( Social Democrats ) , says that they have taught 3,000 people to pick up signs of radicalization among young people . When they see these signs , contact the parents and school . \\n\\n\ '' But there is much that has gone wrong in these residential areas , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\nNew migrants are now located in other districts , and new housing will alleviate overcrowding . \\n\\n\ '' Moreover , we will initiate long-term measures within the living conditions and health to reduce social inequalities between districts . With a long-term effort can we stop segregation and create good conditions for the children , \ '' says Johansson . \\n\\n**Fears for kids** \\n\\nDistrict Bergsj\u00f6n was planned for industrial workers at Volvo and SKF . Now Bergsj\u00f6n marked by drug and gang crime , and two years ago was one of the first foreign fighters from district killed in Syria . \\n\\nSomali coach Jama Abdisataar ( 41 ) has lived in Bergsj\u00f6n for several years . He has four children , and also has two asylum seekers on 16 and 17 living with them . Now he\\ 's upset for the young . \\n\\n\ '' Some people hang around the mosques , and we know that recruitment takes place . It is bad that they leave people who have fled the war into new violence , \ '' says Abdisataar who himself says he hates Islamists Al Shabaab . \\n\\nHe likes it in town , but it seems there is little evidence of Sweden . \\n\\n\ '' Swedes move . I do not know why , \ '' he smiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n",Germanic,Swedish

Well , then we\\ 'll look at a Chilean-Swede and a Chinese-Swede who\\ 've been here for a few decades . \\n\\nNotably , Sweden\\ 's foreign-born population ( 16.5 % ) [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) is large than the US\\ 's foreign-born population [ ( 14.3 % ) ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) . \\n\\nSweden is a bigger immigrant country than the United States and has been this way for years . In 2014 , 21.5 % of Sweden\\ 's population was either born abroad or had both parents born abroad . [ * ] ( http : //www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Befolkningens-sammansattning/Befolkningsstatistik/25788/25795/Helarsstatistik -- -Riket/26040/ ) \\n\\n & gt ; What I mean is that unless an immigrant strips themselves of all heritage , they will not fit in to most European countries . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not true . Europe is very diverse and these issues will depend , to begin with , on where you are in Europe . Second , you have to define \ '' fit in\ '' to get anywhere with this.\\n\\n & gt ; Your statement even highlights it . You are taking a group that has a ton of commonalities and separating them into different groups based on minor language differences . \\n\\nThat\\ 's not the case . The differences are much more than linguistic and go right into hundreds of years of traditional , religion and even where they live and what they surivive on . It\\ 's like speaking of the Amish or Texas Germans to some extent ( though a deceptive comparison ) in that these two groups are also American . \\n\\n & gt ; Any time a distinction like that HAS to be made shows how closely one holds on to even a regional identity and will alienate those not sharing that identity . \\n\\nYes , but your are missing this : that identity can still be included in the conservative national identity , just like variations within nation states elsewhere .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"Yeah , foreign aid workers . In any case , that was not the effect of your argument , so you\\ 're being dishonest . You were clearly implying that immigration is going to work out because it creates demand , which in turn creates jobs .

It is accurate that it is recommended by certain style guides used in the UK . However , English has many different styles guides where rules on hyphenation differ based on a ) country/reigion , b ) field of discourse , c ) publication/in-house editing , d ) hyphenation in many cases being left to the writer\\ 's judgment and so on .",Germanic,Swedish
AFAIAA,europe,"I did not write that the euro destabilized the economy of Sweden , I wrote \ '' create a destructive economic unit to destabilise national economies\ '' . The EU has , for instance , ruined Greece , which I mentioned . Largely this was facilitated by a system in which monetary policy is controlled by unaccountable bureaucrats at the European Central Bank . After the 2008 Financial Crisis a series of enoromous transfers of wealth from taxpayers to financial institutions took place , but they were not enough to stabilise the system because the fundamental structures surrounding the euro aren\\'t capable of doing that . The EU needs to either completely restructure its financial institutions or put checks and balances in place to prevent destroying the very economic zone it hopes to create . But there\\ 's hope there , the EU is so undemocratic and poorly structured it is currently destroying itself from within . \\n\\nConcerning Sweden , the EU constitutes a big economic investment with a relatively small economic return . Its policies towards Greece have directly affected Swedish banking , industry and stock markets . It has paralysed Swedish agriculture and it has given Sweden a large population of unemployable , antisocial Romani . Due to its own idiocy and the influence of its overlords in the EU , Sweden has been hugely affected by the migrant crisis , which is crippling the country\\ 's police force and social services , among other state functions . Swedish export and employment have been affected by the EU\\ 's monetary policies and so on . \\n\\nThe majority of laws and regulations that decide over Sweden today come from the EU : Sweden pays a fee every year to let the EU decide more and more over Sweden , which has undermined Swedish representative democracy . The EU inefficiently places decision-making powers at a supranational level when these same powers can and have long been efficiently carried out at national level . The EU is thus not only undemocratic but also inefficient . This supranational structure in itself entails that power is moved further and further away from Swedish voters and that the EU does not have Sweden\\ 's best interests in mind . As mentioned above , economic sovereignty has been profoundly undermined by the EU , which in turn means that local economies and socio-economic policies increasingly fall into the hands of supranational EU bureaucrats who do not have a particular nation state\\ 's best in mind .",Germanic,Swedish

What\\ 's relevant in this case is how that thing functions . The Third Reich was democratically elected , but according to your reasoning , it is incorrect to call the Third Reich\\ 's Reichstag undemocratic.\\n\\nRegarding EU\\ 's so-called democracy , there are problems with things like accountability , representation and legitimacy . The problems include low trust in the EU , low voter turnouts in EU elections , and national elections for EU seats that focus on national issues when the EU is a supranational organisation . There are no EU-wide parties and there are no actual EU elections . National issues voted on that get national politicans voted into the EU only have indirect influence on actual EU-level issues .

The coastal battery , which was the main defence weapon was missing its fire control system due to maintenance ! Luckily they did manage to get a new fire control system , one which was very modern and mobile , in place by the evening . \\n\\nThe personell at the battery followed the Soviet ships advance towards the border . \ '' *1000 meters , three minutes ! *\ '' Was called out and the mood was tense in the control room.\\n\\nThe next call out was \ '' *700 meters , two minutes ! \ '' , and at about that time the Major in charge thought \ '' *We are probably at war now*\ '' . The decision was made to put the battery into war-mode , which included changing the radio operations into frequency-hopping , a feature that at the time wasn\\'t allowed to be used in peacetime in Sweden . \\n\\nWithin a minute after that the Soviet ships had stopped , just outside the border . Apparently they sent out a transmission saying that something wasn\\'t right and that they were waiting for new orders . \\n\\nThe Soviets did try to make a dash with a tug the day after , but it was stopped by the Swedish sub *HMS Neptun* . Swedish *J\u00e4gare* , basically Swedish commandos/rangers , were guarding the sub at all times as well . They also had the commander , who liked to stand on the tower of the sub , in a sniper sight at all times . If anything were to happen they would board the ship.\\n\\nMore Soviet ships were arriving at the border , and they planned to take the sub by force at 03.00 the next night . However the attack was called off at 02.30 the same night . The reason is supposed to be that Sweden has had the time to mobilize a much larger force at the site at that time . \\n\\nIn the end Swedish tugs got the Soviet sub afloat again and it was escorted to the border.\\n\\nWiki article : https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363\\n\\nA short film made by the Swedish Military shows how it looked at the site : https : //vimeo.com/11072021",Germanic,Swedish

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"& gt ; Certain countries have \u201cunwritten constitutions , \u201d a group of separate documents which , taken together , functions as a whole . Ours is simply a single document for all fundamental laws.\\n\\nMainly the UK in the first case . \\n\\nI can only do a comparison to the Swedish constitution since I\\ 'm fairly familiar to that one . We have four fundamental laws , but the definition of the word \ '' law\ '' is a bit different . I get the feeling n the internet a \ '' law\ '' is mostly referring to an \ '' article\ '' . The most important fundamental law is the instrument of government , and that\\ 's the one I will refer to from this moment on.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know . You said your newest constitution was put in place to avoid amending an older one , and it\\ 's just a comparison.\\n\\nIn that case I wasn\\'t clear enough . The main reason was that a big part of it had fallen into obsolescence . Therefore it was rewritten from the ground up . A big change was the move from a two chamber parliament to a unichamber . \\n\\nIt has then been amended many times , latest in 2014 . In order to amend it you need a simple majority , but two times and have a general election in between.\\n\\n & gt ; In any case , I still don\\'t see why you think we should write an entirely new constitution.\\n\\nWriting a new constitution doesn\\'t have to mean that you do away with everything old . Sure , you can amend it but there are some pretty troublesome parts in your constitution , such as the electoral college.\\n\\n & gt ; Is that not similar to your country\\ 's highest courts ? \\n\\nActually , no . But I know that we\\ 're the odd ones here . Courts ( any court ) can test if the application of a law is in accordance of the fundamental law in each specific case . But they can not dismiss a law as \ '' unconstitutional\ '' . Before a law comes into effect it passes through the \ '' council on legislation\ '' which may point to problems with the laws . The government is being watched by the \ '' Committee on the Constitution\ '' . But as I said , we\\ 're pretty odd in that . \\n\\nThe point I was trying to make was that instead of interoperating old laws it might be better to rewrite them so they make sense . \\n\\n & gt ; I did say that . The Bill of Rights merely protects these rights , holding them as granted by default.\\n\\nHmm , the only thing which remotely resembles that is [ allemansr\u00e4tten ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam ) , which isn\\'t defined what it includes or not . But it is granted by the constitution by the 2nd chapter , 15th article , 4th paragraph : \\n\\n\ '' Everyone shall have access to the natural environment in accordance with the right of public\\naccess , notwithstanding the above provisions.\ '' \\n\\nBut then again , doesn\\'t that make it the other way around ?

Jack might be a rule , for instance no use of names , if you say someone\\ 's name you drink . Queen might be ladies , and King guys . Ace is often a \ '' waterfall\ '' , meaning everyone drinks and they might not stop until the person on their right stops.\\n\\nOther games include \ '' Matt Damon\ '' , for this you need at least two big plastic cups and a number of bottle caps . Two persons get one cup each , it doesn\\'t matter who . However the cups should be halfway around from each other . The persons with the cups each place one cap in the palm of their hand , and by hitting the underside of the table with the top of their fingers they will try to get the cap to fly into the cup . \\n\\nIf you miss you keep trying until you hit .

Today for instance we hade sunrise at 02:13 , and sunset will be at 22:47 , but to be honest it doesn\\'t really get dark , it\\ 's more like a dusk/dawn setting . Tomorrow we will have sunrise at 02:09 and sunset at 22:51 . So we will \ '' gain\ '' 8 minuets of sunlight over just 24 hours .

In all cases of dismissal the employee should , if possible , be offered a different position at the same employer , or to improve the working situation for the employee.\\n\\nMost of the times you get dismissed not for personal reasons but due to lack of work at the employer .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"About Swedish healthcare.\\nSweden is divided into 20 countys , and it\\ 's the county that\\ 's responsible for healthcare and the insurance of its inhabitants . This means that there are some variations throughout the country . But generally speaking a visit to the ER will cost you about 100 SEK . When you reach 1100 SEK over a 12-month period you don\\'t have to pay the fees for the reminder . The same is also true if you reach 2200 SEK for prescription drugs.\\nThere is also a lot of private health care in Sweden . However most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . Meaning it\\ 's funded through the countys and you don\\'t pay anything extra just because it\\ 's private . Also , according to law you have the right to choose your \ '' home clinic\ '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here.\\nThere exists some private healthcare that isn\\'t funded by the countys as well . And because of that there also exists private health insurance . These cost between 90 and 450 SEK/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what\\ 's included.\\n\\nNow , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc . I for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually I can go there the next day . At the ER it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . But yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times.\\n\\nI have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . Also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the National Board of Health and Welfare.\\n\\nAnd lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . You can also access it on the web att [ 1177.se ] ( http : //www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time..",Germanic,Swedish
