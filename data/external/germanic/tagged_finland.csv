Critics described the measures as a \u201csticking plaster\u201d . \\n\\nAfter a fourth night of disorder at Calais , when the French authorities faced more than 1,000 attempts by migrants to reach the tunnel , striking French ferry workers added to the misery by burning tyres to block routes to the port . \\n\\nWith the average queueing time for lorry drivers on this side of the tunnel at 18 hours , and congestion on Kent\u2019s roads hitting local businesses and residents\u2019 daily lives , trucks will now be diverted onto Ministry of Defence land near Folkestone to keep the roads clear.\\n\\nMr Cameron called the situation \ '' unacceptable\ '' and said : *\ '' This is going to be a difficult issue right across the summer .

Mr Cameron was due to discuss the problem with the French president Francois Hollande on Friday night.\\n\\nThe migrants\u2019 desperation to get to Britain was typified by photographs of two men clinging to the top of a lorry coming out of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone . \\n\\nThe lorry belonged to the Belgian rental firm ATL , which said it had not been contacted by the British authorities or the rental driver , and did not even know about the incident until contacted by The Telegraph .

Arquinas,europe,"Well , really hard to think of many things . Most stereotypes are only half true.\\n\\nI guess I should say , \ '' lack of politeness\ '' . Finnish language has a different plural and singular form for \\'you\\ ' . Plural rarely gets used . And we don\\'t generally call anyone mr/mrs/miss ( Unless you\\ 're on super official business/dealing with high-value foreigners like hotel receptionist or your boss just suffers from some delusions ) For example , people working for the president probably call him Mr. President or some variant but if he\\ 's visiting or talking to random people they\\ 'll just probably call him by his nickname.\\n\\nMost people subconsciously use the plural form when talking to old people ( I do ) , but it\\ 's not necessary . Teachers are mostly referred by their first name or their occupation by slang unless your school is so big that referring them to by surname is easier.\\n\\nNow I might be talking out of my ass but this extends into work life too . Nobody really talks to their boss like a superior . They talk to their boss like he\\ 's just another dude working there.\\n\\nIf I\\ 'm travelling this is really the only rule I stick to . I don\\'t want to come off as rude to any foreigner but I think referring to other people consciously as sir or madam or plural you is humiliating.\\n\\n\\nThis really only came to my mind because someone once told me a story about a german CEO who was hired into a finnish company and was really confused at first because nobody referred to him like he expected to . Heard that he ended up loving the idea so much that he brought his family with him and stayed here .",Germanic,Finnish
