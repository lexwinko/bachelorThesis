0x424242,india,"Well , in TN Higher Secondary Boards , there are a select set of schools , the usual suspects ( S.V Mandhir , SRV , SKV , DAV ) that get State Ranks . I studied at S.V Mandhir , almost a Decade back , and trust me I know how these schools work . They start teaching 12th right from your 11th grade . School hours are 7:00 to 20:00 ; If you 're in hostel then your hours are 4:00 to 22:00 . So , yeah . I could say with confidence that you ca n't buy your way out to get state ranks . If your goal is only to pass , then you do n't need to do shit . Just make sure you answer all the questions with ( BS ) answers . You 're good to go .",Germanic,Swedish
0x424242,india,Why does it have to be fishy ? Perhaps it might come off as a surprise to people who are n't from TN . But there are a bunch of schools in TN where everyone scores really well . Check this [ one ] ( https : //results.reportbee.com/2016/tn/12/school/34KGI425 ) out . Consistent 90 % + school average for the last 7 years . It is very common to see 20-30 students from this school every year in each of the state 's top 5 Engineering colleges .,Germanic,Swedish
0x424242,india,"90 percent average is on their total score , which includes language papers . Engineering Cut-Off for the state 's best college ( College of Engineering , Guindy ) are CS - 199/200 , ECE - 199.25/200 , EEE - 198.75/200 , Medical Cutoff for Government Colleges in TN is 198.25/200 , which as you see are all above SRCC 's 99 . Appreciate the sarcasm . Perhaps I was n't clear enough . I do n't think them of as genius either . They just know how to score marks in their higher secondary boards without cheating . They spend 18 hours a day for over 2 years reading the same books . They get slut shamed if their cut-off in the billion mock exams which happens throughout a year is less than 190 . So , yeah , more than 50 in a school scoring 99 % ( 198 ) cutoff is not a huge surprise . It has been happening for years . So , you claiming it to be 'fishy ' based on your 'instincts ' is too 'Donald Trump-esque ' and not fair to the students , though they had spent 2 years doing meaningless shit .",Germanic,Swedish
0x424242,india,"I totally agree that TN board is rather shitty with the syllabus . And I agree it is unfair for students from other boards or CBSE . I appreciate if SRCC , or even TN Engineering colleges start conducting entrance examiniations , so that it can be a fair game . What I do n't agree with is you citing the school average/cutoff to indicate that the school as a whole is cheating to achieve the results , as in Bihar .",Germanic,Swedish

The problem usually is the clouds which when set in , will remain for weeks , and mask all the little hours of winter sunshine . Winters are quite cold ( -15 to -20 ) too . The best months of Sweden are June , July , and August . The whole of Sweden shuts down during July ( I kid you not ) to spend their time with their families . Other than that , it is typical welfare state with high taxes ( ~50 % [ Direct + Indirect ] ) providing for very generous benefits . * 480 days of paid Parental Leave * 28 days of paid Vacation with extra vacation pay per day . * Free Healthcare above a ceiling of 1000 SEK/yr . * Free Education . * A monthly subsidy of 1000kr per child until the age of 18 , after 18 they get paid monthly to go to school/uni . * Unlimited VAB - Vard av Barn - During which the parent is paid 80 % of their salary during their leave of absence , if they are taking care of their sick child .

Stockholm is the home of Ericsson , and Gothenburg is the home of Volvo , so plenty of history there . Other smaller cities like Karlstad , Jonköping are situated on the borders of two gigantic lakes , which are several thousand sq km in size . Most other cities are university towns , Lund , Linköping , Uppsala , and are even smaller . The major source of subcontinent people are the Universities . Free education to non-eu students was cancelled around 2010/11 , I think . But then the Universities started providing shit tons of scholarships for non-eu folks that would entail you almost a free ride for the whole two years , making it a very cheap destination for a Masters Degree when compared to The US , or The UK . 4 years ago when I started school here in Gothenburg , around 60 out of these 80 scholarships went to the Indians .

Trading and teamplya is vital . If you see a teammate peaking or that 's about to peak , ask if he needs a flash or something . Be ready to step out and trade ; a 4v4 will help you a lot , a 4v5 is quite a disadvantage . You do n't have to take positions at the beginning of the round . It is perfectly OK to let the CTs have banana & amp ; apartments and to take it later in the round , when they have spent most of their grenades . Try to bait out as many nades as possible . Holding off a retake : if you 've played by the book , and no shenanigans have happened ( they will happen , trust me ) so it 's a normal 3v3 retake , both bombsites ( especially A ) are very hard to retake just due to the sheer amount of angles a CT has to check .

1008oh,battlefield_one,"I have n't touched it since before the release of TSNP , exept for a 6 hour session 3 weeks ago . Then I realized that this game was in a way different than BF3/BF4 . Nowadays I rather play BF4 than BF1 . These are the reasons I can think about why I left this game : 1 . Customization . I was a big fan of all the attachments/weapons/camo/gadgets that existed in BF4 . Even though most attachements had the exact stats , I liked the ability to choose between different weapons , and changing them according to the map and the faction I was playing ( US on Siege of Shanghai - & gt ; Run M16A4 w/o any attachments and UCP camouflage for example ) . This is the biggest point for me , and probably the # 1 reason I left BF1 . 2 . Conquest . Ever since I first touched the BF3 beta in 2011 ( wew , was that really 6 years ago ) , I 've been breathing and living conquest . It combines infantry , armored , aerial , and with BF4 also naval combat into one gamemode . What more can be asked for ? With BF1 and the changes to conquest , almost all my joy for that gamemode has been lost . I feel like vehicles have less of an effect on the objectives , and that it 's more infantry fighting infantry . The points system is also a step down from the previous one , where it is usually very easy to tell who is going to win only after a team reaches 200 points . This point also leads nicely into the next one : 3 . Map design . The maps are all so linear , leading into both teams clashing down 25vs25 on the central objective . This makes the fights way more chaotic and means that the first team to capture the central point goes on to win the match . 4 . The trend towards a more `` casual '' game . I guess this is more of a personal opinion , and that DICE had to make the game more casual in order to appeal to a larger audience . I do n't blame them for this . This does n't mean that I did n't like the game ; it 's just that I enjoy BF4 a lot more . BF1 did have some really nice stuff to offer : * Behemoths . I loved the concept , I just think that they have a little too little HP , as they are easily destroyed by a team that makes destroying the behemoth their primary goal , where it does n't have the time to have a significant impact on the game and help the losing team recover and come back . * Sound design . I could mention graphics , but I feel as if we could have had BF1 level graphics in BF4 , but that the average PC/console ( XB1/PS4 released in 2013 ) would not have handled it . The sound however has less to do with specs and more with what of a great job DICE has done in BF1 . The guns , the screams , the steps , the vehicles and the ambient sounds are all just so much better . * Limpet charges . No one ever sees them coming : ) Edit : formatting",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake Inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with Inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until Inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could Inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty . Instead , i see many benifits with bringing in Inferno without removing any map , effectivly increasing the map pool to 8 maps . Firstly , it is the only logical move to do . As I ’ ve said multiple times already , no map deserves to be taken out of active duty . Inferno was remade to make it more viable in professional matches , and will make its way back into the pro scene . If no map can be removed , just expand the pool . Secondly , it allows for other maps to come back to CS : GO , or evn for brand new maps like overpass to be born . Before overpass was introduced , no one would have thought that Valve would create a map from scratch to then force it into professional play . With a bigger map pool , the addition of a new map has a lesser impact on the current professional scene . One new map in a map pool of eight maps in total is going to stagnate the pro scene a lot less than the swap of a map in a pool of seven maps . A valid point to make is the burden placed upon the professional teams . As the number of maps increase , the amount of work required by the pro teams also increases . This may seem like a concern , but this is only due to the bad map draft cutrrently used at major events , where the last map is always selected randomly which requires a team to be very sharp on at least four maps : their own pick , and all three that remain in the randomizer . By increasing the map pool to eight maps , the pick-ban system can be redesigned to work in a very favorable way . Valve ’ s argument for the random third map has been to increase the diversity of maps played , while in CS 1.6 , the maps were banned down until one was remaining . With eight maps , the system could look like this : -First , both team get to ban a map , their “ permaban ” . -Then , both teams pick a map out of the six remaining . -Now , both teams get to ban a map again , reducing the remaining amount of maps to two . -The last map is selected randomly . Technically , by putting in the same work of studying four maps , a team can learn an own favorite map , the favorite map of their opponents as well as both the maps in the randomizer . This should lead to much more interesting BO3 series with closer games , since the teams are given more opportunity to study each other . **Conclusion** The current CS : GO map pool is fairly balanced , with all maps , exept nuke which still should be given time to grow , are quite enjoyed by the community as well as the professional scene . Before the reintroduction of Inferno to competitive play , it is worth considering the possibilities surrounding the active duty map pool . As no map has a real valid reason to be taken away from professional play , a good alternative is to add Inferno without removing any other map , effectivly increasing the map pool to eight maps . In the process , the pick-ban system at major and minor events should be changed in order togive the teams more control over the third map whilst retaining the randomizer for the purpose of variation : let each team ban once , pick once , ban once again and randomize between the last two maps remaining . This should lead to teams being more capable of preparing for events , as well as giving the spectators a better viewing experience , as a consequence of closer map scores . TL ; DR : Reading a TL ; DR is not enough to participate in a discussion I feel like , but if you want to just quickly realize what my thoughts are , just read the conclusion .",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"Valve does n't go after these sites because they are using bots . They go after them because they use the steam services commercially . In the letter they write : `` Under the SSA Steam and Steam services are licensed to personal , non-commercial use only . '' In the subscriber agreement , this is also clearly stated : `` Valve hereby grants , and you accept , a non-exclusive license and right , to use the Content and Services for your personal , non-commercial use ( except where commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable Subscription Terms ) . '' These sites would need a special license to make any buisness , which I do not think Valve will either give out to any site . If there are any sites that applied for a special license , I do not think it will be renewed . The result ? Valve can **shut down any gambling site they want** , based on the fact that using steam to run a buisness is against the subscriber agreement . **TL ; DR** : Valve found a new way to force gambling sites to shut down that is much more general than the use of bots .

1008oh,AskReddit,"Background : in the second to last year of high school , the school I went to organizes 2 weeks of internship in Paris for all the students at that age , about 100 of them . This happened three years ago . You bring 100 17-year olds to a city abroad with only 6 teachers supervising everything , things are gon na get crazy . Because the internship lasted over a weekend , everyone had planned to do some serious partying . Without going into too much detail , I can say that the 70 of us that were at this massive place got realllllly drunk , all of us . Next thing you know , the police storm the place , apparently they got some info about drugs at said party ( which there were ) . They detain ofer 50 students who failed to give a proper id-card ( which is mandatory to have on you at all time in France ) . After 30 minutes or so , they decide to bring the most shitfaced people and the ones on drugs to the police station . The teachers got super worried when 30 students did n't check in that night , until a guy tells them they are being detained by the police . Those were good times",Germanic,Swedish

1008oh,battlefield_one,"Remember , you have a sniper rifle . It can acccuratly hit players up to 150 meters , and one shots in the head at any range . Use that to your advantage . In conquest , remember that it is not all about attacking flags ! Defense is actually very often forgotten . You are totally PTFO : ing if you 're at C and fending the enemies off when they are coming from D. You do n't have to ( and should n't ) be rushing in as the first guy , you 'll just die . If you however want to play aggressively , as everyone else says , use your sidearm after a hit . i like the Mars Automatic since it almost always finishes them off in one shot . Also , play with your team . you should n't be the first point of contact as a scout , or you 'll find 5 supports with BARs shooting at you . instead , let your teammates move up , check out the area while you spam spotting flares . Spam the `` Need Ammo '' button to get more . Make sure you take advantage of your range superiority . An automatico can do serious damage at 20m , but is almost useless at 40m . I would recommend you to use a marksman variant ( I use the gewehr 98 , good at long range while still excellent close up ) at lowest zoom since you can still get close and personal , while getting those 80-100m shots . Cheers from an overly aggressive scout .",Germanic,Swedish

123yo123,sadboys,"I did it . Every \___ is a song . Apparently Tiger came to be by him re-recording a verse on a really bad , old song of his and then having Whitearmor making a new , `` less serious '' beat to go with it . He says Tiger 's sound is unique on his mixtape . He says it 's his one of his own favourites and that he does n't care about people who say they do n't understand what he 's saying in it . _____ After Migos he says he loves their flow , that it 's like Future 's but more on-point , also enjoys their lyrics . They are real trendsetters with their flow . He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording . ___ After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much , like Hard in da Paint and Versace . He 's apparently called Sweden 's Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone ( Sad Boys manager ) , and Thaiboy himself agrees on that . ___ He loves auto-tune , it makes things better . Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who ca n't sing are able to by using auto-tune , like Chief Keef . People hate auto-tune because they 're conservative and need things to be `` real '' in order to enjoy it , and that you need talent to be able to sing . Auto-tune allows you to be creative in a new way and it 's modern . The interviewer asked if he ever feels like he 's crossing boundaries when he makes music , and he says he feels like he does that a lot , examples being Fuck U . The lyrics make no sense , the melody makes no sense , but the song 's feeling makes sense and that 's all his music is about , the feeling . ___ He started making music in a serious way last summer , people started hating because it sounded pretty bad . Last winter he decided to add auto-tune and now you can catch him on podcasts . Started from the bottom now he here . He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out . First he thought they 'd be like Migos , everybody featured on every track , but now it 's more like GBE with Chief Keef , everyone doing their own thing and occasiounally helping each other out on tracks . ___ Nothing really happens after the Kevin Gates song . ___ Describing boppin , he says it 's an easy dance where you just go low with them knees and go left to right . There are several levels of boppin : the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right , the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around , and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff . She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin . Yung Sherm is very good at it , but Ecco2k is the best one , Bladee and Whitearmor are probably the worst . ___ Conclusively , he says the mixtape will be finished when Whitearmor returns from the tour .",Germanic,Swedish

16dollars,SuicideWatch,"This reply is intended for you OP but I hope that some other lurker out there as well will benefit of it . 1 . In a relationship , be it a love , friendly or family one , there is a minimum of two persons . What a lot of us tend to forget is the amount of responsibility you have to take , or should *not* take , to maintain one . If you 're the one who is always calling your `` friend '' , maybe you should reconsider your friendship with this person ? Move on and try to find someone who cares for you . It may be a cliché but look at it from another perspective . You 're not boring - the people who do n't want to spend time to get to know you are . Basically - **if they do n't want to be your friend - fuck 'em . Their loss and not yours . ** Try contacting someone you have n't spoken to in a long time . I can almost guarantee that they 'll be happy that you reach out . Just have a chat and if it feels good take it a step further and meet . Just have a beer together , play some xbox or whatever you enjoy . And then you repeat . And repeat . And repeat . And then you reconnect with another person . And repeat . 2 . Have you tried internet dating ? It may sound a bit cheesy but it seems that a lot of people get something out of it . And if a date does n't work out , maybe you 've at least made a new friend ? 3 . Do you play any video games ? Voice chat is a minor social interaction but it still makes you connect with other people . Plus you 'll have something to talk about . A big warning though - excessive amount of playing video games can send you down an evil spiral ... Use it as a compliment and **not** a complete substitute for social interaction . 4 . Get out and do stuff . Take a cooking class , learn how to scuba dive , join the local bowling team . It 's the small things that keep you from killing yourself . Just think of it for a second . Suppose you actually took a cooking class . Ok , so you have to get there . You have to meet a bunch of new people and you get to cook something . Talk to some of the people there . Try something like `` hey , we should team up next week since our meatballs were so damn good '' . This means that you have to show up next week . Or one person will wonder what happened to you . You learn how to scuba dive . Sign up for a day trip with your club . Your [ buddy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_diving ) is going to ask you to pick him up at 11am . If you do n't show up two people will now wonder what happened to you . You join the local bowling team . Next sunday is your first game . If you do n't show up 10 people will wonder what happened to you . Maybe you feel that you have nothing in life that is worth living for . But try filling it with *something* and some good may come out of it . I 've been trying to live like this for the last couple of years and it does make a difference . I think you should give it a try , what do you have to lose ? Yes , I 'll admit that some days I still just want to put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger . But knowing that *someone* will miss you if you die can be a comfort albeit a small one .",Germanic,Swedish
