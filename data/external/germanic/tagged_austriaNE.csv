0x126,Amd,This is some choking pattern . I get that with my Fury on WOW since this game sometimes even pushes my 16thread cpu to 100 % ... In your case it 's clearly a underpowered CPU . ( Can also be RAM speed/size . BF1 consumes about 7GB ( 9.5 in total ) on my system . On 4K the 4GB vram is not enough . Have to lower stuff to medium for 4k @ 60fps ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Have that on my system too ( in wattman ) . Happens only on shitty programmed games ... WOW Legion in my case . BF1 is always 90-100 % on wow it jumps from 0 to 100 and back cause the gamecode is shitty optimized and way outdated . They ported ftom DX 8 to 9 and then from 9 to 11 . Wrapping and changing is not optimizing . My 16 threads are at 100 % in wow at some places and gpu drops to 5 % usage ... that is really sad since no difference can be seen .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Same here like dragnar . I have my fury now and 800€ for a TI that does 10fps more on 4k ultra is n't a reason to upgrade at that insane costs . Vega may lower prices , support freesync 4k @ 60 ( which is what i need ) and be 100€ cheaper . Nobrainer to wait another 5 months till vega is on sale before Christmas .

0x126,Amd,"Use search function , read QVL list on Mobo site and buy accordingly . There are a trillion Mem OC threads already . There is a tech support thread . Have fun .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Basically : 2133MHz is the base frequency of DDR4 everything above is an overclock . Setting only the mem . frequency or using XMP is not a OC . XMP is for Intel platform . on AMD it is called DOCP . You have to set - frequency , DDR-voltage , the DDR reset voltage , the calculated timings ( yes , calculate them or try & amp ; error them ) and the SOC voltage ( only AMD afaik ) . The QVL gives you tested setups that work . Better would be to get certified RAM . If you have a 3200MHz rated kit , you should easily get 3000MHz OC ( use XMP , set only the MHz to 3000 - worth a try ) . I use a RAM kit that is not even listed on my QVL and running it at 2666MHz of it 's rated 3000 ( rated Vendor* ) . I have lower MHz but could do a CL14 instead of a CL15 ; ) The most importand thing is to use the latest bios with AGESA 1.0.0.6 because there are much moch settings and more stable OC possible . Hope this helps you somehow .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Idk about the PLUS but on the B350-A Prime I ran the RAM at 2666MHz pre AGESA 1006 . On my current board ( Fatal1ty x370 K4 ) the CMK16GX4M2B3000C15 runs at 2666MHz with CL14 ! So I 'm happy .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,that is the more pragmatic approach which I picked too ( get the cheapest with highest MHz and run it at best speed ) . This is the way to go for advanced users who can adjust their OC themselfs and not relay on XMP or auto OC,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Since 1700 = 1700x = 1800x i guess with good air cooling 150W+ it should be possible . A good 1700 silicon should clock to 4GHz like the 1800X does . XFR idk if I need that ^^,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"Ok so there are many reasons that could happen . First of all it does not seem to be a power throttling ( but you can always go to full % since it only consumes what it needs ) . Temp throttle at 76°C is also excluded . So the most common thing left is that the VRAM is full or the RAM . 8GB of VRAM are only maxed out on AAA titles in 4k with AA fully on so - nope . Since your paging file is 11GB ? ? ? I think that this is the problem . Mine is mostly 0-200MB with 32GB RAM Close all other apps and play around with the settings of the game . Vertical Sync may also be leading to downclocking or some other target setting for FPS . The card seems fine , there has to be some periferal problem ( HDD , RAM ) . Do you often switch to the desktop ? or how do you play ? windowed or full-widowed or fullscreen ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,no it 's not normal . As a wrote this may have nothing to do with the GPU but rather the RAM/Paging/HDD read/write . open the task manager and look at the performance graph of RAM and HDD . Even huge number of page faults or read/write errors may be a hint ; ),Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,I gave back the reference 480 and getting the Red Devil too . Best after market cooler after intensive research .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you did n't change the fan curve and throttle at 85-90°C in the best case . in the worst you throttle because of power draw ^^ if you have some G/V/Free-sync at 1080p on it does n't matter but when I used the reference card with 4k it jumped from 40 to 28 and up to 35 FPS in seconds . horrific . stable clock with power limit up and fan ramped up got me to 70° ... and a vacuum right next to my head . going for custom cooler now .,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,This makes total sense . Vega 11 is maybe between 6TF of 480 and Vega 10 . Paired with HBM 2 Vega 10 has to compete with Future Titan X . Going from Furys TF is considering better architecture and or higher clocks feasable .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,The reason is stability . My old GT 8800 ruined my PCIe slot while hanging in there ( case screws were not enough ) .

0x126,Amd,"This is a new architecture .

Since I just wanted to check the headroom , I now have clocked all cores to 3.5GHz at 1.18V with ~35°C idle since I do n't need the power yet . All games I play are limited by the GFX card . All applications I use are 1.5-3times faster than with my old 2500k . Ryzen Master does not set the VCC correct ( HW monitor showed other than was set , higher ! ! ) - so do it in bios ! It is sufficient to set the voltage offset +0.12V for ~3.8GHz was it for me and the multiplier to 38.5 ( or play around with the multiplier and divider values till you get there ) Edit : only crashes I experienced were to low voltage or to high temps .

0x126,Amd,"It 's not pointless . It 's better binned ( other thread with analysis of 90cpus ) and clocked higher to start with .

0x126,Amd,Mine does 3.8GHz at 1.28V So I guess if you do n't get the lottery silicon you just have to put +0.05V on it - which with your watercooling is no problem . I run that on the Wraith Stealth ( I think it is the stealth ! ),Germanic,German

So I could push it up there with 1.35v , CL 15-17-17-17-36 and 2933 ( 3000 ) MHz . My mobo does n't store that correctly ( works for one boot fully stable . Then it gets reset - buggy ) .

0x126,Amd,WoW ok no b350 will have the vrms to oc 1800x to max . I ordered the asus board since it supports up to 3200. there is the plus that supports two cards but not mATX anymore . Is that even possible in sizes ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Maybe not boosted to max ? running on 4.5GHz while boost should be 5GHz could mean 100 % but overall ( of possible ) only 80 %,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Still thereis the issue of not utilizing the power of 1700 . Even well threaded games seem to underperform currently . My guess is microcode ( windows fix needed ) or caching problem ( bios fix needed ) .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Software Problem ! Bios - windows- microcode - threading - optimized only for intel ? We will know soon hopefully !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Well preventing windows from randomly switching tasks between ccx would be sufficient for most purposes .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess not outbound,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Mindfactory.de has numbers . Hundreds there . Problem is , that was the best supplied seller . So my bet is shortage too .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,There is a full thread on the problem . Windows switches tasks from core to core but even over the core complexes ( ccx ) where it is slow . This does not happen with cpu only tasks ( therefore good benchmarks ! ) . Additionally powersaving features and memory bios problems . Wait some days for fixes . Then come back for new benchmarks ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"No no this sub clearly always stated that its 5 % below skylake and best for general use , not gaming special . Anyway if you keeping it , wait for the memory , scheduler and microcode fixes that reduce the gaming performance compared to benchmarks . For me it 's a huge upgrade from 2500k . But if gaming would be my focus i 'd get a 6600k and a 1070 for 1080p and a 1080 ti for 4k",Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,Yes he is good at what he does . Works at caseking.de btw 8auer means Bauer which means builder ( edit : constructor ? ) or farmer in german . So I like to read it as The Farmer : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,In normal conditions yes but amd cpus are voltage torture resistant . So LN2 and 1.6volt do n't kill it ; ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I put 16GB ram ontop of my 1700 box but still 0.0GHz and 0 fps . Ordered 3000MHz ram but does not help !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Me not since bios ( memory ) , microcode and windows scheduler patches still need to fix many issues . after that it should be 5-10 % better in games ( that are shitty optimised if at all for intel ) . After these improvements R7 should be in games too where it belongs : - on par with 6900k - 5-8 % lower than 7700k in 4c max engines",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,currently with all the broken bios and scheduling problems yes . but non gaming ( GPU communication and CCX switching ) are the same or ahead so there are some software problems open !,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,downvote without a comment ? thats lame guys . nothing wrong with my comment . look up the CCX thread moving issue yourself . holy crap : D,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Have n't seen these . Thanks mate ! But it does not help to deactivate the whole CCX haha That is nice to see more clear that Ryzen has lower IPC than Kaby but what prevents gaming performance like a 6900k is that switching threads from one ccx to another goes by RAM and not L3 which makes a difference in time in the order of a magnitude . Since windows does this automatically ( god why ? keep temps lower ? idk.. ) this is a problem on fps but not on usual benchmarks ( one task per core , overall delays are fine cause end result counts ! )",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Should have bought a better gfx card..,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Delivery probably 9.march or 16.march Only in germany there are plenty but would cost me 20€ shipping : (,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Ok so that is what can be zen 2 - 5ghz on air,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,So what do you suppose ? Test at 480p at 500+fps to take out the gpu of the equation ? 1080p with a 1080 is a better setup than 80 % of gamers would get since a 1070 is already suited better for 1440p I still do n't get why the benchmarks are that off on GN . Sure IPC is lower but that crippled result seems to be some caching problem or motherboard problem . Will see the next days,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,It 's fake or 1700 @ 4GHz is only 50points behind a 7700k @ 4.2GHz in single core . http : //imgur.com/a/JWYaI So I do n't see any reason other than the OC space ( for DX11 gaming only builds - who does that ? ) on the 7700k to go for the 7700k ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,A single compile is never the problem but like in media editing you have to check what shit you did . 5seconds can add up to weeks that are lost . Testing environments ( emulators for mobile ) are resource eaters . The more the better !,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"yeah but you get +4c +8t for all the workload ahead and games are maxed out with 4cores currently ( DX11 are fine even with 2c ) So why bother ? in 2 years even 1700 & gt ; & gt ; 7700k ; ) Edit : what I mean is , i buy a 1700 over a 7700k cause more cores , almost same 1080p be better next 4-6 years . that simple .",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,"Hi /u/AMD_Robert , first thanks for your work . Second : will it be possible to store or share OC profiles ( Edit : online ) for games and applications ? e.g . disabling 4 cores and oc others higher ? Since it is possible with Ryzen Master to store those localy will there be a import/export function ?",Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Got the 1700 still happy I preordered since my 2500k had to go anyway . Mainboard not yet chosen - since this is the real critical thing . Does it support 3200MHz DDR yet ? Do I go for a B350 or the X370 for future upgrades / APU use on one ? How do prices react the next few days ?,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,I guess it is more a software or mainboard problem with the review all over the place . it makes no sense that these CPUs die in games like flies . Anyway why would you choose 4c over 8c ? because of 5fps ? That is crazy stupid,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,With a mid range CPU and a SSD yes sure . If not you got a CPU bottleneck or in another place . Totally correct . He elaborated it again later .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,then you should have wrote that somewhere ; ) the minimum are HUGE btw,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,there is another thread that states other issues currently not solved . This is only one of them but can be seen as you mentioned in the 4+0 and 2+2 fps . 12fps are about 10-12 % which in turn would be 16fps with all cores . only this problem alone : ),Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Cache management seems off the rail on some boards ( other thread looked it up ) . Which would be reasonable : in fully threaded benchmarks only the core cache is used heavily ; in games the commom cache SHOUD be used too since multiple threads work with same materials . Hence the issue could be windows driver or bios . Iff there is any . Idk . Plz asus let me buy the mobo and do my build . Please .,Germanic,German
0x126,Amd,Waiting for stock in germany/austria of anything currently . Only some shops have mobos with 20€ shipping costs ... that is too much,Germanic,German

0x126,Amd,"If you game , why would you get a Ryzen ? This is a workload CPU not a high clocked gaming CPU : ) You may have to wait till all problems are sorted out ( May ? ) to use full capability of ryzen .

0x126,Amd,"Low FPS not dropping like shit . So with ryzen you get lower average and peaks but higher consistent lows .

0x126,Amd,"So why does it in some games and others not ? LOL yes . Games use the same resources as other applications but are crafted to supply specifically the gpu . Hence it depends on HOW it is done and if the architecture is suited for this .

We had water in our basement ( about one inch in some places ) and very low water pressure in the house ( it was pretty infuriating trying to shower on the top floor ) . We thought the water in the basement was caused by cracks in the foundation and missing drainage of the soil around causing rainwater to be pushed through the floor . We also thought the low pressure was caused by an old and probably clogged meter , and because noone in our household REALLY cared we did n't do anything about it . But after the pressure did n't change after we replaced our meter as advised by our water supplyer my dad figured out the two problems might be connected . We hired a company to look into it and sure enought , after digging about four feet down we hit water .

Not many players will use that feature , im certain , but i don´t think it would be hard to add . * **Fix the DotA-TV camera** I think I dont have to say much about this . Just go watch a replay and try to change the camera to player-perspective . * **Please add a key-overlay to DotA-TV** I think an optional overlay in player-perspective that shows you what keys are being pressed by the player at the moment would be pretty nice .

17DF53E,skyrim,"They came without warning . Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound , and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count , wielding flame and foul sorcery , slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose . Of once-mighty Stonehall 's military strength only the Bronze Legion , led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin , was near enough to answer the call of battle . They rode into their city , fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets , cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion : an ethereal rift within the city square , and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion . Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer , the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade , cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil . Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast . It turned , smiling at her through a maze of teeth . Heedless of the battle raging around them , they charged one another . Deflecting blow after blow , the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them . Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her . The odds turned . The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly , a brutal thrust from the side , but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke . Blade scraped on blade , beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below , carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood . The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack , driving her blade through her foe 's flesh into the stampeding heart within . With a scream that split the clouds above , the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish . The stygian portal wavered , the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared . The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel . Though victorious , the survivors saw little to celebrate : the city lay in ruins , and survivors were few . Fires continued to spread . Unfurling her banners of war , Tresdin gathered what allies she could . Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss , and damned be any who would dare stand in her way .",Germanic,German

1L4V,DotA2,"**IT WAS THE REFLECT OF DUEL WITH AGHS ! COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT^so^so^so^sorry** We played against an Anti-Mage with Aghs and everytime our Necrophos ulted him he took 0 DMG from the ult . It did n't matter how much HP he had left . I could n't find any reason , he does n't take any dmg from Reaper Scythe . MatchID : 2989133401 Examples of what I am talking about : ( Time equals the Clock ingame ) **first time** Time : 63:31 on bot lane . He was duelled and ulted from Necrophos with around 1/4 of his HP . Reaper 's Scythe deals 0 DMG . In the combat Log only the debuff is stated , but nowhere any dmg . Spell Shield is on CD ( got popped by LC Duel ) . Lion Ult also does n't show up as dmg in combat Log , only as debuff and seems to deal no dmg . **game deciding time** Time : 65:27 mid lane where Dire Tier 2 would 've been . Again AM had Spell Shield on CD because of Duel and again he was Necro ulted with around 1/4 of his HP . In the **Combat Log** following is always written : > Anti-Mage receives modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff from Necrophos . > Anti-Mage loses modifier_necrolyte_reapers_scythe debuff . There is no DMG in the combat Log and 0 dmg was taken . Do I miss something completely obvious ? Or is there actually something broken ? Please someone look into this matter , because if this is true , then AM Aghs is bugged . REALLY bugged . Matchlink : dota2 : //matchid=2989133401 & matchtime=4004 **Edit 1 : ** LC had no Aghs . So that could n't be the problem **Edit 2 : ** CLEARED IT UP ! Thanks to u/Drakesfjord and u/DimitrijaT ! I have completely forgotten that the reflect is Aghs upgraded ... silly me ...",Germanic,German
