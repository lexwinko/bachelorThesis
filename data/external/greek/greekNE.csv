The west had invaded USSR in 1918 and USSR was allied with Nazi Germany until 1941 ( Molotov-Ribbentrop ) . & gt ; as soon as facism was removed Fascism was never `` removed '' .

ACircledSquare,todayilearned,"Not blaming it on Bush per se but giving free money willy nilly to everyone with high interest rates kind of reminds me the housing bubble . Anywho here are some sources . https : //carybankruptcy.com/blog/are-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy & gt ; After graduation , college students sometimes find themselves earning less money than expected and monthly student loan payments can quickly become quite troublesome . As stated above , ordinarily student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , but filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection may offer some assistance if graduates find themselves falling behind on student loan payments . Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects borrowers from having to repay student loans during the pendency of the chapter 13 plan . & gt ; & gt ; The only way a debtor can discharge either federally subsidized or private student loans is to prove that that repaying the student loan debt would impose an undue hardship . This is done by filing an adversary proceeding ancillary to the debtor ’ s bankruptcy case . The Brunner test is currently used in the Fourth Circuit , which includes the Eastern District of North Carolina , and requires that three conditions be met . First , the debtor must prove that a minimal standard of living can not be maintained while repaying the student loans . Second , other conditions must exist that suggest that the debtor ’ s poor financial circumstances will persist for a large percentage of the student loan repayment period . Finally , the debtor must prove that a good faith effort has been made to repay the loans prior to filing for bankruptcy . Fulfilling all of these requirements is difficult , but not impossible . http : //www.totalbankruptcy.com/overview/basics/student-loans-in-bankruptcy.aspx- - & gt ; Generally speaking , student loans are non-dischargeable debts that can not be eliminated through bankruptcy ; however , there are some rare exceptions . & gt ; & gt ; Prior to the bankruptcy law change in 2005 , student loans owed to private non-profit institutions were dischargeable , but the new bankruptcy law closed that exception . & gt ; & gt ; Currently , the only way to eliminate student loans in a bankruptcy is to file an adversary with the bankruptcy court and demonstrate that the student loans impose an `` undue hardship '' on you or your dependents . & gt ; & gt ; To learn whether your student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy , fill out the below form to talk to one of our sponsoring bankruptcy lawyers for free : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; The `` Undue Hardship '' Exception & gt ; & gt ; Bankruptcy judges have interpreted the `` undue hardship '' exception very favorably towards student loan lenders , and disability or other extreme circumstances are typically required to successfully eliminate student loans . & gt ; & gt ; A majority of jurisdictions require you to demonstrate the following : & gt ; & gt ; Repayment of the student loan would prevent you from maintaining an adequate standard of living & gt ; Your financial situation is unlikely to improve & gt ; You have made a good faith effort to repay the student loan & gt ; Adversary proceedings to determine the dischargeability of student loans can resemble a `` mini-trial '' and can be very time-consuming and complex . & gt ; & gt ; Accordingly , legal fees can be substantial and difficult to afford , especially for someone facing `` undue hardship '' . & gt ; & gt ; Chapter 13 and Student Loans & gt ; & gt ; Student Loans can be included in the 3-5 year repayment plan of your Chapter 13 bankruptcy , but you will be responsible for any remaining balance upon the completion of your bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; Anywhere from 10 % to 100 % of your student loan may be included in your bankruptcy , depending on your assets , debts , and income . & gt ; & gt ; Including your student loans in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers many protections and may provide you with short-term relief from collection activity . & gt ; & gt ; While you are in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , the student loan creditors are prohibited from adding any interest or penalties to your pre-petition debt and can not garnish your wages or place liens on your property . & gt ; & gt ; You can also request that the bankruptcy court make a final determination on the proper amount owed if there is a dispute as to the correct balance of the student loan . & gt ; & gt ; Speak to a Bankruptcy Lawyer Today & gt ; Student Loan Eligibility After Bankruptcy & gt ; & gt ; Generally speaking , a bankruptcy filing will not affect your eligibility for federal student loans . & gt ; & gt ; These government loans are based on need , not credit , and federal lenders are prohibited from denying a student loan solely based on your bankruptcy determination . & gt ; & gt ; However , federal lenders are allowed to consider your credit history since the bankruptcy when determining your willingness to repay the loan . They may also deny a request for further loans if your student loan is in default and not included in a repayment plan . & gt ; & gt ; Private student loan lenders may consider a previous bankruptcy filing when determining eligibility . & gt ; & gt ; Maintaining good credit after bankruptcy , repaying old student loans , and demonstrating a steady income are all factors that could influence a private lender to grant you a student loan even after a bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; A parent 's bankruptcy filing generally does not affect their children 's eligibility for a student loan , unless they are required as a cosigner on the loan . & gt ; & gt ; Debt After Graduation & gt ; & gt ; Of those students who do take out loans to finance their undergraduate education , some studies show that the average student loan debt is $ 20,000 . While most loans allow for a grace period for recent graduates , the likelihood of finding a full-time position that pays well enough for recent graduates to pay their loan bills is becoming increasingly slim . & gt ; & gt ; Advocates for student loan reform say that by eliminating subsidies to private lenders , the government will be able to make more Pell grants for low-income students while offering loans with fairer terms for those who require them . & gt ; & gt ; The above summary is by no means all-inclusive and is not legal advice . For the latest information on bankruptcy and student loans , speak to a bankruptcy attorney in your area . & gt ; & gt ;",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Can you please correct any miss understanding I may have for ZFS and GlusterFS ? Two identical servers with twi drives partitioned with ZFS . We use ZFS because ZFS is a good substitute for LVM , it also incorporates a form if its own version of RAID . But we want to take it a step further and user GlusterFS . We want to do this so we can offer the ZFS drives over the network and but also because we want replication of data in case of a major failure . This way if Server1 is completely destroyed , we can default to Server2 and still have access to the same data stored in the ZFS volumes . And here are my questions , conclusions . - ZFS offers a huge degree of scalability . By adding glusterfs we ensure redundant drives available across the network . - GlusterFS is NOT a filesystem ( like NFS , ext4 etc ) are . It is technology that offers redundancy . - GlusterFS is not to be confused with NFS , even though they are similarities . NFS is a filesystem that is available across the network ( similar as a Samba share ) . It is that and nothing else . On the other hand GlusterFS offers whatever filesystem you want to share ( can be ext4 , ext3 , btrfs ) across the network and it also allows for a huge degree of redundancy .

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,Hello folks . The environment is running on Centos 6 and 7.1 and 7.2 I am dealing with a repo that does not have the open-vm-tools rpm package . Syncing the repos so we can get the newest packages is simply not an option . Not for now at least . So what we want to do is the following : - wget the open-vm-tools for each release of Centos . - Copy it in the update directory - Run createrepo -- update on the update directory only . Is this going to work ? I am concerned about running the `` createrepo -- update '' command on the update directory only . Does n't the RPM database need to be aware about the packages on the other directories ? Not sure . This is a highly customized environment by the way . Thank you .,Greek,Greek

I am trying to setup replication of specific tables in PostgreSQL , like I used to do in one of my previous jobs while working with MS-SQL It appears as though this type of replication is not supported right out of the box with PostgreSQL . Is this correct ? At any rate , is this something worth going after in PostgreSQL or it is dangerous territory since it is not a `` out of the box '' feature ? Thank you .",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,Database,"Hello folks . I have worked for 6 years in a shop which I had to setup replication with MS-SQL in numerous customer sites . I was able to specify which tables I wanted to replicate and it was very straight forward to do so . However , what I am noticing in PostgreSQL , MySQL and possibly Oracle ( I have n't checked ) it does n't seem to be a straight forward process . It appears as if PostgreSQL and MySQL do not offer support right out of the box for these kinds of features . Is this kind of replication something that should be even attempted with these database engines ? Am I wrong ? Any thoughts ?",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Hello folks . So this week I have been playing around with HA and it has been great to say the least . I created two HAproxy servers with keepalived and they work . However I discovered that if for example on ServerA ( which would be the master/active server ) the HAproxy dies , keepalived has no way of knowing this and as a result it will still keep accepting requests and forward them to the Master server which no longer has HAProxy running . How would you deal with such a possible issue ? Having Nagios and monitoring tools is great but recovery should be done with extreme speed in situations like these . Did I miss something on the configuration of HAproxy ?",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You see , for me at least , this move that you are doing ( and let 's be clear I have nothing against you , I 'm sure you 're a nice bloke ) , the move that takes us **from what is constitutionally right , to what is politically right , ** Yes , because in this specific paragraph we are talking if Greeks are more or less naive than other nations and if so should people address it by doing an introspection of the events that were unfolded . You mentioned in your previous post `` You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves.. '' You somehow mix expressing one 's political opinion about the competence of the state as being anti-democratic . Now if the people were lied or were told half truths , that is a whole different debate and history will pass its final judgement . & gt ; How is it crass to say that people died in order to have true and proper elections in this country ? You said in your previous post `` but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey '' . & gt ; When it comes to serious issues , I have n't . As we are both members of the human race , allow me to not believe you when you say that you never , ever said in your life a comment that was just sarcastic and with no real substance . & gt ; According to him , all Greek governments are incompetent . That 's a ridiculous claim to make . Even I would n't make that claim . But , the governments , in any country do n't appear out of thin air , people vote for them . So , to say that X government is incompetent , would beg two questions : a ) for whom is this government incompetent and b ) what does this tell us about the electorate ? We are basically saying the same thing . The only difference is I have no qualms in saying the Government is complete idiotic because I do not directly associate the Government with its people . For example , I do not view Greeks are incompetent because they voted for Syriza , even though I view Syriza incompetent . Do I place blame to all of us Greeks for the cluster fuck of the last 45 years ? Yes I do , we should have known better and we did know better but this does n't mean I view Greeks as incompetent . I just view it as Greeks have to get their shit together . & gt ; I challenge you to find a single piece of evidence that the Greek debt was caused by the ordinary Greeks , and not by financial institutions , or dodgy deals . I will argue that financial institutions , or dodgy deals of course are at the core of the problem . However , to say that Greek citizens are not responsible as well is naive . Not paying your taxes , feeding into clientism are two examples of how Greek citizens fucked shit up as well . Of course you can argue that tax evation is a result of Governmental policies which then comes back to what you were saying , people elect their governments and should follow the policies of the Government they elected . If they are not happy then the people should change how things are done , as much as they can because I do realize corporate powers behind the scenes are sometimes extremely powerful .",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves . Every `` red line '' Siriza said would not be crossed , has been crossed . This new deal is even worst than before . Siriza was always saying about plan B and as it turns out it plan B never existed . Does this make Greeks incompetent or naive ? I would say no more than any other country that has been lied to by their politicians . So please , stop taking it so personally . & gt ; I do n't know where you 're from , or in what culture you 've grown in , but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey This is such a crass thing to say . How do you know if people in other countries care less or more about politics in their country ? Do you also understand that people in Democratic societies have shed blood for their right to vote and for their right to be free ? Funny you would mention about New Jersey but ... `` New Jersey played a significant role in the Revolutionary War . George Washington spent more time in New Jersey than anywhere else during the war . New Jersey 's strategic location made it a center of Revolutionary War activity . '' http : //www.revolutionarywarnewjersey.com/ & gt ; And also , perhaps you could have been more respectful to the people that voted for the current government ... ..but what you 're saying is simply ignorant , ridiculous , and **anti-democratic** I do n't understand this . Yes the comment of the previous poster may have been a sarcastic comment with no real substance but tell me who has n't done this before ? Are you going to tell me you have n't done it either ? Also , why do you demand a more respectful tone to what he wants to say ? Why do you view his tone as `` anti-democratic '' ? Why such an attachment to a Government ? As long as no hate speech is involved , who dictates what and how people express themselves . Democracy is messy , it is loud , it is difficult . And you know why it is difficult because we have to put up with each other 's opinions . Show respect how ? By expressing our thoughts in a pre-determined manner which is not `` anti-democratic '' ? Who sets the rules for that ? Do you even understand that Democracy allows for freedom of expression ? Who puts the guideline of what `` anti-democratic '' is ? A sarcastic comment is anti-democratic ? Prehaps a satire is anti-democratic as well ? It appears your post is just pure emotion , the same way Syriza handled the situation with Greece . And just in case you accuse me of being pro ND or pro PASOK , let me stop you by saying that this bullshit for a mess has been brewing up for 40-45 years and to say that Greeks have no responsibility is just naive . Are we to run away from criticizing our selves even if it is in the form of sarcastic comments , satire or just a calm conversation ? How is what the previous poster said `` anti-democratic '' .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,Scholar,Thank you so much ! I really appreciate it : ),Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,budgetfood,"Total protein is one part of the picture . First of all , 26g of protein is too little for a grown man . There are plenty of articles discussing this issue . Menno Henselmans from Bayesian Bodybuilding has done a [ great review ] ( http : //bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/ ) of the recent literature . The take away message here is that the optimal amount of protein is 1.8g per kg . So compounding that factor in , if a 70kg man only gets his protein from oats he would have to eat 3000 calories worth of oats . Not something that I would call practical or healthy for that matter . Additioally , another factor you do n't take into account is that oats are n't a complete source of protein . For the layman that means that , oats lack some of the essential amino acids and thus they should be paired with a more complete source . So do n't get me started on spinach which has only a measly 3g of protein per 100g . If you have any questions I would be happy to answer and/or provide my references .",Greek,Greek

That 's understandable . I do n't doubt that genuity of these emotions . Sure if somebody was in the place of the kid you mentioned in your example , they would feel like shit . However , think let 's think of another example . Say there is a couple on the night out , and the husband notices someone on another table staring at his wife . He feels jealous and threatened and proceeds to punch the other guy . The husband felt like shit , but was his reaction justified just because he felt that way ?

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"& gt ; I do n't mean to be rude but none of these are good examples . No worries , I do n't mind . Being wrong just means that there is room for improvement : ) I brought up public smoking as an example not because it harms the smoker 's health , rather it harms people who choose not to smoke in the first place . In this situation some smokers played the victim because they thought that they were being oppressed but in reality , they were being oppressive . Pre ban if you asked someone to blow out their cigarette , it was n't that uncommon to receive a `` go fuck yourself '' as an answer . As far as the other example , I think you are right . However , sometimes our feelings are not justified because , well they are feelings . If I feel I am being controlled , it does n't necessarily mean that I am being controlled .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"There seems to be some short of synergy between instant gratification and avoiding negative emotions .

There is a huge difference between instant gratification and happiness , but most people do n't seem to grasp that .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"& gt ; I 'd need a concrete example to give a more pointed opinion on this One example is smoking . As I said earlier , some smokers got pretty upset when it was banned and blamed the government as well as the people who were pro-ban . Another one would be people who do n't want to work out because they feel forced to do so . More like a knee jerk reaction really . Like children who do n't eat their greens .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Maybe I was n't clear enough . Let me clarify . Although u/styder_hiru did make a reference to people with mental issues in his post , my answer was directed at the general public . As I said earlier , it would be foolish to blame someone for having a mental health issue . It is n't in their control after all . Reading the original post , you will see that I intentionally did n't make a reference to people with disorders . Rather , I mentioned people with insecurities . Being insecure about yourself is not the same thing as being anorexic . Yes , there is some overlap and people with anorexia display extreme insecurity . But it is more of a spectrum than just absolutes .

These people should be treated by a professional , and obviously not buying magazines is n't going to do them any good . I am not a mental health professional so giving out advice to people that obviously need one would be incredible irresponsible . If you read the original post more carefully you would realise that it mainly targeted people that avoid exercise . Avoiding exercise is not the same as suffering from body dysmorphia . And while we are at it , you might benefit if you see a professional yourself . Blaming projection is a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder .

There is no incentive in that other than profit . Feelgood generates publicity for the media , twinkies make money for the sugar lobby . That 's one thing though . People tend to blame others for their maladies . For example , they keep blaming muscle magazing for their unrealistic standards . Well then , do n't buy that magazine . How is the magazine hurt by you not working out ? When smoking on public spaces was banned in my country , many smokers would bitch that society should be more tolerant and that the government was infringing their rights .

AgentErgoloid,electronic_cigarette,"Hey there everyone , Kinda new to this game . I 've been smoking hookah for about 8 years and I am looking for something that can emulate it . Mainly looking for something can produce thick clouds , and a strong buzz with clean flavor . A couple of years back I bought a kangertech evod for a relative who wanted to quit smoking . They were n't to fond of it so they gave it back to me . Since then I 've been using it on and off whenever I ca n't be bothered to set up my hookah , but it pales in comparison to the qualities mentioned above . I did some more reading on the subject and it seems like I need something that can provide a lot of power along with a sub-ohm tank . However , I do n't want to spend a ton of money on it , in case it turns out to be like the evod . So , all in all I 've been thinking about getting the eGo One . Looks like a decent kit at an affordable price . Do you have any other suggestion around the 50€ mark ? EDIT : In the end I got a Smok stick one plus that I found on sale .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Abstract Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass . Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs , the principle of specificity , which states that adaptations are specific to the nature of the applied stimulus , dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others . Research is lacking , however , as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains . The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program versus a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects . 17 young men were randomly assigned to either an HT group that performed 3 sets of 10RM with 90 seconds rest or an ST group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with 3 minutes rest . After 8 weeks , no significant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii . Significant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat . In conclusion , this study showed both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size , but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24714538/",Greek,Greek

The physical keys worked fine and I was even able to open the task manager ( albeit I could n't shut down any application ) or open the camera app . This would happen 2-3 times per week and a simple restart would always solve it . However that was n't the case yesterday . At some point during the night I woke up and decided to set my alarm because I had forgotten doing so earlier . At this point the very same problem that I describe above happened again . Not thinking much about it , I thought that a simple restart would solve it as per usual . That was n't the case though . Even after restarting the phone the problem persisted . I then decided to try and hold the power button for 10s until the phone vibrated three times . To my surprise , it was n't effective even thought whatever problem occured in the past would always be resolved that way . Next up , I decided that I should try and back up the phone data , before trying anything else . Thankfully I did n't face any problem during the procedure and I was able to back up everything . The next two things on my list were the 3 button hard reset and a firmware downgrade . None of these things proved to be effective . I am thinking that this is related to faulty hardware , and more specifically faulty digitizer . What are your thoughts about this issue ? Thanks a lot .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,ecr_eu,"Lately I 've been trying to break into the eliquid sector by approaching shop owners , sadly there is no appreciation for creativity since most of them ask for clones . Risk aversion is a constant as they do n't have much room for error , in case a batch does n't have the expected sales . But this is completely understandable . Times are tough . I did some digging a while back for an unrelated purchase . Turns out that because ELTA has n't been profitable for some time now , they outsourced custom checking to a private company . So this where the additional 15 EUR go to , if an item is taxed ( 15 EUR plus 24 % VAT for items deemed to worth between 22 and 1000 EUR , if my memory serves me right ) . I do n't know exactly what 's their policy regarding specific item categories , but for what is worth there was a post about a month old , on a very well known Greek technology related forum , that some guy stated that he was taxed around 50 EUR for a bunch of comic books . The original price was below 20 EUR . There was another guy on the same thread , who was also called to pay an additional 50 EUR for 3 or 4 video game cartridges . He also , originally paid below 20 . In case you can provide proof that the item cost you less , than what they estimated , you can apply for a second check . But it takes about a month and it will cost you an additional 10 EUR , however there is a chance that you wo n't be charged since the law has gone back and forth a couple of times already . If your order comes from an EU member state , then forget everything I said . On the other hand , if it comes from a elsewhere , prepare for a long wait and additional fees . Personally , I think I 'll take my chances with the SMM Serpent . It 's on flash sale on GearBest for 19 EUR .",Greek,Greek

For example , I placed an order on 27/7 . It reached Greece , on 2/8 . Delivery was a couple of days ago , 10/9 if my memory serves me right . I do n't place the blame on FastTech of course .

If you put a bucket of warm water outside , and that warm water just happened to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit , but the outdoor temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit , the water would cool down . That 's because the outdoor temperature , while still warm , is cooler than the temperature of the water . Heat naturally flows from warmer places to cooler places . The heat 's `` goal '' is to reach equilibrium–a state where everything is the same temperature as everything that surrounds it . That 's why a hot bowl of soup or a cold glass of soda will eventually reach room temperature if you leave them out long enough . The difference between you and a bucket of water ( well , one of many differences ) is that your body is constantly generating more heat . All that heat has to go somewhere , so it tries to escape through your skin .

I know that it might seem far fetched to include ocs and pct , but since I have only a minimal amount of time I want everything to be optimal in terms of safety and gains . From what I understand , since SARMs stimulate the androgen receptors throughout the body , this signals the HTPA axis to downregulate the release of FSH and LH . In turn , this reduces total and free test . If I were to include clomiphene , which is shown to increase the release of both LH and FSH , would n't that prevent any suppression ?",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,AskReddit,"Then [ this ] ( http : //www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html ) might be of interest to you . I would like to highlight some parts to make it clearer . `` The findings from excavations testify that at this time , unlike the later Sparta , a rich culture had developed here . Around 1100 BC , the Dorians came and conquered the territory ( Archaeology favors a date for Dorian settling around 950 BC ) . '' `` During Sparta 's history , the habitation center in the Eurotas valley had changed many times , but the Dorian city which was comprised from five villages , occupied the territory of today 's city of Sparta. ``",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,AskReddit,"Indeed . However , there is an important distinction here . During the bronze age the dominant civilization in Greece was that of the Mycenaeans . At that time Menelaus , the brother of Agamemnon , was the king of Mycenaean Sparta . However at some point later , around 1200 BC , the Dorians invaded Greece and the Mycenaean civilization perished . So calling him Mycenaean is the correct term , since people at Peloponnese at the time were of a Mycenaean culture . The ancient city that we know as Sparta , did n't exist back then . TL ; DR Same place , different civilizations .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,HomeworkHelp,I 'll give you an answer to your first question since the same principles apply to the second . First things first . You will have to convert pKa to Ka . In order to do this you will need to antilog 4.76 . Ka=10^-pka -- & gt ; Ka=10^-4.76 -- & gt ; Ka=1.74*10^-5 From there on you can calculate the concentration of H3O^+ . Ka = [ CH3COO^- ] [ H3O^+ ] / [ CH3COOH ] [ CH3COO^- ] = [ H3O^+ ] = x [ CH3COOH= 0.28-x at this point you can assume tha 0.28-x≈0.28 thus : Ka=x^2 /0.28 -- & gt ; 1.74*10^-5 *0.28 = x^2 -- & gt ; 4.87 * 10^-6 = x^2 -- & gt ; x=sqrt ( 4.87 * 10^-6 ) -- & gt ; x= 2.2 * 10^-3 Now that you know the concentration of hydronium cation you can calculate the pH since : pH= -log [ H3O^+ ] pH=-log ( 2.2 * 10^-3 ) -- & gt ; pH= 2.66,Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,ZenHabits,"That 's a pretty clever concept . I 've been employing that principle for sometime now . My kryptonite is the Internet . Although I do use it study daily I found myself procrastinating now and then . So what I did was to use a piece of software called Cold Turkey . Some redditors might be familiar with it . It basically blocks websites and/or programs that otherwise might be draining your productivity . I tried it for a couple of weeks and I found that it really helps ! You see , when a good five or six hours of your day are wasted on addictions and then suddenly you stop , the void has to be filled . You can say that I have my triggers under control . What you said about visualization is also pretty much true for me . It is just that I did n't have the resolve to study or go to class . I felt that it was pointless . That I would be able to pass the class with the least amount of effort . Then I thought a little bit about it . I had the notion that living is all about having an easy life . Boy was I wrong ! Things get dull after a point if you do n't push yourself to strive for the best . Awareness is key here . I would n't be where I am now without becoming more self-aware .

AgentErgoloid,NonZeroDay,"Drug addict or not , you have to remember that everybody is responsible for their own actions . Also this `` The drug addict did n't mean to get addicted to drugs , they were just going to try it , but then bam , they are screwed . '' is completly false . Physiological addiction takes a couple of uses to form . There is something else in the works here . Picture this , you are playing your favourite video game and it is 1:00 am . You are 1 hour past your sleep time and you have to go to work in 7 hours . Yet you decide to play just 20 more minutes , which become 1 hour , which becomes 2 hours and so on . In the end you end up sleeping poorly and feeling tired for the whole next day . In this scenario , the subject was conscious their decision to only play for twenty minutes . A person that gets into drugs only to try them out , is also conscious of their decision . Do you see a pattern here ? If you fail to resist immediate reward you only have yourself to blame for your lack of willpower . You are uncomfortable with the idea because you need to put effort , and when we put effort into something we tend to get out of our comfort zone which is well.. uncomfortable . So in the end it all boils down to willpower . I hope I did n't come across as offensive , just my 2 cents .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,StonerProTips,"Actually THC has a half life between 1.6–59h so it surely is n't 4 days . See [ this ] ( http : //link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200342040-00003/fulltext.html ) study for further info . Another point is that half-life has nothing to do with tolerance . Think about it . Caffeine has a half life of 5 hours , however you need cease consuming it for a couple of days in order for your tolerance to reach zero . So what does exactly happen when you develop tolerance for a given substance ? The brief answer would be that the system being targeted ( receptor ) downregulates itself . This is known as a negative feedback loop . The phenomenon mentioned above happens due to homeostasis . * *Homeostasis* Homeostasis , also spelled homoeostasis or homœostasis ( from Greek : ὅμοιος , `` hómoios '' , `` similar '' , and στάσις , stásis , `` standing still '' ) , is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant . There are some exceptions to this . Namely reverse tolerance or receptor sensitization . **TL ; DR : ** Tolerance develops due receptors downregulating .",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,hearthstone,"TBH forsen played the final interview really well . Stated his points , congratulated his competitor , didnt rage . Pretty solid handling , unlike some ESL admins..",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,Destiny,How about no pepe ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"So happy for Fear . From smalltime teams , to nirvana , to online kingdom , to finally claiming the title of # 1 with EG . For many the star of the show was suma1l/ppd 's draft . But Fear , constantly performing at the top level , possibly the most reliable carry in the scene with truckloads of experience on his shoulders , cant imagine who deserves this win more than him . Congrats to EG , and wp CDEC for giving us an entertaining and competitive final",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"No way . Mid-fight level ups are not uncommon , and 2 stat points can make or break a fight , an experienced player should have the presence of mind to skill it in fight , and that should give him an edge . I think this is one of those changes that dumb down the game , instead of making it smarter",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Does KDL need better casters ? Definitely . Should you take it out on those guys ? i dont think so , they were probably made to do it from their employer , and are trying to learn as it goes on . Cut the casters some slack",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,ITT : hating on protoss,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Oh boy finally , i was thinking of getting in the business myself sometime and really wan na read some advice Below are just suggestions , if anyone disagrees/wants to correct something please do so 1 . Enforce an age limit of sorts . You dont want kids coming in to play for free/yelling etc . Also keep in mind that some games attract younger people ( a.k.a league usually attracts non adults ) and you might not want that in a place that serves alcohol and whatnot Honestly , PCS for players in a bar is not a good idea , Consoles on the other hand would probably work well but w/e floats your boat . My suggestion would be to instead get some old ( or new ) arcade game machines ( Street fighter /MK/R-Type etc. ) . 2 . If you set up PCS , make sure at least the towers are in a spot where they wont be accidentally showered with a drink or something 3 . Dont focus too much on gaming ( basically , dont make it awkward ) and alienate other potential customers , though thats something really subjective . 4 . Better forgo that dungeon crawling idea and replace it with a shooter theme . That means CSGO , Battlefield , CoD and/or whatever else you want . I dont know if its legal , or you would have to negotiate a deal with twitch/streamers w.e . but watching those things in a bar with the goal of making money might be a legally different situation from watching at home , dont really know 5. maybe get a barman/bartender to make you some game related drinks . ( There have been some pokemon related stuff going around on the web ) . Nothing much . Just 2-3 game inspired drinks ( Think `` clarity potion '' etc . ) . As for food , you do not really need to go that far . Just the usual stuff that would accompany a cold beer Tournament nights are your best weapon in this business , especially you combine them with some cool stuff like raffles , giveaways or even allow people to bet on matches ( dont know what you would reward them with though ) .Make sure your place has online presence and advertise your pubstomps frequently ( fb page , maybe twitter ) . Anyway best of luck to you , hope your business goes well",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,gaming,"Well having read this review and watched TB 's video about it , i 'd say that its definitely not 3.5 , its higher , dont know by how much though . In the video , Thief ( PC Version ofc ) was reported having extremely smooth performance and you could see the PC port was amazing . Truth be told , most game reviews are as biased as the reviewer and in many cases rushed and exaggerated . This game clearly is not deserving of such low rating , and this for me means egmnow is not really a site i should consult in the future",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Its nice to see Fear finally rewarded for all his work . Well done old man , well done EG",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"I dont really watch the LoL scene so i cant speak for it , but the dota2 season is packed full of tournaments and is generally on the rise , i dont see a need for such sponsorship . Sc2 would benefit more from this i think",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"This is all fine , however , for the game to get more people is easy . Lower price , more foreigners winning . There are a lot of people who are not interested watching koreans battle it out again and again . You dont have anyone to represent you , ofc you wont be interested in watching",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,I kinda liked it,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,The jew part ... holy hell this is too funny,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Best show ever,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Exactly . This is personal preference , and i prefer not listening to the same stuff over and over again , i can understand whats going on in the game and i find their casting to be exactly what it needs to make my viewing experience entertaining",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"Damn right , Long shows = best shows",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"True , if anything they got muted for not being able to stand a low ranked players idiotic mistakes , flaming , and getting muted",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,They are not talking about the game as much as production/events/incidents with teams/players etc . I cant really speak about others but i find it interesting and dont mind listening about that kind of stuff even though i do not play LOL or follow their competitive scene,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"this is great , good job",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"maybe you dont speak about SC2 , a lot of us play both games",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I liked it,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Whats wrong with sc2 ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Man this reminds me of the GDshows of old . This stream is fucking awesome,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,One could argue that since jaedong made mistakes ( scouting in 3rd game for example ) he was not the best player in that particular match,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"One thing i want to say is that i see people posting about being interested in only dota , or only starcraft and the rest are just a convenience if they are there . There are also many guys who are very into sc2 and dota2 both , and dont care about anything else . I open TL every day when i sit on my pc and check what sc2 and d2 streams are going on and pick one of them . I check for any good articles on d2 and sc2 both . And while i know it sounds a bit ridiculous to say its hard to just click a different site , it will make a difference Bottomline this does not seem like a very good change but we 'll have to wait and see",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,DotA2,"If it is anything like the sc2 division of GOM ( and i think it will be ) they probably need casters that live in korea and cast live from the GOM studio in gangnam.. please god let it be tastosis , it should at least be more enjoyable than casting tanks",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,"Nobody says that , the hate is towards riot because riot pays for every tournament , there is literally no tournament that isnt paid for by riot ( tencent ) dota 2 players for the most part never talk shit about sc2 . I noticed you keep making these retarded comments all over the thread , whats your problem ?",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"And here comes the ever politically correct , always mannered , and very entitled `` community member '' part of reddit ... . this cant go wrong",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"not that this behaviour is right , but you should get used to it ... over the past years , anyone who played internet games had his whole family killed , raped and mutilated multiple times . We have been spammed , flamed etc . There was no need for gender specific insults because we knew that we are probably all male anyways . Now as girls get into it , someone who wants to swear can do so with a wider vocabulary , and he uses it . Simple as that My point is , its just insulting , it wont get better no matter how many banhammers drop . No need to go on crusades about it , just ignore it and do your thing . Also if i knew my teammate was female i honestly would not expect anything from them .Would not flame , yell , rage etc . but initially treat them as someone who does not know what to do in this game ( so fails are to be expected )",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Guess what , Flash is going to surpass Fatal1ty in the next 2 years",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Will you do any more stuff for sc2 ? ... to this day everyone says asus ROG summer was the best event ever , and the way things are going they could definitely use some of that production magic again . also will you discard the sc2 segment of the gd show ? it was fairly interesting",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Friendly reminder that LOLupdates is a troll account and should not be taken seriously,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Honestly , i thought it sucked . Smaller target/pointer - harder to last hit . the minimap felt..wrong , i had been playing wc3 dota mainly watching the minimap , and in dota 2 the minimap confused me . The map felt considerably smaller , it seemed like ganks came out of nowhere , even though wards were up i did not notice stuff that in wc3 i would see in a split second . Teamfights also were too chaotic at start but i had expected that . Of course it was all a matter of adjusting and now i think d2 is vastly superior , but those first days it felt like playing dota2 made me worse at the game",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"They were talking about too many male gamers . Honestly i think he complimented her , meaning that she is a female pro gamer , why would he hint at something like that out of the blue , you heard what he was saying about scarlett in other times Eitherway , thats 2gd love him or hate him , and i for one would not jump to assumptions and call someone a `` transphobic shithead '' . What does calling him that make you ? not a better person surely",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"I would argue but it seems we disagree on the matter . Still , even if it was as you say it was meant as a joke , unlike your comment",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,thegdstudio,"In this weeks Unfiltered they talked about EG 's mason making some offensive statements and how would that reflect on Alex garfields `` political correctness '' policy . I actually did not see it discussed on the dota2 subreddit ( and to be honest its nothing new to the scene ) , which is why i did n't edit it in the news thread.They did make a pretty big issue out of it though so if someone considers it newsworthy you might as well add it . The statements in question : http : //i.imgur.com/5N4Tx3d.png",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Draskyl should be there ( and yes i know why he declined ) , cant believe he wont be at TI while a bunch of `` community figures '' will",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,n0tail cast is very good . Cast was also very good before n0tail . I dont think anything needed to be salvaged,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Its a nice concept but there is something about adding so many `` conveniences '' to the game that i dont like ... An experienced player can manage his inventory in a fast and efficient manner , hence he gets a fair advantage over an inexperienced player . Its a good idea , would not like it to be in the game though",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Its a matter of practice . Also everything you do while playing is part of the game and it should rightfully require an amount of skill to execute,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Sweden is great and Mason is an asshole . He did have one point down though . Most swedes i talk to online automatically think they are superior to others . ( Master race and all that shit ),Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,i remember there was a time where everybody wanted to beat up babyknight because he was a huge flamer/dick.They would wait for him at LANS . Mason seems to be walking down that path,Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,This so much . I would definitely tune in to hear Idra cast,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Tasteless fuck yea,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Maybe it was great for a chinese fan , but for us europeans/americans it didnt mean much . We were not emotionally invested and personally i just wanted to enjoy some good games without getting anxious about a team i support . But , we didnt even get good games . Not that its anybody 's fault , boring finals happen all the time in other sports/esports ( mainly starcraft 4-0 and 4-1 sweeps ) , it was about time we had one as well .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Nobody is discrediting newbee , but you cant force people to like or admire something . Yes they won , congratulations . People showed manners and gave them applause , chanted their name , and all was good , but thats it . In the end it was a boring series and an anticlimactic finale to the season",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"This is gold Maybe you should link it to d2 subreddit or something , people ask but dont know where to find this",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I think he said something similar last year ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Fucking perfect , immensely entertaining cast , i love it Some guys in chat and here need to chill though . So much butthurt , if you dont like it close the stream . Almost every cast nowadays caters to people who dont know enough about the game , and when something like this pops up they cry and yell because they are not being spoonfed tedious info , graphs and stats again and again . I for one welcome this , its not like it happens often , or in grand finals .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Will we have to subscribe to TB 's channel to access vods ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Point is , you will not find yourself in those annoying situations if you manage your inventory properly-which is something you have to learn . Everything that happens after loading is dota . Courier handling , buying items , swapping items , everything . Yes , Experience should give an advantage via mechanics . Inventory management IS mechanics",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Probably some GEM higher ups got annoyed about an article or two,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Man its enough that tobi made everything awkward for everyone last night , do we really need to see that shit at the front page of r/dota2 ?",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Zeus for the last one , his model is pretty plain , he needs some badassery",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Na'vi , or whatever team Fear plays on , which i guess now is no team . I used to really dislike navi , was a huge MYM fan back in dota1 , when Mym vs navi was `` el classico '' ( F4F 3.5 finals anyone ? ) . At TI1 i was rooting for online kingdom but that team disbanded , so i basically thought navi was the best of the `` old '' players , plus if it wasnt for them at TI2 china would still be laughing at us",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Yep , plus it will show koreans what dota 2 actually is , it kinda seems most gamers do not know much about it still . The prestige of TI ( and the incredibly huge prizepool ) will attract more korean teams , and gamers will follow suit",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"I like the daily challenge , the remodel and the A-Z other than that pretty underwhelming , which is ok. Those are optional stretch goals , we dont have to reach them . In the end i got a relatively cheap compendium and i d say with the current unlocks its already worth its cost.Anything more is a bonus , if we reach it cool , if not , no problem",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"yes , he said `` soon ''",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"we frontpage now boys Also this looks great , seems like a very high skillcap game",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,aww,"The host of that place and owner of the studio brand used to work as a caster/commentator for ESL , plus some other stuff for years . He decided to invest in this and produce `` shows '' . Pretty damn good shows , also he managed a team of other casters/commentators booked theme events and such Another guy used to code tools for a game called dota 2 , they liked his work , invited him to the `` world cup '' for casting and then hired him . Point is , years of 8-5 jobs before they ended up there . Of course luck helps , right place at the right time with the right skills and all that .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"And now with draskyl , the double knowledge combo",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Admirr was actually really good upon his return , and vigosss had some really solid appearances , they just didnt have the drive to make it last",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,DotA2,"We just like both fucking games and play / watch both , how hard is it to understand",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,Sheever is not part of the studio though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Amen , same here",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Chances are they simply do not want to risk it . Their bootcamp doesnt start until later in June , it would make sense to play it safe and buy as much time possible for his arm to recover fully . Also , i dont think alex garfield really wants to field his team without fear , he is an important `` persona '' if you may , after the free to play documentary , its the kind of thing that creates storylines ( and brings in money )",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I dont think what 2gd said then and puppey now are comparable to be honest . I also thought 2GD 's joke was very funny and people get offended too easily . Puppey was straight rude though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I really hope this isnt true but if it is ... . i understood EG 's predicament when they released Idra but if they actually use Fear 's injury as an excuse i cant even imagine the backlash if proof gets out,Greek,Greek

It kinda has been the nature of the turks , since the turks started occupy other countries they 've been known how barbaric they 've been against christians . Killing many , abducted children to fight for them . One reason for the bosnians to convert was this , so the turks would be easier on them at the time ( and tax reasons ) , but serbs took it very wrong .

Because there was never a slaughter against turks at a scale that can be labeled as a genocide . Turks usually were taken prisoners , those being killed in the war had the unfortunate to do so . But were never systematically slaughtered by other factors , **understand that** . Compare it like what the Nazis did to the Jews and other minorities , less gas more bullets . So yeah , people have sure have grudge against Turks . My family/roots being partly from Trabzon/Sinope area , did experience the slaughter . Many had never had the oppurtunity to leave , before being slaughtered . & gt ; Thank you for 3 passive-aggressive paragraphs full of racism Sorry I did n't want to make it passive-aggressive , just wanted to state that how it was or how it was mostly seen by people . & gt ; it 's likely that many of my ancestors were Christian at some point Can be very true , because modern turks are a blend from everything they came in contact with , and you can see similarities from western turks ( in Turkey ) with some Europeans . & gt ; So that Turks no longer are so much like Mongols should tell you about how inclusive and accepting the Turkish culture was Turkish culture **HAD** to adopt to become a well functioning kingdom/empire , cause unlike the nomad-life it is n't very stable and do n't tend to last long .

One keeping the ottomans on the island and the other keeping remaining armies in anatolia . If you manage to have allies before the war , it will be even better . I had poland ( they will bring lithuania with them ) and Wallachia ( I think ) . On your peace treaty you gain land and ducats to pay off your loans .

Like this backslash \ . But the camera will still let you look over there ( straight up ) . So when I used to have a Pharah right on top of me , I could block the missiles , nowadays I ca n't . And one other thing is the charge . Clearly if you 're a main you should notice that there been changes to the logic of the collision . When the smallest ramp could stop the charge and count it as a collision . This has been change ( I think to the better ? ) Example , when attacking in Route 66 , I used to love and try to charge on [ this little ramp ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/R8Wfz ) you see , it used to stop me everytime , whether I charged from middle or left gate . After I started playing again , it now works without collision , so I can continue to charge all the way to the payload and start moving it . It feels also that people who 're infront of me should get pinned when I charge at them , but sometimes they just `` jump '' /get pushed straight up . I do n't get it .

Not to mentioned that the very nature of the race was similar : Mostly 1-stopper ( did anyone made a 2-stop today , anyway ? ) hard to overtake , even with fairly bid pace advantage ( granted , the track 's nature did n't exactly helped ) , many retirements due to mechanical failures etc . etc .

This behaviour has emerged over the last 4-5 months or so , and it 's driving me ( 17 year old , male , the only other child of the family ) , and our two parents ( both at their 40 's ) crazy . Only today , he and grandma ( who has visited us for a couple of weeks ) were supposed to go to the local bookstore to buy some stuff he needed for school . But he took his bicycle , and went ahead after a while , leaving her to come alone . Dunno why . Even worse , pa and ma are n't home for a couple of days , they return tomorrow evening . I dread to guess how they 'll react once they learn what happened . This is just the last of many things my bro has done during the past 2-3 yrs which indicated recklessness and non responsibility . I.. want to help him think , but i 'm not sure how . Father 's yelling and `` go to your room '' are n't doing much good . I need some help , reddit . Please , help me here.. Edit : Another example is how he constantly argues with father about nothing really , and that he will continually press on the argument , even when proven false , very much like politicians dabble on and on , trying to prove they 're right . Also , he often yells and shouts , which frustrates my dad , who in turn punishes my bro . I should also add he spends many hours in front of his laptop , way too much for his age ( or anyone tbh.. ) Dad often takes his laptop after another one of their arguments , however he 'll crumble after a day or two and give it back . Now , my brother knows he 's often wrong and that he 's sorry , you can see it in his eyes . But i think he does n't know how to change it .

AlexanderTheGreen,swtor,"**ATTENTION PLEASE ! ! This is NOT just a rundown of the actual chapters of the KotFE expansion . While close to it , they are rather my opinion on how the story could 've been better , and have a solid ending . Enjoy ! ** Chapters 1-2 : Same as the actual game . The Hunt , the ambush , the capture , Marr dies , we refuse to bow , we kill Valko 's body , Arcann 's the new Emperor . Vision and Dreams also same . Chapter 3 : Same , more or less . Key differences are T7 actually comes with us , and there 's no HK . Seriously , besides guiding us to the gravestone , he 's just there for nostalgia ( hk-47 ) and coolness factor . Practical change , essentially same . Chapter 4 : More or less same , but here i try to minimize time spend in the swamp/gathering supplies . We still get some much needed exposition about these 5 years . After burying the crashed shuttle , Koth recalls and tells us that the legendary gravestone is rumored to be here and it might be our only hope getting out of there alive . T7 can point the way just as well as HK can . With the gravestone found , up and running ( time saver ) , Lana tells us we must go to Asylum asap to form an Alliance to rival the ET ( eternal throne ) . We meet Senya in the zakuul knights ' ambush , she joins us . Chapter 5 : Lady of sorrows arc . We meet Heskal who 's telling us about `` fate '' and stuff and his Scions . He also hints at wanting to join us , but that 's up in the air . We recruit SCORPIO . Chapter 6 : Taking Flight Arc . Heskal pips Arcann off to Asylum , he and all his scions are murdered by arcann who faces off against us . Arcann raids Asylum with a mightly force , so the day is basically get the GS ( gravestone ) free and go . 2nd standoff with arcann . He beats us - just , but Valko is n't there to help us . Dunno if you noticed , but Valko does n't appear at all to present these `` opportunities '' to us . That 's intentional . No , we 're saved by Koth , who at the last minute shows up to save the day and us , Zakuul patriot and all . Arcann is ticked off/distacted/trapped ( under debris ? ; ) ) just enough for us to escape . He certaintly doesnt get thrown down 9999 floors only to escape cause plot . Vaylin vs. senya goes as normal , senya wins bu spares her . they all escape to odessan , but the outlander is furious at sparing , or at least not capturing , such a big enemy . That makes Senya somewhat dissillussioned about his ability to rule/command , and foreshadows the betrayal . Chapter 7 : Alliance . We go to Odessan , meet the new friends and get our ship back . Same as story . Chapter 8 : Aric recruitment chapter . Havoc enters the alliance . Chapter 9 : Mandalore 's revenge . same as normal , mandos enter the alliance . Meanwhile , Theron informs us he 's found one of our old crew members ( old companions , class- dependant ) . chapter 10 : visions in the dark . same chapter as normal , same story . valko appears , he taunts us , we meet shatele and ghost marr . chapter 11 : profit n ' plunder . chapter 12 : Mandos and Havoc together infiltrate the spire from different points to gather intel about the area . Meanwhile , the outlander and lana go into asylum , where another companion might be in here , ready to help . sadly , its a trap by vaylin , who kills said companion and attacks us . she fights to her last breath and dies . now here 's a good point , or so i thought . said companion , of course different with each class , would be the one you build the least affection with from levels 1-55 ( RotHC ) ( original 5 companions ) , excluding ship droid . So basically , YOU -WE get to choose which companion to kill . We all wanted to kill skadge , or corso or kaliyo.. vaylin 's ready ; ) Also , by killing original comps it 's another reminder of the new age ( kotfe ) . Lana is severely injured in the fight ( or not , depending on some PC choice during the fight ) . They return to odessan , only to find an enranged senya - the outlander killed her daughter , and a failed mission from Havoc and the Mandos . You can either Aric or Shae , if you want to . Senya has a fallout with the Outlander and ditches the alliance . Chapters 13 : Odessan Orbit . Arcann , enraged about her sister 's death ( hey , the buffin has feelings 😂 ) and now joined by Senya *har , har* , raids odessan . Senya has revealed the location of the alliance base and together , they bring the full might of the eternal fleet against the outlander . First off , the alliance prepares to face them off in space , on odessan orbit . The battle is tough , and they lose it . They 're forced to retreat , and the chapter ends with the outlander crash landing the gravestone , which is destroyed . The ground assault will begin soon ... Chapter 14 : The Battle of Odessan : The conflict is long , tough and brutal . The Alliance is dug deep and well protected , but they Eternal fleet is storming the place , they have em outnumbered and outgunned . Both sides are merciless , with no one giving an inch to the other . The casualties are very high for each side , and they continue to amass . As Commander , you can tip the scales off , however . We 're given actual choices about who dies and who survives . Based on our choices , Lana ( based on vaylin injury or not ) , Koth , Theron , Aric , Shae , Vette , Gault , SCORPIO , any past companions who have returned and fight by you , as well as a potential number of mandalorians can die or not . You can save em all , you can kill em all . Waging war against Arcann is BRUTAL . On a personal level AND when seeing the bigger picture . That 's what tipped me off in Chapter 1 , when i faced Valkorion and the Fleet , i knew , Zakuul was going to be TOUGH to beat . That 's the feeling i wan na give here . The green fields run red with the blood . Zakuul has a very big number of casualties as well- Arcann 's lost his flagship and many , many other ships , although no one important is there any more . On the ground , Knights arr scattered , destroyed and scared for life . Some plea for mercy as u walk by them . Chapter 15 : The Last Stand : Arcann vs. the Outlander . The time has come . No stupid `` shields '' or anything , but the `` ultimate '' duel between an expert duelsman and.. well , an expert at whatever class you are : P Like Vaylin , Arcann has no intention to surrender . He wants both to avenge his sis , AND Valko to talk to him . We win this time . As we 're about to finish him , Senya shows up trying to stab us from behind and kill us . Valko FINALLY shows up and strangles her in front of an almost dead Arcann , laughing with pleasure . Valko mocks his son- he gave attention to a stranger and nothing on his child . Arcann 's litterally broken now , he cries and weeps on the floor like an abused child . Valko tips us to end this miserable being . The Outlander can either spare him or kill him , OR something else , check the neutral ending in the end of the post for it ; ) * In LS ending , we tell Arcann we -us and the alliance- can help him . heal him , his body and his soul . With us , he can finally rejoice and be redeemed . He can have.. friends , people who care bout him . Arcann finally realizes the difference of us and Valko . He understands what a monster Valko really is , and what his pursuit of him has made him . We help him get up , and we join forces . Valko now.. **returns** to life , litterally , he transitions from ghost to real life body . We urge Arcann that even if we ca n't defeat him , we must try . That 's what makes us better . We fight Valko 2vs1 with Arcann . Arcann 's already near death from our fight , so he can only help so much and he 's fatally wounded . We manage to stab and `` kill '' Valko again , who dissapears again , saying he 's defeated . With his power base and influence lost , `` he wo n't bother us for another 1000 years '' . We speak with arcann , who in true vader fashion , lays off his metal mask and arm - his `` sacrifice '' over . He 's redempted , and he dies in peace . * In the DS ending , we actually get to punch a sorry and weeping arcann in his stupid face . We take his mask and metal arm off as painfully for him as possible , and we press our boot down his weak throat as hard as we can . Arcann dies a few moment later , his last sight his father 's actual body - he 's returned to life- , laughing over his corpse . Valkorion congratulates us , and tells us `` we 're ready '' . He takes control over us , and we are shown marching on the fray again , slaughtering any one still alive . We have sinhy purple eyes , we are invincible - nothing can harm us . We speak with Valko 's voice . He has litterally posessed us , and the game ends on that note , we as his vessel with HIM in control , going off against the galaxy to cause chaos , murder and mayhem . The LS ending is n't resolved , however . With Senya/Arcann 's death and Valkorian 's `` exit '' , the aliance wins the battle of odessan . The bulk of the eternal fleet is defeated . Our allies -and us- have been damaged , but we 'll endure . The alliance no longer can go after zakuul , but zakuul is leaderless and with no major force to attack them , AND with no government ( they 're thrown into anarchy ) , the Republic and the Empire charge off against them , liberating and retaking their lost worlds . They have a truce in effect , which after zakuul 's total defeat and the destruction of the Throne , becomes an official Allyship . Back on Odessan , now a ruin world , the victims are pilled together and burned . They brifely discuss Valko , but they know he wo n't bother them again -at least not in a very long time . The Alliance has WON . Thus , it 's time to be dissolved . Everyone 's going their way , Pub , Empire or back to sabacc or bounties . The Outlander prepares his ship to leave as well . He 's returning to Tython/Korriban/Non Force classes somewhere else , specific to their lore ( BH Rakata Prime-mandalorians ? ) . Before they depart , they observe a hill plateau on the sunset . Marr ghost appears , now joined by sathele shan 's ghost as well -she has died , presumably from aging . Lastly , their class mentor appears in ghost ( Orgus Din , Master Yuon , Baras , Zash ) , no mentor for non force classes . They all smile n ' nod towards the PC , giving him the utmost respect and credit for all his or her work , one last time . Edit : Also , here 's something i had written on my notes but forgot to pass on the thread : Based on how did you handled your companions and your troops throughout both the orbital and the ground battle of odessan , you determine how many main characters survive . If more than half , or half of your available units which you get a CHOICE to command in battle survive to the end , the Alliance wins the battle . If less than half survive , Zakuul rampages through and conquers then destroys the Alliance base . **Please note that you ca n't get the LS ending if Zakuul wins odessan . However , you can get the DS ending regardless of the outcome of the battle of odessan** . Edit 2 : No , i did n't forgot Kaliyo . I left her out on purpose , because even Agents should n't accept her in this Alliance . Edit 3 : For the LS ending , the `` fallen masters '' ghost for each class ( orgus , baras etc . ) might be removed if asked to ; ) Edit 4 : The segments where Valky gives us his power without us agreeing ( like when he leaves in Visions in the Dark ) , are cut because they 're plain stupid . **BONUS-Neutral Ending** When Valko urges us to end Arcann , we have another option : The Outlander realizes that Valky is somehow tied to him , inside his/her mind , so Neutral players , seeing the pitiful carpet crying in front of them and a becrazed spirit talking to them , fall into desparate measures . Seeing that Valko survives whether we kill Arcann or not , the Neutral choice is **To Literally Impale/Shoot ourselfs in the gut** , to have any chance , if minimal , to hurt/kill Valkorion ( because he 's tied to us ) . A foolish move , perhaps , but neutral ca n't `` inspire '' arcann to fight with them again -he 's weak and he 's an enemy , and neither do they want to crush him like a bug . I thought about having the option to arrest him , but at that point , the outlander sees valky as a much higher threat to the world than arcann . So yeah , we shoot ourselfs in the gut ... . The outcome is.. you guessed it , we die . We do n't survive the day . Valkorion is indeed seen hurting- very much . In fact , he decides to `` leave '' , in similar fashion to the LS ending . We have n't killed him , but we 've gotten rid of him . We wo n't make it though . Arcann gets up , still very much in shock , but it looks as if he 'll manage . He slowly exits the area after one final look to us . We are left to die , Arcann 's fate is unknown . Now , if the Alliance wins odessan , Arcann is killed in the outro , our body is recovered and given burial , and from there it follows the LS ending , only difference being we 're being mourned and remembered by our allies . Our Legacy survives , it is the downfall of zakuul and the restoration of our faction . If Zakuul wins , Arcann returns to the throne , our remaining , if any , allies are executed , and our body is left to rot . Arcann fully recovers and Zakuul lays waste to both Imp and Pub planets , and their citizens . **Neutral ending explanation ends** The . End : D",Greek,Greek
