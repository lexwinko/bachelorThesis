Alternatives , like budget , are counter-productive to the EU\\ 's stated goal.\\n\\nThis regulation creates a demand for *European* media . It does not create a demand for *good* European media . Therefore , a thousand hours of video of a man dressed as a cat running in circles around the Eiffel tower that cost 15 $ to make fulfill that demand the same as a multi-million euro production . Because creating such a terrible \ '' movie\ '' fulfills the criteria for the least amount of cost , it is the path of least resistance , which Netflix will take.\\n\\nIt protects local content from competing with international content in runtime .

But relatively small dividends could afford everyone a basic level of living *without being dependent on the government* . One has to look no further than Greece to see what happens when a large segment of the population is an economic vassal of the state : the system will inevitably be abused by politicians promising higher and higher handouts , bankrupting it and leading to effects far worse than letting the market take its course.\\n\\nThe tax refund is gained through cutting public spending during a transitional period . Those people who are going to be affected by automation the most are also the ones who pay the least taxes as a proportion of total tax revenue ( I recall seeing that the top 10 % of earners in the US payed ~75 % of taxes , but I can\\'t be sure about the precise figures until I find the article ) , and so their contribution to public revenue is not as significant . By offering full tax refunds for investment , everybody wins . The workers are \\'future-proofed\\ ' against automation , since the gains from it are passed down to them , the government can save on social security , and the industry flourishes because of the resulting *incentive to invest* . For the worker , the act of acquiring stock becomes \ '' free\ '' , since he would have lost that money anyway.\\n\\nAnother tool is to privatize public services - don\\'t scroll down yet , because I don\\'t mean it in the way that most people mean it . Lets take for example the Greek Public Power Corporation . It could be broken into smaller corporations , privatized and split into shares that would be equally distributed amongst the population . Those shares can be freely traded or kept . The estimates I have seen on the value of its assets are at around ~15 billion Euros , and that\\ 's just one service . If you combine it with the tax returns for investments , you could easily get most of the population in the game of investing instead of working , and they don\\'t even have to manage the assets yourself - just hire someone to do it ! It could easily replace basic income with some tweaking , and everyone is satisfied . Well , except the Marxists , but who the fuck cares about those lunatics anyway.\\n\\nThe economy of the future shouldn\\'t be about \ '' how many hours you work\ '' , but \ '' how many robots you own\ '' ( as roughly as I can put it ) . Start giving people incentives to invest in automation now , and you secure their future while also removing their dependence on the government .",Greek,Greek

Instead of owning up to the politically suicidal necessity of cutting public sector wages and pensions , which were built like a pyramid scene , as well as laying off the hordes of useless paperpushers whose jobs could be automated for a fraction of their monthly wages , all of our governments have taken the path of least political resistance and cut the budgets of departments that need them in the first place .",Greek,Greek

We need privatization . We need to tie pensions to pension fund contributions , since almost everyone on pension gets more out of the system than they put in - and the cost is passed on to taxpayers , closing down businesses and impoverishing everyone else . But if we leave the Euro , Greece will be left at the mercy of its socialism-dominated politics , to become another failed state like so many SSRs before it .

Alithinos,europe,"Hello , in this post I\\ 'm going to write a few short paragraphs in an article about social phenomena I have experienced or noticed in my country , Greece , that appeared or became more severe since 2010 . I am not a professional writer or journalist , just another redditor , so please be kind . I took the decision to write this , because I want to share some stories and \ '' get them out of my chest\ '' , and also because out of curiosity I wander if similar phenomena exist in other countries of our continent , and hear some input from others . So without further ado , let\\ 's start.\\n\\nOK so one thing has to do with the relations of employers and employees . They\\ 've become worse . There are two reasons for that . One is the high unemployment rate which makes it easier than ever for an employer to fire someone and get someone else , and the second is the structural changes that according to Troika will make the market more competitive . So many bosses now take the role of the \\'boss\\ ' quite further than they should , accompanied with a feeling of smug superiority . The less bad thing is that bosses now ask you to do all kinds of chores . Like for example say you are hired as a front-end web developer , and the employer asks you to go buy him coffee , take his dog for a walk etc ... And of course you will spend more time at work , without getting paid for it . At worst , employers keep postponing pay you FOR MONTHS . Sometimes after some months of not paying , they fire you and they never pay you for all the work you\\ 've done . There are some cases in which people demanded to get paid for the months they worked got attacked and injured . Perhaps you might have heard about the story from 4 years ago when at a strawberry field the boss started shooting at Bangladeshi workers that were never paid and demanded their salaries : https : //www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/bangladeshi-strawberry-pickers-shot-at-by-greek-farmers-win-european-rights-case\\nBut this is just one case that got popular because of its size and the fact the attacked were Bangladeshis . There are more incidents of attacks , that don\\'t get to international news . Like for example recently a Greek woman was attacked with punches and kicks by her ex-boss for demanding the salary for her work , but this news story was \\'disappeared\\ ' . Of course quite usually people who do work and are getting paid are harassed daily by their bosses with name calling and what not , and workers swallow their pride and accept it because they are afraid of losing their jobs and not finding another one after . A job has become something rare , and if you are lucky to find one you are expected to do whatever you are told , even things not related to your profession , and being harassed , and feel lucky about it because you have a job while others don\\'t . \\n\\nAnother phenomenon is the rise of fringe political groups , and political extremism . Politicians that were once thought to be clowns now have got into the parliament . Neonazis have become the 3rd strongest party in the parliament . A bunch of neonazis murdered a man some years ago , a group of anarchists walked into the offices of some business and broke machinery in it like computers etc with hammers , recording it all with a cell phone and uploading it to Youtube ... https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6MByeh3soKU\\nThese are just hand-picked incidents , there are more like these.\\n\\nA third phenomenon is people believing easier than ever in conspiracy theorist charlatans . We are perhaps the only country in the world where an elected parliamentarian asked the government if it secretly \\'sprays\\ ' people with a chemical , following the popular \ '' chemtrails\ '' conspiracy theory . Aside from that , a few years ago a man appeared on TV saying he had 3 trillion euros ( ! ) , and that he would give 600 billions from his wealth to end Greece\\ 's debt . When asked where he found all that money , he said that the \\'gods\\ ' of ancient Greeks were aliens , and that he discovered an abandoned spaceship of them , and that he sold the technology of that aircraft . He promised that not only he would pay Greece\\ 's public debt , but also that he would give each Greek 25.000 euros once he becomes the ruler of Greece . Because of course he wanted to rule Greece as a return for his favor ... And people believed him . And they went to find him , and he convinced them that he can only use the money after he becomes the prime minister . And asked people to pay so he can start a political party . And some people paid , and hundreds of offices of his new party popped up at cities and towns all over the country . Eventually one of his organization\\ 's members ( who are all nutjobs ) murdered another thinking that the other member was plotting to steal his place in this organization of nutjobs . And the organization was banned only because of that . http : //www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2017/03/17/artemis-sorras-the-man-to-buy-greeces-debt-with-600bn-sentenced-for-embezzlement/ \\n\\nAnother thing , is religious people acting more than ever . In the last years we saw a muslim trying to convert people through Youtube https : //www.youtube.com/user/GreekMuslimEldin , the same thing done by a Jew https : //www.youtube.com/user/JewishIdea77 ( these two often speak about one another in a bad fashion as they see each other as competitors ) . We also have lately some Christian dude believing that the antichrist is here , and he attacks ATMs saying credit cards are the mark of the antichrist , he breaks cell phones because these are Satan\\ 's too , and does other similar stuff : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zALLL-azSOM and of course there are people marching through the streets with a statue of Dionysus and beating drums : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=q8uARn0do4I\\n\\nHere is another phenomenon : Lots of Greeks now open their businesses on other countries like Cyprus , Bulgaria , or Malta . And although the headquarters are there , they live and practice their professions in Greece . They do it so they can be taxed in these other countries because tax rates there are shorter . Globalization allows them to do it , and it\\ 's an argument against austerity , as if the taxes are too high on one country , businesses just move to another one now that it\\ 's easy . This way the Greek government collects even less taxes because the number of businesses is reduced.\\n\\nAnd there are more ... I got tired up a bit writing all this for now . Perhaps I might edit this post to add more later . Tell me your opinions about these . Do you have similar phenomena in your countries ? If so , for how long , and do you think that there is something in particular that leads to them ?",Greek,Greek

The European countries that didn\\'t took part in such activities had no such attacks , and I guess they won\\'t have in the future either.\\n\\nAs for the question if it was a good thing that the Ottoman Empire ended or not , ask the Armenians , the Greeks , the Assyrians , Slavs , Bulgarians , Albanians , and the rest minorities that lived in it .

He is the man for the special operations of international usury , his the man that will destroy Greece , through the unwanted bailout , through its economic destruction , and through illegal immigration which will make us the minority in Greece . You lied before the elections , you lied for 6 whole months , you sold us a big fairy tale , a theater act , with the supposed negotiations , which were a few small trips ... A few small trips in which you vacated in Brussels and Strasburg , and had fun being photographed for Marie Claire , and other lifestyle magazines , you promoted yourselves , and you come here today to say that you absolutely accept the sellout of Greece . Having already destroyed the market , thousands of our co-citizens have lost their jobs in just a few months , and most importantly , after a resounding NO , a NO that expresses the vast majority of Greeks , a NO that constitutes illegal any decision of the parliament for the acceptance of the memoranda dictatorship , the international loan sharks . Minister Tsakalotos talked a while ago for the \\'rich\\ ' . \ '' We will hit the rich\ '' he said , who are the rich ? Isn\\'t he himself rich ? Having more than 800.000 euros deposited in offshore banks ? Minister Stathakis ? With more than 800.000 euros deposited ? Papadimoulis ? With more than 1.300.000 in deposits and 28 houses in total all over the world ? Who are the \\'rich\\ ' you are going to hit ? When you don\\'t even dare to touch the benefits of the parliamentarians . We gave a battle , during the second bailout when we revealed to the public about the benefits parliamentarians received , and New Democracy was lying . And you today crush the farmers with these new measures , you crush the freelancers , and you don\\'t even dare to touch the wages , and benefits of the parliamentarians . You gave us a paper not even worthy for us to spit on it , a shameful paper written in English , which refers to a fund of 50 billion euros , that will be bidding the public assets . Where do these 50 billion euros come from ? What are you going to sell , SYRIZA\\ 's offices that are on Koumoundourou street ? The fifty billions are our oil , the natural gas , the natural wealth of Greece that Germans want to take from us . But they won\\'t take ANYTHING from Greece , and these shameful , odious memoranda that the Greek people refused , will send you and your policy to the trash bin of Greek history . The parliamentarians of SYRIZA are right to be afraid that Golden Dawn will become a giant through all this , through all this 180 degree turn , through your bailout policy , we will grow like a giant , because now only Golden Dawn expresses the honorable NO of the Greeks , the National Resistance of Greeks , the National Sovereignty of the Greeks , the Greece that belongs to the Greeks.\ '' \\n",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,europe,thank you very much !,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,europe,"Excuse me but I haven\\'t travelled much to different countries , so I will only write some facts I think interesting about my own , Greece.\\n\\n\\nIn Greece there is a legal term , that is also written on the ID cards , which translates to \\'indigeneity\\ ' . ( that\\ 's different from citizenship ) For a person to have full rights and be considered Greek , it has to have Greek indigeneity , and to have that , it has to have at least 1 Greek parent.\\n\\n\\nThere is a considerable amount of Greek people who relate themselves more to the Roman Byzantine Empire than Ancient Greece , and they feel that the capital of their nation ( Constantinupolis / Istanbul ) is still \ '' under foreign occupation\ '' .\\n\\n\\nAlthough most Greeks will tell you that they are Christian Orthodox , a large amount of them doesn\\'t really believe in any God , and name-call Jesus and Saint Mary every day . They still baptise their children and marry in churches , but they do it for tradition\\ 's shake.\\n\\n\\nThe reason the Euzonoi ( presidential guards ) wear skirts , is because pants at other countries started becoming mainstream as a horse rider\\ 's clothe , and social sexism didn\\'t allow women to ride horses , so pants got associated with manliness . But when in the rest of the world this was happening , Greeks were isolated living in the Ottoman Empire.\\n\\n\\nGreece sits right at the point where the African , and European tectonic plates meet , and because of that it has the highest earthquake frequency in Europe.\\n\\n\\nLast time Greece made in invasion was in the 3rd century B.C. , the one Alexander started.\\n\\n\\nWhile the large majority of modern Greece\\ 's population has mixed features , and mostly Roman / Etruscan , there is a very short amount of population ( a few thousands perhaps ) that have all the bodily shapes and features that can be seen on ancient Greek statues . ( \\'Greek nose\\ ' , curly hair , \\'Greek feet\\ ' , etc ) \\n\\n\\nEvery mountain , every lake , and every cave in Greece , has its own legend or myth . Some God or Fairy , or other being will be somehow related to any place.\\n\\n\\nIn the WW2 , Italy which was an ally to Germany , send a letter to Greece , asking its submission and co-operation , to allow Axis forces to pass through it , to get to Palestine / Israel , to attack the British forces that were stationed there . Greece replied with only a single word , \ '' No\ '' . This day is comemorated in Greece every year , and it is known as the \ '' No Day\ '' .\\n\\n\\nIn 1996 there was a dispute between Greece and Turkey , about the belonging of an island known as Imia to Greeks , and Kardak to Turks . When some Turkish journalists went on the island and removed the Greek flag that was there , the Greek minister of defense said to the medias that were asking about it that \ '' The air took the flag away\ '' , to calm the tensions of Greek people . The truth was later revealed in a leak.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Logic is related to Logos , the same way politics are related to polis . So logic isn\\'t a thing of its own self , but something that is immidately related to Logos , and couldn\\'t exist without Logos . Logos is the \\'mother\\ ' of logic , reason , and words , as the process of thinking involves words , as we think in our language . So Logos is this concept.\\n\\n\u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ( Barbarian ) : Essentially the meaning of the word is \ '' someone who has not the culture , language , ways and costumes of Greeks\ '' . Ancient Greeks also used a verb related to this word , that was used to describe other Greeks in some occasions , \ '' \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\ '' ( Barbar-ing ) which meant \ '' speaking or acting like a Barbarian\ '' .\\n\\n\u0395\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 ( Henad ) : The concept of one consisting of many parts that are all in unison in such a way so they all form and act as one.\\n\\n\u0399\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ( Isegoria ) : The concept of listening to what one has to say and judge his words on their own merit , no matter who he is that says them.\\n\\n\u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( Ethnos ) : it is a word that wrongly is often translated as \\'nation\\ ' , but it\\ 's meaning is considerably more specific . The term \\'nation\\ ' as we mostly use it , means a total of people who feel like they have something binding them together that differentiates them from other people . So someone can belong in the American nation and be a Muslim , or have a 100 % African ancestry , if they feel Americans . But Ethnos is reffering to a total of people that have the same ancestry , language , religion , ways , customes , and worldview . Those people who have all this in common , will belong to the same Ethnos , even though they might belong in different nations . \\n\\n\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 ( Theos ) : This word is translated as \\'god\\ ' , but lot of its meaning is lost in translation . Greeks called Zeus , Hera , etc with that word . But the literal meaning of the word means \ '' one who travels fast\ '' , and they called these beings like that , because people from one village would say that let\\ 's say Apollo visited them one day , then people of a village 10 days away would say that Apollo visited their own village one day after he visited the first village ... So they they thought of calling these beings with a word that kind of means \ '' Fast traveling individual\ '' .",Greek,Greek

He spoke about the need of having a non exclusive public education system ( school ) , he defended that slaves weren\\'t born inferior but given the same luck and benefits a \\'free man\\ ' had , a slave could do as well as any other \\'free man\\ ' , and he also defended that women shouldn\\'t be closed and isolated inside houses , but that they should join men in education and working . He had made some realisations and proposed things , that only the last 1-2 centuries we got to materialize in our world , and what\\ 's most interesting in this man\\ 's books , is that what he wrote 2500 years ago , is mostly still relevant for our modern societies .

Those who present themselves as representatives of Muslims in Greece and talk with the government and press supporting the particular Mosque are not chosen or elected by local Muslims to represent them , and are linked to the \ '' Muslim Brotherhood\ '' that he calls a terrorist organization . Most probably these \ '' representatives\ '' are going to get a leading or other important role once the Mosque is done.\\n\\n2 . The government is ignorant and the way it wants to create this Mosque is wrong , for example it lists a number of Muslims that this Mosque will be open to , including Sunni , Shia , Sufi ... He says there are going to be problems because some of these groups consider other groups heretic and such and don\\'t get along well together . That there will be infighting between Muslims if this happens on who is going to lead and control the Mosque , and not only that but in turn that quarrel will generate a climate of Islamophobia for the rest non-Muslim people , and that in the end only harm and problems will come out of it . In another video he has called Sufis \ '' mystics that do magic and dress like women\ '' pejoratively.\\n\\n3 . He calls one of the groups that is included in this list ( Harigit ) a dangerous heresy that out of it have spawned terrorist groups like Al Quaeda .

Then the haircut happened , which made investors to be afraid of buying Greek bonds . Then layoffs and salary reduction in the public sector happened , that resulted in less money circulating on the local market , deepening the economic depression .

When a country \\n\ '' needs money\ '' one thing they can do is sell bonds/bills etc . The incentive for people to buy said bonds is their interest rate . The interest rate reflects the amount of risk of non-payment that bond has.\\n\\nSo if a country is almost assured to pay ( say Germany ) the bonds will have negligible yields . If a country might not pay , then the bonds will have large yields.\\n\\nSo when your banks bought Greek Dept , it carried a risk . So in 2009-2010 it turned out that Greece can\\'t pay . Well your politicians - since a bank bailout was pretty recent - decided to transfer that risk from your banks to the government . \\n\\nSo now can we stop with the childish \ '' you borrowed money now pay us back\ '' bollocks ? **Every** investment carries a risk .

Anergos,europe,"Let me preface this by saying I am not pro-Syriza . They did a bad job but I\\ 'll get to that and how it is explainable.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\nAusterity is one of the proposed set of policies that aim at deficit reduction . As such , there isn\\'t a single political party in Greece , there isn\\'t a single Greek person who disagrees with the notion that Greece needed some policies of austerity . Our budget was messed up and everyone acknowledges that.\\n\\nThe problem is with specific measures and how they were called to be applied . Anyone claiming that Greece \ '' didn\\'t try hard enough\ '' should be metaphorically slapped silly . There hasn\\'t been a single country able to almost eliminate a 15 % budget deficit in 5 years time . France has a ~4 % deficit and they\\ 're asking for an extension to 2017 to drop it to the \ '' required\ '' 3 % GDP , just a 1 % drop.\\n\\nThe problem was that this was - and I am using Varoufakis analogue - a bad medicine . While it worked , it was full of destructive side effects.\\n\\nSo Syriza\\ 's promise was to try and negotiate a new package that eased on those side effects . Of course they would not go in a new spending spree , there aren\\'t any money.\\n\\n\\nNow something else , pretty minor , but still . The \ '' troika\ '' didn\\'t enable Greece to spend \u20ac240BN more than it could have spend . The banks did , they were the original lenders . And that wasn\\'t the face value of the debt . \\n\\nNow enough with these things , let\\ 's talk about Syriza and what happened by starting with a little background.\\n\\n**ECB**\\n\\nIn order for central banks to provide liquidity to the banks , they need to have collateral , usually govt bonds . But ECB does not accept junk rated bonds , which unfortunately the Greek banks had . However ECB bent their own rules and deemed they were acceptable . That was till Syriza came to power.\\n\\n**Syriza**\\n\\nSyriza came to power with a promise of a new deal , a deal with better terms that would allow the Greek economy to recover . \\n\\nTheir tactics were pretty aggressive . But they were amateurs in the negotiation and overestimated both their negotiating position and ECB\\ 's stance . \\n\\nThey shouted left and right that they do not accept the 2nd bailout terms , that the program will not continue etc . That was enough to push ECB to revoke their current stance of accepting Greek junk bonds as collateral - even though nothing had actually changed in that regard . \\n\\nSyriza\\ 's politicians didn\\'t expect that . That was during February I think , and that\\ 's when things started going sideways for the new government.\\n\\nGreek banks had to rely on ELA , which among other things has a bigger interest rate and can be frozen at a moment\\ 's notice without special justification . A 2/3 vote on ECB\\ 's governing council and that\\ 's that.\\n\\nAdd the fact that Greece did not have access to the markets , could not receive any of the bailout trenches , and the debt kept pilling on . \\n\\nFast forward further fuck ups from Varoufakis , the unexpected hard stance of the creditors , the *catastrophic* ELA freeze and the idiotic referendum and we reach today.\\n\\n -- -- -\\n\\nSyriza *had* honest intentions . I mean **everyone** knew that the debt was not payable . They just had the balls to say it out loud . But the way they went about things was amateurish . Syriza\\ 's politicans are inept , that\\ 's certain.\\n\\nSo now it\\ 's time for a question : \\n\\nWould you support the same old parties that partook in the destruction of the country for so many years now ?

About him being a man of the \ '' creditors\ '' , with the goal of promoting austerity measures across the periphery or somesuch . One of the accusers was working within Elstat.\\n\\nThere\\ 's some rumors going on that the large charge ( fudging the numbers ) has been dropped yesterday but the second charge ( working with the IMF at the same time , which I believe constitutes a conflict of interest ) still standing.\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Anergos,europe,"**Incoming wall\\'o\\'text . ** \\n\\nGovernment debt to GDP was pretty constant till 2008 . That includes [ Greece ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/H3CKQky.jpg ) , just to dispel certain myths.\\n\\nSee that point in 2008 ? Anyone remember what happened then ? How about after ? Why isn\\'t the debt to GDP shrinking even after that many cuts ? Increasing austerity in times of crisis increases the debt/GDP . It\\ 's a denominator problem , austerity = smaller GDP = larger Debt/GDP . In a crisis , the more you cut , the larger the debt becomes . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's talk a bit on how we got there . It was a problem of bond yield convergence . You see before the euro , government bond yields were higher . And I mean HIGHER , for instance French bond yields were ~15 % . Why were French bond yields that high ? It\\ 's not as if France would skip payment ... Well Exchange rate risk plus inflation risk . The euro project meant no such risks . Markets priced accordingly and since the risk was too low , the yields were getting smaller and smaller.\\n\\nWell that\\ 's a problem for banks . You see , back then , they were getting good money from bond yields , but that was about to disappear . Banks loved sovereign debt , the more they had the more collateral to borrow more in the repo market financing . But with the price of bonds going up ( yields going down ) how could they make money ? Well , grab as much as you can before other banks do . Which meant every banks wanted bonds , which pressed the interest rates to become ever smaller , which meant they *needed* more and so on . \\n\\n70 % of the European funding are repo transactions . But when the European Council said that all sovereign debt withing the euro would be treated the same banks went berserk . They doubled their balance sheets and became very big very fast . But that is a problem . What would happen if the banks went into trouble ? \\n\\nBefore the euro , if say French banks went into trouble , it was an \ '' easy\ '' fix . Print more francs . Job done . But this isn\\'t the case with the euro . Everybody assumed it was the ECB\\ 's job , a lender of last resorts . It wasn\\'t . \\n\\nRating agencies started to rate down on sovereign debt . Which essentially meant the bank assets . Case in point , French banks had 33 % of the French GDP on crappy assets from the South . German banks ? 20 % of German GDP.\\n\\nGerman people saved their money . Deutsche Bank took their money and bought Greek Debt . Greek people had money to buy German products . Everyone was happy . \\n\\nUntil the crisis of 2008 when all shit got loose . Funding came to a stop . How could they deal with the situation without the ability to print euros ? ECB\\ 's function was to set an inflation target , not a lender of last resorts.\\n\\nFrench bank assets ? 450 % of French GDP . Total EU bank assets ? 300 % of total EU GDP . We\\ 're talking about MINDBLOWING numbers . How on earth can you bail out *that* ? \\n\\n**The problem was not spending too much . The problem was over-lending . ** \\n\\nSolution ? Dump money into the banking circuits . Draghi dumped ~2trillion of euros there . Job done.\\n\\nHow come France with a deficit grows now ? No austerity there . How come french yields are shrinking even though they are borrowing more ? \\n\\nEverybody used ECB\\ 's money , buy said bonds , yields drop , presto.\\n\\nWhat about Greece ? Greece can fuck off , it\\ 's been cut from Draghi\\ 's plan.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n",Greek,Greek

Anergos,europe,"& gt ; No , it wasnt . Germany was controlled by the allied forces for a significant amount of time , with the allied forces basically being able to pull the plug on the German government for a while afterwards if need be . Nobody gave Germany a bunch of money and told them to just do what they thought was best with it.\\n\\nGermany\\ 's debt repayment was tied to their exports . That gave incentives to creditors to buy German goods.\\n\\nCompare it to tying Greek Debt repayment to growth . That will give incentives to creditors to invest in Greek growth . That\\ 's pretty similar in my books.\\n\\nI will not delve into how German govt hands were tied compared to the Greek situation now . Suffice to say Greece needs approval for every economic measure they pass through parliament and there is no fear of Greece becoming an aggressor country.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Greece is still a democracy , and regardless of how this thing goes , actual meaningful change that gets Greece to becoming a country capable of actually sustaining itself is going to mean a lot of hardships for the population , more than there are now . Its not unreasonable to believe that the Greek people might not be willing to do that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you mean by more ? You don\\'t seem to grasp the situation in Greece right now . There is no more . That\\ 's why Syriza was elected . 25 % unemployment , 40 % of populace below poverty line , salaries taking a 30-45 % dive but price of goods remain the same , what more ? Increase unemployment ? How\\ 's Greece going to make money for the payments ? Decrease salaries ? How are Greek people going to buy food and medicines ? Do you see Lidl or any other exporter rushing to drop prices on their primary goods in Greece ? \\n\\n & gt ; Because the claim has no legal value , and Greecce knows it . Otherwise they would have taken it to court . The issue is that you dont throw what you know to be a bogus claim into someones face while also effectively asking for donations . Greece is ultimately reliant on goodwill from other nations , and theyre doing a stunning job at pissing it away.\\n\\nHow exactly are you sure that it has no legal value ? Are you expert in international law and have examined the Greek documents ? Up until they actually put those documents under examination by experts , no one can tell , not me , not you.\\n\\nAnd what donations are you talking about ? Who\\ 's giving Greece free money ? IMF ? 30 billion loan over 5 years netted a healthy 2billion profit , I wouldn\\'t call that a donation . No one is giving \ '' free money\ '' .\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Im pretty confident they could , its not an impossible thing to do like you make it seem . The reason they dont is because its much more reasonable not to do so , so long as you can afford it . Greece cant afford it though , because they simply have too much debt , so their total deficit is too high if they dont manage to run a pretty high primary surplus.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a single economist that says it\\ 's doable . I mean , your country , the epitome of austerity , with the lowest unemployment in EU , in a top economic shape and with excellent efficiency , reached a 3 % surplus ONCE from 1995 . You expect a country with 25 % unemployment to sustain itself for that long a period of time with 4.5 % ? Let\\ 's be reasonable now ... \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Greece hasnt \ '' followed a program\ '' . Greece has been given parameters they would be required to meet in order to receive financial help .

Apolitikal,europe,"Oh my god , I agree with so many things of what you just said . Except for one , the \ '' leftist\ '' argument . I don\\'t know whether you\\ 're Greek or not and whether you\\ 're familiar with our politics , but the 2004-2009 government was a centre-right wing one . That government was lying about the deficit ( on the 2nd of October of 2009 , the Karamanlis administration reported a prospected deficit of 6 % of the GDP to the EU Commission and the next Government after the 04/10/09 elections , revised that to 12,5 % . That number would again be revised and finalised in 2010 , when the newly formed ELSTAT ( Hellenic Statistical Authority ) and Eurostat announced the 2009 deficit to be 15,4 % of the GDP ) and things went really out of control . So the problem was the deficit.\\n\\nHowever , the reasons that Greece had such a deficit and its causes , have yet to be recognised and accepted by the public and tackled by the bailout programs . Early retirements at 55 ( or younger for women ) in the broader public sector with pensions and benefits immeasurably ( literally ) inconsistent to what someone has paid during his working life . A 10 people job in 1980 , was a 3 people job in 2005 . No one cared to reorganize the public sector . I don\\'t know up until which point the government didn\\'t even know how many people were working in the public sector . Huge deficits in public-held companies , railways , energy , water , banks . As for the sleeping giant that is the Greek agriculture ( which undoubtedly can produce of the highest quality exportable products ) , the bulk of the money that was given by the EU throughout the years , ended up becoming 2-story houses , a couple of Mercedes E-class and lovely nights with lovely girls from the former communist countries ( also , they used to declare their crops to be many times larger than they actually were and the state didn\\'t have the means of checking that . Well , the state didn\\'t want to create the infrastructure for those checks ) \\n\\nI mean , it\\ 's not just one or two or three things . If you don\\'t live here and don\\'t have dealings with the state and don\\'t know people to tell you stories and examples , you can\\'t realise why Greece is still so far behind . It\\ 's sad and angering for the hard working people . And it angers me that the EU partners haven\\'t pushed hard enough for the necessary reforms . We keep raising the taxes to achieve the targeted primary surplus , but noone seems to care about the other part of that calculation , government spending .

Arathian,europe,"# Full Text\\n\\nFRANCE\u2019S most pro-European presidential candidate took his campaign to London this week to a rapturous welcome . Emmanuel Macron , a 39-year-old former Socialist economy minister , was there to court the French vote abroad , and is exactly the sort of upbeat , international-minded tech enthusiast that London\u2019s latte-drinking French voters adore . Campaigning as an independent for votes on the left and the right , Mr Macron has pulled off the astonishing feat of hauling himself up from rank outsider to joint second place in the polls . But the closer he gets to a shot at the French presidency , the tougher his campaign is turning out to be.\\n\\nA few days before Mr Macron turned up in London , he had been in more hostile territory : the Mediterranean naval port of Toulon , traditionally held by the right . The entrance to his rally was blocked by scores of enraged National Front ( FN ) supporters and pieds-noirs ( ethnic French who resided in Algeria during colonial rule ) , chanting \u201cMacron traitor ! \u201d On a trip to Algeria that week , he had called France\u2019s colonisation of the north African country a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d.\\n\\nThe rally went ahead all the same . Mr Macron told the audience that he was \u201csorry\u201d if he had \u201cwounded\u201d anybody , but that France needed to confront all sides of its history . The venue was a little over half full , and the atmosphere flat . The crowd seemed motivated as much by curiosity as conviction . Jean-Luc , a high-school maths teacher , said he had never been to a political rally and was \u201cintrigued\u201d by Mr Macron . Robert , a retired salesman , said he voted for Fran\u00e7ois Fillon , the centre-right candidate , at his party\u2019s primary but was now \u201clooking for a way out\u201d . ( Mr Fillon is under investigation for having employed family members on the parliamentary payroll , despite little evidence that they did much work . ) It was Mr Macron\u2019s \u201cdifferent way of doing politics\u201d that appealed , said a retired naval worker and Socialist voter ; he was not yet sure of his vote . \\n\\nWith two months to go before the first-round , the French presidential election has become more unpredictable than any in recent history . The only near-certainty is that the FN\u2019s Marine Le Pen will win one of the two places in the run-off . This has turned the election into a race to face her . Though she has staged almost no rallies , Ms Le Pen tops first-round polling , with about 26 % of the vote ( see article ) . Over three-quarters of her voters say they are sure of their choice . For Mr Macron , who is neck-and-neck with Mr Fillon in second place , this share is just 45 % .\\n\\nThat Mr Macron is in this position is remarkable enough . This , after all , is a young man who in July 2014 , after quitting his job as deputy chief of staff to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , could be found in his top-floor office at the Elys\u00e9e Palace cheerfully mulling over plans to write a book , or perhaps teach philosophy . Today , the offices of En Marche ! , the movement he founded last year , are filled with young people in sweatshirts , and feel like a cross between a start-up and a student society . He has attracted policy heavyweights , such as Jean Pisani-Ferry , an economist , and the support of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou , a centrist who has declined to run himself . And he is recruiting candidates from all backgrounds to stand at parliamentary elections in June . The objective , says Mr Macron , is to reject \u201cyesterday\u2019s choices\u201d , pursue \u201cradical novelty\u201d in politics , and build \u201ca new France\u201d.\\n\\n**Not your regular Gilles**\\n\\nYet , besides his inexperience , two obstacles in particular lie ahead if Mr Macron is to beat Mr Fillon into the second round . One is whether he can find a way to speak to a broader electorate , beyond the metropolitan voters with a university degree who favour him . \u201cHe\u2019s too intellectual , \u201d says a retired antique dealer , in a caf\u00e9 overlooking the port in Toulon , where the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is docked while undergoing repairs . Mr Macron\u2019s overtly pro-European politics are unfashionable in parts of France these days . His support for Germany\u2019s open-border policy towards Syrian refugees\u2014he says it \u201csaved our collective dignity\u201d\u2014collides with a popular mood of rising nationalism . And Mr Macron\u2019s embrace of technological disruption does not resonate with those who fear they will be its next victims . \u201cHe is quite weak among manual workers and employees , and it\u2019s not possible to construct a successful candidacy without them , \u201d says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet of Ifop , a polling group.\\nThe second is how far his poll success is down to an engaging personality rather than a convincing programme . The country , he says , needs \u201cvision\u201d , not scores of policy ideas that promptly get shelved by presidents in power . But his reluctance to be too precise has left Mr Macron open to the charge of ambiguity . Asked which of his policies they liked best , supporters questioned in Toulon were unable to answer . Mr Macron is due shortly to unveil more specific plans which , perhaps tactically , he has long avoided . Yet this carries fresh risks . Some of the ideas he sketched out in \u201cR\u00e9volution\u201d , the book he published last year , are profoundly radical , certainly for France . He wants to curb the overall level of public spending ; have the state take over the employer- and union-run unemployment benefit system in place since the second world war ; and devolve most negotiations on working conditions to companies . He is liberal , he says , \u201cin a Nordic sense\u201d . Getting the right balance between what France needs , and what the French will vote for , will be perilous.\\n\\nA historically unusual opportunity is within Mr Macron\u2019s grasp : the chance of beating all established party candidates into the second round , and from there into the presidency . Polls suggest that he would be a more solid run-off candidate against Ms Le Pen than would the damaged Mr Fillon . Under the Fifth Republic , no independent has ever pulled off such a feat . Then again , none has had such a remarkable opportunity to do so .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; You\\ 're being sarcastic and patronising in both your comments which I find unnecessary.\\n\\nI was not being sarcastic at any point . Nor patronizing , I would like to think . I am just pointing out the facts.\\n\\n & gt ; As you said , the individual wants something deleted , not the government . Just because the government is acting on behalf and for the benefit of the individual does not make it \ '' government censorship\ '' . You highlighted government in your sentence as if having the word in there makes it so.\\n\\nThe government enforces the law to delete information . That automatically makes it government censorship since compliance is obligatory under law . The point of highlighting the government was to show the enforcer of said law.\\n\\nThe fact that a private individual requested the government to censor something ( which happens often , I might add ) does not make the government\\ 's actions not-censorship magically.\\n\\n & gt ; The censorship aspect of this can be argued for , but it\\ 's certainly not \ '' textbook\ '' as no such law or situation has existed before.\\n\\nIt is textbook censorship since the government is actively censoring information . The law being new is quite irrelevant to that . If the government introduced a law dictating that you can never talk about ducks , that law would also be textbook censorship despite the law being a new one.\\n\\n & gt ; There are arguments that can be made on either side , I don\\'t understand the conviction some have on how this is some big government conspiracy somehow.\\n\\nNobody here is talking about conspiracies . I am just pointing out that this is a plain censorship law and I hate censorship laws . I don\\'t think the government here is \ '' conspiring\ '' to do anything in particular . Conspiracy would imply a deeper plan which I doubt exists . This law is just dumb , harmful and it is censorship.\\n\\nAnd yes , it is big government infringing on the right to free speech.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; You seem to live in the illusion that \ '' being rich\ '' is something we can all do together in this world.\\n\\nBecause we can.\\n\\n & gt ; In simple terms being rich means \ '' owning more things than the other\ '' \\n\\nNo it isn\\'t . It is \ '' being able to afford a large amount of luxuries without a significant problem\ '' . Or , as the dictionairy puts it\\n\\n\ '' having a great deal of money or assets ; wealthy.\ '' \\n\\nA millionaire and a billionaire are both rich even though the billionaire owns way more stuff . That is an incredibly bad definition of richness.\\n\\nAlso , not everyone *needs* to be rich . Middle class and higher lower class existing is both healthy and normal in the current system . Not everyone needs or wants to work the required hours and put the required effort to reach the higher status . No country will ever have all its citizens do that.\\n\\n & gt ; If everyone has an equal amount of things nobody is rich\\n\\nIf everyone could afford a big house , 2 cars , one of which is a high quality Ferrari and whatever meal they choose we would all be rich . Owning 1 or 3 houses after that literally makes no difference because , again , your definition of being rich is wrong.\\n\\n & gt ; Keeping Africans away from our wealth isn\\'t racism , it\\ 's greed.\\n\\nNot wanting to lose your hard earned stuff stuff isn\\'t greed , it is self-preservation . It is a most basic human trait , really.\\n\\n & gt ; Greed is what motivated us to build this continent in the first place and it\\ 's what made us rich enough to act as though socialism works . I , for one , see little in this pseudo Christian notion of sharing our riches \ '' because it\\ 's the right thing to do\ '' .\\n\\nSocialism isn\\'t what motivates us to save third world countries . in fact , I quite dislike socialism in that sense.\\n\\nKnow which countries have made the biggest jumps in income the past 20 years ? The ones who became more capitalist . China had mass famines 30 years ago and today the average citizen can afford a car and eats twice a day . The only thing that changed is that they opened up to capitalist trade.\\n\\nNever believe that we can\\'t nor shouldn\\'t help countries . There are ways to hinder them ( eg sanctions ) but the majority of the time , we can help them help themselves and we both profit . Both China and the western world are better off today than they were 30 years ago due to our relationship .

[ here is the full subthread ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ddrww/holy_war_of_isis_arrives_in_germany/cjornuf ) \\n\\nMy comment to someone asking why I think multiculturalism objectively failed : \\n\\n\ '' First off , diversity is an acceptance of mass immigration without a particular pressure to immigrants to assimilate or change their culture within the host country and instead a pressure to locals to accept said cultures . Tell me if you disagree with this definition so we can speak from a common ground.\\n\\nNow , the objective failures : \\n\\n-It brought over the worst qualities of the other countries along with the good ones and did nothing to pan them out . This is in stark contrast with other immigration models like the American melting pot . This thread is a good case in point of this.\\n\\n-It created strong cultural tensions and locals are not the only ones to blame . The immigrants themselves are not interested in interacting with the locals because most of them come from cultures that don\\'t pressure them into acceptance . Since the policy , by definition , doesn\\'t try to change it , it remains that way.\\n\\n-Strong cultural tensions brought strong cultural backlash . This IS a failure of policy . If a policy brings on such a strong backlash something is done wrong , regardless if you agree or disagree with the backlash.\\n\\n-It increased crime . Yes it did . You might say it is the fault of the locals for not accommodating immigrants but it still did . Sweden is the rape capital of the world and it isn\\'t Swedes that are doing the raping.\\n\\n-It distorted local cultures . I left this for last because it isn\\'t exactly an objective one since many don\\'t actually care about it , but I do . So this is a failure for me . Many smaller cultures within the countries got homogenized the past 2 decades in a push of grand cultural change by the governments of Europe and that is a loss.\\n\\nedit , also a particularly bad one I forgot : \\n\\n-Mass immigration was not controlled in any way for most of the past decade which led to a vast increase of unskilled labour that severely saturated the low skill labour market with no corresponding increase in low skill labour availability . This led to severe lowing of wages , and even unemployment , of the poorer strata of locals as well as a deterioration of lifestyle.\ '' \\n \\n\\nAs far as I am concerned , my comment still stands and , if anything , it is stronger today .",Greek,Greek

In his apology for the remarks last month , Mr McDonnell claimed he only made them to promote the peace process . In fact , however , Mr McDonnell told the IRA\u2019s official newspaper that he opposed the peace process negotiations to create a power-sharing assembly in what became the Good Friday Agreement.\\n\\n & gt ; Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell \u201cwork closely\u201d with the Wolfe Tone Society , according to its convenor , Dennis Grace , speaking at the 2006 event.It was at the Wolfe Tone Society\u2019s 2003 commemoration that Mr McDonnell made his now notorious comments calling for Sands and other terrorists to be \u201chonoured , \u201d adding : \u201cIt was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of Bobby Sands that brought Britain to the negotiating table.\u201d\\n\\netc etc\\n\\n**Hamas : **\\n\\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11749043/Andrew-Gilligan-Jeremy-Corbyn-friend-to-Hamas-Iran-and-extremists.html\\n\\nthis article has most of what you need but it mostly focuses on Corbyn ( who is even more crazy in the Hamas front being the chairman of the \ '' stop the war\ '' foundation which is a whole different set of whackos ) \\n\\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11840793/jeremy-corbyn-hamas-praise-israel-palestine-conflict.html\\n\\nAlso the \ '' respect\ '' is two ways with Hamas.\\n\\nIf you want any further sources , please do tell.\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"The problem with Greece is that due to the crisis , everything is extremely complicated nowadays.\\n\\nIf magically I became the prime minister tomorrow ( assume with a relatively majority right wing government that roughly follows my ideals ) : \\n\\n-I would follow the current deal with the EU to the fullest extend.\\n\\n-I would appeal for EU countries to provide us with tax collectors and officials charged with looking for public corruption . The EU had actually suggested that before but we declined . I wouldn\\'t necessarily put them directly collecting taxes ( since they would probably not be many of them ) but instead advisory and overwatching rolls , especially for higher level corruption.\\n\\n-Would probably start a \ '' good will\ '' tour up north immediately to try to fix Tsipras\\ ' diplomatic fuck ups . Not just Germany , but I would also focus on Poland/Slovenia/Finland/Baltics . Sign a few cooperation deals , say a couple of nice words in public along with a German official to calm the markets down.\\n\\n-After about 6-8 months of implementing the current deal , I would secretly start talks about actually making the debt reasonably manageable while not creating a situation of potential political suicide for European leaders . Basically , debt cuts would be given constant disguises or even provided indirectly ( for example , EU funds could be increased and redicted towards there ) . The point would be for the cuts to happen without anyone noticing . The goal would be that by the end of the first year , a solid guideline towards reducing the debt would be established that would essentially replace the current deal.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\\n\\nAssuming this goes well , and it very well might not since the situation is so volatile , after that I would focus on crushing corruption and reducing state expenses . I would probably tax , to some extend , the church and reduce millitary spending by a bit . Hopefully , by then the foreign bureaucrats overseeing the Greek collectors will have helped stem tax evasion quite a bit which would afford small tax cuts to benefit the wider population , especially in food.\\n\\nMy pet project would probably be to digitize state expenses , so literally every Greek could see where the money are spend and then advertise the shit out of that . The idea would be that at least 1/10 Greeks will be checking that place occasionally and start to give Greeks a \ '' our tax dollars\ '' mentallity for watching over the state so we don\\'t go back to being a cleptocracy when the crisis is over.\\n\\nAlso start an anti-corruption organization similar to Romania\\ 's .

Arathian,europe,"https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign\\n\\n & gt ; The Hundred Flowers Campaign , also termed the Hundred Flowers Movement ( simplified Chinese : \u767e\u82b1\u8fd0\u52a8 ; traditional Chinese : \u767e\u82b1\u904b\u52d5 ; pinyin : B\u01ceihu\u0101 y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng ) , was a period in 1956 in the People\\ 's Republic of China [ 1 ] during which the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) encouraged its citizens to openly express their opinions of the communist regime . Differing views and solutions to national policy were encouraged based on the famous expression by Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong : \ '' The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is designed to promote the flourishing of the arts and the progress of science.\ '' [ 2 ] [ 3 ] After this brief period of liberalization , Mao abruptly changed course . The crackdown continued through 1957 as an Anti-Rightist Campaign against those who were critical of the regime and its ideology . Those targeted were publicly criticized and condemned to prison labor camps . [ 4 ] Mao remarked at the time that he had \ '' enticed the snakes out of their caves.\ '' [ 4 ] [ 5 ] \\n\\n & gt ; The first part of the phrase is often remembered as \ '' let a hundred flowers bloom\ '' . It is used to refer to an orchestrated campaign to flush out dissidents by encouraging them to show themselves as critical of the regime , and then subsequently imprison them . This view is supported by authors Clive James and Jung Chang , who posit that the campaign was , from the start , a ruse intended to expose rightists and counter-revolutionaries , and that Mao Zedong persecuted those whose views were different from the party\\ 's .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text : **\\n\\nA DEADLY car bomb in Ankara on February 17th just a few hundred metres from Turkey\u2019s parliament has fanned the flames of the war that Turkish troops are fighting against Kurdish insurgents in the country\u2019s south-east . It also threatens to pull Turkey yet deeper into the chaos in Syria and to sour its relations with America . Most worryingly , it has brought Turkey one step closer to a direct confrontation with Russia.\\n\\nOn Thursday , Turkish officials identified the man who detonated a car packed with explosives next to a military bus in the heart of the country\u2019s capital , killing 27 military personnel and one civilian , as a member of the People\u2019s Protection Units ( YPG ) , a Syrian Kurdish militia . \u201cA direct link between the attack and the YPG has been established , \u201d said Ahmet Davutoglu , the Turkish prime minister . He claimed the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party ( PKK ) , a Turkish-Kurdish group that has fought Turkey\u2019s government for decades , provided logistical support for the attack.\\n\\nThe YPG has no history of attacks inside Turkey . It denied any role in the bombing , and said the government was blaming it as a convenient excuse for launching a military operation in Syria . A senior PKK commander claimed ignorance of the attack , but did not exclude the possibility that other Kurdish militant groups were involved . \u201cWe know that previously such acts have been carried out in retaliation for massacres in Kurdistan , \u201d Cemil Bayik told a Kurdish news agency . The PKK has been battling government troops and police in Turkey\u2019s south-east since last summer ; the fighting has left hundreds dead , including over 200 civilians , and displaced more than 100,000 people.\\n\\nMetin Gurcan , a military analyst and columnist for al-Monitor , a website , finds the PKK\u2019s denial unconvincing . \u201cThey have a record of trying to franchise violence without taking responsibility , \u201d he says . \u201cThey may be trying to export the violence [ from the south-east ] to the west of the country.\ '' \\n\\nOn Thursday , a PKK roadside bomb killed six troops in Diyarbakir , a south-eastern province . The same day , Turkish jets pounded PKK bases in the highlands of northern Iraq.\\n\\nThe Ankara bombing has widened the rift between Turkey and its allies over the YPG . Turkey , which regards the group as a front for the PKK , wants America to suspend its co-operation with the militia in Syria . But Washington considers the YPG an important partner in the war against Islamic State ( IS ) . It has acknowledged ties between the YPG and the PKK , which it labels a terrorist group , but refuses to place the two in the same category.\\n\\nSince the attacks , Mr Davutoglu has doubled down . \u201cWe can not excuse any NATO ally , including the US , of having links with a terrorist organisation that strikes us in the heart of Turkey , \u201d he said on Thursday . The same day , his ministry of foreign affairs summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.\\n\\nTurkish warnings appear to be falling on deaf ears . Late on Thursday John Kirby , a spokesman for the State Department , suggested that Ankara had yet to provide conclusive proof of the YPG\u2019s involvement in the attack . He also ruled out ending American backing for the group . \u201cI think I\u2019ve said that they\u2019ve been some of the most effective fighters against Daesh [ IS ] , and they have been supported by the air from the coalition , \u201d he said . \u201cAnd going forward , I would expect that that sort of support\u2026would continue.\u201d\\n\\nThe two NATO allies will probably find a way out of the dispute . But the far deeper row between Turkey and Russia has now reached uncharted waters . Having traded threats since late November , when Turkey shot down a Russian jet that had briefly entered its airspace after a bombing run in Syria , the two sides are now embroiled in a proxy war . In past couple of weeks Russia has effectively provided the YPG with air cover , paving the way for the group\u2019s advance against Ankara-backed rebel forces north of Aleppo . The Turks have responded by raining artillery fire on the YPG for several days in a row , hinting at a possible ground operation and allowing as many as 2,000 rebels to cross into Syria to check the Kurdish offensive.\\n\\nOn February 19th Mr Davutoglu stopped just short of accusing Moscow of engineering the bombing in Ankara . \u201cI would like to warn Russia , which is giving air support to the YPG in its advance on Azaz [ a key rebel stronghold ] , not to use this terrorist group against the innocent people of Syria and Turkey , \u201d he said.\\n\\nMeanwhile , the YPG has started to leverage its budding relationship with the Russians . In an interview , the head of the newly opened Syrian-Kurdish representation to Moscow , Rodi Osman , warned that any Turkish incursion into Syria would result in a \u201cgreat war\u201d with his hosts . \u201cRussia will respond if there is an invasion , \u201d he said . \u201cThis isn\u2019t only about the Kurds , they will defend the territorial sovereignty of Syria.\u201d\\n\\nFor that reason alone , a unilateral Turkish offensive in northern Syria has hitherto seemed highly unlikely . Whoever staged the Ankara bombing hopes to have made it less so . \u201cFor an actor , or a group of actors , who want to draw Turkey into Syria , \u201d says Mr Gurcan , \u201cthis was the perfect attack.\u201d",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; I\\ 've seen about as much actual discussion in this thread as I have in all the various submissions of the past few months.\\n\\nLook . I understand you guys get lots of people yelling at you and the original thread had a sizable brigade from our \ '' sister-who-we-are-not-really-talking-to-since-she-put-a-nazi-flag-in-the-garden sub\ '' however , don\\'t you realise with this that , what you are essentially saying is , that you haven\\'t seen much discussion *you* cared about/liked in the past few months ? \\n\\nThere is an easy and quick fix for that and it is generally not checking the threads , which is absolutely fine . Filters would also work.\\n\\nCurrently , european newspaper front-page issues are not being discussed in this sub at all . How is that a success in any way ? To whom is the front page \ '' nicer\ '' to ? Obviously not the users considering the constant backlass towards the containment threads.\\n\\n & gt ; The point of this thread was to give some place for immigration to be discussed , as much as it ever was truly discussed , whilst allowing discussion of other topics to flourish as well . It seems to be working very effectively in that effect.\\n\\nAs people have pointed out much better than me in the past few threads : \\n\\nMegathreads don\\'t work like that . Stickies have the amazing feature of generally getting less discussion than normal threads since they are usually reserved for announcements . When I was a forum mod in the past it was common knowledge that stickying something was the surest way to kill discussion in it . I assume you know that too . \\n\\nThis system also has a ton of problems inherent to reddit . Discussions , even good ones , are burried in reddit due to the way comments are presented and are generally best for 2-3 people . If that was not the case , why even allow multiple threads in this sub and not have a megasticky with the top stories posted every day ? \\n\\n & gt ; If you want to discuss immigration more without megthreads , then I invite you to go to /r/Euromigration , which will be more to your desires.\\n\\nAgain , why not make a /r/europerussia too and send everyone who wants to talk about Rusisa there ? A /r/europegreece and send everyone talking about the crisis there ? Why is this discussion different than those ? What was the reasoning behind this besides \ '' we didn\\'t like the discussion going on\ '' ? \\n",Greek,Greek

No one is dying in Australian camps and it\\ 's not Auschwitz . They are also free to go back at any point . I am not saying everything is rosy , but let\\ 's not blow it out of proportion.\\n\\nAnd why do things have to be \ '' bad\ '' in an EU camp ?

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; The importance and significance of a topic is rarely proportional to the media spotlight that it gets nowadays . These news make the front pages because they sell , much like any juicy drama that disrupts people\\ 's everyday lives.\\n\\nI disagree . Check the cover pages of all the UK newspapers after the Charlie hebdo attacks . Notice a pattern in that they all refuse to show the comics involved in fear of offending Muslims . The repercussions of such attacks are far greater than a dozen people dying . If you die in a car crash , it is tragic but nothing seriously consequential on a society level . If you and a dozen others die for exercising a right , that right is under attack.\\n\\n & gt ; But it will go away . The current situation is largely a consequence of the disruptions of ruling regimes in Libya and Syria .

It\\ 's basically saying \ '' someone else should do something about this , but don\\'t ask me what\ '' . If you think something needs to be addressed , then address it.\\n\\nSure , here are some specific proposals : Ban religious schools . Ban funding from Wahhabi groups and governments . Enforce strict requirements for religious and science education . Limit rights of worship in non-designated public areas , reduce funding for religious institutions and be very strict in the selection of religious figures allowed to preach.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"Here\\ 's the thing . Vlachs in Greece are definately not a thing any more . Maybe they were 50-60 years ago , but even then they were completely Hellenized .

This is very similar to the Arvanites who were Albanian-Greeks that mostly identified as Greeks . While we have some people who still identify as Arvanites and there are Arvanite societies , they are all distinctively Greek and identify as Greek . Greeks tend to have that with subgroups , like , for example , many Pontiac Greeks who are completely Greek but identify with their origin from Pontus.\\n\\nThis is kinda like having a map of , eg , USA and randomly somewhere , instead of \ '' American\ '' you spliced \ '' Virginian\ '' .

Why should we consider her specific heed for a \ '' reasonable debate\ '' as anything more than a stall tactic ? What would she ( and you ) consider a reasonable debate ?

This and many fun tibits and top bantz about various European nations.\\n\\nLeast Favourite : This sub has too many camps that yell at each other with no intention of ever changing their minds . This directly hurts my favourite thing about this subreddit . I hope I can help reduce that ! \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? \\n\\nAbsolutely none and automoderator could as well be casting spells for all I know . However , I usually learn the computer hocus pocus rather fast when needed.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Why do you want to be a moderator ? \\n\\nRight , I will be blunt on this one : because I am a right winger.\\n\\nHowever , that doesn\\'t mean what some might expect . I don\\'t think there is a \ '' grand conspiracy of left wingers\ '' in this sub\\ 's moderation . In fact , I would go so far as to say that it is pretty much a fact that there isn\\'t such a conspiracy.\\n\\nAs a right winger , I would have the \ '' legitimacy\ '' to do something the current mods can\\'t do due to calls of \ '' censorship\ '' : I can properly moderate immigration threads . If I become a moderator , I will probably spend most of my time whacking over the head two types of people : \\n\\n-the \ '' I am not racist but muslims should be gassed\ '' people\\n\\n-the \ '' everyone who disagrees with me in & lt ; shill , racist , SJW & gt ; \ '' people.\\n\\nI intend to enforce civility and try to bring the discussion back to people discussing an event rather than a yelling competition . I strongly opposed the megathreads ( even got banned for it , although it was reversed ) but the current situation is getting slightly out of hand . My main reason for being a moderator is to help balance the front page again.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; why do you think you would be a good moderator ? \\n\\nCheck preface for a detailed answer on that . For tl ; dr : I don\\'t think I would be the best one . I do think I would be a competent one . I also think my presence in the moderation team , in itself , would be a good thing.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; do you have any experience with statistics , data-mining or reddit bots ? \\n\\nI have extensive experience with statistics . In fact , I got a minor on that ! I do not have any experience on data mining or reddit bots.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? What do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? \\n\\nI strongly opposed it . I still strongly oppose any such solutions . Immigration is a very complex story but the basics ( people going from X to Y ) has been talked about to death and anything worthwhile has been said . The point of immigration threads is to discuss specific *events* that happen as they happen . That is not possible in a megathread . Megathreads are ... .okey for single events , not great , but okey . They are absolutely terrible as a permanent solution for discussing a major topic.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What\\ 's one weakness you have ? \\n\\n [ I usually v\u00f6rk all day and neglect my family . Fok em . ] ( https : //youtu.be/2W0WsdLobq8 ? t=138 ) \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? \\n\\nObviously a hundred duck sized horses . Horses are stupid and they won\\'t form up to fight you . You can just bash em to death one by one while they are trying to flee from you . Also , they can be latter used for delicious , duck-sized horse steaks ! \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What single word connects all of these three of the following words : Europe , Pussy Cat , Teacher ?

Arathian,europe,"FULL TEXT : \\n\\nANGELA MERKEL , Germany\u2019s chancellor , is often seen as the West\u2019s last best defender of the liberal order against a tide of populism . She is likely to win re-election next autumn , but faces a challenge from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany . So Mrs Merkel needs to buck up her own party , the centre-right Christian Democratic Union , which is disillusioned with the \u201cwelcome culture\u201d for refugees that she has promoted . Speaking to party delegates on December 6th , Mrs Merkel promised that the events of 2015 , when 890,000 refugees claimed asylum in Germany , \u201ccan , shall and must not be repeated\u201d . She vaunted her government\u2019s European values of sexual equality and religious tolerance . And , in a line that drew long applause , she added that \u201cthe full veil is not appropriate for us , and should be banned wherever legally possible.\u201d\\n\\nThere is a contradiction in Mrs Merkel\u2019s embrace of liberal values and her vow to ban the full veil , known variously as the niqab or burqa . Wearing it is regarded by some Muslims as a religious duty for women when in public . A ban infringes the freedom of religion . It is also unenforceable , polarising and serves to pander to populists.\\n\\nLike many other rights , religious freedom is not absolute . Sometimes the state has good reasons to require people to show their faces : at passport controls , for example , or if they are working as , say , social workers or teachers . For security reasons , Germany already bans ski masks and other facial coverings in public demonstrations . Yet Mrs Merkel did not speak in such limited terms . She proposed the ban as a means of preventing the development of \u201cparallel societies\u201d as Germany tries to assimilate its Muslim immigrants . Forbidding religious dress worn by only a tiny fraction of those immigrants is the wrong way to accomplish this.\\n\\nSome argue that the niqab ( as well as less concealing forms of Islamic dress ) is a form of oppression . Muslim women , they say , are forced to wear the veil by family members\u2014typically their husbands , fathers or brothers . That may be true in some cases . Yet a ban might simply prevent those niqab-wearing women from leaving the house at all . Other women may choose to cover their hair or faces out of piety , or because they dislike being ogled , or to affirm their Muslim identity . Governments concerned about the subjugation of Muslim immigrant women would do better to concentrate on integration and education schemes.\\n\\nEurope\u2019s fad for such bans is driven chiefly not by principles , but politics . France introduced a burqa ban in 2010 ; some municipalities even tried to prevent Muslim women from wearing the body-covering \u201cburqini\u201d at the beach last summer . Such measures only invite extremists to paint France as an enemy of Islam . Last month the Netherlands adopted a ban on face-covering garb in education and health-care establishments , government buildings and public transport . In both cases , the real motive was to fend off the rise of anti-immigrant parties , such as Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front in France and Geert Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom in the Netherlands.\\n\\nIf centrists like Mrs Merkel now see burqa bans as minor concessions to hold off populists , they are fooling themselves . Those who want to ban veils are not worried about security but about immigration and integration . To them , limited bans confirm only that mainstream politicians are too timid to embrace the real thing . Some of them worry legitimately that Muslim immigrants do not share Europe\u2019s liberal norms . But the best way to preserve those freedoms is to let women dress as modestly as they please .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text : **\\n\\nFEW places reveal the anguish of a frozen conflict better than the 180km long buffer zone between the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus and the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ( TRNC ) . In Nicosia , the island\u2019s divided capital , barbed wire and sandbags separate a fashionable caf\u00e9 from an abandoned bookshop . The former opened last year . The latter closed in the summer of 1974 , when Turkish troops invaded the north of the island following years of ethnic bloodshed and a Greek Cypriot coup . Deeper in the demilitarized zone , a flock of sheep graze along the runway of an old international airport , a cavernous time capsule littered with broken glass and forty years of bird droppings . An airplane rusts nearby . The scene does not inspire much hope . But analysts believe that a solution to the Cyprus dispute may be more likely now than at any time in the past decade . What has changed ? \\n\\nReunification talks between the Greek south and the Turkish north started less than a year after the Turkish invasion . The closest they came to fruition was in April 2004 , when a plan brokered by the United Nations was put to a nationwide referendum . ( Turkish Cypriots backed the deal . Their Greek neighbours rejected it by a three-to-one margin . A week later , Cyprus entered the EU as a divided island , with the north effectively frozen out of the bloc and recognized by only one country , Turkey . ) The election of Mustafa Akinci as president of the TRNC in the spring of 2015 breathed new life into the peace process . Both Mr Akinci and the Greek Cypriot leader , Nicos Anastasiades , now say that a settlement is possible by the end of the year . The Eurasia Group , a consultancy , puts that likelihood at 60 % . The islanders themselves are less optimistic . In a recent poll , 62 % of Greek Cypriots said reunification seemed no closer today than one year ago\\n\\nMany of the pieces needed for a solution are in place . Mr Akinci and Mr Anastasiades , having met at least 25 times , report that consensus is within reach in several areas , including governance , property , and the application of EU law in the north . Turkey , which has enough problems to deal with inside its own borders , has publicly backed an agreement . Without Cyprus on board , Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government can not hope to unlock stalled membership talks with the EU . ( Mr Anastasiades stresses he will \u201cnever\u201d drop his veto on the negotiations \u201cunless Turkey gives some signs that they mean business.\u201d ) The changing regional energy map also favours a deal . Greek Cypriots know that reunification might be their only chance to market the island\u2019s offshore gas deposits , possibly through an Israeli pipeline to Turkey ( assuming those two also manage to reconcile ) . \u201cIf we have a solution , we will be able to exploit our natural gas , \u201d says one former negotiator . \u201cIf not , nobody knows how Turkey will behave.\u201d\\n\\nYet the road to a deal remains mined with misgivings and disagreements over territory , power sharing , and security guarantees . In the economically stunted north , any agreement will have to allay fears of a flood of Greek Cypriot capital and underrepresentation in the governing bodies of a united island . To be palatable in the south , it will have to ensure property restitution and the withdrawal of the 40,000 Turkish troops stationed in the TRNC . Another hurdle is the cost of a settlement . Even with a mix of remedies , including reinstatement and property swaps , compensating the 160,000 Greek and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots who abandoned their homes in the 1970s will cost billions of euros . There is fear that the momentum is ebbing . The talks have already slowed ahead of a May 22 parliamentary vote in the south . In the north , Mr. Akinci faces potential pushback from a newly formed cabinet headed by hardliners . An increasingly unpredictable Turkey may yet throw a wrench in the works . \u201cThe longer the talks go on , the greater the chance that we could see problems arise , \u201d says James Ker-Lindsay at the London School of Economics . After four decades of talks and spilled ink , Cypriots have reason to hope for the best and prepare for the usual .",Greek,Greek

People created something called \ '' companies\ '' for that , in effect investment funds for singular , large-scale projects .

Private entities can be hired by the state to complete certain aspects of it but they have never made them privately . Never . Feel free to prove me wrong by linking a single case.\\n\\n & gt ; Why industry today should not be interested to build roads , bridges or hospitals today ( to improve mission-critical infrastructure ) has never been explained by statists.\\n\\nRoads , hospitals etc all multiply their economic cost into profit multiple times over , even in the short term .

Arathian,europe,"I am an atheist and support a ban on abortion ! \\n\\nYeah , I expect this won\\'t be popular here . \\n\\nI do add a few exceptions to it . If the life of the mother is in direct danger due to the pregnancy , she should have the right to abort . If the child has extreme , uncurable genetic diseases that will make its life miserable and/or very short , abortion should be an option.\\n\\nI also think it should be a state\\ 's top priority to seriously upgrade its motherhood support systems ( social care , free doctor visits and so on ) as well as a seriously improved state care of children in the adoption system . So no , the \\'caring for children\\ ' should not stop the moment they are birthed.\\n\\nI also should clarify I do not believe abortion should be available in case of poverty , teen pregnancy or rape . The child is not responsible for any of the 3 scenarios . I do , obviously , want support for the mothers in all 3 situations though , and very much including psychological support.\\n\\n -- -- -- -- \\n\\nSo , now to my actual reasoning behind the initial statement : \\n\\nMy default position on things are that they are none of my business unless proven otherwise . So until a few years back , I was obviously fully pro-choice.\\n\\nHowever , and this is where 99 % of you will disagree with me , I was convinced that embryos , from fertilisation on , are human the same way you and I am . Anyone who comes to that conclusion , I hope is obvious , would oppose abortion as it would be killing innocent humans in their perspective . And so it was with me.\\n\\nMy reasons behind that change were multiple , however , the main one was that the way we define \ '' human\ '' and \ '' not human\ '' in embryos is so entirely arbitrary it simply is made up.\\n\\nFor example : \\n\\n-A woman gets an abortion at 3 months old : not human\\n\\n-A woman gets assaulted and has a miscarriage as a result at 3 months : person who assaulted her is tried for murder ( and have been convicted of that multiple times ) .\\n\\n-Person whose heart doesn\\'t work - human\\n\\n-Embryo whose heart doesn\\'t work - not human\\n\\nThen we have the completely arbitrary dates . 3 months , 4 months , 5 months and so on . Like if an embryo that is 2 months and 30 days old is suddenly so much less human than an embryo that is 1 day older.\\n\\nIn short , I don\\'t believe there is any concrete , scientific reasoning on why an \ '' embryo\ '' would be any less human than a human grown man . Embryos are human and simply in a different development stage , the same way an old man and a baby are both human in different development stages . Showing me a picture of an embryo being a bunch of cells and going \ '' ooooo , that totally doesn\\'t look like a human\ '' is meaningless . Humans are extremely diverse in their development . \ '' A bunch of cells\ '' looks no more or less like a human than a baby or a 100 year old man does.\\n\\n -- -- -- -\\n\\n\\ntl ; dr I support ban on abortion . I am not a religious nutjob . Reason is I believe embryos are human.\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text for those without a subscription : **\\n\\nSINCE the attacks in Cologne several commentators have argued that Europe has a \u201cman problem\u201d . Writing in Politico Magazine , Valerie Hudson , a political scientist , argued that \u201cthe sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided ... that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts\u201d\u2014especially young ones . Is this the case ? \\n\\nMore young men than young women have indeed been coming to Europe . Of the 1.2m asylum applicants in the last 12 months of available data , 73 % were men , up from 66 % in 2012 . Those men skew increasingly young : according to Eurostat , the proportion of male asylum claimants who were 18- to 34-year-olds was 40 % in October 2015 ( the latest available data ) , up from 35 % in 2012 . Males between 14 and 17 years old accounted for 11 % of all asylum-seekers , up from 5 % in 2012.\\n\\nThe numbers , however , differ by nationality . Around 60 % of all male asylum-seekers from Algeria and Morocco were 18- to 34-year-olds . By contrast just 48 % of the Iraqis , 38 % of the Syrians and 31 % of the Afghans fell into this age group . Proportions of young males also differ by host country ( see chart ) . Sweden took three asylum-seekers for every 1,000 inhabitants in the 12 months to September 2015 . That is the highest ratio in Europe . Alongside this , it also has more young male asylum-seekers : in the past 12 months 17 % were 14- to 17-year-olds , compared with only 6 % in Germany.\\n\\n\\nThis will alter the sex ratio for some age groups in Sweden . As Ms Hudson points out , the teenage population will become more male : currently there are 106 male 14- to 17-year-olds for every 100 women . If all asylum applications are granted , this will change to 116 men to 100 women , while for those aged between 18 and 34 the male-to-female ratio will go from 105:100 to 107:100 . This is worrisome . Skewed sex ratios would mean lots of sexually frustrated young men , which is a recipe for trouble.\\n\\nBut the example of Sweden does not reflect what will happen across the whole of Europe . ( Ms Hudson also conflates asylum applications with asylum granted . Not all of the 20,000 16- to 17-year-olds she says entered Sweden in 2015 will receive full refugee status ; on current trends , around 17,000 will . ) The countries that will be most affected are small , with populations under 10m . Sweden , Hungary , Austria and Norway would see the biggest sex-ratio changes ( and only if they accepted all the asylum-seekers who applied ) . Germany has less to worry about . If it accepted all the young males who sought asylum in the year to October 2015 , its sex ratios would go from 106:100 to 107:100 for 14- to 17-year-olds and from 105:100 to 106:100 for 18- to 34-year-olds . Europe does not have a man problem . Sweden may have .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"[ Full article here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Yibdz6e.png ) \\n\\n**Plain text : **\\n\\nFEW people pondering how to vote in the referendum on Britain\u2019s European Union membership on June 23rd will care which group is designated to vie for their support when the official campaign begins on April 15th . Yet the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision on April 13th to pick Vote Leave from among rival pro-Brexit organisations matters more than many realise.\\n\\nOfficial designation brings with it the right to spend up to \u00a37m ( $ 10m ) , to send a free mailshot to all households , to make a number of campaign broadcasts and to receive \u00a3600,000 of taxpayer funds . Unofficial campaigners are far more restricted in what they are allowed to do . Brexiteers are already fuming because the government sent out its own leaflet this week advocating a vote to remain , at a cost to taxpayers of over \u00a39m . ( The government says it is merely following the examples of the Scottish referendum campaign in 2014 and the 1975 referendum on Europe . ) \\n\\n\\nWhat counts most , however , is the people putting across the message and how they do it . Vote Leave includes such heavyweight Tories as Lord ( Nigel ) Lawson , Michael Gove and Boris Johnson , as well as the UK Independence Party\u2019s only MP , Douglas Carswell . It was deemed by the Electoral Commission to have broader cross-party support than its main rival , Grassroots Out , which relied heavily on UKIP\u2019s leader , Nigel Farage and the financial backing of Arron Banks , a wealthy businessman.\\n\\nMore to the point , Vote Leave has been trying to make a liberal case for Brexit , with a focus on less regulation and freer trade . Grassroots Out and Mr Farage have instead put more emphasis on tougher immigration controls . Both groups recognise that concerns about immigration are the strongest source of support for Brexit . But Vote Leave is offering a more positive message and worries that relying on Mr Farage\u2019s to argue for Brexit might put off centrist and undecided voters . Because Vote Leave seems more sensible than its rival , its official designation may marginally boost the chances of a Brexit vote.\\n\\nThe two groups will presumably now come together anyway . Mr Farage has already congratulated Vote Leave and promised to work with it , as have two Tory MPs who helped to establish Grassroots Out . But Mr Banks and some of his advisers are talking of a judicial challenge to the Electoral Commission\u2019s decision . If they can get a challenge off the ground , which seems unlikely , they could even delay the date of the referendum by a few months.\\n\\nIn the fuss over which pro-Brexit group would be designated , less attention has been paid to the group selected to campaign to remain in the ( EU ) . Britain Stronger in Europe , led by Lord ( Stuart ) Rose , the former boss of Marks & amp ; Spencer , has no rivals , is well financed and has the backing not just of leading pro-Europeans but also of most British businesses . Yet even its fans concede that , by focusing largely on the risks to jobs and the economy from Brexit , it is offering voters a less exciting vision than the Brexiteers are . As our new interactive poll tracker , which will be up on the site Friday April 15th , shows the battle will be an extremely close-run thing.\\n\\n",Greek,Greek
Arathian,europe,"Okey , I say this hopefully without any offence caused but you are severely misinformed if you think \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's rather unlikely anybody will borrow you any more money for quite some time\\n\\nis the extend of what will happen if we bail.\\n\\nFirst of all , since it is a blatant disregard of international law , automatic sanctions will kick in . Know how Greece\\ 's economy is reliant on tourism ? Yeah , that kills that.\\n\\nSecondarily , the debt , even if we pretend doesn\\'t exist , every other country will continue aknowledging its existence . That means we can\\'t enter the market not for \ '' several years\ '' but theoretically forever until we are prepared to pay back and , with Greece\\ 's most important economic sector severely hit , this will take a long arse time.\\n\\nFinally , yes , they absolutely can seize stuff that belongs to the Greek state . A few obvious choices would be from the Greek merchant fleet of which Greece has a large one . Second , a lot of the money we currently \ '' have\ '' ( aka money we borrowed ) is not actually held in Greece , but outside of Greece . We will lose ANY security blanket . That means no oil imports , no energy imports ( of which we do for 80 % of our energy . Means all non-essential buildings could lose electricity for the majority of every day ) , no tharmaceutical imports unless done under humanitarian aid which ... yeah , we will need etc.\\n\\nHell , they could even pull [ this ] ( http : //www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/20/argentina-sailing-ship-ghana-release ) and , imagine , this was done by private individuals and not even a superstate.\\n\\nAnd honestly , this probably is just the surface of the shitshow that will follow immediately of the stupid decision to stop paying debt .

Arathian,europe,"Full text : \\n\\nZIPPING across the choppy Aegean in his powerboat , Nassos Karakitsos , a volunteer with a search-and-rescue NGO called Emergency Response Centre International , scans the horizon for refugees . He spots none . A few months ago the seas around the Greek island of Lesbos were filled with overstuffed rubber dinghies ( \u201cballoons with engines\u201d , Mr Karakitsos calls them ) carrying Afghans , Iraqis and Syrians from the Turkish coast . Today they are home only to the more forbidding vessels of the Greek coast guard , Frontex ( the European Union\u2019s border agency ) and NATO , lately arrived to help with maritime surveillance.\\n\\nThe quiet seas are the result of a deal struck between the EU and Turkey to reduce migrant flows , which came into effect on March 20th . It took everyone by surprise , says a European official on Lesbos , and there were teething troubles : the police tailed a Turkish liaison officer stationed on the island , suspecting he was a spy . But for now the migrants have stopped coming . Some of the scrappy volunteer groups that flocked to Lesbos last autumn , when 6,000 refugees might clamber ashore in one day , are closing shop . Larger organisations are moving staff to mainland Greece , where 46,000 refugees have been trapped by the closure of the Macedonian border.\\n\\nThe drama has shifted to Greek ministries , EU agencies and the quasi-prisons on Aegean islands created by the Turkey deal . On Lesbos , all arrivals are taken to Moria , a \u201chotspot\u201d ( processing centre ) turned detention camp . Most will face return once their asylum claims have been found inadmissible , on the ground that they reached Greece from Turkey , now considered a safe country for asylum-seekers . ( Deportations of migrants who did not claim asylum in Greece have already begun . ) Activists consider the deal a shameful abrogation of the EU\u2019s commitment to human rights . The pope , who has attacked Europe\u2019s \u201canaesthetised conscience\u201d on refugees , will visit Lesbos on April 16th.\\n\\nWell over 3,000 souls have been stuffed into Moria , a grim place of barbed wire and watchtowers . Through a fence Muhammad , a Syrian refugee , tells Charlemagne of overcrowded shelters and a complete lack of information before a policeman cuts the conversation short . Pakistanis\u2014who , curiously , have been arriving in greater numbers since the deal kicked in\u2014have begun a hunger strike . The NGOs that used to provide services inside Moria have partly withdrawn in protest , leaving it short of infrastructure , expertise and food . Last week Amnesty International , a human-rights watchdog , criticised the \u201cappalling conditions\u201d at Moria and another centre on the island of Chios.\\n\\nWorse may be to come . All migrants on the island have the right to claim asylum and to appeal if rejected , and 95 % have taken this up . The Greeks plan to conclude each case within just 15 days . But there are endless unanswered questions over the process , from the treatment of unaccompanied minors to the provision of legal aid . \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for us , and for Europe , \u201d says Maria Stavropoulou , the director of the Greek asylum service.\\n\\nVery little about Europe\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis has gone right . This deal is unlikely to be an exception . Refugees who have spent vast sums to flee life-threatening situations may not go willingly . The fate of non-Syrians returned to Turkey is unclear . Legal challenges are certain . The timeline for processing may well slip . In the meantime , if arrivals pick up again , Lesbos could reach its capacity of around 6,000 . Officials have already begun offloading migrants from Moria to other camps . Dozens of EU asylum officials have been dispatched to process the claims . Ms Stavropoulou\u2019s service has doubled in number . But she can not bring herself to say that she is confident the deal will work.\\n\\nMuch of the criticism the deal has attracted is therefore deserved . And yet , as Yannis Mouzalas , the Greek migration minister , notes , by the time it was signed it was the best that could be done . The EU had learned the hard way that it was unable to create a relocation scheme to share the refugee burden , and without one , fences were the only alternative . For those European politicians whose priority was to reduce the flow , the new arrangement looks like a success . New asylum registrations in Germany fell to 21,000 in March , down from over 200,000 in November . Fears that migrants stranded in Greece would find other ways through have not come to pass ; instead , they have camped out in wretched conditions near the border , and elsewhere , in the futile hope that it will reopen one day.\\n\\nAsylum or bust\\nThis has created a tinderbox in Greece\u2014last week Macedonian police tear-gassed migrants who tried to storm the border\u2014but breathing space for politicians . Not long ago pundits speculated that Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , might not see out her term . Now she enjoys rising approval ratings.\\n\\nThat could change if the deal collapses . But there is a bigger concern . There was , despite appearances , a noble idea behind the EU-Turkey deal : stop the irregular migrant flows to make way for regular ones . Europe will probably make good on its minimal commitment to accept one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one sent back from Greece . But the deal also includes a vague promise of far more substantial resettlements to Europe : optimists have spoken of 200,000 a year or more . On this there is little sign of movement , despite the efforts of German and Dutch politicians to corral their colleagues into making pledges.\\n\\nThroughout this crisis Europe has been accused of pulling up the drawbridge and shunting its problems onto its neighbours . So far the accusation has not been warranted . But it will be if the EU fails to make good on its resettlement promises . On the wall of Moria the graffiti is still visible behind the whitewash : \u201cEU shame on you.\u201d If Europe does not show that its refugee policy amounts to more than border closures , detention and forced deportation , it will become impossible not to agree .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"For this week\\ 's thread , I have another recipe . All you Americans or other people who have a grill/grill like machine will be excited : \\n\\n [ **Souvlaki ! ** ] ( https : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Souvlaki-plate.jpg ) \\n\\nPreparation : you need meat . The meat can really vary . Beef is the most common , but lamb , pork , chicken and even swordfish work really well . Cut it in rough , roundish pieces like the picture.\\n\\nMany people also love adding cut veggies , like peppers or even tomatoes . Personally , not a huge fun , but I know many people love it.\\n\\nYou need large , about 6-8 inches ( 15-20 cm ) wooden sticks . If you don\\'t have that , metal sticks also work . For wooden sticks , you probably want to let them soak in water for a few minutes before use . Helps keep them from burning up but it is by no means obligatory . \\n\\nSo , you skewer the meat leaving a bit on both ends for holding . Put your grill on high and wait for it to heat up . When it does , throw the skewered meat on it . Turn it around every couple of minutes.\\n\\nWhen the meat starts taking a colour , you add lots of lemon , a bit of olive oil , oregano , salt and pepper . You can also add garlic but it\\ 's kind of meh in my opinion . Right before you remove them ( after they have been skewered to about \ '' medium well\ '' status ALWAYS ) you can add paprika . That depends how much you like paprica . Some don\\'t put any at all , I love having a fair amount . Done ! Brilliant souvlaki sticks.\\n\\nSide dishes : traditionally ( and as the picture shows ) you have french fries with this . You can also have grilled bread with added olive oil and oregano as side dish as well as some feta cheese to go with the french fries . Alternatively , some pita bread is also great ! \\n\\nAnd of course , [ Greek salad ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lv4re/tuesday_cooking_20150922/cv9ma4n ) which I explained how to do last week.\\n\\n [ Enjoy ! : ) ] ( http : //kalofagas.ca/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/IMG_2232.jpg ) \\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"& gt ; How is food not part of culture ? \\n\\nHere is the definition of culture\\n\\n & gt ; the ideas , customs , and social behaviour of a particular people or society.\\n\\nWhile certain kinds of foods can be considered \ '' customs\ '' within a cultural context , the food itself is in no way \ '' culture\ '' . Eating Magiritsa during Eastern is considered part of the Greek culture however a random American eating magiritsa ( delicious by the way , try it one day ) does NOT mean he adopted some part of the Greek culture.\\n\\nClear enough ? \\n\\n & gt ; But if you mix two cultures you get a new one in the sense that both influence each other.\\n\\nSo let me re-state it . Show me ONE instance of an organic mix of cultures in Europe . ONE . I don\\'t think it is too much to ask for you to support your theory with a single piece of corroborative evidence.\\n\\n & gt ; And last but not least , using the internet is a bad idea if you want to keep your culture from foreign influence.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to keep my culture from foreign influence . I want my culture to not be replaced by millions of immigrants who create ghettos and out-reproduce the locals . The majority will NEVER adopt the culture of the minority , neither will a very sizable minority . This is exactly what is happening all over Europe and why we are freaking out . \\n\\nLet me explain this a bit further : \\n\\nPeople got somewhat pissed off from all the \ '' Americanization\ '' of everything , but you never saw massive \ '' anti-American\ '' parties rise solely to expel American influences . People bitched and moaned about it , sure , but that is where it stopped.\\n\\nThe reasoning behind that is because the change happened organically and with no higher power forcing it on the people . Nobody came and forced us to eat burgers or watch some chick flick ( not that this is America\\ 's culture , obviously , just generalizing ) . People ARE being forced to be \ '' acceptive\ '' and \ '' inclusive\ '' and \ '' cosmopolitan\ '' now though . The change is NOT organic . This is further worsened by the fact that a cultural balance and demographic balance that held true for thousands of years is being upset.\\n\\nLet me re-re-re-re-re-restate what everyone in this thread keeps repeating : \\n\\nnobody wants to have a monolithic , unchanging culture . People just don\\'t want to be culturally replaced and see their people destroyed . \\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"You presume here the system will be as is today . You also presume that I simply want to ban abortion and not change anything to help support such mothers.\\n\\nUnlike what the user above said , I am EXTREMELY STRONGLY against \ '' ignoring them at birth\ '' .\\n\\nI think , even before banning abortion , there need to be severe changes to the following things : \\n\\n-Social support programs for single mothers and mothers in general\\n\\n-Adoption programs and state care of children\\n\\n-Benefits for mothers\\n\\nBasically , fund each vastly more than they are funded today ( in fact , I think motherhood should be as funded as things like healthcare and the army ) .

Arathian,europe,"Hey again folks , \\n\\nOn the 5th of March at [ 7 PM GMT ] ( http : //time.is/GMT ) we start our **NEW EU4 campaign** after finishing the last one . The game , unlike last time , will last 4 hours per session because previously people said 5 hours was a bit much . It\\ 'll be ending at a more reasonable hour for most people which is a good thing.\\n\\nAnyways , you can drop off at any time before that . No hard feelings ! \\n\\nWe only ask to please take a major nation only if you\\ 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it\\ 'll be more fun for everyone if they don\\'t get imploded by the AI.\\n\\n*P.S.\\nNo reason you can\\'t become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . *\\n\\n**TO JOIN : **\\n\\n [ This is /r/Europe\\ 's steam group ] ( http : //steamcommunity.com/groups/EuropeReddit ) . It is open for anyone to join so you don\\'t even need an invitation.\\nThere are two ways to join the actual game.\\n\\n**First way : **\\nOnce you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group\\ 's chat . You can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat.\\n\\n**Second way : **\\nDakarans should be hosting , but you can send me ( The Hound ) , Arathian ( Arathian ) or Dakarans ( Dakarans ) a friend invite and then you can join the game through us by : \\n\\n* Entering EU4 and going into the Multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart EU4 ) \\n* Open your friends list where one of us is\\n* Click on that person\u2019s profile\\n* Click join game button as pictured here [ Friend profile ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/oIYscJI.png ) \\n\\n**FAQ : **\\n\\n*- Do we use some sort of communication tool ? *\\nYES ! For anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend EU4\\ 's whisper functionality ) , we use teamspeak . You don\\'t HAVE to join it , but we strongly recommend it . If you don\\'t know how to set it up , please ask.\\nThe teamspeak server details are : \\nAddress : 185.4.149.102:9152 \\n\\nRoom : EU4Game \\n\\nPassword : europe\\n\\n**-I didn\\'t play last session/last week , can I join now ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Absolutely ! The usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . But if he isn\\'t there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . If an absentee going to be late to a session and don\u2019t want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you\u2019ll be showing up . If you give notice , you can miss **one** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back.\\n\\n**Since this is a NEW game , we will be picking nations from scratch . ** \\nYou can reserve a nation here in this thread , or you can simply pick what\\ 's available when the game starts . You can drop in at the last minute if you wish.\\n**IMPORTANTLY** - Please choose one of the major nations only if you intend to show up every week.\\n\\n**-I can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . That\\ 's fine : ) \\n\\n**-I came 10 minutes late and you have already started/ I crashed /I got annexed and disconnected , what do ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** We will be playing with a ton of people . That means we unfortunately can\\'t be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . We will be having 3 or so restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it\\ 's not the end of the world.\\n\\n**-I am bad at this game**\\n\\nYou are absolutely welcome ! Most of us weren\\'t experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc.\\n\\n**-I have never played this game before**\\n\\nYou are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably won\\'t enjoy this . The game is super complicated and you won\\'t understand most things and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . I would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in SP first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . It is really fun ! \\n\\n**-My internet is trash , can I join anyway ? **\\n\\n**Answer : ** Sure but ... your internet probably can\\'t handle it if it\\ 's really bad . If you slow down the game too much , it\u2019s not practical to participate . We NEED to keep a consistent speed 2 and if you can\\'t handle that ... .sorry . If you are not sure , feel free to join and see how it goes : ) \\n\\n***************************\\n\\n**-RULES ? **\\n\\nAnswer : Last game we had only a surrender rule and no other rules which produced some weird situations , so we\\ 've agreed to set up some basic ground rules : \\n\\n* **We are limiting the number of player allies to 2 . **\\nBasically , what this means is that you can have at most 2 allies which are played by humans , but as many AI allies as you can get.\\nThe reason for this is preventing unrealistically huge alliances which stifle the whole game because everyone\\ 's too afraid to do anything . We want to get a lot of smaller alliance blocks for greater diplomacy and tension ! \\n\\n**CLARIFICATION ON THE ABOVE RULE : **\\n\\nThe above rule means that you have to stick with your allies . You can\\'t simply quickly break an alliance to ally someone else just to intervene in a war . If you want to defend/attack someone with some other player , you either have to ally them beforehand , you can guarantee them ( which does not count towards alliance limits ) , you can \ '' demand peace\ '' or you can simply declare a seperate war . Seperate war is important because if the attacked nation surrenders to one of the aggressors , they have to accept so they can turn on you , making ganking up more risky . Breaking alliances in peacetime is , of course , fully allowed . It is also fully allowed to not defend an ally that is attacked . \\n\\n* **If you\u2019re in the top 6 score at the start of the session you\u2019re limited to only 1 other top 6 score player as an ally . **\\nThese nations will be noted in a separate post in the thread before the start of each session . For the first session they\u2019ll stand as ( in no particular order ) : \\nFrance , \\nCastille , \\nAustria , \\nOttomans , \\nEngland , \\nLithuania ( or Poland-Lithuania if PU happens ) \\n\\n* **After the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or PU ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . ** You can pick one at the 1st round\\ 's start though.\\n\\n\\n* **You are allowed to play a player\\ 's colonial nation ( i.e . Thirteen Colonies in Eastern America ) once those are created . ** However , you are limited to two nations supporting your independence , and if you lose your independence war , you lose control of the colonial nation and it has to stay AI . Glory is there for those who seize the opportunity , but choose wisely ! \\n\\n\\n* **Try to be a sporting player . ** This is more of a suggestion since this can hardly be enforced . You are of course allowed ( and encouraged ) to declare war on whoever you think , and take what suits you and what you can conquer ! \\nDo try and play fair ( ish ) at least , don\u2019t deliberately gank people with like 5 separate alliances on your side , try not to gank someone completely at the very beginning of the game ( unless it\u2019s like you\u2019re Castille and he\u2019s Navarra because that\u2019s natural ) , etc.\\nFeel free to plot and scheme with/against players though , it\u2019s one of the most fun parts of the game ! \\n\\n* **No nation ruining . ** If someone surrenders ( by saying \u2018I surrender\u2019 in general chat ) , you HAVE to offer them a peace deal at maximum 100 warscore . Taking more than 100 warscore per war is not allowed.\\n\\nHave fun ! \\n\\n**P.S.\\nFeel free to ask any question regarding this MP game or EU4 in general in this thread or anywhere else . Don\u2019t be afraid to ask ! **\\n\\n**PSS : ** [ here ] ( http : //rghost.net/7mtCchFzp ) is an upload of the save file if someone wants to snoop around .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**FULL TEXT FOR THOSE WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE ECONOMIST**\\n\\n\\nGREECE\u2019S migrant crisis is getting worse . Macedonia has closed its border to all but a trickle of migrants , following the example of Austria and other countries along the so-called West Balkans route to Germany . Yet desperate Syrians and Iraqis continue to arrive at the Idomeni crossing point . On February 29th Macedonian police used tear gas against scores of migrants trying to break down the border fence . As The Economist went to press , more than 12,000 people were crammed into a tent camp with facilities for only 1,500 . Food is in short supply . \u201cIt\u2019s a tense situation , \u201d says Panagiota Siafaka , a social worker with the UN High Commission for Refugees.\\n\\nSo long as the border remained open , Greece could manage the flow of arrivals from Turkey . Now almost 30,000 migrants are bottled up in Greece . Nikos Kotzias , the foreign minister , expects the number to reach 150,000 ; local aid agencies worry that 200,000 people may arrive in March alone . Reception centres around Athens for migrants are hopelessly overcrowded . Half a dozen new ones , mostly refurbished former military camps , are quickly filling up . Local and international charities provide food and medical care . \u201cThe state seems absent , but luckily ordinary people are here every day to help , \u201d says Mariana , a paediatrician working at Piraeus port , gesturing towards a group of elderly Greek women handing out bananas and chocolate bars to harassed mothers in headscarves.\\n\\nThings will improve , if only gradually . Greece expects to receive a large chunk of the EU\u2019s new \u20ac700m ( $ 760m ) , three-year humanitarian aid package for countries that host a lot of migrants . Of that , \u20ac300m would be spent this year . Athens-based aid agencies hope that funds will bypass the slow-moving Greek bureaucracy , going straight to needy migrants in the form of vouchers for food and housing.\\n\\n\\nBut stemming the flow of migrants from Turkey is proving hard . A NATO naval mission was due to begin monitoring the strait between Greece and Turkey on February 29th , electronically locating smugglers\u2019 boats so Turkish coastguards could nudge them back to shore . But on March 2nd the NATO vessels were still in port . The Greek defence ministry said Turkey had raised \u201ctechnical problems\u201d.\\n\\nEU leaders hope for a breakthrough at a summit on March 7th with Ahmet Davutoglu , Turkey\u2019s prime minister . The Turkish government has yet to crack down on the people-smugglers . Diplomats in Athens believe the Turks will make a deal conditional on EU countries resettling Syrians from refugee camps in southern Turkey . Meanwhile , Turkey has agreed to take back economic migrants who crossed to the Greek islands from Turkey . After weeks of bureaucratic exchanges between the Greek and Turkish police , a first group of 270 Moroccans , Tunisians and Algerians were handed into Turkish custody on March 2nd at the land border in Thrace . A group of 150 Pakistanis will be next . It is a modest start , yet even a small reduction in numbers helps relieve Greece\u2019s migrant burden .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"***Full text***\\n\\n\\nHOW big is the world\u2019s appetite for things Danish ? Foreign audiences have already binge-watched the country\u2019s noir TV series ( such as \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cThe Bridge\u201d ) and raved over the new Nordic cuisine of Noma , Copenhagen\u2019s trend-setting restaurant . This autumn , publishers are testing the limits of the world\u2019s Danomania . Before the Christmas season , at least nine English-language books will come out devoted to explaining the elusive quality of hygge.\\n\\nHygge is difficult to pronounce . ( Try \u201chew-geh\u201d . ) It is also tricky to describe . Writers have tried \u201cthe art of creating intimacy\u201d , \u201ccosiness of the soul\u201d and \u201ccocoa by candlelight\u201d . It is an attitude rather than a recipe , evoking relaxation with close friends or family . Many see it as a quintessential element of Denmark\u2019s national character . There is some evidence for this : the Danes are Europe\u2019s biggest consumers of candles , burning through about 6 kilogrammes ( 13 pounds ) per person every year . Runner-up Austria manages just half that . Denmark often leads ( highly subjective ) rankings of the happiest countries , and hygge is being marketed as a way for foreigners to imitate the Danes\u2019 balanced , relaxed , egalitarian lifestyle.\\n\\nBut not all Danes agree . Jeppe Trolle Linnet , an anthropologist at the University of Southern Denmark , argues that hygge is not the great social leveller it appears . Danes dislike acknowledging class differences , but his research finds that the habits of hygge vary by income and social status . For some , hygge is a bottle of burgundy with soft jazz on the hi-fi ; for others it is a can of beer while watching football on telly . Worse , different groups are uncomfortable with others\u2019 interpretations of hygge . Mr Linnet calls it a \u201cvehicle of social control\u201d , involving \u201ca negative stereotyping of social groups who are perceived as unable to create hygge\u201d.\\n\\nIn this , hygge resembles the German quality of gem\u00fctlichkeit , which also implies a sense of cosiness , peace of mind and\u2014crucially\u2014social acceptance . And although the desire for communality does encourage social solidarity , it can also mean excluding strangers . Getting to hygge with a local is not always easy : in Denmark even crowded buses can be eerily silent . Danes have a reputation for aloofness.\\n\\nA recent report on the quality of life for expatriates in 67 countries , compiled by an organisation called InterNations , bears this out . Denmark\u2019s own natives may rank it top for happiness , but the immigrants in the survey ranked it 60th in terms of friendliness , 64th for being made to feel welcome , and 67th for the ease of finding friends . Finishing just ahead of Denmark on the finding-friends measure was Norway , the country from which the Danes imported the word hygge . If cultures are obsessed with the joys of relaxing with old friends , perhaps it is because they find it stressful to make new ones .",Greek,Greek

The convention also imposes other obligations on states , such as to secure equal treatment for refugees and issue special travel documents to refugees , which can be used instead of their national passport.\\n\\nThe effect of the convention is that states are required to determine asylum claims made by anyone within their territory . The principal exception to this is where there is a safe third country to which the person can be sent in order for substantive consideration to be given to their claim . Removing a person to a safe third country will not engage the removing state\\ 's obligations under the convention unless doing so exposes the person to a real risk of refoulement.\\n\\n**There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country . There has , however , been a longstanding \ '' first country of asylum\ '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . This principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined . ** \ '' \\n\\nSo books have been written , you just haven\\'t read them.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full post for those without an economist subscription** : \\n\\nWHAT a difference a month makes . On the night of September 4th Angela Merkel made the most dramatic decision of her decade as German chancellor : to suspend European asylum rules and allow tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary to enter Germany via Austria . It was a moral gesture that fitted the mood of the moment . As The Economist went to press , Mrs Merkel was considered a favourite to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\\n\\nIn Germany , however , that altruistic embrace has caused a backlash that could weaken a chancellor so far considered all but invincible . Using uncharacteristically missionary language , Mrs Merkel said repeatedly that the right to asylum has \u201cno upper limit\u201d . But Joachim Gauck , who as president is expected to keep out of workaday politics , responded that \u201cour reception capacity is limited even when it has not yet been worked out where these limits lie.\u201d As though on cue , the political tone turned against Mrs Merkel . \\n\\nThe numbers are dramatic . More than 200,000 migrants are believed to have arrived in Germany in September alone . For the year , official forecasts had already risen in August from 450,000 to 800,000 . This week Bild , Germany\u2019s largest tabloid , cited estimates that the number could reach 1.5m\u2014equivalent to the population of Munich . New refugees keep pouring in , and those granted asylum have the right to bring family later . No end is in sight.\\n\\nProcessing centres exceeded capacity weeks ago . Local authorities are struggling to find housing , since temporary tent cities will not suffice in winter . The government of Hamburg has begun seizing empty office buildings to house refugees , raising constitutional questions . Berlin and Bremen are considering similar measures . Schools are struggling to integrate refugee children who speak no German.\\n\\nFights have broken out inside overcrowded asylum centres , often between young men of different ethnic or religious groups . There have been more arson attacks on migrant centres . In Dresden , a xenophobic movement called Pegida is growing again : about 9,000 protested this Monday against refugees.\\n\\nMainstream society is tolerant but edgy . In a survey by German public television 51 % of Germans say that they fear the refugee influx , 13 points more than in September . Approval of Mrs Merkel dropped by 9 points to her lowest level since 2011 ( though it is still a respectable 54 % ) . In two other polls Mrs Merkel slid from Germany\u2019s most popular politician to fourth.\\n\\nThe fiercest criticism of Mrs Merkel comes from within her own conservative bloc\u2014the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , which she leads , and the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , which exists only in Bavaria and usually supports her . Horst Seehofer , the CSU\u2019s boss and premier of Bavaria , called Mrs Merkel\u2019s decision \u201ca mistake that will keep us occupied for a long time\u201d . In one meeting he threatened half-seriously to drop off busloads of refugees at the federal parliament in Berlin.\\n\\nGerda Hasselfeldt , a CSU parliamentary leader , wants to erect transit zones along Germany\u2019s borders like those in airports . Markus S\u00f6der , Bavaria\u2019s finance minister , has called for a fence . A group of Christian Democrats calling itself the \u201csecurity club\u201d debated closing Germany\u2019s borders to refugees entirely . Another group has written a letter to Mrs Merkel charging that her refugee policy breaks the law.\\n\\nIn response Mrs Merkel\u2019s government is scrambling to make changes . It has passed legislation that cuts pocket money to refugees , currently \u20ac143 ( $ 160 ) a month , and replaces it with vouchers . More police and administrators are being hired . All Balkan countries have been declared \u201csafe\u201d so that their asylum applicants can be rejected and deported faster . On October 6th Mrs Merkel took charge of co-ordinating refugee policy , in effect demoting the interior minister , Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re.\\n\\nNone of this , however , will reduce the numbers of Syrians , Iraqis and Afghans who are fleeing war . Nor will last month\u2019s agreement by the European Union to allocate 120,000 refugees among member states . Mrs Merkel had lobbied fiercely for it , but the compromise will barely dent Germany\u2019s refugee numbers.\\n\\nShe is now concentrating her effort on getting Turkey , whence most refugees cross into the EU , to intercept and keep more migrants . But Turkey already hosts more than 2m . It will demand concessions such as easing visa restrictions for Turks entering the EU . It will also expect Germany to tone down criticism of Turkish crackdowns on the press and on Kurdish separatists . It may ask for German help to create a buffer zone in Syria.\\n\\nMeanwhile , Germans have begun to feel that the refugee crisis could change Germany even more than reunification did 25 years ago . Back then the task was to let that which belongs together grow together , as Willy Brandt , a former chancellor , famously said . Speaking on October 3rd , the anniversary of unification , Mr Gauck\u2014like Mrs Merkel a former East German\u2014said that today\u2019s challenge is greater because \u201cwhat should now grow together has so far not belonged together.\u201d Germans worry whether Muslim refugees will accept German norms of sexual equality , secularism and Germany\u2019s special responsibility towards Israel and Jews.\\n\\nThe backlash does not yet threaten Mrs Merkel\u2019s hold on power . While extremist parties have become serious contenders for power in some other European countries , they remain marginal in Germany , and voters have faith that their government will restore order , says Timo Lochocki of the German Marshall Fund , a think-tank . The chancellor faces no Christian Democratic challenger . The centre-left Social Democrats are internally torn . And the leftist opposition can not attack her for a refugee policy they themselves support.\\n\\nMrs Merkel is under pressure as never before . Yet the crisis has brought out a new style of leadership in her . For years she has been accused of following public opinion rather than guiding it . Now she has found her moral calling . \u201cIf we start having to apologise for showing a friendly face in emergencies , \u201d she says defiantly , \u201cthen this is not my country.\u201d",Greek,Greek

I have many times before advocated for opening large refugee camps in the countries affected to process people in need from there to bring to Europe . That would screen people before arriving in our continent and also prioritize people needing asylum first over whomever has enough money/ has the physical ability ( meaning usually he is a 20something male ) to come.\\n\\nNot accepting the flood completely does not contradict our stance on human rights.\\n\\n & gt ; we are criticized by middle eastern countries for not reacting\\n\\nMost middle east countries have accepted exactly 0 refugees . if they criticize us , we are free to laugh in their faces.\\n\\n & gt ; it creates a bigger crisis at EU\\ 's door , probably needing more military intervention from EU countries\\n\\nThe majority of the youth leaving Syria is also a crisis for the country . Also , see my first point . Processing them is possible without fucking up our border situation.\\n\\n & gt ; more money spent by NOT welcoming refugees than by building welcome centers within and out of the EU . \\n\\nSee my first point on this . Also , how do we lose money by not accepting them ? \\n\\n & gt ; plus future citizens bringing consumption and potential growth to welcoming country\\n\\nImmigrants from outside the EU are proven to be a net loss in almost all cases . We won\\'t make money accepting Syrians , especially considering most of them are statistically uneducated , unspecialized and many have some very weird ideas about culture and religion.\\n\\n & gt ; most individual EU countries\\ ' constitutions grant full rights of asylum to anyone in need ( for example Article # 4 of the French Republic\\ 's constitution preamble , or art . 16 of Germany\\ 's constitution etc ) \\n\\nCorrect . Asylum and refugees however have very specific meanings.\\n\\n [ Here is an article by the guardian detailing it ] ( http : //www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/sep/21/claim-asylum-uk-legal-position ) \\n\\nTo quote the relevant parts : \\n\\n & gt ; There is no obligation under the refugee convention or any other instrument of international law that requires refugees to seek asylum in any particular country . There has , however , been a longstanding \ '' first country of asylum\ '' principle in international law by which countries are expected to take refugees fleeing from persecution in a neighbouring state . This principle has developed so that , in practice , an asylum seeker who had the opportunity to claim asylum in another country is liable to be returned there in order for his or her claim to be determined.\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"[ full article here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/A57tEX1.png ) \\n\\nFull text : \\n\\n\\nBEFORE reading a \u201cpoem\u201d on German television on March 31st , Jan B\u00f6hmermann , a satirist of questionable tact , explained that he wanted to clarify the boundaries of free-speech law . He then declaimed a series of obviously fictional passages ( in rhyming verse ) depicting Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the president of Turkey , engrossed in a series of athletically challenging sexual activities with barnyard animals . By the time the broadcaster took the video off its website a day later , it had caused a diplomatic fracas between Turkey and Germany.\\n\\nThe tension had been a long time brewing . In 2007 the chancellor , Angela Merkel , snubbed Mr Erdogan by opposing Turkish membership of the European Union . As Mr Erdogan\u2019s rule became increasingly autocratic , Mrs Merkel often chided him for nobbling dissidents and the press . But in 2015 refugees started streaming into the EU via Turkey . Suddenly Mrs Merkel needed Mr Erdogan\u2019s help.\\n\\nThe result is the deal that the EU , at Mrs Merkel\u2019s prodding , made with Turkey last month . In return for taking back migrants from Greece and cracking down on people-smugglers , Turkey gets billions in aid and new talks about joining the EU . Its citizens will also be allowed to travel visa-free in Europe . Mrs Merkel is now reluctant to criticise Mr Erdogan.\\n\\nBasking in its new importance , Turkey has summoned the German ambassador for a dressing-down three times in recent weeks . One complaint was over a mildly satirical song about Mr Erdogan aired on German television on March 17th . At that point Mrs Merkel declared press freedom sacrosanct\u2014prompting Mr B\u00f6hmermann to up the ante.\\n\\nOn April 10th Ankara dispatched a formal diplomatic note , invoking an antiquated German law against insulting foreign heads of state . In theory Mr B\u00f6hmermann could go to prison for three years , if the German government decides to prosecute . Amid howls of outrage in Germany , Mrs Merkel has yet to rule this out . Mr Erdogan has also filed a personal complaint on the same charges.\\n\\nMrs Merkel will need all her diplomatic skill to contain this spat . The stakes are greater than Mr Erdogan\u2019s fragile ego : freedom of speech , the refugee crisis and Syrian policy are all in the mix . Meanwhile , another blow-up is on the horizon . This spring the German Bundestag is set to vote on whether the mass killings of Armenians by Turks a century ago constituted genocide . Expect Turkish tempers to fray .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"# ARTICLE\\n\\n**The plan is fraught with problems , and will be difficult to enforce**\\n\\nALTHOUGH he was not there , it was hard to escape Donald Trump at the European Union\u2019s latest summit . Held in Malta on February 3rd , the day-long event focused on new plans for handling migration , particularly for stemming the flow of people making their way towards Europe from sub-Saharan Africa through Libya and across the Mediterranean . It also touched upon broader ( and slightly wonky ) questions of what the EU means 60 years on from the Rome treaty . But it was Mr Trump who dominated proceedings . Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , the French president , called his American counterpart\u2019s comments earlier this month denigrating the EU \u201cunacceptable\u201d . Describing the new migration plans , Federica Mogherini , the union\u2019s foreign policy chief , said \u201cwe do not believe in bans and walls\u201d , a slap at Mr Trump\u2019s executive order on refugees and his plans for a wall on America\u2019s Mexican border . Yet the EU\u2019s new plans could be just as chaotic and ineffective as Mr Trump\u2019s.\\n\\nAfter the EU struck a deal with Turkey in March 2016 to crack down on people-smuggling in the Aegean sea , the flow of migrants from Turkey to Greece dropped dramatically , from 57,000 in February 2016 to about 3,400 in August . But the numbers making their way from Libya have not decreased . Some 180,000 arrived in Italy last year , with more than 4,000 dead or missing on the crossing . Many of them are economic migrants , not refugees . The largest proportion came from Nigeria , which has very low asylum acceptance rates . Most experienced extreme hardship on the route : reports of beatings , rapes and torture in Libya are common.\\n\\nThe EU is now attempting to implement a version of the EU-Turkey deal in Libya in order to stem the tide . A day before the summit Paolo Gentiloni , the Italian prime minister , signed a deal with Fayez al-Sarraj , the prime minister of the Government of National Accord ( GNA ) , the UN-backed Libyan government . Italy will provide money to try to persuade the GNA to stop smugglers sending thousands of people out on flimsy boats . The EU backed the deal at the summit , providing an additional \u20ac200m ( $ 216m ) to an EU fund for Africa ( already worth \u20ac1.8bn ) , and confirming plans to train up the Libyan coast guard . Transit countries , such as Niger and Mali , have also been targeted with promises of cash and international help ( particularly from Germany ) .\\n\\nThe point , said Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , was not to keep out genuine refugees : \u201cThis is not about who has the right to claim asylum.\u201d Rather , she said , it was about destroying the smugglers\u2019 business model . Along with preventing people from attempting the Mediterranean journey , Europe will need to try to make their home countries safer , or to establish safe havens in nearby countries . European leaders seem to hope that migrants can be persuaded to stay put . Mrs Merkel said that on a trip to Niger last year she spoke with former migrants who had travelled to Libya , faced horrendous conditions there , and been persuaded by the International Organisation for Migration ( IOM ) to return to their home countries.\\n\\nYet Mrs Merkel acknowledged that at the moment the GNA does not have the \u201cnecessary stability\u201d to implement such policies . This is an understatement . Libya today is close to lawless : the GNA has limited control outside of Tripoli , the capital , while the coast is ruled by competing militias . The EU is mulling getting neighbouring countries , such as Tunisia or Egypt , involved , but the plans are vague . Training up Libyan coastguards , a good idea in theory , may prove ineffective ; they may belong to militias . Last year one group of Libyan coastguards boarded an NGO-run search-and-rescue boat . Other NGOs have accused coastguards of beating migrants with sticks.\\n\\nThe plan might not just fail to prevent emigration ; it could also make life more miserable for thousands of migrants . The Italy-Libya deal calls for establishing \u201creception centres\u201d , but does not explain what they would be , says Federico Soda of the IOM . Detention centres , run by different militias and other groups , already exist all over Libya . Most provide miserable accommodation to those who are stuck in them , almost always against their will . For the plan to work these centres would have to offer more humane conditions . The EU will also need to make a concerted effort at state-building in Libya , Niger and other countries along the route , with enough money and regular monitoring , says Elizabeth Collett of the Migration Policy Institute , a think-tank\u2014something for which Western countries no longer have much appetite.\\n\\nIf the situation now seems dire , that is partly because it has been left to fester for too long . The Italian government has been complaining to the EU about the failure to tackle African migration for decades . Indeed , the EU\u2019s plan to bottle up migrants in Libya is reminiscent of the deal Silvio Berlusconi cut with Muammar Qaddafi , the former Libyan dictator , to do the same . But it was not until the catastrophic overflow of migration from Turkey to Greece in 2015 that policies for the central Mediterranean route began to be implemented . Mrs Merkel acknowledged this at the summit ; at a lunch , she said , EU leaders had discussed why \u201csometimes we are far too slow\u201d.\\n\\nSuch deliberation over migration policy is preferable to the angry rashness Mr Trump has shown in his first weeks in office . But in the face of a humanitarian disaster such as the Mediterranean refugee crisis , hesitation can be as dangerous as haste .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full text for those without a subscription to the economist : **\\n\\nWHEN the European Union picked Malta as the site for this week\u2019s EU-Africa migration summit , it seemed a logical choice . The island nation is perched in the Mediterranean halfway between Libya and Italy . For a time , it was one of the top destinations for migrants from Africa trying to reach Europe . And Valletta , Malta\u2019s fortified Baroque capital , is a very telegenic spot for a summit . ( In \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d , a television series , it serves as the backdrop for the port city of Pentos , whose own asylum seekers include the Targaryans , an exiled royal family . ) But Malta is also apt in a way EU leaders may not have intended : as a standpoint from which to observe Europe\u2019s increasingly confused attitude towards refugees and other immigrants.\\n\\nAfrican migrants encounter as much undisguised hostility here as anywhere in Europe . Neil Falzon , who runs Aditus , a local human rights organisation , says many have been spat upon in the street . As in much of eastern Europe , unfamiliarity breeds contempt . Until the turn of the century , the island had one of the most ethnically homogenous societies in Europe , though its unique identity is actually the product of centuries of racial mingling . ( The result is a native population who look a bit like Italians , speak a bit like Arabs and drive on the left like the British . ) \\n\\nIn the early 2000s , when thousands of African asylum seekers began landing here annually , it came as a shock . \u201cA lot of elderly people had never seen a coloured person , \u201d says the leader of the opposition Nationalist Party , who condemns racism ( while unwittingly using a politically incorrect term ) . Maltese xenophobes can fall back on a rational argument : Malta is both the EU\u2019s smallest state and its most densely populated one . Maltese feel they should have to take fewer migrants than larger states . \\n\\nYet strangely , without anyone much noticing , they seem to have got what they want . Malta is barely 200 miles from Libya , still a major transit country for refugees though no longer as important as Turkey . But the flow to Malta has virtually shut down\u2014and no one knows why . Over 140,000 migrants arrived in Italy by sea in the year to November 10th ; in Malta , since the end of January , the number is just 20 . Meanwhile , the economy has been thriving . Malta has succeeded in becoming something Viktor Orban , the eurosceptic Hungarian prime minister , might dream of : an EU state with enviable growth figures and almost no migrants.\\n\\nThe signs of prosperity are everywhere . Winter sun-seekers throng Republic Street , Valletta\u2019s main thoroughfare . Everywhere one looks , sandstone palazzos are being converted into plush offices for foreign firms . Tower cranes dot the horizon . The Maltese economy grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of more than 5 % . Unemployment is the third-lowest in the EU . The budget deficit this year is expected to be 1.6 % of GDP.\\n\\nMalta has undoubtedly benefited from an \u201cArab winter\u201d effect , as tourists who might otherwise be in Egypt or Tunisia opt for a safer alternative . But the government prefers to stress its own contributions . In 2013 Joseph Muscat , the leader of the Labour party , swept to office with an implausible pledge to cut the island\u2019s sky-high energy tariffs by 25 % . Helped by the fall in oil prices , he managed it ( though at the cost of getting the state-owned power company to set artificially low prices and rack up debt ) . \u201cI think that we can do what Singapore has done , \u201d says the 41-year-old Mr Muscat , who has the same missionary zeal as Matteo Renzi , prime minister of neighbouring Italy.\\n\\nOne would think such talk would have migrants hastening to his island . Yet there are virtually no new arrivals , no rickety fishing vessels full of human cargo . Not a single large boat has landed on Malta this year . Even migrants rescued by Maltese vessels in Malta\u2019s search-and-rescue area are being taken to Italy instead.\\n\\nConspiracy theorists speculate that the Italians are helping in return for a chunk of Malta\u2019s lucrative air space , or have secretly been granted prospecting rights for oil and gas . The prime minister denies any secret deal with his friend Mr Renzi , and protests that Malta has taken its share of refugees under burden-sharing arrangements with Italy and Greece . But Mr Falzon estimates there are today only about 2,000 migrants on Malta who arrived irregularly , less than 0.5 % of the population.\\n\\nFortress Malta , Fortress Europa ? \\nAt the EU-Africa migration summit , European leaders pleaded with African countries to help them to bring their migrant problem under control . Countries that arrest people-smugglers , and accept the return of migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected , will be given aid\u2014\u20ac1.8 billion ( $ 2 billion ) of it , says the European Commission\u2014as well as more access to European markets and more visas for their citizens . As the summit was meeting , Sweden , one of Europe\u2019s friendliest countries to refugees , announced it would set limits on asylum applications . Could Europe as a whole aim for the same migrant-free prosperity as Malta ? \\n\\nPerhaps , were it not that Malta\u2019s economic renaissance depends heavily on migration . According to the Malta Employers\u2019 Association , expatriates ( European or otherwise ) now make up 12 % of the labour force . Foreign workers have flocked to the island nation to work in growth industries such as financial services , generic pharmaceuticals and online gaming . Locals say some asylum-seekers who have been accepted in other Mediterranean countries , like Spain , are coming to Malta in search of jobs . The country even offers passports to anyone who invests \u20ac1m.\\n\\nMalta is not keeping immigrants out ; it welcomes them , but preferably if they are European , skilled or wealthy . This may be a viable strategy for small Mediterranean islands , but not for an entire continent of greying workers . Leaders who draw lessons from Malta\u2019s success should keep in mind that if Europe wants to bring in immigrants to grow its economy , they will by definition have to come from outside Europe . From Africa , perhaps .",Greek,Greek

Multinational corporations are , by definition , not bound to any one country . You can\\'t blame something as massive as \ '' Europe\ '' either . I mean , my country was a Muslim colony up until 1829 . Some cases can be more clear , like US corporations doing crap like blood diamonds in Africa or the ( British ) BP oil fucking up the golf of Mexico but even then it is the fault of the corporations , not the countries these happen to reside in.\\n\\n & gt ; I simply mean to say that they play a part and benefit from that system.\\n\\nThat is an unsubstantiated statement . How do we currently profit ? Did the Brits profit 200 years ago from the colony in India ? Yeah , they did , at least some of them . Did the French ? Also yes . But currently we don\\'t have colonies and we do not profit from our none-existent colonies . The \ '' past wealth accumulation\ '' is honestly a horrible argument . Are we also gon na go around demanding Turkey hand over their lands \ '' back\ '' to us ? Should we go to kaliningrad and kick out the Russians to put the Germans back there ? \\n\\nInjustices that happened on another era with another mindset might server as examples for today but the American attitude that people , who had nothing to do with it , profit or should feel bad about it today is absurd .

We can\\'t and shouldn\\'t try to right all wrongs , that is stupid.\\n\\n & gt ; It is pretty hard to say Europe has their hands clean when these countries were ruled by Europe and had their borders drawn by Europe .

That\\ 's kinda what we are discussion here , such laws . I disagree with them and think no state should have such laws.\\n\\nIf I say \ '' a state has no right to ban religious conversion\ '' and you state , correctly , that SA prohibits converting from Islam under the penalty of death , that doesn\\'t invalidate my point in any way.\\n\\n & gt ; The controversy with Orthodox Jews has pretty much nothing to do with their garb and everything to do with their beliefs and practices ( morality policing , refusing to work , etc ) . Ditto with Islam/Muslims . Nobody kicks a fuss about kippas and Sikh turbans.\\n\\nSo let me state that : I have a problem with kippas , sikh turbans and that thing that looks like a nijab Christians used to wear 100 years ago . I don\\'t think they should be banned , naturally , but I highly discourage people from wearing such garbs on a personal level and want to encourage such an attitude on a societal level.\\n\\nIs that satisfyingly inclusive in your opinion ? \\n\\n & gt ; Ultimately it\\ 's a philosophical difference , but I don\\'t see anti-discrimination laws as anymore a loss of freedom than , say , seatbelt or speeding laws.\\n\\nBoth speeding laws and seatbelts have a thing in common : they affect other people than you . If you speed , you will create accidents . If you don\\'t wear your seatbelts and get in an accident , you will be propelled from your sit and crash into the guy in front of you , killing them.\\n\\nThat\\ 's not the same as \ '' anti-discrimination laws\ '' that affect private businesses . \\n\\n -- -\\n\\nAs a side-note . I do think discrimination is bad . Some more than others , but all inherently bad . I want to reduce certain behaviours ( like overt religious expression ) but I believe that should be done through education , not societal exclusion.\\n\\nBut anti-discrimination laws are bad and only drive people to resentment against the protected group . \\n\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek
Arathian,europe,"& gt ; Freedom of religion is a central right in , like , every single western constitution.\\n\\nAgreed . \\n\\nBut private individuals can not violate your freedom of religion unless they actively harm you because of your religion .

West has ( thankfully ) abolished almost all of these but , for another example , would be orthodox Jews and their garb . Orthodox jews , of course , are far less of an issue as they tend to be a model minority otherwise . But the controversy is a very real one , especially in Israel.\\n\\n & gt ; There was a time when private businesses were allowed to openly discriminate ; it was so terrible for minorities that it led to us deciding as a society that such \ '' freedom\ '' isn\\'t worth the social cost ( and cost to some segments of society\\ 's ability to function and live as equal citizens ) .\\n\\nI disagree .

In fact , let me repeat it : \\n\\n**Wearing a Hijab is a brazen , absolute and utter rejection of Western culture , traditions and shows a complete unwillingness to integrate**\\n\\nJust because \ '' your friend\ '' wears one doesn\\'t make it okey . A hijab is a symbol of oppression of women and is being consistently used to oppress women , including in the West . The hijab is not a religious garb but a cultural Arabian garb that has been impossed as part of the islamist rise in the 60s . The hijab is a declaration that you do not wish to integrate in society by pointing yourself out and directly stating that your primary trait is your religion in a country where secularism is the law.\\n\\nYour friend and you should be ashamed for promoting such garb .

Arathian,europe,"So I will go back to what you told me above : \\n\\n & gt ; No one is expecting the west to take in every possible refugee.\\n\\nIf *we aren\\'t expected to take them all* but nobody else takes any ( as is very much the case ) , who will ? \\n\\nEither some will be left out or China will have the biggest change of heart from any country in history.\\n\\n & gt ; Being refugees , they\\ 're already in the category - most at need.\\n\\nJust to be clear : you believe an able bodied 20 year old Muslim from Syria is in the exact same danger and need as a pregnant , 20 year old Christian woman from Syria ? \\n\\nOr do you believe that the degrees of danger shouldn\\'t matter ? \\n\\n & gt ; The refugee convention says you should accept all that come , not that you should be obliged to pay for them to come to you.\\n\\nI don\\'t think setting a refugee camp in Syria ( or paying some country to host it ) to process refugees is \ '' paying them to come to us\ '' . It will be a space to actually hold people in immediate need while also processing people according to ( what I believe are ) differing degrees of need to come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; The reason we see so many people coming by more dangerous paths ( and hence makes who are more likely to survive ) is because of how European governments made the refugee convention work with airlines - namely that if an airline bring in an asylum seeker who\\ 's by a refugee , they have to pay for their flight back . If we got rid of this rule we would see the most vulnerable being able to make it to Europe first.\\n\\nCould you explain this further ? You can ask asylum at an airport to the best of my knowledge .

Arathian,europe,"**FULL TEXT : **\\n\\nON AUGUST 11th Amnesty International , a human rights charity , announced its support for decriminalising prostitution between consenting adults . Laws over prostitution differ by country : in Britain the sale of sex is legal , but pimping and brothels are not , while in America it is illegal in all states but Nevada . Increasingly , however , human rights campaigners are calling for it to be decriminalised , as it is in several European countries . Amnesty\u2019s recommendation follows on from similar ones made by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS . Is decriminalising sex work a good idea or not ? \\n\\nAmnesty\u2019s decision has found fierce opposition : a letter from the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women , an NGO , signed by a few former sex workers and actors including Meryl Streep and Lena Dunham argues that it \u201cwill in effect support a system of gender apartheid\u201d . Those opposed to decriminalisation argue that prostitution as a trade inevitably leads to the trafficking of vulnerable women : the letter from the coalition says that since sex work was legalised in Germany the number of women trafficked to the country has boomed and that it has become the \u201cBordello of Europe\u201d . Rather than prosecute women for selling sex , many think that the \u201cSwedish model\u201d , which made buying sex illegal in 1999 , is one which should be followed . Norway , Iceland and France have adopted similar models , and the European Parliament has championed it . The Swedish model attempts to wipe out prostitution by reducing demand.\\n\\nBut it is not completely clear that the Swedish model has worked . Those who support decriminalisation\u2014which includes this newspaper , along with many sex workers\u2014point to the fact that pushing prostitution underground can have ugly consequences . Violence against prostitutes can go unpunished , as women may be less likely to go to the police if they are considered to be at the margin of the law . Street work , which had declined in Sweden , increased again after the law was passed , putting many women in more danger than before . Prostitutes may also be less likely to seek medical advice . When Rhode Island accidentally decriminalised prostitution in 2003\u2014a legal loophole from 1980 was found to only criminalise the sale of sex outdoors\u2014the state did see an increase in the amount of indoor sex work . But , according to one paper , the number of rape offenses also dropped by 31 % between 2003 and 2009 , when the trade was once again made illegal , while there were 39 % fewer cases of female gonorrhoea . Making the purchase of sex between two consenting adults illegal is also deeply illiberal.\\n\\nFears over human trafficking and child abuse should not be dismissed lightly . But laws against both exist and should be strictly enforced . And prostitution , even if made illegal , will not be eliminated : old estimates put the value of the trade in America at $ 14 billion annually ( it is now likely to be far higher ) . Rather than chase the elusive goal of stamping out a trade , the safety of prostitutes who do their work willingly should be made paramount . Countries , as well as human-rights organisations , should look at the evidence .",Greek,Greek

By saying that Putin\\ 's actions were identical to Hitler\\ 's in regard to this , I\\ 'm *not* saying that the people of Crimea didn\\'t want to be part of Russia , same way that am I not saying that the people of Sudetendland didn\\'t want to be part of Hitler\\ 's Third Reich . They did and they did.\\n\\nYou\\ 're Hitlerists , because just like Hitler , you use that desire in order to grab the territory from the neighboring nation -- against any concept of national sovereignty . But if this was *reversed* , if some region within your borders wanted to leave you , then you would put that down with violence.\\n\\nThe borders between the Ukrainian and the Russian nations were fucking ESTABLISHED . You had *agreed* to them . You had never claimed that any region that wants to leave from each of those nations , must be allowed to leave them . That\\ 's not how national sovereignty works.\\n\\nYou seem quite ignorant of history in general ; and more specifically of what Hitler did and was and argued .

This was so absurd that no country in the world could support us , and indeed none did . \\n\\n**Turkey : ** Our mere membership helps defend against Turkish aggression . Same with Cyprus -- its EU membership is a tremendous boost to its physical security from Turkish aggression . \\n\\nIf you don\\'t see this to be the case , then imagine how angry Russia would be if we let Ukraine or Georgia join up as members of the EU -- because attacking them would then have much worse consequences for them.\\n\\nCould it do more against Turkish aggression . Sure . The EU could also have done more against Serbian aggression against its neighbours , or against Russian aggression against its neighbours . But it\\ 's not doing nothing either.\\n\\n**Immigration issue** : \\nWe have received officers from EU countries , we have received funds from the EU ( e.g . https : //www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/02/refugee-crisis-europe-eu-countries-greece-receive-700m-extra-aid-funds ) .\\n\\nWhat Greek establishment objects to is that the EU counties didn\\'t open their borders to receive hundreds of thousands of Middle-eastern immigrants . \\n\\nSo again it depends whether you desire to reduce the immigration crisis , or to instead spread the crisis to other countries . Greek government complains because other countries helped us in *reducing* the overall immigration crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; Romania and Poland blocked our borders.\\n\\nYes , we should be thanking them for that . EU countries closing their own borders , since we could not defend our own , was part of the necessary solution to the immigration crisis . No immigrant wants to stay to Greece , therefore if they can\\'t proceed to Europe , they don\\'t have any reason to come here in the first place . \\n\\nThe immigration crisis reached its height in 2015 , because it was then that the new Greek government instead of *hindering* immigration , started promising immigrants that they would be transported to Europe , and indeed was itself helping transporting them from the islands to our northern borders , where we were demanding that other countries would open their own borders to let them in.\\n\\n\ '' They wanted to defend their borders , so we should are fine with Russia threatening them militarily\ '' is an absurd imperialist position . Nothing in the EU treaties demands the acceptance of third-world immigrants by any EU nation . They do demand solidarity in the face of armed aggression though .

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Why is it that normal wear and tear of our cells can be stopped and errors made in replication averted ? I know of some organisms that are able to replace their cells quickly enough to make up for the process , achieving very long ( we still don\\'t know if infinite ) lifespans , but their cells do age normally.\\n\\nUnlike you I\\ 'm not speaking about an \ '' elixir of life\ '' that will forever stop aging ( that\\ 's why your sarcastic words are harmful to *your* understanding ) . I\\ 'm talking about any medical cure of aging , even if it\\ 's similar to us too \\'replacing our cells quickly enough to make up for the process\\ ' . Or if looks instead more like \ '' replacing our organs with artificial ones\ '' that would work too . Or any other method of either defeating or completely circumventing the aging processes.\\n\\nIf you care about specific techniques that current anti-aging researchers are thinking of using , you can again start with what a [ wikipedia article ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging-rejuvenation ) has to say : \\n\\n * Cell loss can be repaired ( reversed ) just by suitable exercise in the case of muscle . For other tissues it needs various growth factors to stimulate cell division , or in some cases it needs stem cells . \\n\\n * Senescent cells can be removed by activating the immune system against them . Or they can be destroyed by gene therapy to introduce \ '' suicide genes\ '' that only kill senescent cells . \\n\\n * Protein cross-linking can largely be reversed by drugs that break the links . But to break some of the cross-links we may need to develop enzymatic methods . \\n\\n * Extracellular garbage ( like amyloid ) can be eliminated by vaccination that gets immune cells to \ '' eat\ '' the garbage . \\n\\n * For intracellular junk we need to introduce new enzymes , possibly enzymes from soil bacteria , that can degrade the junk ( lipofuscin ) that our own natural enzymes can not degrade . \\n\\n * For mitochondrial mutations the plan is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy . The mitochondrial DNA experiences a high degree of mutagenic damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria . A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals , and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs . All mitochondrial proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria . \\n\\n * For cancer ( the most lethal consequence of mutations ) the strategy is to use gene therapy to delete the genes for telomerase and to eliminate telomerase-independent mechanisms of turning normal cells into \ '' immortal\ '' cancer cells . To compensate for the loss of telomerase in stem cells we would introduce new stem cells every decade or so . \\n\\nBut these are just some possible paths . If one of them doesn\\'t work out , we can always try something else.\\n\\n & gt ; If non-aging of mammals , amphibians or birds were possible without a major alteration to the organism , don\\'t you think of how much evolutional advantage would it give ? A non-aging population would need 100 times fewer births to be sustainable . \\n\\nUh , first of all , no . Populations of animals are mainly limited by the availability of food and the existence of predators . For you to say that a non-aging population would need \ '' 100 times fewer births to be sustainable\ '' it seems you\\ 're imagining that 99 out of 100 animals die from aging . Far from so . And since evolution would need the reproduction mechanism *anyway* it\\ 's easier to replace old organism than preserve them , much like it\\ 's cheaper to replace an old TV than repair it.\\n\\nGenes \\'care\\ ' about preserving themselves , not about preserving the \\'organism\\ ' itself . If all I cared about was the preservation of human genes rather than the preservation of human minds and the elimination of suffering , I wouldn\\'t be interested in agelessness either.\\n\\nSecondly , you know what else would give a huge evolutionary advantage to animal species ? If they could communicate instantly across many thousands of kilometers . But wow , look at us , here we are communicating instantly across thousands of kilometers , and we didn\\'t need to have major alterations to our organisms either.\\n\\nYou know what else could give huge advantage to land animals ? If they could fly across oceans . But wow hey , look at humanity , flying across oceans.\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t evolution provide us with internet and airplanes ? Well frankly they were beyond the ability of any single gene-cluster to create . In the same ways beyond the ability of any single one of us are surgery , gene-therapies , 3D-printed organs , stem-cell research , and any other methods ( e.g . nanobots ? ) we might use to defeat aging . \\n\\n & gt ; Lastly , I don\\'t know why do you bring religion into the discussion . \\n\\nYou treat aging as an immutable law of nature rather than a mere genetic condition of our organisms , treatable like any other genetic condition . And it\\ 's only religion that does that -- treating aging as if it\\ 's a law set down by God or a divine punishment or something . Whether actually religious , or a leftover from the religious elements in your society , that\\ 's where the idea originates of treating aging as something that will \\'never\\ ' be cured , rather than a mere medical problem that we can fight against and eventually defeat like any other .",Greek,Greek

Instead they always praise him ( Kammenos openly treats the \ '' Karamanlis faction\ '' as worthy of the utmost respect , unlike those supposed \ '' neoliberals\ '' like Mitsotakis ) . It\\ 's a bit bizarre really -- *I* know how to explain it ( via their mutual geopolitical ties to Russia ) , but I\\ 've not seen a convincing different explanation offered by those people who disagree.\\n\\n & gt ; But I would take for starters not evidence but even suggestions . For example Greece acting pro Russia for no reason . That does not include making business deals with Russian . Remember France wanted to sell warships to Russia , they wanted the money they were not troyan horses . It doesn\\'t include simply holding the same position as Russia . Russia does not recognize Kossovo , the same goes for Greece and Cyprus . This is does not suggest Greece is a trojan horse because there is the simple explanation that Greece recognizing Kossovo would compromise it\\ 's position against recognition of occupied north Cyprus.\\n\\nSure , I understand all that , and I\\ 've never used Greece\\ 's position on Kosovo as evidence for Greece\\ 's relationship with Russia . \\n\\nI could start by mentioning some of the purely-symbolic-but-otherwise stuff , like ( 1 ) Kostas Karamanlis making an announcement on the day of Anna Politkosvskaya\\ 's murder that he phoned Vladimir Putin to ... wish him a very happy birthday ( 2 ) Segments of the Russian army partaking in Greek national parades in Alexandroupoli under the Samaras government , though AFAIK not even NATO allies ever partake in those . ( 3 ) The Greek state TV under the Tsipras government spending hours broadcasting the Russian military WW2 celebration , when I don\\'t think the state TV has ever done the same for any foreign military celebration .

According to one of the leaked emails , this organisation signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with the influential Russian Institute for Strategic Studies ( RISI ) at the end of last year.\\n\\nThe RISI was linked to Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service , the SVR , until it was brought under the office of the Russian presidency in 2009 . Leonid Reshetnikov , its director , is a retired SVR lieutenant-general . Kammenos\u2019s deputy at the defence ministry , Kostas Isichos , is another ardent fan of Putin . Last year he described EU sanctions on Russia as \u201cneo-colonial bulimia\u201d and saluted the \u201cimpressive counterattacks\u201d of Russian-backed militias in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nEchoing Russian propaganda , he accused the Kiev government of tolerating \u201cneo-Nazi abominations\u201d .

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Feels like you can\\'t really blame Syriza for Greece\\ 's plight at this point.\\n\\nWe can blame it for the part of Greece\\ 's plight that started or worsened only after they became government ( e.g . capital controls ) .\\n\\nWe can also blame it for its role in covering up the crimes of the predecessor government ( Syriza\\ 's \ '' investigating committee\ '' deliberately excluded all the years of Kostas Karamanlis from its investigation , though his term in office was the one primarily responsible for the crisis that struck Greece . And similarly Karamanlis did nothing when leftist thugs were burning down Athens in 2008 ) .\\n\\nTsipras of SYRIZA and Kostas Karamanlis of ND love each other deeply , as these two chief destroyers of Greece both mutually admire how much destruction each has brought upon the country while remaining personally untouched by anyone .

The liberal wing of ND hasn\\'t been in power since 1994 , instead ND had the populist Kostas Karamanlis , which sidelined the liberals and then helped installed fellow populist destroyer Samaras as his successor ( nationalist \\'hero\\ ' who as a minister caused the overthrow of the ND government in 1994 because they were more compromising with FYR Macedonia in regards to the name that he wanted ) .\\n\\nThe modern SYRIZA on the other hand is effectively the successor of 1980\\ 's PASOK of Andreas Papandreou , which like SYRIZA got power by insulting Europe , and then proceeded to remain in Europe because that\\ 's a useful position to be in if you want to take Europe\\ 's money and waste it . The most sickly bits of PASOK ( the parasitic nepotistic bureaucrats , masking their deep corruption behind a thin smokescreen of supposed social justice ) have migrated to SYRIZA .

Do you seriously doubt that such a referendum would have passed easily in Sudetenland if Hitler had bothered with one ? \\n\\nYour arguments that referendums are a fine method to divide up countries and annex parts of them to neighbouring countries makes a mockery of national borders , and turns every single minority in neighbouring countries into a tool for conquest . Your recipe would mean an endless new sequence of wars where every minority that becomes a local majority would either trigger a border change , or cause an ethnic cleansing to avoid such . ( In short : Turkey conquers a bit of Greece , Greece conquers a bit of Albania , Albania conquers a bit of Serbia , Serbia conquers a bit of Bosnia and Croatia , Hungary conquers a bit of Romania , etc , etc ) . Nice consequences eh ? \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' But it\\ 's interesting to see that you are not a democrat and reject the right of people for democratic self-determination\ '' \\n\\nRUSSIA rejects the right of people for democratic self-determination , you vile hypocrite .

In short I support Scotland\\ 's right to independence and Quebec\\ 's right to independence , and Basque Country\\ 's and Catalonia\\ 's and Chechnya\\ 's right to independence , but I do not support Kosovo\\ 's right to independence ( facade of Albanian imperialism ) , nor the Bosnia & amp ; Krajna Serb\\ 's right to independence ( facade of Serb imperialism ) nor the Abkhazians , South Ossetians , Transnistrians , Crimeans or Donbass right to independence ( facade of Russian imperialism ) .\\n\\nAnd Crimea\\ 's annexation was exactly that : a facade for a neighboring imperialism , and you are using the \ '' right of people for democratic self-determination\ '' EXACTLY AS HITLER USED IT , as a FACADE for your imperialism , as evidenced by the fact that no Crimean is no longer allowed to even SPEAK of separatism from Mother Russia or they face fines and jail sentences . Voting to join Russia is an irrevocable choice it seems , and you care about democratic self-determination only when you want to tear apart your neighbors , not to apply to yourselves.\\n\\nChristians say that even Satan can quote from the bible . I say that even Hitleric fascists can speak of \ '' democratic self-determination\ '' whenever it suits their purpose to tear apart and slaughter their neighbours in pursuit of their vainglorious nationalistic ambitions .

It had been threatening Ukraine with dismemberment and invasion since at least 2013 ( when it still had the \\'pro-Russian\\ ' government of Yanukovich ) because of the EU association agreement , and because of how this conflicted with Putin\\ 's dreams of a Eurasian Economic Union with Ukraine as a member .

I believe in a universal right to self determination . \\n\\nSo you support Hitler\\ 's annexation of Sudetenland , but like a coward you don\\'t want to actually state it out right.\\n \\nPerhaps you\\ 'll one day figure out why those of who have learned from the bad experience of Hitler know not to accept the words \ '' self-determination\ '' when imperialist conquerors use them to justify their ambitions.\\n\\nReally , the biggest problem Vladimir Putin and his various allies face , is that every educated person in the world who has studied WW2 in the slightest knows to recognize his Hitleric actions and excuses as Hitleric actions and excuses . \\n\\n & gt ; You support the self determination of Croats but refuse the self determination of Serbs in Croatia.\\n\\nYes , the Croats have the right to an independent nation . The Serbs already have an independent nation , it\\ 's called \ '' Serbia\u201d . The borders between Serbia and Croatia had been well established and mutually recognized through all the time of Yugoslavia . If the nation of Serbia wanted some territory from the nation of Croatia , then it should *buy* it from Croatia after peaceful negotiations.\\n\\nPerhaps one day you\\ 'll understand that it\\ 's they who respect people\\ 's right to have a secure home is they who also oppose thieves attempts to violate those homes . On the other hand thieves want their own homes secure but fail to respect other people\\ 's homes.\\n\\nYou talk about \ '' self-determination\ '' but you\\ 're arguing that any group of people can move to a part of some other country , and steal a part of it to annex it to a neighbouring one . So for example , 10,000 ISIL members can just travel somewhere in France , and they should be given the right to have their neighbourhood made independent , right ? \\n\\nBtw , I also support the right to Poland\\ 's independence from Germany , but refuse the right to \ '' independence\ '' of Germans in Czechoslovakia . History has shown that the countries most eager to invade their nations in order to protect the \\'self-determination\\ ' of minorities , are paradoxically the countries most eager to brutally crush the self-determination of other nations.\\n\\nActually ofcourse it\\ 's not paradoxical at all . It\\ 's the old phrase about how \ '' good fences make good neighbours\ '' . Mutually-respected borders make for peaceful relations.\\n\\n & gt ; You support the self determination of Bosnians but refuse the self determination of Serbs in Bosnia.\\n\\nYes , same reasoning as above . The Yugoslav constitution itself recognized the right to independence for *all* the constituent republics.\\n\\nAs for \ '' Serbs in Bosnia\ '' , they expelled hundreds of thousands of other ethnicities from their homes in order to have their ethnically pure territories to ( attempt to ) annex to Serbia . That\\ 's the direct consequence of people treating the \ '' right to self-determination\ '' as a justificable reason to tear countries apart -- ETHNIC CLEANSING AND GENOCIDE , because every country that isn\\'t \\'ethnically pured\\ ' will be divived up and destroyed.\\n\\nDon\\'t you *care* about those consequences , or is it those consequences what you\\ 're truly after ? What is your metaethical system if it\\ 's not consequentialistic ? What reasoning led you the the deontology of \\'universal self-determination\\ ' regardless of how nasty the consequences of such are ? \\n\\n & gt ; You use the same tired western propaganda points even tho Serbia was found not guilty in the cases of both Croatia and Bosnia in front of the International court of justice.\ '' \\n\\nI showed you how Serbia was directly responsible and participating in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.\\n\\n & gt ; You act like you don\\'t support the Kosovo secession ( while in reality you keep on justifying it\\n\\nI\\ 've been very clear on my stance in Kosovo , and how I opposed it and for what reasons , which have been completely consistent : I support the right to independence for every nation , region , city or village , AS LONG AS IT\\ 'S NOT A SMOKESCREEN FOR A NEIGHBOURING IMPERIALISM.\\n\\nI opposed Kosovo\\ 's independence because it\\ 's a smokescreen for Albanian imperialism . I\\ 'm very fucking clear on that , but I expect slander from a supporter of Hitler\\ 's annexation of Sudetenland , and Putin\\ 's annexation of Crimea.\\n\\nI think you\\ 're obsessed with pretending I supported Kosovo , because you are desperate to refuse the concept that I actually follow principles with reasoning behind them , and you instead need to portray me as some \\'puppet of western propaganda\\ ' .",Greek,Greek

ArisKatsaris,europe,"I didn\\'t support Kosovar independence , and I think it was an example of Albanian imperialism that it shouldn\\'t have been supported.\\n\\nBut the reason that it *was* supported by the West , was because Serbia had made itself utterly hated throughout the world for its brutal imperialism and attempts to tear apart Croatia & amp ; Bosnia.\\n\\nUnlike Serbia , neither Georgia , nor Moldova , nor Ukraine , had ever threatened the territorial integrity of any of their neighbours .

You claim to want \ '' independence\ '' , and then you join a different country where independence is forbidden .

But not quite that either really , because Yugoslavia recognized the different ethnicities and Greece melded them into one.\\n\\nIf Arvanites had sought to split off Greece and said they want to form \ '' Arvania\ '' ( or something similar ; - ) you wouldn\\'t be able to call that one a country designed to be multiethnic either .",Greek,Greek

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Nothing to do with religion . Like the witch hunts in the 16th,17th , 18th centuries . \\n\\nIn pre-Christian Rome , in 331 BC , 170 women were executed as witches.\\nIn 184 BC , about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft\\nIn 182\u2013180 BC another 3,000 executions took place.\\n\\nChristianisation actually drastically reduced the killings of witches , with the first church teaching actually calling for the punishment of anyone who *accused* people for witchcraft . From wikipedia : \\n\\nThe Councils of Elvira ( 306 ) , Ancyra ( 314 ) , and Trullo ( 692 ) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship . This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries . The general desire of the Catholic Church\\ 's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn , which , in 785 , explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch . The Lombard code of 643 states : \\nLet nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch , for it is not possible , nor ought to be believed by Christian minds . [ 22 ] \\nThis conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900 AD ( alleged to date from 314 AD ) , which , following the thoughts of Augustine of Hippo , stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was , itself , false and heterodox teaching . The Council of Frankfurt in 794 , called by Charlemagne , was also very explicit in condemning \ '' the persecution of alleged witches and wizards\ '' , calling the belief in witchcraft \ '' superstitious\ '' , and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches . [ 23 ] Other examples include an Irish synod in 800 , [ 24 ] and a sermon by Agobard of Lyons ( 810 ) . [ 25 ] \\n\\n ... \\n\\nPope Gregory VII , in 1080 , wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence . \\n\\n & gt ; Nine million of them just went puff.\\n\\nI suggest you recheck your numbers .

Bond_Ionic_Bond,europe,"To be fair to him though , the previous two governments ( that shared the \ '' wheel\ '' of the country since 1974 ) were the yes men of the EU . Samaras ( PM before Tsipras ) would only go to eurogroups to get the list of the necessary austerity measures and negotiate a few details ( like increased VAT instead of fighting tax evasion ) . Tsipras was the alternative to all these technocrat , puppet governments.\\n\\nI think everyone would agree that the EU has problems , but Tsipras and Farage instead of wanting to improve the EU they chose to say a big *fuck you* to it . I can draw a lot of parallels between these two referendums . The \ '' leave\ '' and \ '' no\ '' voters were middle and mostly working class , communists , fascists , nationalists , eurosceptics , and people who just wanted to protest with their vote . The \ '' stay\ '' and \ '' yes\ '' voters were upper class , business men , economists , people whose interest was to stay in the EU . \\n\\nBoth Tsipras and Farage put forth the ( false ? ) dichotomy that we\\ 're either going to go our way , build a strong nation , be the bosses of our selves , yada yada yada ( actually Tsipras didn\\'t say exactly that - he said that we would be respected more within the EU - our minister of defense said it ) , **or** we would be under the control of bureaucrats and technocrats in Brussels . Even I was deeply perplexed and ended up voting a not valid vote , because on the one hand I didn\\'t want a \ '' yes sir\ '' government but on the other hand I didn\\'t want us to leave EU , not only because it was in my interest to stay , but because we kinda need it ; you wont believe how many infrastructures are co-funded by the EU , or in how many respects Greece has been improved because we had to comply by it\\ 's standards , not to mention the opportunities the youth and especially the students have within the EU .",Greek,Greek

Bond_Ionic_Bond,europe,"& gt ; Sure , saying that you aren\\'t required to murder strippers in a video game , despite them being there for that sole purpose , is a HUGE inaccuracy . Feminism debunked . Move along , society.\\n\\nWell you either didn\\'t see the video , or didn\\'t care enough to pay attention to it . The game is called \ '' Hitman.\ '' You can literally kill anyone , anywhere . You actually get penalized for killing these strippers - and any other innocent person as a matter of fact . The strippers don\\'t have a purpose , they\\ 're there because you\\ 're in a strip club . If Hitman enters a restaurant , the customers\\ ' sole purpose wouldn\\'t be to get murdered . On the contrary , if these strippers have a purpose is to make you hate your contract ( target ) more by listening how much he mistreats them . \\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , a lot of other videos that either criticize her and not her ideas\\n\\nThere are videos criticizing her ideas and/or debunk her arguments , and , granted , they may call her a few names in the process ; you just chose to concentrate on the name calling and not on the substance . \\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's a tight statistic . 44 % of video game players are female . \\n\\nIf you include iOS , Android and Facebook games , yes . But that\\ 's not our focus here . Our focus is platform and computer games . The paper says that 41 % of game purchases are made by women , but doesn\\'t specify if it\\ 's purchases in general or platform/PC purchases specifically . Probably the former . Furthermore , the most frequent female gamer is 43 years of age . I don\\'t think 43 year old women like to play fallout and doom . And in the games I play - flight simulators - , although they can hardly be called games , there are almost zero women players.\\n\\n & gt ; There\\ 's nothing wrong with that . What\\ 's wrong is having that in a character that doesn\\'t have anything else to her , that\\ 's just there for the male to ogle . It\\ 's objectification . If you think that\\ 's okay , well honey , there\\ 's no point arguing with you.\\n\\nAlthough I agree with you here , this can\\'t be applied universally . For example , the strippers in Hitman don\\'t contribute much to the game ( unless maybe for the reason I mentioned above ) , but they\\ 're not just there to satisfy the male gaze either . \\n\\n & gt ; If she is like that in the game -I don\\'t know , I haven\\'t played it- , then yes , it\\ 's sexist.\\n\\nI haven\\'t played it either , so there\\ 's no reason to discuss it further.\\n\\n & gt ; So you shouldn\\'t take the average gamers\\ ' maturity into account when criticising sexism in video games , but you should when calling the cops when that same gamer sends you death threats ? \\n\\nWell , it depends . On the first occasion you\\ 're talking about a whole society , on the second occasion you\\ 're talking about only a part of it . Most , if not all , threats come from immature \ '' basement dwellers\ '' , but not all gamers are immature basement dwellers . Yes , I agree , that if you\\ 're immature enough to make rape/death threats over opinions on the internet , you don\\'t have enough mental ability to differentiate game reality from actual reality . \\n\\nI like to draw a parallel with movies and movie goers here . How many great films have sexism , racism , violence , or all three ? Would you call all movie goers sexists , racists and violent ? \\n\\n & gt ; You just said society is sexist.\\n\\nWhen did I say that ? Are you referring to *\ '' What\\ 's wrong with having female characters in kinky outfits ? \ '' * Being attracted to sexy individuals of the opposite sex ( or the same ) is something natural , not taboo , nor is it discriminatory to individuals that don\\'t reach these standards . Male characters don\\'t have the average gamer\\ 's shape either ; they all have warrior bodies ! I should mention though , that I too am against displaying models of both sexes with \ '' perfect\ '' bodies everywhere , not because I feel bad that I can\\'t reach these standards - I don\\'t - , but because this objectification - as you\\ 'd say - takes away the feeling of appreciation when you see your SOs body . In simple words , you just grow uninterested to sexuality . \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong though , I\\ 'm not denying that there is *no* sexism in society , just not as much as 40 years ago . \\n\\n & gt ; If you raise a child in a racist background that doesn\\'t make him question racism , he will probably grow up to be racist . Playing a game where killing a black person has no consequences won\\'t help him question that happening , and leave him as he was . Playing a game where that behaviour is discouraged will hopefully lead him towards a different path.\\n\\nIf a child is raised on a racist background , the games he\\ 's playing is just a drop in the ocean . The real problem is the background into which he or she is raised . Personally , instead of trying to criticize content , I\\ 'd work towards building suitable backgrounds to raise children into . \\n\\nEDIT : some spelling",Greek,Greek

Carrotman,europe,"My tips are for around the Chania area , where I come from.\\n\\nThere are several wonderful gorges . Samaria being the most famous one and the longest one in Europe . A bus from Chania drives to Omal\u00f3s ( the starting point ) several times during the early morning hours and at the end of the gorge ( about 5-7 hours later depending on your pace ) you can get the boat to either Sfaki\u00e1 or to So\u00fagia and from there take the bus back to Chania . Better take an early bus so that you won\\'t have to hurry at the end . The last boat to Sfaki\u00e1 is around 5:30pm and to So\u00fagia around 5:00pm . I usually carry a sleeping bag with me and spend the night at the beach in So\u00fagia taking the morning bus to Chania ( aroung 7am ) .\\n\\nAnother nice gorge is Ar\u00e1dena . Reachable by bus from Chania . Around a 3 hour hike through the gorge to the beach ( M\u00e1rmara ) and then another 3,5 hour hike eastwards along the shore to Sfaki\u00e1 . When I did this one I did a late afternoon hike through the gorge , ate in the evening at the taverna on a cliff at the beach , spent the night under the stars and had pleanty of time for the eastward hike along the shore to enjoy the two little villages ( reachable only by boat ) and the sweet-water beach where an underground river flows into the sea.\\n\\nNice sandy beaches are Fal\u00e1sarna and Elafon\u00edsi . The boat trip to Grambousa ( from Kissamos , reachable by bus from Chania ) and the subsequent stop for a swim at B\u00e1los is also a nice day trip.\\n\\nI absolutely suggest a visit to a small tavern hidden in the mountains called [ \ '' \u039c\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\ '' ] ( http : //www.milia.gr/EN/ ) , but you need a car to reach it ( and plenty of courage for the last 2kms , if you\\ 're not used to the roads there ) . It can be easily combined with a visit to the aforementioned Elafonisi which is only about 45 mins away.\\n\\nSome nice wilder beaches are [ Ravdo\u00facha ] ( https : //maps.google.com/maps ? q=35.534841,23.725002 & amp ; num=1 & amp ; t=h & amp ; z=18 ) and [ Kedr\u00f3dasos ] ( https : //maps.google.com/maps ? q=35.269624,23.558334 & amp ; num=1 & amp ; t=h & amp ; z=17 ) , though the last one might be prove hard to find the way to .",Greek,Greek

CharMack90,europe,"& gt ; Ultimately your post points out that some bad feelings still do exist in Europeans and I\\ 've seen it myself but we are in a really difficult \ '' chicken and the egg\ '' ( which came first ? The chicken or the egg ? ) situation here . Do people have negative feelings towards migrant communities because of issues currently posed by them ( crime etc . ) or was that feeling there already and partially contributes to marginalisation ? \\n\\nI believe it\\ 's mostly because of people already having the tendency to being prejudicial towards immigrants.\\n\\nFor example , when the population exchange of 1923 happened between Greece and Turkey , hundred of thousands of Greeks were expelled from their ancestral homes in Anatolia and were brought to Greece proper.\\n\\nMost of them were settled to newly-abandoned villages and uninhabited areas near towns and cities . These places were usually marshlands and bogs unfit for settlement and the native Greeks were often prejudicial and even hostile towards the immigrants.\\n\\nThese people were forced to leave their homes and come to a ( to them ) foreign land , and even though they had the same ancestry , culture , religion , and language ( albeit , different dialect ) with the locals , they were still treated negatively and faced challenges in integration.\\n\\nThe immigrants , though , were good for each locale . They were among the most educated and well-versed workers and businessmen . They built villages and towns , made major contributions to Greece\\ 's economy , and still had to wait for generations before the local community accepted them.\\n\\nNow imagine how difficult it would be for people of different heritage to be accepted . Sure , 2016 is much better than 1923 in terms of social integration , but it\\ 's nowhere near perfect . I can\\'t be certain , but I reckon it starts from the natives first , before affecting the immigrants and making a vicious circle out of the situation .",Greek,Greek

D3va92,europe,"Why i vote yes ? Well lets start with this . The company i was working for closed and i got fired . Because i was working there for many years they gave me an amount that is currently in deposit . In case of a no vote things might work and get a better deal indeed but it also gets us closer to grexit and basicly me losing all my savings and without a job i am pretty much fucked . On the other hand with yes at least you know that a deal will be made . But lets be honest even with yes vote , this question will come up again later on.\\n\\nNow that was why i vote yes . Now what i think is that with a yes or a no Europe can say that we wont make a new deal and that you should have signed back then . And be forced to leave Euro . If i didnt have the money in deposit i would have voted no . Not because i trust syriza but because its obvious like you said that a solution is not possible if we follow that road .",Greek,Greek
D3va92,europe,"Exactly , and yet people call that democracy and call Tsipras a worthy Prime minister . They fail to realise that he did it for himself more than anything . Yesterday i talked with some of my friends to see what they were thinking , i was shocked they all thought that money they have on banks wont go 1:1 with drachma when we leave euro , they think that there is no way of leaving euro and the EZ . Also even if we go back to drachma they believe that Europe will still help us early on . Delusions thats all i have to say .

Even if we leave we will end up in the same situation so fast .",Greek,Greek

D3va92,europe,To me it seems like Tsipras want greece out of the Euro but he wants to do it and still stay in power . So he waited until the last possible moment to announce the referendum .

And if you ask them why they would say it doesnt matter its just 1euro they should go catch the big fish first . They dont realise that even that is a problem . Anyway when the politicians avoid taxation and make laws just so they can avoid getting caught , it doesnt make the rest of the population more willing to be right . In conclusion they should reform the whole system if they ever wish to not end up in the same place we where .",Greek,Greek

Varoufakis tweets that capital control is against what they believe , then we learn that he said different things on BBC and after some hours they anounce capital control .

But the rest are gon na have a problem .

And i dont mean savings above 50000 euros , but still an amount that will make you last for some years without a job . So most of those people will vote yes . In case of a no and grexit it will leave them with nothing . Then i am pretty sure that this gon na lead to riots and hate towards the goverment and propably against its other . In such times its not hard for some groups to act and make things worse . Anyway things can get pretty bad if we split and i believe something like that is possible . You can see it from now the people that vote No call everyone that votes YES stupid along with other things . And when channels suddenly say that not matter the outcome we have to stay together i see a possible problem.\\n\\nP.S . Also in a yes vote this scenario is possible .

The police found the murderer , who moments earlier had phoned his woman at home , and told her to erase all existence of any Golden Dawn paraphernalia from their house.\\n\\n* The police found tons of incriminating evidence in his house . The murderer confessed to the killings , and after questioning he directly implicated Golden Dawn . He worked for them for years , as an active member of Golden Dawn \ '' patrols\ '' , where among other thugs he rode around in motorcycles and beat up non-whites.\\n\\n_____________________________________________\\n\\n* Unknown assailants , no connections to anyone besides rumors.\\n* Known assailant , direct connections to specific party which preaches hate and violence against non-whites.\\n\\nHow are those the same ? \\n\\nNo , I don\\'t think the firebombers should get away scot-free . If found they should be arrested , and if the same evidence is found on them and they confess to have analogous connections to ANY political party , I will hold that political party equally responsible.\\n\\nUntil then , it\\ 's rumors VS facts , and nothing else , and the decent thing to do would be to stop diverting attention from the crime that took place.\\n\\nEDIT EDIT : The assailants in your EDIT EDIT have been arrested and they should stand trial , not as members of the parliament with special privileges , but as ordinary citizens .

This is the state\\ 's fault that is completely unable or rather unwilling to enforce the law . Do regular checks and fine the owners that don\\'t conform to oblivion until they get it .

Sorry , no.\\n\\n & gt ; In Cyprus case , what benefits Greece and EU is that Turkey to pull out completely , and the island to become a fully EU governed space\\n\\nOver and over again you keep saying that same thing with no support whatsoever . The island would be self-governed just like other countries in the EU are and if it didn\\'t like the EU it could always follow its own path . Countries are free to both enter and leave the EU in case you haven\\'t noticed recently . I understand that\\ 's a strange concept to a country that had to invade and illegally occupy another country but yeah.. that\\ 's how it works over here . Stop blaming it on the EU just because you know that the island wouldn\\'t be aligned with Turkey . \\nyour puppet anymore . We are proposing for both armies to withdraw exactly so that the island can be autonomous without influence from either Greece or Turkey . It would be in our interest if only our army remained but that wouldn\\'t be fair obviously . Both sides withdrawing and leaving Cyprus alone is fair . Clearly you don\\'t care about what\\ 's fair which is fine but in that case , stop using bullshit arguments and blaming the other side and instead say \ '' we\\ 're wrong but it suits us so yeah\ '' . It\\ 's more honest than trying to excuse your country with bullshit theories about EU overlords.\\n\\n & gt ; That international community was proposing Turkey to abide by the Treaty of Sevres or go back to Mongolia . You think we care about some fat liberals sitting in Brussels and telling us what to do ? They may be your overlords , but not ours dude.\\n\\nNo , that was the Entente . And it\\ 's the same one that didn\\'t even enforce the teary of Sevres and instead let you get away with the treaty of Lausanne so don\\'t sound so wronged . Even then they were your overlords . They could have leveled Istanbul if they wanted to.\\n\\n & gt ; I am getting tired of repeating myself . What you propose ( wirthdrawal of Greek army ) does not change the fact that the plan benefits you.\\n\\nThe plan would only benefit us if Cyprus chooses to . You\\ 're complaining about repeating yourself but never comment on that . You won\\'t let a unified Cyprus decide on its own because you think they won\\'t align with you . Even the turkish-cypriot part . Your only proposal is a unified Cyprus with a turkish army present to blackmail it ? \\n\\n & gt ; Unless you propose something that does not extend EU\\ 's sphere to Turkish shores , we have no deal.\\n\\nIn other words \ '' we\\ 'll boycott every deal unless we dictate how it goes\ '' . I guess it works for now . Your international reputation sinks even lower , you remain with an isolated pseudostate that doesn\\'t even like you , the RoC part keeps enjoying its independence and acceptance of the international community and it gets to exploit its oil reserves anyway without you being able to do something about it . You know that with that mentality you\\ 're bound to lose the northern part sooner or later anyway though right ? \\n\\n & gt ; Cyprus is pretty close from Mersin , which is a Turkish shore . One can even take a ferry and go to Cyprus . You must know the map of the fucking region if you want to talk about its politics for fuck sake.\\n\\nHow is this even relevant to anything ? Chios is even closer to Turkey . You could swim across , let alone taking a ferry . The EU already has close borders with you . It has been like that from the beginning . Again , what are you talking about ? What does Cyprus being close to your shores have to do with anything ? \\n\\n & gt ; Cyprus won\\'t be independent as long as EU is involved . Since when Cyprus is independent excuse me ? \\n\\nSays who ? It already is independent . I\\ 've asked you many times but you\\ 've been unable to tell me how Cyprus is not independent even now as the RoC , because of the EU . Give me an example.\\nAnd i already told you , they were briefly independent after they signed the declaration from the British . It didn\\'t last long because of the incidents with EOKA etc but still..\\n\\n & gt ; If you ask an average Greek , he would prefer to get a free American citizenship and settle in NYC now ( as many do ) , does not justify America to come and claim Athens.\\n\\nNo , but a ) there have been no such talks between the USA and Athens , b ) A Greek can get an American citizenship anytime while the TRNC is not even recognized , and c ) similarly with b ) , Greece is a recognized sovereign country while the TRNC is a pseudostate , not a part of Turkey so anyway you look at it your example is flawed.\\n\\n & gt ; Oh do not get me wrong , I have zero faith in Greece to make a militaristic move on the island . Greece is incapable ( both politically and militaristically ) to make such a move . What I meant there was the intention is still there . Junta tried the militaristic way ( and failed ) , republic tries the diplomatic way ( through EU , sphering Cyprus ) .\\n\\nI wasn\\'t talking about that either . There is not even the intention . Everyone knows and accepts that RoC is its own country now . Plus the Junta didn\\'t even try the militaristic way . If it had the Turkish army would never even have landed on the island . It tried to incite unrest to force the union yes , but that wasn\\'t the militaristic way . You\\ 'd know it if it was.\\n\\n & gt ; In either way , the idea is to extend EU\\ 's borders to Turkish shores . \\n\\nLike i said before that argument is beyond stupid . The EU already has enough borders to Turkey . And why would the EU want borders with or close to Turkey in any case ? What do you think they\\ 're going to do ? Invade you ? If they want to they can do that from distance as well , don\\'t worry about that . The idea is to finally reunite the island , end the isolation of the northern part let Cyprus has its own entire country .

First of all , Greece wasn\\'t the one that said \ '' pay us or we crash the EU.\ '' Greece was the one threatened with an exit . There\\ 's a difference . Still , Greece has voted everything that was asked of it so far has it not ? My question is , what\\ 's the point ? Everyone can see that the debt is not sustainable but Germany ( more precicely Schauble ) keeps insisting on more reformation which result in more debts wich combined in turn result to Greece being in a worse shape , people having even lower wages and more inability to pay so the market is frozen , more businesses close and on top of that , the debt is even bigger cause we take loans for older debts . This is a black hole . I\\ 'm not blaming others for our situation to begin with but i AM saying that the way this is being handled the situation for us is actually getting worse , not better.\\n\\nIf the other countries feel like they shouldn\\'t help Greece , then simpy don\\'t do it to begin with , instead of putting Greece through a loop that\\ 's not actually fixing anything . On the other hand , if the EU thinks that it should help Greece , this is not the way to do it . When you want to help a guy that\\ 's on the ground you help him up , you don\\'t kick him in the stomach . When Germany was in ruins the wzy to help it was to postpone its debt repayments by a lot and more than 50 % of it had to be erased entirely . If the loaners were like \ '' take more loans and pay up what you owe now , i don\\'t care how you do it\ '' , Germany would be in an entirely different state right now . \\n\\nAgain , I\\ 'm not demanding more money or blaming others for our initial shit but there have been mistakes in the way this was handled and the Greek people are paying ( more ) for it now .",Greek,Greek

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"& gt ; There is no anti-Turkish conspiracy it is about islam . Considering how Islam is pretty popular topic in europe . You guys simply use Turkey to prove a point.\\n\\nSorry but that\\ 's stupid . That\\ 's like saying \ '' It\\ 's not about Hitler , it\\ 's about Nazism\ '' . Well obviously , we don\\'t have something personal with Hitler other than that fact that he did what he did.. Turkey has been muslim since the beginning but only now that it\\ 's going more radical people are vocal about it . Do you think that\\ 's somehow wrong ? Turkey has been muslim 15 years ago and it was best buddies with the West so no , it\\ 's not about Islam , cause Turkey has always been there . It\\ 's about allowing someone to tether Turkey to Islam and allow religion to affect its society.\\n\\n & gt ; See this is exactly what I am talking about . The perpetrators of those get arrested and locked up you guys act like these are actually encouraged by the state they are not . You guys trying to push that stuff like this is ordered by islam and supported by muslims while perpetrators are generally violent idiots.\\n\\nAs far as i know the guy that attacked the girl in the bus was released . If that changed , good . I\\ 'm not trying to say if it\\ 's Islam that orders it or not but since you mentioned it , the attacks happened because of religious reasons right ? These typically don\\'t happen in secular countries . Obviously it\\ 's not the rule in Turkey but the whole picture is getting increasingly worse for you guys . Try to understand that it\\ 's not a matter of Islam . In Greece if you follow what religion dictates , people are not supposed to eat meat during Easter too but we don\\'t have cases like this one . Regardless of the religion , if that happened people would be mad because it\\ 's not a secular thing but a sign of backwardness . So no , it\\ 's not about Islam . It\\ 's about Turkey getting closer to being a society with bullshit laws dictated by religion and moving away from what it used to be.\\n\\n & gt ; Another example that proves my argument . Do you see the pattern here ? Death penalty maybe coming back to Turkey has absolutely nothing to do with islam yet you act like it does . Why ? I know why but please answer.\\n\\nIt\\ 's very simple . Because unlike what you\\ 're claiming , i\\ 'm not using Turkey to bash Islam . As you just pointed out , this has nothing to do with Islam . Other things do have to do with religion generally , but this one doesn\\'t.\\n\\n & gt ; Islam is barely relevant here if majority of Turks were non-religious Erdogan\\ 's methods would simply change he uses religion because we are religious people.\\n\\nThat\\ 's correct . He\\ 's using religion to get what he wants but i\\ 'd except from a country like Turkey to be able to resist that given that even though you\\ 're religious people ( like us pretty much ) , there was a strong secular core . Unfortunately Erdogan is taking Turkey away from that from what i see . His motives might not be religious but the outcome affects exactly that . Again , this is not a beef against Islam . It\\ 's a beef against a country slowly turning theocratic regardless of the religion it adheres to.\\n\\n & gt ; No it is you who want that . So that you can say \ '' I told you so\ '' . If you actually cared you would get informed.\\n\\nThat\\ 's a pretty childish mentality , it\\ 's all i can say . Anyone that wants to see a country going there just so that he can feel good about saying \ '' i told you so\ '' is a retard .

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"I won\\'t bother debating on the whole \ '' extermination\ '' thing again . There was no such case , you have nothing to support such claims . If the allies wanted you exterminated , you\\ 'd be exterminated . If anything the Great Powers spared the Ottoman Empire turning it into Turkey . You posted a link about prosecutions of muslims and i posted a link about prosecutions of christians . Your only counter argument was \ '' yes but this was before that\ '' which isn\\'t even accurate cause the link i posted talks about 1800+ as well . It\\ 's simple . If the Turks were being systematically \ '' exterminated\ '' in Europe , we\\ 'd be talking about a witch hunt and a genocide . 5 million deaths is a HUGE number . Yes no one else is mentioning of the extermination of 5 millions Turks other than you . I guess you have to counter-balance the genocide accusations somehow.\\n\\nAbout that there are no demographics of the Greeks being a majority in the areas given to them , you\\ 're wrong.\\n\\n\ '' According to the U.S . Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time , Henry Morgenthau , more than half of Smyrna\\ 's population was Greek . [ 27 ] The American Consul General in Smyrna at the time , George Horton , wrote that before the fire there were 400,000 people living in the city of Smyrna , of whom 165,000 were Turks , 150,000 were Greeks , 25,000 were Jews , 25,000 were Armenians , and 20,000 were foreigners\ '' \\n\\nMost demographics show that they were close to 50-50 and some reports mention the Turks as a majority and some mention the Greeks as a majority , both with a slight advantage . \\nAlso the Greeks didn\\'t invade Smyrna . The area was given to Greece and the army landed peacefully , not counting some fights with irregulars.\\n\\n & gt ; Yes obviously there couldn\\'t be a compromise after how the Greek army behaved itself and the treaty of sevres . I\\ 'm talking about a compromise prior to that.\\nAtat\u00fcrk was not bloodthirsty warmonger and without the Allies going crazy after ww1 his resistance wouldn\\'t even have been necessary.\\n\\nWell it\\ 's not up to Ataturk to decide what\\ 's fair and what\\ 's not . He\\ 's on the losing side . Ataturk could also not have compromised with even the slightest land loss or penalty against the Ottoman Empire so how is that \ '' Ataturk didn\\'t like the treaty so he didn\\'t compromise\ '' an argument ? If the Great Powers wanted to enforce the treaty they could have , but the change in the Greek government changed things so they went with Kemal instead and made a different deal/treaty . \\n\\nJust to clarify , I\\ 'm not defending that war here . By modern standards the treaty of Sevres was bullshit . I\\ 'm just saying that it\\ 's the same that the Ottoman Empire had done to the past . Total conquest and loss of independence of the opposing side . \\nThat war shouldn\\'t have happened in the first place . Greece was used as fodder to enforce a treaty that the Great Powers didn\\'t really care about enforcing , they got us into another war with Turkey and the whole \ '' Megali Idea\ '' thing on Greece behalf was greedy but inspired by a desire to liberate parts where rather big number of Greeks still lived .",Greek,Greek
Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"There were definitely not 5 million turks living in either Greece , Serbia or Bulgaria . Unless you can show me some demographics or death tolls but i guess you can\\'t . That was my point . Most of the muslims were displaced back to the Ottoman Empire . In greece most of them went back during the population exchange . If they had been slaughtered , there would have been no muslim population to be exchanged in the first place . Ponder on that.\\nAlso these happened - again - both ways . Since you like reading wiki articles about prosecutions , take a look in this one as well\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians # Persecution_of_Orthodox_Christians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire\\n\\nKeep in mind that the Ottomans/Turks are charged with 3 genocides . \\n\\n & gt ; The Ottoman Empire didn\\'t get its start until the 14th century . At that point the Byzantine\\u200bEmpire was already in full decline and only controlled Constantinople , a few surrounding areas in Anatolia and European possessions . Everything south and east of the tiny Ottoman domain was ruled by other Turkish dynasties . The countryside was completely Turkish made up of farmers and nomadic tribes.\\nHere\\ 's a map from 1326 : \\n\\nAre you stupid or something ? You\\ 're showing me maps that show Turks in the TURKISH anatolia , which means that they had already conquered these grounds . You specifically said \ '' the Greeks weren\\'t a majority in these for more than a thousand years which brought us to around 900 AD and you show me a nap of 1326 AD when the Ottomans had already conquered most part of it.\\nHere\\ 's a map from 867 which is way closer.\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire # /media/File : ByzantineEmpire867AD4lightpurple.PNG\\n\\nAs you can see Anatolia was clearly Byzantine . turks started becoming the majority there AFTER they conquered it . Just like with Constantinople . \\n\\n & gt ; It made no sense . The Greek population wasn\\'t the majority . There could have been a compromise where each side got some of the land according tp population size . But you got greedy and lost everything.\\n\\nLike i mentioned earlier , more demographics show that the Greeks and Turks had about the same numbers , and some stats even show the Greeks as actually being more than the Turks . So if the Greeks weren\\'t the majority , The Turks weren\\'t either . \\nAnd no , there couldn\\'t have been a compromise since Kemal straight out ordered the Turks to attack Smyrna and kick the Greeks out . Even if Greece hadn\\'t been greedy they would have had to attack anyway . Yes , the truth is that they did get greedy and were influenced by the Megali Idea but it\\ 's also the truth that the Turks kept attacking Greek positions . Also we didn\\'t lose everything cause we got greedy . The defeat came when the change in the government came and Greece went with the royalists instead of the Venizelists . Venizelos wanted to to continue the war ( the greek army was almost outside of Ankara by that point ) but most Greeks were war-weary and against the war . Venizelos\\ 's political enemies campaigned saying they\\ 'd stop the war and indeed the won the elections . Venizelos wasn\\'t even elected in the parliament . The thing is , after the win , the King not only didn\\'t stop the war , but they also replaced a lot of the veteran officers of the old regime with new ones that were completely inexperienced and basically useless which rapidly led us into getting our asses kicked . Kemal on the other had was an exceptional leader and strategist so it\\ 's no surprise . But yeah greed ( although obviously bad ) wasn\\'t the problem . Most say that if Venizelos had remained in power , the greek army would have probably entered Ankara . The rest is unknown . \\n\\n & gt ; And yet only ever the Turks are admonished . \\n\\nWell.. it\\ 's not ONLY them that are admonished , at least not in that particular war . But in the end the atrocities in Smyrna kind of echoed louder with people drowning , the city in flames and all so i guess that\\ 's what\\ 's easier to \ '' stick\ '' .\\n\\n & gt ; This makes no sense . I\\ 'm talking about the lands that make up Turkey today . The lands given to Greeks and Armenians was already egregious . But additionally\\u200b the Allies occupied other areas as well . What was to happen to those areas eventually ? Based on the example of the Italian behavior of giving their possessions in the Adriatic to Greece they would have again been given to the Greeks and Armenians with the Turkish population getting ethnically cleansed.\\nJoining a war is no excuse for a war of extermination . Neither Germany\\u200b nor Austria were treated that way . Yes they lost their imperial possessions and had to make territorial concessions but areas of German settlement weren\\'t just given away nilly willy until both Countries were at 20 % of today\\ 's size.\\n\\nAn area being egregious isn\\'t the same as changing hands entirely . Smyrna would pass to the Greeks , the rest of the areas wouldn\\'t go to Britain or France , these countries didn\\'t work that way . They preferred control over the Empire . I agree that joining a war is no excuse for a war of extermination although keeping in mind how far the Ottoman Empire spread and how many countries it completely conquered and enslaved , it\\ 's funny to me how \ '' unfair\ '' you think it is that other countries would do the same with the Ottomans . If you could you have completely wiped off the map every European country back in the days of the strong Empire , but when you lose and you\\ 're about to lose your country to others you\\ 're like \ '' they\\ 're trying to enslave us and wipe the great Turkish nation off the face of the Earth\ '' as if it\\ 's so unfair.. it\\ 's kind of hypocritical.\\nIf we were being fair the Great Powers SHOULD have completely dismantled the Empire , like you did with the Byzantine Empire and others . You value independence differently when you fight for it instead of taking it away from others , don\\'t you ? \\nGreece didn\\'t have a country for centuries . Think about that .

The fact that a totally different people moved in that area doesn\\'t give them the right to claim the same name .

The name \ '' Macedon\ '' is connected to more than the area ( which btw is shared by 3 more countries so even this way , it\\ 's not exclusive ) .\\n\\n & gt ; The people of Republic of Macedonia have practically nothing to do with ancient Macedonia.\\n\\nAnd this is why they should find a name of their own and stop naming their airports after ancient Macedonian kings .

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"& gt ; Yes , because they don\\'t go as far as equating the names Republic of Macedonia/Macedonians with the ridiculous claim of ancient Macedonian heritage . One can call Slav Macedonians , Macedonians , knowing perfectly well that they are not the descendants of the ancient Macedonians and that Greeks from the Greek province of Macedonia are also called Macedonians and are the ones claiming that heritage.\\n\\nYou could say the same about Indians/native Americans . We all know that THESE Indians were not the ones from India yet instead of calling them Indians we now call them native Americans which is a correct term . Why have a wrong term and have to learn to distinguish between the two instead of fixing the issue and having a proper correct name/term ? \\n\\n & gt ; I think the solution is to educate people . There are other countries and regions which inherited the name of the place from other groups than the one who is majoritarian now or who share a region . Examples were given by other people here.\\n\\nSame as my previous comment . You agree that the claim is absurd but instead of changing the name you propose that the entire world should bend around it and learn that even though the name is wrong , the two people are different when we could easily avoid that with a different name that would make it a lot easier to tell the difference . \\n\ '' People are educated\ '' could also work if we named every country in Europe Germany and just say \ '' yeah but we know who the real Germans and who the fake ones are so meh , it\\ 's fine\ '' . No .

FYROM can\\'t have it both ways . We have absolutely nothing against them but personally i\\ 've seen so many of them that actually believe and promote the idea that they\\ 're ancestors of the ancient Macedonians and as long as this policy is followed , frictions will be there.\\n\\nI agree about the qualifier .

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"I agree in everything you say but while you see it from a purely geographical perspective , it doesn\\'t end there .

Greece wouldn\\'t care if they used the name of the area if that name didn\\'t overlap with their own history . It\\ 's one thing to call them \ '' the people living in Macedonia\ '' ( as in the area ) and another to call them Macedonians because of that overlapping . Mexico and America don\\'t have the same issues because they don\\'t take the name of a previous civilization/kingdom.\\n\\nIf Texas wanted to name itself \ '' Aztecia\ '' or something , Mexico would probably react and it make sense . They\\ 're after a name that belonged to a people that have no connections with them , simply because they live on the same area . Besides it\\ 's not like they HAVE to take the name of the area they live in . Many younger countries have used names unrelated to the areas they\\ 've settled . Bulgarians settled in Macedonia/Thrace yet they didn\\'t name their land that .

This is also why Turkey has consistently been avoiding bringing this to the International Court of Justice . Turkey even declared a casus belli ( which is illegal ) in case Greece does exactly what International Law enables her to do . \\n\\nSo no , it\\ 's not just about the EU and yes we know Turkey and we don\\'t expect it to change its policy just because the EU ( and others ) says so , but it\\ 's an indication of what other nations think about the situation and that it\\ 's basically just Turkey that considers this area as its own airspace . \\n\\n & gt ; It then also does not mean Turkish jets violate \ '' Greek air space\ '' .\\n\\nIt kind of does unless you follow Turkey\\ 's line of denial i suppose .

Wasn\\'t it Greece in 1919 which . after grabbing Smyrna , wanted to grab the entire Minor Asia had failed in a terrible way ? \\n\\nWell it was the allies\\ ' plan in general . Smyrna was given to Greece , it didn\\'t take it by itself . Greece was never going to have the entire Minor Asia even if the plan had worked anyway . Greece was used by the allies to push inwards and stop Kemal\\ 's resistance . However , yes Greece did have Megali Idea back then and look how that worked out . Greece hasn\\'t had anything like that since then though . That\\ 's the difference . Turkey is still acting like the Ottoman Empire , a century later.\\n\\n & gt ; No seriously , you should be fair with your judgements , especially if you are coming from a country where people think Turks must go to Mongolia as a popular belief.\\n\\nThat\\ 's actually not a popular belief .

What are you talking about ? You\\ 're talking about the Greek junta which was illegal itself . Not about Greece\\ 's stance today.\\n\\n & gt ; It is because Greece does not have the military capability today . The moment Greek army becomes greater than Turkey\\ 's , and an opportunity occurs ( just like post-ww1 situation ) we know that Megali Idea 2.0 would be initiated . \\n\\nEhhh.. how do you know this exactly ? Greece has been following the same policy for a long time and it has no claims on any lands whatsoever . With your mentality , Greece would be using its greater army to invade Albania , FYROM etc but for some reason it doesn\\'t . Do you know why ? Because Greece has stopped having anything to do with Megali Idea for a long time . The only reason Greece even has such a strong force in the area is Turkey\\ 's aggression and constant threats . Greece has made zero claims in any Turkish areas . Turkey can\\'t say the same . As i said earlier and you conveniently tried to dismiss as \ '' nonsense not to be taken seriously\ '' , Turkish officials have actually talked about Turkish islands under occupation . Greece hasn\\'t . \\n\\n & gt ; Actually that was an official statement made by Allies in post-ww1 ( Turks must be driven back to Asia ) . It is not only some Redditors again , \\n\\nNaturally..

No Greek actually cares about Istanbul either , at least not more than any other country would care about having a free extra city . Ask the Greeks if Greece should make war and re-take Istanbul and no one other some few brain dead ultra-nationalists will give a shit . Regardless of military power . Even if Greece had twice the armed forces of Turkey , any idea of land claims would be doomed and dropped . Saying that Greece wants that because of the idiots that talk about Istanbul is like saying that Germany today wants to take over Europe because of the few neo-nazis that wear SS uniforms and get a boner . \\n\\n & gt ; Turkish politicians saying islands are occupied are a threat , but Greek people believing that Istanbul is occupied is not a threat.\\n\\nDefinitely , since the one is an official elected government\\ 's statement and the other is a generalization pulled straight out of your ass.\\n",Greek,Greek
Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"& gt ; And although Turkey acted upon the treaty ( at least the first part , right of intervention ) , today\\ 's Greece strangely protests Turkey.\\n\\nGreece protests because Turkey acted way beyond the treaty . Turkey violated the ceasefire and conveniently went from occupying 3 % of Cyprus to occupying almost 40 % of it , even though hostilities had ended . Furthermore , Turkey illegally brought in settlers from mainland Turkey to live in the grossly disproportionately ( considering the island\\ 's demographics ) occupied lands which is a clear violation of the Geneva convention . In other words , Turkey went from simply intervening ( which is how it likes to call it ) , to straight out occupying almost half the island and bringing settlers to solidify the division and occupation of Cyprus . Anyway , that\\ 's a completely different topic that you brought up because you found a wall regarding what the International Law states about the Aegean dispute.\\n\\n & gt ; Society believes in this . Tell me that I am wrong , aren\\'t there people in Greece who believe Mongols have occupied Istanbul ? Tell me I am wrong . Be honest . Dude I can even find street interviews from Youtube if you like ? Let us not play the dumb come on.\\n\\nNo , you\\ 're not wrong . The thing is you\\ 're not wrong if you say that there are people that believe in lizardmen . So if you\\ 're claiming that the Greek society believes that if we had a larger army we should initiate a Megali Idea 2.0 , yes you\\ 're completely wrong . If you\\ 're saying that the Turks came from central Asia to conquer Constantinople , that\\ 's a fact , i don\\'t know why you\\ 're objecting to that . The fact that some people are bitter that Constantinople was lost does not in any case translate into Greece wanting to re-take it . It\\ 's gone , it belongs in the past . The only people that will tell you otherwise are ultra-nationalists which are by no means the majority of the population , or people poking the \ '' remove Kebab\ '' , \ '' Gib Istanbul\ '' , or \ '' 1453 was an inside job\ '' kind of meme fun . \\n\\n & gt ; Turks have zero interest in conquering Athens , while \ '' liberation of Constantinople\ '' has become a folk legend in Greece . Tell me one thing that Turks could find sentimental in Athens . I can find 9999 things from Turkey which are sentimental to an average Greek.\\n\\nQuit avoiding the topic and spiraling over the same bullshit argument . It\\ 's not a matter of it being Athens or Istabul . Turkey has officially claimed Greek land , while Greece hasn\\'t claimed Turkish land . It\\ 's very simple . Stop talking about Athens as if that removes the fact that the Turkish government has talked about islands under occupation . It\\ 's making you sound bad.\\n\\n & gt ; Your defense minister actually tried to revive the crisis of Imia again.\\n\\nHow ? If i remember correctly it was your armed forces general Hulusi Akar that did that by sailing on the islands at the \ '' crisis\\ 's anniversary\ '' . Our minister flew over the islands right after that . If anything it was your side that tried to revive the crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; Come on man , do not expect me to believe this , come on ! If one half of a Greek\\ 's heart lies under Parthenon , other half lies under Hagia Sophia . I have been to your country dude , I have Greek friends . I know you guys . I am from fucking Smyrna myself , I can hear your radios here , we are that close to each other . No need to say things like \ '' No Greek cares about Constantinople\ '' , come on.. Is that why it has become a religious folk tale ? \\n\\nThe religious folk tale has been there since 1453 . I explained in my previous comment . Yes people are sensitive about Constantinople cause it used to be our old \ '' capital\ '' . That would be the case with many nations . It\\ 's a significant part of our history is that\\ 's expected . But like i explained , very few people actually want to retake it . Every sane Greek realizes that it\\ 's a thing of the past . Would it be cool if we retook it ? Sure . Wouldn\\'t it be cool for you guys if something happened and expanded in Greece ? Yes , how would that be bad for you ? Does that mean that your majority wants to take Athens ? No . You do however have claims over other parts . \\n\\n & gt ; By whom ? NATO , yes . USA would prevent that . By average people ? No . As I said , half of their hearts are under Hagia Sophia . It is a very important figure for a Greek.\\n\\nNo , i\\ 'm talking internally . Any government that would suggest that would automatically crumble . Simply put , Greece doesn\\'t pursue any kind of conflict or idea of occupation . It\\ 's just the country\\ 's mentality . Kind of like with Germany . Perhaps it\\ 's weird for you to understand that cause you\\ 're from Turkey ( and i\\ 'm not saying this as an insult , but Turkey\\ 's policy is quite different ) .\\n\\n & gt ; One is a populist speech given to get votes ( and not done jack shit on later ) while the other is a common belief in Greece which you are denying for some reason.\\n\\n\ '' Just a populist speech to get votes\ '' ... I can just imagine Hitler being all like \ '' We need to exterminate the Jews and conquer more lands ! ! \ '' and Germans being like \ '' calm down guys , he\\ 's just saying that to collect votes , it\\ 's all good , nothing to worry about\ '' . See what i\\ 'm saying ? Populist speech or not , it establishes the idea and precedent if you like , that there are islands that Greece is occupying which is retarded , and this can be used now or in the future accordingly . So while you might perceive is as a populist speech , Greece doesn\\'t care . It affects her directly.\\n\\nAs for the common belief , i\\ 'm telling you that you\\ 're taking an emotional bond about a city and you\\ 're translating it to a desire by the majority to retake that city , which is pure bullshit .",Greek,Greek

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"This is a bump after a long time but i had to say this is a spot on description , at least based on how i see the situation of the time . \\n\\nGreece wasn\\'t really in danger of being part of the Eastern block since Stalin had already \ '' abandoned\ '' it to the West sphere of influence . It could have been communist but not USSR communist . Would things have been better or worse ? Hard to tell for sure . But i believe that a country has the right to explore that possibility and decide which path to take itself , something that the British denied Greece at that time by force of arms . \\n\\nThe key points are : a ) like you said EAM was definitely leftist but it was not hardcore communist in its majority . Even many right-wing people sided with them because they saw what EAM did for Greece during the occupation , and the alternative was far from saints as well . \\n\\nb ) EAM wasn\\'t anti-west , it was anti-western meddling as you pointed out about the king . They had every desire to work with the Allies like they did during the occupation but they wouldn\\'t trade one occupation with another ( British ) , nor would they want to reinstall monarchy . The Greeks were free to decide what to do with their country and for better or worse the majority was pro-EAM , yet the British couldn\\'t let Greece slip to communism so they intervened and actually supported the nazi collaborators , the very same people they had been fighting during the occupation , and turned against their former allies of EAM . \\n\\nc ) EAM never sought to stop the British when it could . They could have marched into Athens and secured it before the British arrived and the British would have a REALLY tough time fighting them there , yet the EAM stood and let the British enter Athens not seeking confrontation . Even Churchill couldn\\'t believe it . \\n\\nIt\\ 's a largely unknown story but to many Greeks this was a betrayal by the UK . Many will argue that it turned out better this way cause Greece avoided communism but the ends don\\'t always justify the means and when another country forcefully dictates what kind of government you\\ 'll have , it\\ 's just always crappy.\\n\\nAlso thanks for the recommendation of the book , i\\ 'll definitely give it a try .",Greek,Greek

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"Strategists don\\'t typically abandon their main objective . The objective there was not the Dutch soldiers but the civilians . It is a matter of strategy when you wiggle around in order to better pursue your main objective with the best results , not when you pull a 360 and you help in killing the ones you were supposed to fucking protect . The Dutch didn\\'t simply retreat to a better position to defend a more important camp or something . They actually made a deal to hand over the civilians and then escape.\\n\\nWhat i\\ 'm still unsure about is whether Karremans acted alone or followed a direct order from command . If he did acted alone and handed the civilians to Mladic , then yes , the soldiers are to blame too . When dealing with massacres or situations that indirectly make you responsible it\\ 's not just the officer\\ 's burder but also that of the soldiers following orders , as unfortunate as that might be . \\n\\n & gt ; Somehow it\\ 's the fault of the soldiers though , true story . Let\\ 's airdrop 300 Greek soldiers in bumfuck Africa and tell them to protect 8.000 people without support or supplies . See how well that goes for you.\\n\\nThey would be expected to do their duty as well . If they handed the civilians to the enemy , they\\ 'd also be partly responsible for their fate . \\n\\n & gt ; Nice example . So Leonidas allowed other Greek forces to retreat and set up defenses while he bought time eh ? That does not apply to the Srebrenica situation at fucking all.\\n\\nLeonidas could also have thought \ '' even if the Persians pass through the gates , they\\ 're too fucking many.. we can\\'t defend against that . fuck it , let\\ 's save our lives instead , it\\ 's more practical\ '' .

Using your mentality every battle in which you\\ 're outnumbered and outguned is a doomed case and a no-win situation but history proves you wrong there . Sometimes it\\ 's smart to retread a pick a better fight . That\\ 's not the case when you have to protect civilians and instead you hand them over choosing your life instead.\\n\\n & gt ; And throwing grenades at soldiers . How strange soldiers don\\'t want to defend you if you throw grenades at them.\\n\\nWere the Bosniak civilians hiding in the camp , throwing grenades at the Dutch that were supposed to protect them ? \\n\\n & gt ; Why ?

That\\ 's my whole damn point.\\n\\n & gt ; We\\ 're basing it on emotion now ? That\\ 's the worst basis for punishment.\\n\\nLol a shitload of things come from \ '' emotion\ '' as you call it , or being a decent human being . The very purpose of the UN is based on that . Clearly that must be so strange to you since like you said above you don\\'t see a point for your government in taking part in peacekeeping operation of \ '' second grade civilians\ '' so i\\ 'm not surprised at all that you find emotion to be such a trivial thing.\\nCertain armies have values .",Greek,Greek

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"Well actually.. before the fall of the city the tensions between the east and the west were rather great mostly due to the two christian dogmas , catholicism and orthodoxy . The situation became worse because the East was hard pressed by the Ottomans and desired to gain help from the West but in order for that to happen , the schism between the two churches would have to be bridged . The Catholic church seeing the opportunity , basically demanded that the Orthodox church submitted entirely to the Catholic church and the Pope and adopt their doctrines .

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"& gt ; When Istanbul was occupied after the WW1 , christians ( both local and foreigners ) flocked to Hagia Sophia , trying to pray inside . Again and again they got permissions and support from British and pressured Ottoman Administration . They did this despite it being clear that it was a mosque and the Imperial Mosque at that . They came to our lands and spit on our face ( figuratively ) .\\n\\nFunny.. the exact same sentence can be said about when the Ottomans occupied or captured Constantinople . It was a church and you came to our lands and took em and spat in our faces by making it a mosque . See how it can be used both ways ? If you\\ 're basing your whole argument on \ '' they did it too first\ '' , you\\ 're wrong cause you did it first . Regardless , like i\\ 've mentioned before , both are wrong the way i see it . Turning a church into a mosque or a mosque into a church are both shitty and petty.\\n\\n & gt ; They were simply destroyed outright or left to disrepair ( for much of Ottoman heritage in Balkans , leaving it is same as destroying them ) .\\n\\nA lot of old small churches are left abandoned and without repairs as well . There\\ 's a shitload of them sometimes it\\ 's not possible to restore them all . There are many more important and bigger mosques that are being preserved in many countries however . That\\ 's not a justification for what Turkey is doing . Not repairing a mosque is nowhere near as insulting or provoking as converting it into a worship site for a different religion ( considering it\\ 's being done out of spite like you\\ 've admitted ) .\\n\\n & gt ; We can also preserve it as a mosque and my people can go and feel the same things as their ancestors did.\\n\\nThis is the problem with you people . You\\ 're talking about how preserving it as a moque is right cause of your ancestors as if you built the place . You merely found it there , it already existed almost 1000 years before it was \ '' yours\ '' so your argument is hollow . It was basically a church for way longer than it was/is a mosque . Your ancestors used to pray there and other ancestors used to pray when it was a church ( and for longer ) . \\n\\n & gt ; Taking it and turning it into a zoo ( not much different ) \\n\\nLol museums respect and protect their displays . Your ancestors destroyed much of the iconography in the church because it was christian . Talk about a zoo eh ? \\n\\n & gt ; Culture is something that lives , and continuing traditions for centuries while keeping to their original meaning is the thing we should do.\\n\\nIronic . Its original purpose was being a church . \\n\\n & gt ; I won\\'t say we cared about your heritage , we didn\\'t . For us it was same as any building . And that explosion also caused deaths of hundreds of people but I guess it was our fault for using \ '' gunpowder storage\ '' . I can understand that it was negligence but it was certainly not on purpose.\\n\\nActually yes it was on purpose . How do you \ '' accidentally\ '' store gunpowder in an ancient temple ? It was done to prevent the Venetians from bombarding Athens . That you don\\'t care about culture is evident . \\n\\n & gt ; I thought it was about history and culture but as you clearly show it is about symbolism . Those \ '' random irrelevant\ '' mosques are part of our history and they are the \ '' history and culture\ '' of Turkish people . Funny how you disregard them because of their size.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not symbolic it\\ 's a simple matter of monumanets comparisson . Will it be the same if the Blue Mosque and a random 25 square meter mosque in a village in Turkey are destroyed ? One is a marvel of architecture and a monument and the other is easily replaceable . Both the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque have a bigger impact in history and culture than your everyday church/mosque . Don\\'t play silly , you can tell the difference . \\n\\nAnyway like i said earlier and you admited yourself , this whole thing is pointless .

Drumgor,europe,"Greek here . My left-wing friend once told me he only hates Golden Dawn members and gypsies ( Roma ) . He was not joking . \\n\\nDuring the Ferguson riots all my friends would criticize the Americans for being so racist . When I pointed out how we Greeks treat Roma the answer I got back was : \ '' That\\ 's not the same thing at all , man . The gypsies are animals.\ '' Again , they were not kidding . That was a group of liberal Syriza voters , whose official party stance is very pro-minority , mind you.\\n\\nTo be fair to my friends , I have never met a Roma , who was not a criminal to some extent . Every time I\\ 've met a Roma it was either because he was begging , trying to steal or selling drugs , guns , protection , stolen goods or their children for sexual use . The community is poorly integrated and very resistant to police interference . \\n\\nThey rarely send their kids to school , which sort of creates a vicious circle as their only option ends up being crime . A teacher friend of mine , who works in one of their ghetto\\ 's high schools told me only about 5 % show up for class . She tried noting down and reporting her students\\ ' absences , only to have her car stolen and her life threatened with knives by 3 of her 13 year old students , who had only showed up once or twice before . She did , however , point out , that the tiny minority , that did attend school regularly , were very diligent students , bound for higher education.\\n\\nIt really doesn\\'t help that Roma are notorious for abusing racial discrimination laws . This has , in my limited personal experience , also been very true . It\\ 's impossible to arrest a Roma without him filing a report for police brutality . Attempts to enforce laws and periodic checks on their communities , particularly about child welfare laws , have also met with strong resistance on the grounds of the state interfering with their cultural traditions and identity . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all anecdotal , of course , not some statistical report .

I\\ 'm a layman myself , but here\\ 's a simple example . If a financial organization wanted to establish a presence in a country ( and therefore create jobs by opening offices there ) it would first estimate if it would be worth it . And the bigger market they\\ 'd be accessing the better for them . So , a country in the EU is an attractive place to found/expand such an organization.\\nThat\\ 's the argument for staying in the EU . The counter-argument in UK\\ 's case is that since UK\\ 's economy is large enough , said financial organization will want to have offices in the UK anyway .",Greek,Greek

When he said that the Greek side backed down on many drafts , MANY times , until they were offered reassurance that most of the differences have been solved and we are about to agree , only to have last minute massive demands added , I also believe him , because I have seen the drafts that he brought back to Greece , and they were not what he intended .

Elros_Gr,europe,You forget all the crime that accompanied Prohibition and the War on drugs .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Yes but is it working ? Honestly i dont know much about the prosecution of illegal drugs here in the EU.All i know is what the Swiss did .They didnt go after users , the opened clinics that would provide clean , good quality heroin , while helping the addicted people fit well into society.That worked.\\n\\nI may be wrong but the best way to eliminate harmful , addictive drugs is to lower the demand for them.The supply will follow suite .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Ah to be this young again ! !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Is it so simple though ? Will money be enough ? Is it a longterm solution ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"I dont advocate getting them in unchecked either.Remember they pass through here.\\n\\nI dont know.It just seems a bit inhumane to treat people needing help like pests.\\n\\nYes there are \ '' bad\ '' mixed with normal people , but still .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,You know what that means ! ! \\n\\nGet a bunch of sunscreen and roam the roads looking for Danes ( and other pink or white people ) to help !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Is it though ? How will they live ? Work ? Get educated ? Enjoy a normal life like we all deserve ? Maybe it could work short-term.\\n\\nBut to be honest , i dont think handing off the problem to someone else is going to solve much .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Lets be honest here.This doesnt solve the problem.It just moves it somewhere far from \ '' us\ '' .Out of sight , out of mind.\\n",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,\ '' your\ '' ? I dont want them .Take them : P,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Yes but they havent made it illegal for someone to buy.Making it expensive , limiting ads they all are really good measures .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"I am sorry but this reeks too much of isolationism.We are part of this world If we distance our selves from Its problems , it wont end well.\\n\\nJust look historically all the nations that tried it.Japan ( sakoku ) , China ( Ming & amp ; Qing ) , USSR , etc.I would prefer the EU last and not fall victim to same old shit .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I dont think this would work .European solidarity doesnt exist .The smaller ethnicities or poorer economies would get trampled .Look at whats happening with Greece .Even since the crisis started we have been looked down on and exploited ( the people of Greece not politicians ) . Yes we have made mistakes .We have partaken ( some of us ) in economic corruption .But the punishment is disproportionate to the crime .The majority of the bailout money has gone to European and greek banks .The people have seen none.Yet every once in a while the troika ( with the agreement of our politicians ) chokes our economy with more taxes and austerity measures .I am not an economist but less money ( fewer jobs ) / more taxes is a slow death . Maybe i am just bitter or a cynic .But if the European peoples want a federation use what happened/ is happening as an example to avoid ! \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b9 ( happy summer ) \\n,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Nope but making drugs illegal didnt solve anything.Instead of being given the treatment they need addicts are persecuted.Just look at how the Swiss handled their own heroin addiction epidemic.With humanity not persecution.And it worked .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Hey be careful.Under Aitna lies trapped the Titan Enceladus ( \u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 ) .Thats what causes the earthquakes ! ! ( We still use his name to denote when there is an earthquake . ),Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Hey something positive.I hope everything goes well !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,As i understand it economics and politics are a lot more complicated but you got some points right .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Whats up with Greece ? Only 2 % ? If we judge only by public schools ( most people here take private lessons to really learn a language ) we learn 2 foreign languages.English is conpulsory and then you choose either French or German depending on the school.\\n\\nWeird stats.\\n\\nEdit : I just checked.It says they only asked people older than 15 .We only get English and French/German lessons in high school which is 13-15.Maybe thats why the stats are so skewed .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I have no idea if such thing exists . But i dont know why it would .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"I would encourage anyone who has the time , to watch the whole interview.Its a bit over an hour on the Rubin Report channel.Might shed some ( more ) light on what happened/is happening in Greece .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Would be nice to be progressive about something for a change .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Considering the kind of people he puts in them they are propably more democratic than the rest of the country .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Because making things illegal makes people stop using them.Call USA and tell them the war on drugs is over ! Just make them illegal guys ... ... ... .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Yeah , unfortunately you cant blame others for people you elect . We know this , in Greece , all too well .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah wait till we get to July-August.I am going to be mean and say this has benefited our tourism industry quite a bit . I would feel a lot worse about saying this if they didnt cause this themselves .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Doesnt matter got tourists : P\\n,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,For universities they might leave.But we got 2-4 universities on islands.Jobs depends on How big it is .Crete for example produces quite a few things .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,The mainland is always cheaper than the islands.Most people stayed on their islands .It isnt expensive for the locals.They know where to go .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,God damn just look at the picture.What is he looking at a Greek ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Yeah same as all the other drugs.You lower use not by criminalising them , but by educating people and helping them quit .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Depends on where you went .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Maybe.But the Syrian conflict Cant last forever .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,The places where they are detained didnt . The rest did . Simple .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah i get what you are saying .I figured as much that most people are decent .Makes my decision to come live in Germany feel better.We fan learn from each other .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I see grandmas in Poland drive better vehicles than in Greece .Mine drove a donkey : /,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Not Greece ofc.The EU.Greece doesnt have enough political capital for this.But the EU as a whole does .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Oh cool.Anyone asked the Libyans ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Turkish news have become a nice pair to U.S.A. news .The latter is mind boggling violence while the former is mind boggling stupidity ! A surreal escape from the dying throes of our economy . Thank you guys : ),Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Sure hope so . You Never know with the internet,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah exactly .This map isnt too funny though.Stereotypes are funny If they have some truth to them .This map has little of it,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Finally.A less serious comment in this thread.Thank you for that ! \\n\\nOh ! And take THAT Habsburgs !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,What is it with purges and dictatorships ? What happened to firing someone ? No you get purged.GL in the gulags,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I dont think you should take there charts seriously .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Same with Greece.Adopting the EURO was a BIG mistake.We lost so much purchasing power with that .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Well the EURO is basically the Deutchmark .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I swear guys its the girth that matters not the length . Right ? RIGHT ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Hey thats cheating ! ! ! ! If thats how you wan na play i go up on Mt . Olympus and build a shack .BOOM you lose ! !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah.It sucks inhaling this shit for 25 years despite being a non-smoker.At the place where i learned English the teachers ( all women ) smoked so much that every time i passed outside of their office and went home my mother ( a smoker ) told me i reeked of cigarettes .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,To be fair refugees have also burned parts of their camp.2-3 weeks ago furstrated that their applications were taking so long they burned down the office that was processing them.Seems that noone likes the camps .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,How about we ban smoking altogether here.40 % of the population as smokers is really dropping life expectancy.Also the crisis didnt do us any favours ( less money to spend on homecooked meals=more junk food which is cheaper ) .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Of course not.I was just pointing out that there is a lot of frustration in and out of the camps.And i mean the refugees and the local populace , not the neo-nazis .",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"It must have been a tremendously proud day for the German people but that and what followed ( Germany humiliates France ( 1870 ) , France humiliates Germany ( 1918 ) , Germany humiliates France ( 1940 ) ) shows clearly that despite its flaws the EU is one of the best things to happen for Europeans.\\n\\nWhether is flourishes/improves or dies away its up to us .",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,I wont get worried till they announce they want to revive Stalin from his grave .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I think there is a pattern on this map .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"I can understand the bible a lot better .The iliad is in Homeric greek , a lot more difficult for us to understand .Dont forget Homer lived in the 9th or 8th century B.C.\\n\\nIf you are that interested or need it , you could try learning it .Not gon na be easy but Its worth it .I wish i had learned it better .Translations are fine but reading it in Its original form is exquisite .",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,So i guess Britain did us all a favour ? I guess injuring yourself while trying something can dissuade others from it !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Yes Brexit should become and official EU meme If it hasnt become already,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,If i had to guess Its because we have so many inhabited islands .And also some of those islands enjoy a lot of tourism .I looked up a catalogue of all the airports in Greece and i was amazed.Here is a link in english : https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_Greece \\n\\nGot to get those tourists to the beaches asap .How else can they turn red ?,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Just to rectify one thing about your post.While we wouldnt understand each other 100 % koine greek ( ancient ) is much closer to modern greek than shakespearean english is to modern english .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I am sorry but this isnt the USA .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Every country borrows bro .The trick is for the politicians to not be corrupt,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Fucking gankers man.Put some wards next time Poland .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Wth Turkey .Wow their politicians act like the little kid throwing a tantrum when its parents scolded it for putting shit in his mouth .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,2 reasons for this.Firstly they have been inhabited for many thousand years and secondly we got bad organisation .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"At this point just farming items . UK roaming trying to distract them , France hugging tower ( Maginot line ) , but that wont save her , Greece defending other tower but she just dies along with tower and China is on the other side of the map getting wrecked by Japan.Meanwhile USA is just farming items like crazy and giving some of them to the team .",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Golden Dawn wont win.Before the crisis they were nobodies.They have gained a lot of traction compared to before the crisis but they have proven with their actions that they are thugs.Sure there are some fascists or supremacists that believe what they preach but the majority of their voters are just disgruntled and desperate .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I am not saying its difficult.I am just saying that being poorer is generally lowers your food quality . A souvlaki costs 1.7-2.00 euros.But generally i agree with you .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,I wish i could say it feels good now that the tables have turned but no.Regional locking for videos is stupid.No logic behind it : /,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,Yeah for years the reasoning behind not returning them was we didnt have a proper museum .Guess what stands under the acropolis .And Its our best .Just dont eat at the cafeteria .The amount of money they charge you would think we are trying to finance a new Acropolis .Ahhh where are the days of the Delian League .Taking money from the common treasury to build the Parthenon .Our proficiency in economics was evident even 2000 years ago .Makes me proud ! !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,In Greece they always bring the water before even ordering .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,That seems a bit strange to me.Here in Greece they always bring water before you even order.Only places that dont do that are beerhouses .But there as well you will get free water If you ask for it .,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"Meuh not sure , Freddo Espresso is pretty dominant in Greece these days.Frappe is dying..",Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,I noticed the same in Hungary and Slovakia.I f you ever come to Greece though water is free everywhere .,Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,Yes indeed .There will be little charge as it will be passenger propelled .But you still pay for extra laguage.They use latest tech Its only fair they get compensated !,Greek,Greek
Elros_Gr,europe,"I was there last summer.It was really beautiful but the fact that you get charged 3 different times ( 1 for inside the church,1 for going up the belfry and 1 for going up the ramparts for photos ) was really fucking cheap on their part ...",Greek,Greek

Elros_Gr,europe,"I dont know If they are trying to \ '' destroy\ '' us.Its a bit extreme . \\n I can say a few things about Greece.We had been subjugated for more than a millenia ( Romans then Ottomans ) .We gained our independence less than 200 years ago.The new Greek state didnt hit the ground running.To this day most Greeks are still treating the state as we did the turkish pashas or Sultans.\\n\\n1 ) Hostile and repressing entity thats out to take our money , at the worst.\\n\\n2 ) Collaborator in making a quick profit by stealing money from taxes and securing jobs for your family in the public sector , if you bribe it with votes , at its best.\\n\\nNext we have our European \ '' allies\ '' and \ '' partners\ '' .There is no such thing ( talking about goverments here ) .Just profit to be made.Looking throughout history bad things come from the west for Greece ( generally ) .Siemens has been bribing our politicians for years ( a scandal broke out in Greece a few years back ) .Our minister of Defence ( Tsohatzopoulos ) famously corrupt took bribes and bought German submarines that werent fuctioning properly.Greece ( along side other Countries ) forgave the German debt after WW2 so Germany could grow , yet they refuse to do the same with us.\\n\\nMy point is not to put blame on the German people ( or any other peoples ) .I am not looking for a scapegoat.We as Greeks need to change some of our mentalities that lead us here.We ( some of us ) voted for corrupt politicians , profited ( shorterm ) from it and now we pay for it.But in my view the punishment is a bit harsh for the crime.Our economy is dying.We are having a third exodus ( first in the 1920\\ 's ,2nd in the 1960\\ 's ) of people.Many people are suffering from poverty and we are being painted as the black sheep , that despite Its good friends efforts just wont walk straight.\\n\\nI may sound a bit bitter but the E.U . is starting to look as a good way for Countries with strong economies to walk all over weaker ones.No \ '' solidarity\ '' .With both crisis ( economic and immigrant ) we are being thrown under the bus again and again.And I am a proponent of the EU.\\n\\nTo conclude I believe that should we change we can stop the rest of our \ '' allies\ '' Taking advantage of our weakness.And have a country thats good for everyone who wishes it to live in .",Greek,Greek

Unknown to pilot Zivi Nedivi and his copilot , the right wing was sheared off roughly two feet ( 60 cm ) from the fuselage . The A-4 disintegrated and its pilot safely ejected , while the F-15 nosed down and entered a violent roll . Zivi decided to attempt recovery and engaged afterburner to increase speed . He was able to prevent stalling and maintain control due to the lift generated by the large horizontal surface area of the fuselage , the stabilators , and remaining wing areas . The F-15 landed at twice the normal speed to maintain the necessary descent and its tailhook was torn off during the landing . Zivi managed to bring his F-15 to a stop approximately 20 ft ( 6 m ) from the end of the runway . He was later quoted as saying \ '' It\\ 's highly likely that if I would have seen it clearly , I would have ejected ... \ '' ; leaking fuel along the wing had obstructed visibility of the wing itself .

( The term \ '' haircut\ '' refers to the losses that private investors would incur on the current net value of their Greek bond holdings . ) Merkel\\ 's fear was that Athens would be unable to overcome its problems even with an additional haircut , since it would not be able to handle the remaining debt . Furthermore , she doubted that sending financial experts to Greece would be of much help in bringing the financial system there under control . Within the German cabinet , Finance Minister Wolfgang Schnaeuble alone continued to strongly back another haircut , despite Merkel\\ 's efforts to rein him in , while France and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso were seen to be in favor of a gentler approach . European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet was solidly opposed , with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde described as undecided on the issue . Finally , Merkel believed that action must be taken to enact a Financial Transaction Tax ( FTT ) ; doing so next year , she assessed , would be a major step toward achieving some balance in relief for banks . In that regard , the Germans thought that pressure could be brought to bear on the U.S. and British governments to help bring about an FTT.\\n\\n\\nUnconventional\\n\\nGerman leadership\\n\\nG/OO/526362-11 , 181753Z\\nhttps : //wikileaks.org/nsa-germany/\\n\\nAbout the private bond holders hair cut and how destructive that was for our economy you will find ( and lots more ) info here : \\n\\nhttp : //www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/080715/we-underestimated-their-power-greek-government-insider-lifts-lid-five-months-humiliation-and-blackm ? page_article=1\\n\\n\ '' The part of the second programme of the agreement of 2012 , after the haircut of the PSI [ Private Sector Involvement ] , which was about 170 billion euros , 50 billion out of that was for the recapitalisation of the banks . Of course , there was another problem . From the PSI , the public funds suffered losses almost , if not more , in their own reserves . Why ? Because they were forced under the law to save their cash reserves with the Bank of Greece , and the Bank of Greece had the right to use these funds to buy bonds on their behalf.\\n\\nFor me it was a big scandal because apparently what happened was a lot of politicians , bankers , a lot of people went and gave - they had bonds that they had bought 20 % - they went and they gave it to the Greek Central Bank , Bank of Greece , 100 % , they got their money and then the haircut comes to the public.\\n\\nBasically , what they were forced to do was to use their cash reserves , social security funds , pension funds , in order to buy government bonds that were going to be cut in real terms around 70 % in present value . So the funds right now , the pension funds , are facing a bigger problem than the banks are facing . The pension funds have to plan 15 to 20 years ahead to be able to pay pensions , when the aging population is increasing and the working population is decreasing . They also have to pay unemployment benefits and so on . So , all these debt locks came to the front now.\ ''",Greek,Greek

There were almost two years that EZ did nothing for that ( famous Merkel feet dragging ) and the crisis got out of control ( vultures took advantage , rates had gone over 30 % .\\nb ) Troika intervenes to save the day . We know that the chose the harsh austerity path ( which is debatable if it was correct ) . The austerity measures were severe and based on wrong multipliers . That made the crisis even worse . In fact this experience was what saved Portugal and Spain to have such strict austerity.\\nc ) as many sources reveal ( even wikileaks ) it was know that the programs would never work without debt restructuring/cut . Still the same incomplete and false programs were impemented up tilll now . \\nd ) We now know that Schaeuble at least since 2012 thought it was a good idea to let greece burn and use it as an example to scare other . Hence no real intention was there to help the situation.\\ne ) debt structuring is something that was put on the table very recently . Largely because of syriza behavior . Had we have the old government they would continue to follow wrong programs until they\\ 'd face an absolute and inevitable dead end.\\n\\nAs far as the IMF , we now know that with the strict austerity they\\ 'd proposed they did also proposed a debt cut . They reatret from that , because of EZ ( German ) pressure . In fact they acted as an EU body and not an independent one . \\n\\nHere are few interesting links on that : \\n\\n\ '' IMF has betrayed its mission in Greece , captive to EMU creditors\\nThe IMF\u2019s Original Sin in Greece was to let Dominique Strauss-Kahn hijack the institution to save Europe\\ 's banks and the euro when the crisis erupted , dooming Greece to disaster.\ '' \\nhttp : //www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/IMF-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-Greece-captive-to-EMU-creditors.html\\n\\n\ '' How the IMF doomed Greece to disaster and put its own future in doubt\ '' \\nhttp : //business.financialpost.com/investing/how-the-imf-doomed-greece-to-disaster-and-put-its-own-future-in-doubt ? __lsa=dc7f-9a52\\n\\n\ '' An amazing mea culpa from the IMF\u2019s chief economist on austerity\ '' \\n\\nhttp : //www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/03/an-amazing-mea-culpa-from-the-imfs-chief-economist-on-austerity/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Greek,Greek

[ 80 ] \\n\\nMost of the differences in the revised budget deficit numbers were due to a temporary change of accounting practices by the new government , i.e. , recording expenses when military material was ordered rather than received . [ 81 ] However , it was the retroactive application of ESA95 methodology ( applied since 2000 ) by Eurostat , that finally raised the reference year ( 1999 ) budget deficit to 3.38 % of GDP , thus exceeding the 3 % limit . This led to claims that Greece ( similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy ) [ 82 ] had not actually met all five accession criteria , and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through \ '' falsified\ '' deficit numbers.\\n\\nIn the 2005 OECD report for Greece , [ 83 ] it was clearly stated that \ '' the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP ; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3 % in 1999 , the year of [ Greece\\ 's ] EMU membership qualification\ '' . The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3 % limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece\\ 's application , and thus the criteria had been met . [ 84 ] \\n\\nThe original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with Eurostat recommendations , theoretically lowering even the ESA95-calculated 1999 Greek budget deficit to below 3 % ( an official Eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999 ) .\\n\\nAn error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece\u2019s Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives\u2019 deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits . A currency swap arranged with Goldman Sachs allowed Greece to \ '' hide\ '' 2.8 billion Euros of debt , however , this affected deficit values after 2001 ( when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone ) and is not related to Greece\u2019s Eurozone entry . [ 85 ] \\n\\nA study of the period 1999\u20132009 by forensic accountants has found that data submitted to Eurostat by Greece , among other countries , had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation ; \ '' Greece with a mean value of 17.74 , shows the largest deviation from Benford\\ 's law among the members of the eurozone , followed by Belgium with a value of 17.21 and Austria with a value of 15.25\ '' .
