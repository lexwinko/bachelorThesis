The west had invaded USSR in 1918 and USSR was allied with Nazi Germany until 1941 ( Molotov-Ribbentrop ) . & gt ; as soon as facism was removed Fascism was never `` removed '' .

ACircledSquare,todayilearned,"Not blaming it on Bush per se but giving free money willy nilly to everyone with high interest rates kind of reminds me the housing bubble . Anywho here are some sources . https : //carybankruptcy.com/blog/are-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy & gt ; After graduation , college students sometimes find themselves earning less money than expected and monthly student loan payments can quickly become quite troublesome . As stated above , ordinarily student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , but filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection may offer some assistance if graduates find themselves falling behind on student loan payments . Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects borrowers from having to repay student loans during the pendency of the chapter 13 plan . & gt ; & gt ; The only way a debtor can discharge either federally subsidized or private student loans is to prove that that repaying the student loan debt would impose an undue hardship . This is done by filing an adversary proceeding ancillary to the debtor ’ s bankruptcy case . The Brunner test is currently used in the Fourth Circuit , which includes the Eastern District of North Carolina , and requires that three conditions be met . First , the debtor must prove that a minimal standard of living can not be maintained while repaying the student loans . Second , other conditions must exist that suggest that the debtor ’ s poor financial circumstances will persist for a large percentage of the student loan repayment period . Finally , the debtor must prove that a good faith effort has been made to repay the loans prior to filing for bankruptcy . Fulfilling all of these requirements is difficult , but not impossible . http : //www.totalbankruptcy.com/overview/basics/student-loans-in-bankruptcy.aspx- - & gt ; Generally speaking , student loans are non-dischargeable debts that can not be eliminated through bankruptcy ; however , there are some rare exceptions . & gt ; & gt ; Prior to the bankruptcy law change in 2005 , student loans owed to private non-profit institutions were dischargeable , but the new bankruptcy law closed that exception . & gt ; & gt ; Currently , the only way to eliminate student loans in a bankruptcy is to file an adversary with the bankruptcy court and demonstrate that the student loans impose an `` undue hardship '' on you or your dependents . & gt ; & gt ; To learn whether your student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy , fill out the below form to talk to one of our sponsoring bankruptcy lawyers for free : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; The `` Undue Hardship '' Exception & gt ; & gt ; Bankruptcy judges have interpreted the `` undue hardship '' exception very favorably towards student loan lenders , and disability or other extreme circumstances are typically required to successfully eliminate student loans . & gt ; & gt ; A majority of jurisdictions require you to demonstrate the following : & gt ; & gt ; Repayment of the student loan would prevent you from maintaining an adequate standard of living & gt ; Your financial situation is unlikely to improve & gt ; You have made a good faith effort to repay the student loan & gt ; Adversary proceedings to determine the dischargeability of student loans can resemble a `` mini-trial '' and can be very time-consuming and complex . & gt ; & gt ; Accordingly , legal fees can be substantial and difficult to afford , especially for someone facing `` undue hardship '' . & gt ; & gt ; Chapter 13 and Student Loans & gt ; & gt ; Student Loans can be included in the 3-5 year repayment plan of your Chapter 13 bankruptcy , but you will be responsible for any remaining balance upon the completion of your bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; Anywhere from 10 % to 100 % of your student loan may be included in your bankruptcy , depending on your assets , debts , and income . & gt ; & gt ; Including your student loans in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers many protections and may provide you with short-term relief from collection activity . & gt ; & gt ; While you are in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , the student loan creditors are prohibited from adding any interest or penalties to your pre-petition debt and can not garnish your wages or place liens on your property . & gt ; & gt ; You can also request that the bankruptcy court make a final determination on the proper amount owed if there is a dispute as to the correct balance of the student loan . & gt ; & gt ; Speak to a Bankruptcy Lawyer Today & gt ; Student Loan Eligibility After Bankruptcy & gt ; & gt ; Generally speaking , a bankruptcy filing will not affect your eligibility for federal student loans . & gt ; & gt ; These government loans are based on need , not credit , and federal lenders are prohibited from denying a student loan solely based on your bankruptcy determination . & gt ; & gt ; However , federal lenders are allowed to consider your credit history since the bankruptcy when determining your willingness to repay the loan . They may also deny a request for further loans if your student loan is in default and not included in a repayment plan . & gt ; & gt ; Private student loan lenders may consider a previous bankruptcy filing when determining eligibility . & gt ; & gt ; Maintaining good credit after bankruptcy , repaying old student loans , and demonstrating a steady income are all factors that could influence a private lender to grant you a student loan even after a bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; A parent 's bankruptcy filing generally does not affect their children 's eligibility for a student loan , unless they are required as a cosigner on the loan . & gt ; & gt ; Debt After Graduation & gt ; & gt ; Of those students who do take out loans to finance their undergraduate education , some studies show that the average student loan debt is $ 20,000 . While most loans allow for a grace period for recent graduates , the likelihood of finding a full-time position that pays well enough for recent graduates to pay their loan bills is becoming increasingly slim . & gt ; & gt ; Advocates for student loan reform say that by eliminating subsidies to private lenders , the government will be able to make more Pell grants for low-income students while offering loans with fairer terms for those who require them . & gt ; & gt ; The above summary is by no means all-inclusive and is not legal advice . For the latest information on bankruptcy and student loans , speak to a bankruptcy attorney in your area . & gt ; & gt ;",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Can you please correct any miss understanding I may have for ZFS and GlusterFS ? Two identical servers with twi drives partitioned with ZFS . We use ZFS because ZFS is a good substitute for LVM , it also incorporates a form if its own version of RAID . But we want to take it a step further and user GlusterFS . We want to do this so we can offer the ZFS drives over the network and but also because we want replication of data in case of a major failure . This way if Server1 is completely destroyed , we can default to Server2 and still have access to the same data stored in the ZFS volumes . And here are my questions , conclusions . - ZFS offers a huge degree of scalability . By adding glusterfs we ensure redundant drives available across the network . - GlusterFS is NOT a filesystem ( like NFS , ext4 etc ) are . It is technology that offers redundancy . - GlusterFS is not to be confused with NFS , even though they are similarities . NFS is a filesystem that is available across the network ( similar as a Samba share ) . It is that and nothing else . On the other hand GlusterFS offers whatever filesystem you want to share ( can be ext4 , ext3 , btrfs ) across the network and it also allows for a huge degree of redundancy .

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,Hello folks . The environment is running on Centos 6 and 7.1 and 7.2 I am dealing with a repo that does not have the open-vm-tools rpm package . Syncing the repos so we can get the newest packages is simply not an option . Not for now at least . So what we want to do is the following : - wget the open-vm-tools for each release of Centos . - Copy it in the update directory - Run createrepo -- update on the update directory only . Is this going to work ? I am concerned about running the `` createrepo -- update '' command on the update directory only . Does n't the RPM database need to be aware about the packages on the other directories ? Not sure . This is a highly customized environment by the way . Thank you .,Greek,Greek

I am trying to setup replication of specific tables in PostgreSQL , like I used to do in one of my previous jobs while working with MS-SQL It appears as though this type of replication is not supported right out of the box with PostgreSQL . Is this correct ? At any rate , is this something worth going after in PostgreSQL or it is dangerous territory since it is not a `` out of the box '' feature ? Thank you .",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,Database,"Hello folks . I have worked for 6 years in a shop which I had to setup replication with MS-SQL in numerous customer sites . I was able to specify which tables I wanted to replicate and it was very straight forward to do so . However , what I am noticing in PostgreSQL , MySQL and possibly Oracle ( I have n't checked ) it does n't seem to be a straight forward process . It appears as if PostgreSQL and MySQL do not offer support right out of the box for these kinds of features . Is this kind of replication something that should be even attempted with these database engines ? Am I wrong ? Any thoughts ?",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Hello folks . So this week I have been playing around with HA and it has been great to say the least . I created two HAproxy servers with keepalived and they work . However I discovered that if for example on ServerA ( which would be the master/active server ) the HAproxy dies , keepalived has no way of knowing this and as a result it will still keep accepting requests and forward them to the Master server which no longer has HAProxy running . How would you deal with such a possible issue ? Having Nagios and monitoring tools is great but recovery should be done with extreme speed in situations like these . Did I miss something on the configuration of HAproxy ?",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You see , for me at least , this move that you are doing ( and let 's be clear I have nothing against you , I 'm sure you 're a nice bloke ) , the move that takes us **from what is constitutionally right , to what is politically right , ** Yes , because in this specific paragraph we are talking if Greeks are more or less naive than other nations and if so should people address it by doing an introspection of the events that were unfolded . You mentioned in your previous post `` You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves.. '' You somehow mix expressing one 's political opinion about the competence of the state as being anti-democratic . Now if the people were lied or were told half truths , that is a whole different debate and history will pass its final judgement . & gt ; How is it crass to say that people died in order to have true and proper elections in this country ? You said in your previous post `` but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey '' . & gt ; When it comes to serious issues , I have n't . As we are both members of the human race , allow me to not believe you when you say that you never , ever said in your life a comment that was just sarcastic and with no real substance . & gt ; According to him , all Greek governments are incompetent . That 's a ridiculous claim to make . Even I would n't make that claim . But , the governments , in any country do n't appear out of thin air , people vote for them . So , to say that X government is incompetent , would beg two questions : a ) for whom is this government incompetent and b ) what does this tell us about the electorate ? We are basically saying the same thing . The only difference is I have no qualms in saying the Government is complete idiotic because I do not directly associate the Government with its people . For example , I do not view Greeks are incompetent because they voted for Syriza , even though I view Syriza incompetent . Do I place blame to all of us Greeks for the cluster fuck of the last 45 years ? Yes I do , we should have known better and we did know better but this does n't mean I view Greeks as incompetent . I just view it as Greeks have to get their shit together . & gt ; I challenge you to find a single piece of evidence that the Greek debt was caused by the ordinary Greeks , and not by financial institutions , or dodgy deals . I will argue that financial institutions , or dodgy deals of course are at the core of the problem . However , to say that Greek citizens are not responsible as well is naive . Not paying your taxes , feeding into clientism are two examples of how Greek citizens fucked shit up as well . Of course you can argue that tax evation is a result of Governmental policies which then comes back to what you were saying , people elect their governments and should follow the policies of the Government they elected . If they are not happy then the people should change how things are done , as much as they can because I do realize corporate powers behind the scenes are sometimes extremely powerful .",Greek,Greek
ACircledSquare,greece,"& gt ; You may like it , or not , but saying that a Greek government is incompetent , is like saying that the Greek people are willing to be lead by an incompetent government , and hence that the Greek people are incompetent themselves . Every `` red line '' Siriza said would not be crossed , has been crossed . This new deal is even worst than before . Siriza was always saying about plan B and as it turns out it plan B never existed . Does this make Greeks incompetent or naive ? I would say no more than any other country that has been lied to by their politicians . So please , stop taking it so personally . & gt ; I do n't know where you 're from , or in what culture you 've grown in , but rest assured that the Greeks care about politics , much more than Hans from Wuppertal , or George from New Jersey This is such a crass thing to say . How do you know if people in other countries care less or more about politics in their country ? Do you also understand that people in Democratic societies have shed blood for their right to vote and for their right to be free ? Funny you would mention about New Jersey but ... `` New Jersey played a significant role in the Revolutionary War . George Washington spent more time in New Jersey than anywhere else during the war . New Jersey 's strategic location made it a center of Revolutionary War activity . '' http : //www.revolutionarywarnewjersey.com/ & gt ; And also , perhaps you could have been more respectful to the people that voted for the current government ... ..but what you 're saying is simply ignorant , ridiculous , and **anti-democratic** I do n't understand this . Yes the comment of the previous poster may have been a sarcastic comment with no real substance but tell me who has n't done this before ? Are you going to tell me you have n't done it either ? Also , why do you demand a more respectful tone to what he wants to say ? Why do you view his tone as `` anti-democratic '' ? Why such an attachment to a Government ? As long as no hate speech is involved , who dictates what and how people express themselves . Democracy is messy , it is loud , it is difficult . And you know why it is difficult because we have to put up with each other 's opinions . Show respect how ? By expressing our thoughts in a pre-determined manner which is not `` anti-democratic '' ? Who sets the rules for that ? Do you even understand that Democracy allows for freedom of expression ? Who puts the guideline of what `` anti-democratic '' is ? A sarcastic comment is anti-democratic ? Prehaps a satire is anti-democratic as well ? It appears your post is just pure emotion , the same way Syriza handled the situation with Greece . And just in case you accuse me of being pro ND or pro PASOK , let me stop you by saying that this bullshit for a mess has been brewing up for 40-45 years and to say that Greeks have no responsibility is just naive . Are we to run away from criticizing our selves even if it is in the form of sarcastic comments , satire or just a calm conversation ? How is what the previous poster said `` anti-democratic '' .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,Scholar,Thank you so much ! I really appreciate it : ),Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,budgetfood,"Total protein is one part of the picture . First of all , 26g of protein is too little for a grown man . There are plenty of articles discussing this issue . Menno Henselmans from Bayesian Bodybuilding has done a [ great review ] ( http : //bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/ ) of the recent literature . The take away message here is that the optimal amount of protein is 1.8g per kg . So compounding that factor in , if a 70kg man only gets his protein from oats he would have to eat 3000 calories worth of oats . Not something that I would call practical or healthy for that matter . Additioally , another factor you do n't take into account is that oats are n't a complete source of protein . For the layman that means that , oats lack some of the essential amino acids and thus they should be paired with a more complete source . So do n't get me started on spinach which has only a measly 3g of protein per 100g . If you have any questions I would be happy to answer and/or provide my references .",Greek,Greek

That 's understandable . I do n't doubt that genuity of these emotions . Sure if somebody was in the place of the kid you mentioned in your example , they would feel like shit . However , think let 's think of another example . Say there is a couple on the night out , and the husband notices someone on another table staring at his wife . He feels jealous and threatened and proceeds to punch the other guy . The husband felt like shit , but was his reaction justified just because he felt that way ?

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"& gt ; I do n't mean to be rude but none of these are good examples . No worries , I do n't mind . Being wrong just means that there is room for improvement : ) I brought up public smoking as an example not because it harms the smoker 's health , rather it harms people who choose not to smoke in the first place . In this situation some smokers played the victim because they thought that they were being oppressed but in reality , they were being oppressive . Pre ban if you asked someone to blow out their cigarette , it was n't that uncommon to receive a `` go fuck yourself '' as an answer . As far as the other example , I think you are right . However , sometimes our feelings are not justified because , well they are feelings . If I feel I am being controlled , it does n't necessarily mean that I am being controlled .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"There seems to be some short of synergy between instant gratification and avoiding negative emotions .

There is a huge difference between instant gratification and happiness , but most people do n't seem to grasp that .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"& gt ; I 'd need a concrete example to give a more pointed opinion on this One example is smoking . As I said earlier , some smokers got pretty upset when it was banned and blamed the government as well as the people who were pro-ban . Another one would be people who do n't want to work out because they feel forced to do so . More like a knee jerk reaction really . Like children who do n't eat their greens .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Maybe I was n't clear enough . Let me clarify . Although u/styder_hiru did make a reference to people with mental issues in his post , my answer was directed at the general public . As I said earlier , it would be foolish to blame someone for having a mental health issue . It is n't in their control after all . Reading the original post , you will see that I intentionally did n't make a reference to people with disorders . Rather , I mentioned people with insecurities . Being insecure about yourself is not the same thing as being anorexic . Yes , there is some overlap and people with anorexia display extreme insecurity . But it is more of a spectrum than just absolutes .

These people should be treated by a professional , and obviously not buying magazines is n't going to do them any good . I am not a mental health professional so giving out advice to people that obviously need one would be incredible irresponsible . If you read the original post more carefully you would realise that it mainly targeted people that avoid exercise . Avoiding exercise is not the same as suffering from body dysmorphia . And while we are at it , you might benefit if you see a professional yourself . Blaming projection is a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder .

There is no incentive in that other than profit . Feelgood generates publicity for the media , twinkies make money for the sugar lobby . That 's one thing though . People tend to blame others for their maladies . For example , they keep blaming muscle magazing for their unrealistic standards . Well then , do n't buy that magazine . How is the magazine hurt by you not working out ? When smoking on public spaces was banned in my country , many smokers would bitch that society should be more tolerant and that the government was infringing their rights .

AgentErgoloid,electronic_cigarette,"Hey there everyone , Kinda new to this game . I 've been smoking hookah for about 8 years and I am looking for something that can emulate it . Mainly looking for something can produce thick clouds , and a strong buzz with clean flavor . A couple of years back I bought a kangertech evod for a relative who wanted to quit smoking . They were n't to fond of it so they gave it back to me . Since then I 've been using it on and off whenever I ca n't be bothered to set up my hookah , but it pales in comparison to the qualities mentioned above . I did some more reading on the subject and it seems like I need something that can provide a lot of power along with a sub-ohm tank . However , I do n't want to spend a ton of money on it , in case it turns out to be like the evod . So , all in all I 've been thinking about getting the eGo One . Looks like a decent kit at an affordable price . Do you have any other suggestion around the 50€ mark ? EDIT : In the end I got a Smok stick one plus that I found on sale .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Abstract Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass . Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs , the principle of specificity , which states that adaptations are specific to the nature of the applied stimulus , dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others . Research is lacking , however , as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains . The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program versus a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects . 17 young men were randomly assigned to either an HT group that performed 3 sets of 10RM with 90 seconds rest or an ST group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with 3 minutes rest . After 8 weeks , no significant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii . Significant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat . In conclusion , this study showed both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size , but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24714538/",Greek,Greek

The physical keys worked fine and I was even able to open the task manager ( albeit I could n't shut down any application ) or open the camera app . This would happen 2-3 times per week and a simple restart would always solve it . However that was n't the case yesterday . At some point during the night I woke up and decided to set my alarm because I had forgotten doing so earlier . At this point the very same problem that I describe above happened again . Not thinking much about it , I thought that a simple restart would solve it as per usual . That was n't the case though . Even after restarting the phone the problem persisted . I then decided to try and hold the power button for 10s until the phone vibrated three times . To my surprise , it was n't effective even thought whatever problem occured in the past would always be resolved that way . Next up , I decided that I should try and back up the phone data , before trying anything else . Thankfully I did n't face any problem during the procedure and I was able to back up everything . The next two things on my list were the 3 button hard reset and a firmware downgrade . None of these things proved to be effective . I am thinking that this is related to faulty hardware , and more specifically faulty digitizer . What are your thoughts about this issue ? Thanks a lot .",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,ecr_eu,"Lately I 've been trying to break into the eliquid sector by approaching shop owners , sadly there is no appreciation for creativity since most of them ask for clones . Risk aversion is a constant as they do n't have much room for error , in case a batch does n't have the expected sales . But this is completely understandable . Times are tough . I did some digging a while back for an unrelated purchase . Turns out that because ELTA has n't been profitable for some time now , they outsourced custom checking to a private company . So this where the additional 15 EUR go to , if an item is taxed ( 15 EUR plus 24 % VAT for items deemed to worth between 22 and 1000 EUR , if my memory serves me right ) . I do n't know exactly what 's their policy regarding specific item categories , but for what is worth there was a post about a month old , on a very well known Greek technology related forum , that some guy stated that he was taxed around 50 EUR for a bunch of comic books . The original price was below 20 EUR . There was another guy on the same thread , who was also called to pay an additional 50 EUR for 3 or 4 video game cartridges . He also , originally paid below 20 . In case you can provide proof that the item cost you less , than what they estimated , you can apply for a second check . But it takes about a month and it will cost you an additional 10 EUR , however there is a chance that you wo n't be charged since the law has gone back and forth a couple of times already . If your order comes from an EU member state , then forget everything I said . On the other hand , if it comes from a elsewhere , prepare for a long wait and additional fees . Personally , I think I 'll take my chances with the SMM Serpent . It 's on flash sale on GearBest for 19 EUR .",Greek,Greek

For example , I placed an order on 27/7 . It reached Greece , on 2/8 . Delivery was a couple of days ago , 10/9 if my memory serves me right . I do n't place the blame on FastTech of course .

If you put a bucket of warm water outside , and that warm water just happened to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit , but the outdoor temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit , the water would cool down . That 's because the outdoor temperature , while still warm , is cooler than the temperature of the water . Heat naturally flows from warmer places to cooler places . The heat 's `` goal '' is to reach equilibrium–a state where everything is the same temperature as everything that surrounds it . That 's why a hot bowl of soup or a cold glass of soda will eventually reach room temperature if you leave them out long enough . The difference between you and a bucket of water ( well , one of many differences ) is that your body is constantly generating more heat . All that heat has to go somewhere , so it tries to escape through your skin .

I know that it might seem far fetched to include ocs and pct , but since I have only a minimal amount of time I want everything to be optimal in terms of safety and gains . From what I understand , since SARMs stimulate the androgen receptors throughout the body , this signals the HTPA axis to downregulate the release of FSH and LH . In turn , this reduces total and free test . If I were to include clomiphene , which is shown to increase the release of both LH and FSH , would n't that prevent any suppression ?",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,AskReddit,"Then [ this ] ( http : //www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html ) might be of interest to you . I would like to highlight some parts to make it clearer . `` The findings from excavations testify that at this time , unlike the later Sparta , a rich culture had developed here . Around 1100 BC , the Dorians came and conquered the territory ( Archaeology favors a date for Dorian settling around 950 BC ) . '' `` During Sparta 's history , the habitation center in the Eurotas valley had changed many times , but the Dorian city which was comprised from five villages , occupied the territory of today 's city of Sparta. ``",Greek,Greek
AgentErgoloid,AskReddit,"Indeed . However , there is an important distinction here . During the bronze age the dominant civilization in Greece was that of the Mycenaeans . At that time Menelaus , the brother of Agamemnon , was the king of Mycenaean Sparta . However at some point later , around 1200 BC , the Dorians invaded Greece and the Mycenaean civilization perished . So calling him Mycenaean is the correct term , since people at Peloponnese at the time were of a Mycenaean culture . The ancient city that we know as Sparta , did n't exist back then . TL ; DR Same place , different civilizations .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,HomeworkHelp,I 'll give you an answer to your first question since the same principles apply to the second . First things first . You will have to convert pKa to Ka . In order to do this you will need to antilog 4.76 . Ka=10^-pka -- & gt ; Ka=10^-4.76 -- & gt ; Ka=1.74*10^-5 From there on you can calculate the concentration of H3O^+ . Ka = [ CH3COO^- ] [ H3O^+ ] / [ CH3COOH ] [ CH3COO^- ] = [ H3O^+ ] = x [ CH3COOH= 0.28-x at this point you can assume tha 0.28-x≈0.28 thus : Ka=x^2 /0.28 -- & gt ; 1.74*10^-5 *0.28 = x^2 -- & gt ; 4.87 * 10^-6 = x^2 -- & gt ; x=sqrt ( 4.87 * 10^-6 ) -- & gt ; x= 2.2 * 10^-3 Now that you know the concentration of hydronium cation you can calculate the pH since : pH= -log [ H3O^+ ] pH=-log ( 2.2 * 10^-3 ) -- & gt ; pH= 2.66,Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,ZenHabits,"That 's a pretty clever concept . I 've been employing that principle for sometime now . My kryptonite is the Internet . Although I do use it study daily I found myself procrastinating now and then . So what I did was to use a piece of software called Cold Turkey . Some redditors might be familiar with it . It basically blocks websites and/or programs that otherwise might be draining your productivity . I tried it for a couple of weeks and I found that it really helps ! You see , when a good five or six hours of your day are wasted on addictions and then suddenly you stop , the void has to be filled . You can say that I have my triggers under control . What you said about visualization is also pretty much true for me . It is just that I did n't have the resolve to study or go to class . I felt that it was pointless . That I would be able to pass the class with the least amount of effort . Then I thought a little bit about it . I had the notion that living is all about having an easy life . Boy was I wrong ! Things get dull after a point if you do n't push yourself to strive for the best . Awareness is key here . I would n't be where I am now without becoming more self-aware .

AgentErgoloid,NonZeroDay,"Drug addict or not , you have to remember that everybody is responsible for their own actions . Also this `` The drug addict did n't mean to get addicted to drugs , they were just going to try it , but then bam , they are screwed . '' is completly false . Physiological addiction takes a couple of uses to form . There is something else in the works here . Picture this , you are playing your favourite video game and it is 1:00 am . You are 1 hour past your sleep time and you have to go to work in 7 hours . Yet you decide to play just 20 more minutes , which become 1 hour , which becomes 2 hours and so on . In the end you end up sleeping poorly and feeling tired for the whole next day . In this scenario , the subject was conscious their decision to only play for twenty minutes . A person that gets into drugs only to try them out , is also conscious of their decision . Do you see a pattern here ? If you fail to resist immediate reward you only have yourself to blame for your lack of willpower . You are uncomfortable with the idea because you need to put effort , and when we put effort into something we tend to get out of our comfort zone which is well.. uncomfortable . So in the end it all boils down to willpower . I hope I did n't come across as offensive , just my 2 cents .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,StonerProTips,"Actually THC has a half life between 1.6–59h so it surely is n't 4 days . See [ this ] ( http : //link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003088-200342040-00003/fulltext.html ) study for further info . Another point is that half-life has nothing to do with tolerance . Think about it . Caffeine has a half life of 5 hours , however you need cease consuming it for a couple of days in order for your tolerance to reach zero . So what does exactly happen when you develop tolerance for a given substance ? The brief answer would be that the system being targeted ( receptor ) downregulates itself . This is known as a negative feedback loop . The phenomenon mentioned above happens due to homeostasis . * *Homeostasis* Homeostasis , also spelled homoeostasis or homœostasis ( from Greek : ὅμοιος , `` hómoios '' , `` similar '' , and στάσις , stásis , `` standing still '' ) , is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant . There are some exceptions to this . Namely reverse tolerance or receptor sensitization . **TL ; DR : ** Tolerance develops due receptors downregulating .",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,hearthstone,"TBH forsen played the final interview really well . Stated his points , congratulated his competitor , didnt rage . Pretty solid handling , unlike some ESL admins..",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,Destiny,How about no pepe ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"So happy for Fear . From smalltime teams , to nirvana , to online kingdom , to finally claiming the title of # 1 with EG . For many the star of the show was suma1l/ppd 's draft . But Fear , constantly performing at the top level , possibly the most reliable carry in the scene with truckloads of experience on his shoulders , cant imagine who deserves this win more than him . Congrats to EG , and wp CDEC for giving us an entertaining and competitive final",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"No way . Mid-fight level ups are not uncommon , and 2 stat points can make or break a fight , an experienced player should have the presence of mind to skill it in fight , and that should give him an edge . I think this is one of those changes that dumb down the game , instead of making it smarter",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Does KDL need better casters ? Definitely . Should you take it out on those guys ? i dont think so , they were probably made to do it from their employer , and are trying to learn as it goes on . Cut the casters some slack",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,ITT : hating on protoss,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Oh boy finally , i was thinking of getting in the business myself sometime and really wan na read some advice Below are just suggestions , if anyone disagrees/wants to correct something please do so 1 . Enforce an age limit of sorts . You dont want kids coming in to play for free/yelling etc . Also keep in mind that some games attract younger people ( a.k.a league usually attracts non adults ) and you might not want that in a place that serves alcohol and whatnot Honestly , PCS for players in a bar is not a good idea , Consoles on the other hand would probably work well but w/e floats your boat . My suggestion would be to instead get some old ( or new ) arcade game machines ( Street fighter /MK/R-Type etc. ) . 2 . If you set up PCS , make sure at least the towers are in a spot where they wont be accidentally showered with a drink or something 3 . Dont focus too much on gaming ( basically , dont make it awkward ) and alienate other potential customers , though thats something really subjective . 4 . Better forgo that dungeon crawling idea and replace it with a shooter theme . That means CSGO , Battlefield , CoD and/or whatever else you want . I dont know if its legal , or you would have to negotiate a deal with twitch/streamers w.e . but watching those things in a bar with the goal of making money might be a legally different situation from watching at home , dont really know 5. maybe get a barman/bartender to make you some game related drinks . ( There have been some pokemon related stuff going around on the web ) . Nothing much . Just 2-3 game inspired drinks ( Think `` clarity potion '' etc . ) . As for food , you do not really need to go that far . Just the usual stuff that would accompany a cold beer Tournament nights are your best weapon in this business , especially you combine them with some cool stuff like raffles , giveaways or even allow people to bet on matches ( dont know what you would reward them with though ) .Make sure your place has online presence and advertise your pubstomps frequently ( fb page , maybe twitter ) . Anyway best of luck to you , hope your business goes well",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,gaming,"Well having read this review and watched TB 's video about it , i 'd say that its definitely not 3.5 , its higher , dont know by how much though . In the video , Thief ( PC Version ofc ) was reported having extremely smooth performance and you could see the PC port was amazing . Truth be told , most game reviews are as biased as the reviewer and in many cases rushed and exaggerated . This game clearly is not deserving of such low rating , and this for me means egmnow is not really a site i should consult in the future",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Its nice to see Fear finally rewarded for all his work . Well done old man , well done EG",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"I dont really watch the LoL scene so i cant speak for it , but the dota2 season is packed full of tournaments and is generally on the rise , i dont see a need for such sponsorship . Sc2 would benefit more from this i think",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"This is all fine , however , for the game to get more people is easy . Lower price , more foreigners winning . There are a lot of people who are not interested watching koreans battle it out again and again . You dont have anyone to represent you , ofc you wont be interested in watching",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,I kinda liked it,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,The jew part ... holy hell this is too funny,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Best show ever,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Exactly . This is personal preference , and i prefer not listening to the same stuff over and over again , i can understand whats going on in the game and i find their casting to be exactly what it needs to make my viewing experience entertaining",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"Damn right , Long shows = best shows",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"True , if anything they got muted for not being able to stand a low ranked players idiotic mistakes , flaming , and getting muted",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,They are not talking about the game as much as production/events/incidents with teams/players etc . I cant really speak about others but i find it interesting and dont mind listening about that kind of stuff even though i do not play LOL or follow their competitive scene,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"this is great , good job",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"maybe you dont speak about SC2 , a lot of us play both games",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I liked it,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Whats wrong with sc2 ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Man this reminds me of the GDshows of old . This stream is fucking awesome,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,One could argue that since jaedong made mistakes ( scouting in 3rd game for example ) he was not the best player in that particular match,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"One thing i want to say is that i see people posting about being interested in only dota , or only starcraft and the rest are just a convenience if they are there . There are also many guys who are very into sc2 and dota2 both , and dont care about anything else . I open TL every day when i sit on my pc and check what sc2 and d2 streams are going on and pick one of them . I check for any good articles on d2 and sc2 both . And while i know it sounds a bit ridiculous to say its hard to just click a different site , it will make a difference Bottomline this does not seem like a very good change but we 'll have to wait and see",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,DotA2,"If it is anything like the sc2 division of GOM ( and i think it will be ) they probably need casters that live in korea and cast live from the GOM studio in gangnam.. please god let it be tastosis , it should at least be more enjoyable than casting tanks",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,"Nobody says that , the hate is towards riot because riot pays for every tournament , there is literally no tournament that isnt paid for by riot ( tencent ) dota 2 players for the most part never talk shit about sc2 . I noticed you keep making these retarded comments all over the thread , whats your problem ?",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"And here comes the ever politically correct , always mannered , and very entitled `` community member '' part of reddit ... . this cant go wrong",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"not that this behaviour is right , but you should get used to it ... over the past years , anyone who played internet games had his whole family killed , raped and mutilated multiple times . We have been spammed , flamed etc . There was no need for gender specific insults because we knew that we are probably all male anyways . Now as girls get into it , someone who wants to swear can do so with a wider vocabulary , and he uses it . Simple as that My point is , its just insulting , it wont get better no matter how many banhammers drop . No need to go on crusades about it , just ignore it and do your thing . Also if i knew my teammate was female i honestly would not expect anything from them .Would not flame , yell , rage etc . but initially treat them as someone who does not know what to do in this game ( so fails are to be expected )",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Guess what , Flash is going to surpass Fatal1ty in the next 2 years",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Will you do any more stuff for sc2 ? ... to this day everyone says asus ROG summer was the best event ever , and the way things are going they could definitely use some of that production magic again . also will you discard the sc2 segment of the gd show ? it was fairly interesting",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Friendly reminder that LOLupdates is a troll account and should not be taken seriously,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Honestly , i thought it sucked . Smaller target/pointer - harder to last hit . the minimap felt..wrong , i had been playing wc3 dota mainly watching the minimap , and in dota 2 the minimap confused me . The map felt considerably smaller , it seemed like ganks came out of nowhere , even though wards were up i did not notice stuff that in wc3 i would see in a split second . Teamfights also were too chaotic at start but i had expected that . Of course it was all a matter of adjusting and now i think d2 is vastly superior , but those first days it felt like playing dota2 made me worse at the game",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"They were talking about too many male gamers . Honestly i think he complimented her , meaning that she is a female pro gamer , why would he hint at something like that out of the blue , you heard what he was saying about scarlett in other times Eitherway , thats 2gd love him or hate him , and i for one would not jump to assumptions and call someone a `` transphobic shithead '' . What does calling him that make you ? not a better person surely",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"I would argue but it seems we disagree on the matter . Still , even if it was as you say it was meant as a joke , unlike your comment",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,thegdstudio,"In this weeks Unfiltered they talked about EG 's mason making some offensive statements and how would that reflect on Alex garfields `` political correctness '' policy . I actually did not see it discussed on the dota2 subreddit ( and to be honest its nothing new to the scene ) , which is why i did n't edit it in the news thread.They did make a pretty big issue out of it though so if someone considers it newsworthy you might as well add it . The statements in question : http : //i.imgur.com/5N4Tx3d.png",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Draskyl should be there ( and yes i know why he declined ) , cant believe he wont be at TI while a bunch of `` community figures '' will",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,n0tail cast is very good . Cast was also very good before n0tail . I dont think anything needed to be salvaged,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Its a nice concept but there is something about adding so many `` conveniences '' to the game that i dont like ... An experienced player can manage his inventory in a fast and efficient manner , hence he gets a fair advantage over an inexperienced player . Its a good idea , would not like it to be in the game though",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,Its a matter of practice . Also everything you do while playing is part of the game and it should rightfully require an amount of skill to execute,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Sweden is great and Mason is an asshole . He did have one point down though . Most swedes i talk to online automatically think they are superior to others . ( Master race and all that shit ),Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,i remember there was a time where everybody wanted to beat up babyknight because he was a huge flamer/dick.They would wait for him at LANS . Mason seems to be walking down that path,Greek,Greek

Aglarod,starcraft,This so much . I would definitely tune in to hear Idra cast,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Tasteless fuck yea,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Maybe it was great for a chinese fan , but for us europeans/americans it didnt mean much . We were not emotionally invested and personally i just wanted to enjoy some good games without getting anxious about a team i support . But , we didnt even get good games . Not that its anybody 's fault , boring finals happen all the time in other sports/esports ( mainly starcraft 4-0 and 4-1 sweeps ) , it was about time we had one as well .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Nobody is discrediting newbee , but you cant force people to like or admire something . Yes they won , congratulations . People showed manners and gave them applause , chanted their name , and all was good , but thats it . In the end it was a boring series and an anticlimactic finale to the season",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"This is gold Maybe you should link it to d2 subreddit or something , people ask but dont know where to find this",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I think he said something similar last year ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Fucking perfect , immensely entertaining cast , i love it Some guys in chat and here need to chill though . So much butthurt , if you dont like it close the stream . Almost every cast nowadays caters to people who dont know enough about the game , and when something like this pops up they cry and yell because they are not being spoonfed tedious info , graphs and stats again and again . I for one welcome this , its not like it happens often , or in grand finals .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Will we have to subscribe to TB 's channel to access vods ?,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Point is , you will not find yourself in those annoying situations if you manage your inventory properly-which is something you have to learn . Everything that happens after loading is dota . Courier handling , buying items , swapping items , everything . Yes , Experience should give an advantage via mechanics . Inventory management IS mechanics",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,Probably some GEM higher ups got annoyed about an article or two,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Man its enough that tobi made everything awkward for everyone last night , do we really need to see that shit at the front page of r/dota2 ?",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Zeus for the last one , his model is pretty plain , he needs some badassery",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Na'vi , or whatever team Fear plays on , which i guess now is no team . I used to really dislike navi , was a huge MYM fan back in dota1 , when Mym vs navi was `` el classico '' ( F4F 3.5 finals anyone ? ) . At TI1 i was rooting for online kingdom but that team disbanded , so i basically thought navi was the best of the `` old '' players , plus if it wasnt for them at TI2 china would still be laughing at us",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Yep , plus it will show koreans what dota 2 actually is , it kinda seems most gamers do not know much about it still . The prestige of TI ( and the incredibly huge prizepool ) will attract more korean teams , and gamers will follow suit",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"I like the daily challenge , the remodel and the A-Z other than that pretty underwhelming , which is ok. Those are optional stretch goals , we dont have to reach them . In the end i got a relatively cheap compendium and i d say with the current unlocks its already worth its cost.Anything more is a bonus , if we reach it cool , if not , no problem",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,starcraft,"yes , he said `` soon ''",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,"we frontpage now boys Also this looks great , seems like a very high skillcap game",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,aww,"The host of that place and owner of the studio brand used to work as a caster/commentator for ESL , plus some other stuff for years . He decided to invest in this and produce `` shows '' . Pretty damn good shows , also he managed a team of other casters/commentators booked theme events and such Another guy used to code tools for a game called dota 2 , they liked his work , invited him to the `` world cup '' for casting and then hired him . Point is , years of 8-5 jobs before they ended up there . Of course luck helps , right place at the right time with the right skills and all that .",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"And now with draskyl , the double knowledge combo",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Admirr was actually really good upon his return , and vigosss had some really solid appearances , they just didnt have the drive to make it last",Greek,Greek

Aglarod,DotA2,"We just like both fucking games and play / watch both , how hard is it to understand",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,thegdstudio,Sheever is not part of the studio though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Amen , same here",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,"Chances are they simply do not want to risk it . Their bootcamp doesnt start until later in June , it would make sense to play it safe and buy as much time possible for his arm to recover fully . Also , i dont think alex garfield really wants to field his team without fear , he is an important `` persona '' if you may , after the free to play documentary , its the kind of thing that creates storylines ( and brings in money )",Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I dont think what 2gd said then and puppey now are comparable to be honest . I also thought 2GD 's joke was very funny and people get offended too easily . Puppey was straight rude though,Greek,Greek
Aglarod,DotA2,I really hope this isnt true but if it is ... . i understood EG 's predicament when they released Idra but if they actually use Fear 's injury as an excuse i cant even imagine the backlash if proof gets out,Greek,Greek

It kinda has been the nature of the turks , since the turks started occupy other countries they 've been known how barbaric they 've been against christians . Killing many , abducted children to fight for them . One reason for the bosnians to convert was this , so the turks would be easier on them at the time ( and tax reasons ) , but serbs took it very wrong .

Because there was never a slaughter against turks at a scale that can be labeled as a genocide . Turks usually were taken prisoners , those being killed in the war had the unfortunate to do so . But were never systematically slaughtered by other factors , **understand that** . Compare it like what the Nazis did to the Jews and other minorities , less gas more bullets . So yeah , people have sure have grudge against Turks . My family/roots being partly from Trabzon/Sinope area , did experience the slaughter . Many had never had the oppurtunity to leave , before being slaughtered . & gt ; Thank you for 3 passive-aggressive paragraphs full of racism Sorry I did n't want to make it passive-aggressive , just wanted to state that how it was or how it was mostly seen by people . & gt ; it 's likely that many of my ancestors were Christian at some point Can be very true , because modern turks are a blend from everything they came in contact with , and you can see similarities from western turks ( in Turkey ) with some Europeans . & gt ; So that Turks no longer are so much like Mongols should tell you about how inclusive and accepting the Turkish culture was Turkish culture **HAD** to adopt to become a well functioning kingdom/empire , cause unlike the nomad-life it is n't very stable and do n't tend to last long .

One keeping the ottomans on the island and the other keeping remaining armies in anatolia . If you manage to have allies before the war , it will be even better . I had poland ( they will bring lithuania with them ) and Wallachia ( I think ) . On your peace treaty you gain land and ducats to pay off your loans .

Like this backslash \ . But the camera will still let you look over there ( straight up ) . So when I used to have a Pharah right on top of me , I could block the missiles , nowadays I ca n't . And one other thing is the charge . Clearly if you 're a main you should notice that there been changes to the logic of the collision . When the smallest ramp could stop the charge and count it as a collision . This has been change ( I think to the better ? ) Example , when attacking in Route 66 , I used to love and try to charge on [ this little ramp ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/R8Wfz ) you see , it used to stop me everytime , whether I charged from middle or left gate . After I started playing again , it now works without collision , so I can continue to charge all the way to the payload and start moving it . It feels also that people who 're infront of me should get pinned when I charge at them , but sometimes they just `` jump '' /get pushed straight up . I do n't get it .

Not to mentioned that the very nature of the race was similar : Mostly 1-stopper ( did anyone made a 2-stop today , anyway ? ) hard to overtake , even with fairly bid pace advantage ( granted , the track 's nature did n't exactly helped ) , many retirements due to mechanical failures etc . etc .

This behaviour has emerged over the last 4-5 months or so , and it 's driving me ( 17 year old , male , the only other child of the family ) , and our two parents ( both at their 40 's ) crazy . Only today , he and grandma ( who has visited us for a couple of weeks ) were supposed to go to the local bookstore to buy some stuff he needed for school . But he took his bicycle , and went ahead after a while , leaving her to come alone . Dunno why . Even worse , pa and ma are n't home for a couple of days , they return tomorrow evening . I dread to guess how they 'll react once they learn what happened . This is just the last of many things my bro has done during the past 2-3 yrs which indicated recklessness and non responsibility . I.. want to help him think , but i 'm not sure how . Father 's yelling and `` go to your room '' are n't doing much good . I need some help , reddit . Please , help me here.. Edit : Another example is how he constantly argues with father about nothing really , and that he will continually press on the argument , even when proven false , very much like politicians dabble on and on , trying to prove they 're right . Also , he often yells and shouts , which frustrates my dad , who in turn punishes my bro . I should also add he spends many hours in front of his laptop , way too much for his age ( or anyone tbh.. ) Dad often takes his laptop after another one of their arguments , however he 'll crumble after a day or two and give it back . Now , my brother knows he 's often wrong and that he 's sorry , you can see it in his eyes . But i think he does n't know how to change it .

AlexanderTheGreen,swtor,"**ATTENTION PLEASE ! ! This is NOT just a rundown of the actual chapters of the KotFE expansion . While close to it , they are rather my opinion on how the story could 've been better , and have a solid ending . Enjoy ! ** Chapters 1-2 : Same as the actual game . The Hunt , the ambush , the capture , Marr dies , we refuse to bow , we kill Valko 's body , Arcann 's the new Emperor . Vision and Dreams also same . Chapter 3 : Same , more or less . Key differences are T7 actually comes with us , and there 's no HK . Seriously , besides guiding us to the gravestone , he 's just there for nostalgia ( hk-47 ) and coolness factor . Practical change , essentially same . Chapter 4 : More or less same , but here i try to minimize time spend in the swamp/gathering supplies . We still get some much needed exposition about these 5 years . After burying the crashed shuttle , Koth recalls and tells us that the legendary gravestone is rumored to be here and it might be our only hope getting out of there alive . T7 can point the way just as well as HK can . With the gravestone found , up and running ( time saver ) , Lana tells us we must go to Asylum asap to form an Alliance to rival the ET ( eternal throne ) . We meet Senya in the zakuul knights ' ambush , she joins us . Chapter 5 : Lady of sorrows arc . We meet Heskal who 's telling us about `` fate '' and stuff and his Scions . He also hints at wanting to join us , but that 's up in the air . We recruit SCORPIO . Chapter 6 : Taking Flight Arc . Heskal pips Arcann off to Asylum , he and all his scions are murdered by arcann who faces off against us . Arcann raids Asylum with a mightly force , so the day is basically get the GS ( gravestone ) free and go . 2nd standoff with arcann . He beats us - just , but Valko is n't there to help us . Dunno if you noticed , but Valko does n't appear at all to present these `` opportunities '' to us . That 's intentional . No , we 're saved by Koth , who at the last minute shows up to save the day and us , Zakuul patriot and all . Arcann is ticked off/distacted/trapped ( under debris ? ; ) ) just enough for us to escape . He certaintly doesnt get thrown down 9999 floors only to escape cause plot . Vaylin vs. senya goes as normal , senya wins bu spares her . they all escape to odessan , but the outlander is furious at sparing , or at least not capturing , such a big enemy . That makes Senya somewhat dissillussioned about his ability to rule/command , and foreshadows the betrayal . Chapter 7 : Alliance . We go to Odessan , meet the new friends and get our ship back . Same as story . Chapter 8 : Aric recruitment chapter . Havoc enters the alliance . Chapter 9 : Mandalore 's revenge . same as normal , mandos enter the alliance . Meanwhile , Theron informs us he 's found one of our old crew members ( old companions , class- dependant ) . chapter 10 : visions in the dark . same chapter as normal , same story . valko appears , he taunts us , we meet shatele and ghost marr . chapter 11 : profit n ' plunder . chapter 12 : Mandos and Havoc together infiltrate the spire from different points to gather intel about the area . Meanwhile , the outlander and lana go into asylum , where another companion might be in here , ready to help . sadly , its a trap by vaylin , who kills said companion and attacks us . she fights to her last breath and dies . now here 's a good point , or so i thought . said companion , of course different with each class , would be the one you build the least affection with from levels 1-55 ( RotHC ) ( original 5 companions ) , excluding ship droid . So basically , YOU -WE get to choose which companion to kill . We all wanted to kill skadge , or corso or kaliyo.. vaylin 's ready ; ) Also , by killing original comps it 's another reminder of the new age ( kotfe ) . Lana is severely injured in the fight ( or not , depending on some PC choice during the fight ) . They return to odessan , only to find an enranged senya - the outlander killed her daughter , and a failed mission from Havoc and the Mandos . You can either Aric or Shae , if you want to . Senya has a fallout with the Outlander and ditches the alliance . Chapters 13 : Odessan Orbit . Arcann , enraged about her sister 's death ( hey , the buffin has feelings 😂 ) and now joined by Senya *har , har* , raids odessan . Senya has revealed the location of the alliance base and together , they bring the full might of the eternal fleet against the outlander . First off , the alliance prepares to face them off in space , on odessan orbit . The battle is tough , and they lose it . They 're forced to retreat , and the chapter ends with the outlander crash landing the gravestone , which is destroyed . The ground assault will begin soon ... Chapter 14 : The Battle of Odessan : The conflict is long , tough and brutal . The Alliance is dug deep and well protected , but they Eternal fleet is storming the place , they have em outnumbered and outgunned . Both sides are merciless , with no one giving an inch to the other . The casualties are very high for each side , and they continue to amass . As Commander , you can tip the scales off , however . We 're given actual choices about who dies and who survives . Based on our choices , Lana ( based on vaylin injury or not ) , Koth , Theron , Aric , Shae , Vette , Gault , SCORPIO , any past companions who have returned and fight by you , as well as a potential number of mandalorians can die or not . You can save em all , you can kill em all . Waging war against Arcann is BRUTAL . On a personal level AND when seeing the bigger picture . That 's what tipped me off in Chapter 1 , when i faced Valkorion and the Fleet , i knew , Zakuul was going to be TOUGH to beat . That 's the feeling i wan na give here . The green fields run red with the blood . Zakuul has a very big number of casualties as well- Arcann 's lost his flagship and many , many other ships , although no one important is there any more . On the ground , Knights arr scattered , destroyed and scared for life . Some plea for mercy as u walk by them . Chapter 15 : The Last Stand : Arcann vs. the Outlander . The time has come . No stupid `` shields '' or anything , but the `` ultimate '' duel between an expert duelsman and.. well , an expert at whatever class you are : P Like Vaylin , Arcann has no intention to surrender . He wants both to avenge his sis , AND Valko to talk to him . We win this time . As we 're about to finish him , Senya shows up trying to stab us from behind and kill us . Valko FINALLY shows up and strangles her in front of an almost dead Arcann , laughing with pleasure . Valko mocks his son- he gave attention to a stranger and nothing on his child . Arcann 's litterally broken now , he cries and weeps on the floor like an abused child . Valko tips us to end this miserable being . The Outlander can either spare him or kill him , OR something else , check the neutral ending in the end of the post for it ; ) * In LS ending , we tell Arcann we -us and the alliance- can help him . heal him , his body and his soul . With us , he can finally rejoice and be redeemed . He can have.. friends , people who care bout him . Arcann finally realizes the difference of us and Valko . He understands what a monster Valko really is , and what his pursuit of him has made him . We help him get up , and we join forces . Valko now.. **returns** to life , litterally , he transitions from ghost to real life body . We urge Arcann that even if we ca n't defeat him , we must try . That 's what makes us better . We fight Valko 2vs1 with Arcann . Arcann 's already near death from our fight , so he can only help so much and he 's fatally wounded . We manage to stab and `` kill '' Valko again , who dissapears again , saying he 's defeated . With his power base and influence lost , `` he wo n't bother us for another 1000 years '' . We speak with arcann , who in true vader fashion , lays off his metal mask and arm - his `` sacrifice '' over . He 's redempted , and he dies in peace . * In the DS ending , we actually get to punch a sorry and weeping arcann in his stupid face . We take his mask and metal arm off as painfully for him as possible , and we press our boot down his weak throat as hard as we can . Arcann dies a few moment later , his last sight his father 's actual body - he 's returned to life- , laughing over his corpse . Valkorion congratulates us , and tells us `` we 're ready '' . He takes control over us , and we are shown marching on the fray again , slaughtering any one still alive . We have sinhy purple eyes , we are invincible - nothing can harm us . We speak with Valko 's voice . He has litterally posessed us , and the game ends on that note , we as his vessel with HIM in control , going off against the galaxy to cause chaos , murder and mayhem . The LS ending is n't resolved , however . With Senya/Arcann 's death and Valkorian 's `` exit '' , the aliance wins the battle of odessan . The bulk of the eternal fleet is defeated . Our allies -and us- have been damaged , but we 'll endure . The alliance no longer can go after zakuul , but zakuul is leaderless and with no major force to attack them , AND with no government ( they 're thrown into anarchy ) , the Republic and the Empire charge off against them , liberating and retaking their lost worlds . They have a truce in effect , which after zakuul 's total defeat and the destruction of the Throne , becomes an official Allyship . Back on Odessan , now a ruin world , the victims are pilled together and burned . They brifely discuss Valko , but they know he wo n't bother them again -at least not in a very long time . The Alliance has WON . Thus , it 's time to be dissolved . Everyone 's going their way , Pub , Empire or back to sabacc or bounties . The Outlander prepares his ship to leave as well . He 's returning to Tython/Korriban/Non Force classes somewhere else , specific to their lore ( BH Rakata Prime-mandalorians ? ) . Before they depart , they observe a hill plateau on the sunset . Marr ghost appears , now joined by sathele shan 's ghost as well -she has died , presumably from aging . Lastly , their class mentor appears in ghost ( Orgus Din , Master Yuon , Baras , Zash ) , no mentor for non force classes . They all smile n ' nod towards the PC , giving him the utmost respect and credit for all his or her work , one last time . Edit : Also , here 's something i had written on my notes but forgot to pass on the thread : Based on how did you handled your companions and your troops throughout both the orbital and the ground battle of odessan , you determine how many main characters survive . If more than half , or half of your available units which you get a CHOICE to command in battle survive to the end , the Alliance wins the battle . If less than half survive , Zakuul rampages through and conquers then destroys the Alliance base . **Please note that you ca n't get the LS ending if Zakuul wins odessan . However , you can get the DS ending regardless of the outcome of the battle of odessan** . Edit 2 : No , i did n't forgot Kaliyo . I left her out on purpose , because even Agents should n't accept her in this Alliance . Edit 3 : For the LS ending , the `` fallen masters '' ghost for each class ( orgus , baras etc . ) might be removed if asked to ; ) Edit 4 : The segments where Valky gives us his power without us agreeing ( like when he leaves in Visions in the Dark ) , are cut because they 're plain stupid . **BONUS-Neutral Ending** When Valko urges us to end Arcann , we have another option : The Outlander realizes that Valky is somehow tied to him , inside his/her mind , so Neutral players , seeing the pitiful carpet crying in front of them and a becrazed spirit talking to them , fall into desparate measures . Seeing that Valko survives whether we kill Arcann or not , the Neutral choice is **To Literally Impale/Shoot ourselfs in the gut** , to have any chance , if minimal , to hurt/kill Valkorion ( because he 's tied to us ) . A foolish move , perhaps , but neutral ca n't `` inspire '' arcann to fight with them again -he 's weak and he 's an enemy , and neither do they want to crush him like a bug . I thought about having the option to arrest him , but at that point , the outlander sees valky as a much higher threat to the world than arcann . So yeah , we shoot ourselfs in the gut ... . The outcome is.. you guessed it , we die . We do n't survive the day . Valkorion is indeed seen hurting- very much . In fact , he decides to `` leave '' , in similar fashion to the LS ending . We have n't killed him , but we 've gotten rid of him . We wo n't make it though . Arcann gets up , still very much in shock , but it looks as if he 'll manage . He slowly exits the area after one final look to us . We are left to die , Arcann 's fate is unknown . Now , if the Alliance wins odessan , Arcann is killed in the outro , our body is recovered and given burial , and from there it follows the LS ending , only difference being we 're being mourned and remembered by our allies . Our Legacy survives , it is the downfall of zakuul and the restoration of our faction . If Zakuul wins , Arcann returns to the throne , our remaining , if any , allies are executed , and our body is left to rot . Arcann fully recovers and Zakuul lays waste to both Imp and Pub planets , and their citizens . **Neutral ending explanation ends** The . End : D",Greek,Greek

The battle was quick and it 's impossible to tell for sure , but i know i shot down at least four of them for good , and i hit at least three others . The rest did n't fared worse , either . We may still be rookies , but within our Tie Fighters we proved that we got what it takes . Tano and Clay were hit hard , though . Doc says they 'll make it , but for now we 're down to four members with our CO . The Imperial assault as a whole on the Rebel blockade was a success . Although we failed to break them , we crippled them and only their AA batteries and our lack of proper bomber instruments forced us to escape , fortunately with very few casualties . The rebels live to fight another day , but they can rest assured it 'll be their last . As our CO told us , *Today we earned our Stripes* . We may sleep at ease . Pvt . Alexander out .",Greek,Greek

We and Arcann defeat and `` kill '' his material body , and he decides to leave cause his plan has been foiled , his too , turned against him , etc .

The 2nd paragraph i agree , though . I leave a sight question mark over the story , as the writers MAY make it have sense in hindsight , after season 3 or 4 of the expansion . But whilst it had so much potential to be one of the best expansions a game has ever seen , it was released as an afterthought , serving only as a prologue to a story the devs have seen fit to grab players ' monthly sub .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"That depends on how you want to define bleeding hearts . I may support libertarianism for deontological reasons , but I also believe that it is the best chance the poor have for a brighter future . History has proved time and time again that the government only magnifies the problems it tries to resolve : it tried to provide everyone access to an education , and college tuition skyrocketed . It tried to provide healthcare , and health costs skyrocketed .

You divide them into three categories : branches to the arm , branches to the armpit , branches to the chest . You create a card for each category , and a collective card that has them separated in categories , so if you forget an item you can work your way towards it . Another anki-specific solution is to use clozed deletion in groups of three .

If the property in question was owned solely by the deceased , then it would be considered unowned until homesteaded . Presumably , the family that lives in a house already homesteads it the instant it becomes unowned , but they would have to actually claim the rest of the inheritance .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Disclaimer : I am agnostic . I believe that there is insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the existence of any deity , and my default assumption is that `` it probably does n't '' , as any positive assertion has to be proven . I do , however , respect the beliefs of others , and their right to have them . Now that this is out of the way , lets roll with your belief . God exists and He has bestowed the state with moral authority to rule in His name . The first problem we run into is *which* God did that . Many religions are contradictory . From a Christian standpoint , Saudi Arabia would not be a legitimate state . From a Saudi standpoint , America would not be a legitimate state . And what of states that are agnostic to religion ? Was the USSR a state ? Is China ? If they are *not* legitimate states , then why do they continue to exist in spite of opposing God 's will ? Another thing to consider is that the state is an impediment to the free practice of religion . The entity which you claim has divine authority is allowing same-sex couples to marry , and forcing you to legally acknowledge that union , it is forcing you to interact with non-believers and sell them products and services , and it is using your money to fund contraception and abortion , both acts condemned by the Church . In fact , it is apparent that *the state indirectly opposes religion* , and in a way seeks to replace it . The state 's actions de-facto turn faith unto God into faith unto the State , much like the USSR did . Supporting both God and the State is therefore a contradiction , because they are at odds with each-other . If the state is legitimized by God , then how can it remain legitimate if it opposes Him ? Arguably , a stateless society would be much more conductive to the worship of God . Food for thought .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"But if *all states* reject God 's law , then are n't *all states* illegitimate ? In fact , it is impossible to find a state that had existed in history that has fully adhered to the word of the Christian God . Consider this : all over the world , public servants have to take an oath of office - an act exclusively forbidden by Jesus . Therefore , no current state can be legitimate . So the question remains on whether or not any *future* state can be established legitimately . Jesus condemned violence , even in self defense ( `` turn the other cheek '' ) , and one of the Commandments is `` do not murder '' . As the imposition of any state requires violence , the very act of establishing it goes against the word of God . So if no current states are legitimate , and no future states may be established without ignoring the word of God , then no state can ever be legitimate . Therefore , the Christian position should be to reject the state .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"& gt ; But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . ( Matthew 5:39 ) Also remember that Luke 3:14 also calls for not taking money through violence . & gt ; Then some soldiers also asked him , And as for us – what should we do ? He told them , **Take money from no one by violence or by false accusation** , and be content with your pay . ( Luke 3:14 ) As taxation is essential to maintain a state , and taxation is the mandatory collection of money - by force if necessary - by the state , Jesus made a direct call against taxation . Of course , there is a lot of contradiction in the Bible , especially when discussing the state . Some passages are a direct call against it , some unequivocally support it . How do you resolve these conflicts and arrive at the conclusion that the state derives its power from God ?",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"I do n't think any ancap really *cares* about race , genetics , etc . I certainly do n't deny that there are several qualities that are heavily correlated with race , such as the prevalence of some diseases ( like diabetes ) or the ability to consume lactose in adulthood , and if a valid research paper demonstrated that IQ correlated with race beyond just culture and socioeconomic factors , I doubt many of us would reject the evidence without a reason . The point is that *it does n't matter* if these differences exist . Even if you could objectively prove , for example , that blacks have a significantly lower IQ than whites as a group , it does n't affect the anarcho-capitalist theory of rights at all . They have the same rights to non-aggression and private property . Claiming that & lt ; quality X & gt ; should deprive a group of their rights is silly , because you might as well say that anyone with & lt ; quality X & gt ; should n't have those rights . Should low-IQ whites be enslaved ? No ? In Ancapistan , I would fully support your right to create your own segregated communities , just as I would support the right of others to want multi-cultural communities . It is a private decision that you can enforce on your property . Open borders , on the other hand , are a complex issue that you ca n't just meme away . There are arguments for and against , and my personal stance is that borders must be removed , but only if the welfare state is dismantled at the same time and the government 's size and scope is limited to much that it ca n't be voted back into place .",Greek,Greek

Instead , in common use the word murder often refers to any case of deliberate homicide aside from self-defense . Likewise , theft is a word that is often used without considering legality . Even as kids , we used to say `` my brother stole my toy '' when the act was clearly not illegal . The catchphrase `` taxation is theft '' is an attempt to make people think about the topic and consider the possibility that morality is not defined by laws , not some irrefutable statement .

I completely agree , but the age of consent can apply to any decision : if you are not mature enough to have sex , are you mature enough to own property ? Get a job ? How about deciding what to study - an arguably more impactful decision on your life ? Another problem with that is that we have no objective measure of the age of consent . Some countries have it at 15 , some at 16 , some at 18 . Some ( ew ) have it at 12 or something.That is something we ca n't possibly resolve , under any system , and any ( very necessary ) limit will be arbitrary .

There are responsible 15 year olds and 30 year olds who I would n't trust with the keys to a car , and any solution is going to be an imperfect 'one size fits all ' that both restricts minors who are mature for their age and lets immature adults through .

I 'd argue that the lack of outrage is mostly due to lackluster media coverage , gag orders , secret courts and *government* meddling , but that 's a whole different topic . & gt ; They are pretty different and the scientific method does n't really resolve scientific problems . They are nothing alike . I use 'problems ' as short-hand . The scientific method provides knowledge on the function of the physical world - and the free market provides knowledge on the method of optimal distribution of scarce resources . The goal of the free market is indeed not to be economically efficient ( although it tends to be ) , nor to progress socially or politically ( although economic freedom is correlated with social progress ) . The free market is a method for the allocation of resources . We live in a universe of scarce resources . Naturally , every human has different goals , wants and ambitions , and they disagree on how to use these resources . The market takes their preferences , it compares them to the scarcity of the resources needed , and it 'spits out ' the price . Things that everyone wants ( high preference ) and are abundant ( low scarcity ) are cheap , while things that nobody wants ( low preference ) and are rare ( high scarcity ) are expensive . It works much like the scientific method . A hypothesis is made by the entrepreneur : 'People have a higher preference for & lt ; x & gt ; product than its scarcity ' . He sets the theoretical foundation : he studies the psychology of his potential customer base , their historic preferences , the objective and subjective qualities of the product and how they are valued by customers , etc . Then , he runs his experiment : he opens a business . If his original hypothesis was correct , then his business flourishes . If his hypothesis was false , then his business fails . **The market has determined whether the preference for the product is higher than its scarcity** . Finally , as needed , the entrepreneur goes back to his theoretical model and adjusts for the findings of his experiment , making corrections and optimizations which he can test anew . The free market is n't a perfect method , but then again , neither is the scientific method ! Experiments can be contaminated , false conclusions can be drawn from data , the methodology may be incorrect . But the experiments are reproducible , and with repetition these flaws are exposed and corrected . & gt ; What proof and answer to what ?

Aliencreature1,GoldandBlack,"It is all about relative value . How much is a can of cola worth to these people ? How much money are they willing to give in return for the delicious thirst-quenching delight of liquid diabetes ( Paid for by the Coca Cola Corporation ( TM ) ) . If C was their 'preference ' for cola , and M their preference for money , at which value does C equal M ? See where I am getting at ? There is nothing inherently wrong with charging $ 5 , $ 20 , $ 1,000,000 for a cola . *Nobody is being forced to buy cola , they simply decide that it 's worth more than the value they are exchanging for it* . But lets see how competition could resolve this situation . Assume the following scenario : 1 ) A can of cola costs $ 1 to make . 2 ) The People ( TM ) on average are willing to pay $ 3 for a cola . 3 ) Pepsi and Coca-Cola have agreed to set a price ceiling at $ 5 . Pepsi and Coca-Cola make a profit of $ 4 on every sale , but not everyone who wants a cola gets one , since a portion of the population values their 5 $ more than they do a can of cola . *There is a market demand for cheap cola* , and because it costs just 1 $ to make , there is a huge margin for a competitor to claim . So a few like-minded entrepreneurs form Kola-Kola ( TM ) , a startup devoted to providing cheap cola for the masses ( and making a profit while doing it ) . Since it costs $ 1 to make a can , they can afford to sell for $ 3 per item . In this manner , they can not only grab Coca-Cola's/Pepsi 's customers ( most people would really enjoy a 40 % reduction in their monthly cola budget ) , but they also tap into the market of cola lovers who do n't want ( or ca n't afford ) to pay more than $ 3 . Sure , there will be loyalists of the original brands , and that 's fine ! Coca-Cola/Pepsi will either have to adjust to the new market prices and reduce their margins , or increase the quality of their cola so people are willing to pay more for it . In any case , the consumer gets the best deal . And if Kola-Kola joins the coalition that Coca-Cola and Pepsi formed , then other entrepreneurs can jump in and make a killing .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,GoldandBlack,"Yeah , pretty much , although I am less optimistic about using the political process . Statism is a vicious cycle : people have their livelihoods ruined by the government , directly or indirectly ( state-controlled inflation had a very major part to play in the withering away of the middle class ) , and so they vote in for politicians that promise to give away free stuff/welfare . In return , taxation grows , and the prospects of the next generation are made even worse . And that 's without even mentioning the indoctrination that happens in schools . And not just public ones : private schools right now are just as bad , constantly promoting collectivist thinking and stamping out the individual , at least in my country , because they have to conform to the curriculum and standards of the state to operate . Personally , I believe that a combination of agorism and political activism must be employed . People are great at looking after their interests , but moral consistency is at an all-time low . Deontological arguments , no matter how well thought out , will fall on deaf ears when no practical improvement can be directly demonstrated - because the very nature of a free market is *speculation* . We believe that a free market will be better for everyone , and we have some data to show a positive correlation between economic freedom and prosperity , but the layman does n't care about statistics and probability . Agorism fills in for the human preference for short-time benefits . In countries that have enforced socialist policies , a black market that for goods that does not concern itself with taxation has emerged . In Greece ( my home ) , most sellers in non-chain stores wo n't hand out receipts by default , choosing to do the transaction 'off the books ' if the customer does n't protest - and in return they skip the 24 % VAT . Off the books employment is also common . Workers get to keep a larger piece of their salary , without the obscene ( mandatory ) contributions to social security , and the employer can afford to hire more staff . Perhaps things are n't as grim as I originally thought . While socialist measures do create a vicious cycle of dependance on the state , they also create a lot of loathing at the inevitably poor service quality and insane taxation .",Greek,Greek

It is a true statement , but it also applies inversely : workers , instead of making use of ( exploiting ) the labor that they themselves produce , make use of ( exploit ) previous labor to enrich themselves . You are assuming the validity of the Labor Theory of Value and dismiss the subjectivity of trade , even of the trade of labor : I value my wage more than I value the hours of work I put in .

The distinction is often made by socialists between 'personal property ' and 'private property ' , with the separation relying on whether the object in question is a 'means of production ' . Those definitions , however , are extremely fluid , and nobody can precisely agree on what the means of production actually consist of . Any item can be used both for personal purposes and to produce : I can scrub toilets with my toothbrush . My body is a very efficient means of production too ! Does my toothbrush or my body become public property when I use it to produce ? Another definition I have seen is based on absentee property . But then , who defines the limits of absentee property ? Does property that is not being actively used become communal - can I leave my house unattended and then return to find it occupied ? - or is there some arbitrary time limit ?

Capital ca n't oppress anyone either , as it is not a person . *You own yourself regardless of context . * Even in your dying breaths , where you have no food , no water and no shelter , you own yourself and the consequences of your ( in ) actions . If I own everything else , you still own yourself . But lets get back to the whole metabolism thing . Obviously man wo n't stop *needing* food , water and shelter , no matter how hard we whine . **Somebody will have to produce these for as long as we live in a world of scarce resources ( aka forever ) ** . For that reason , the phrase `` each man should be free from the constraint of laboring for basic things '' is nonsensical : **someone will not be free from that constraint** , or *everybody starves* .",Greek,Greek

In fact , most factors that contribute to inequality are not related to capital at all : a stupid millionaire can quickly become destitute and an intelligent homeless man can potentially become a millionaire . Capital *helps* , but it is not a guarantee , nor is it deterministic . In your example , the first man has an advantage , yes . He used his own labor , risked his own life and applied his own intelligence to create value ( his shelter , walls , etc. ) . The second man ca n't be expected to freeload on the first 's effort . Nobody has a right to *life* , because if that was the case , then it would generate a slave-master relationship by virtue of obligating others to provide for them . But he has options ! *It is hard* can never be an excuse for demanding 'free stuff ' : he can make rain collectors , he can collect fruit rich in water content , he can build a makeshift 'desalination ' device using fire and condensation . *He is solely responsible for providing value for himself* . If he can do neither of these things , he can exchange items or services for access to the clean water : he can offer to hunt , or he can offer to work as a farmer for the first man .

Aliencreature1,GoldandBlack,"& gt ; Thank you for the reply . As an Ancap , then I would presume that you reject USA 's declaration of independence proclamation of the right to life , liberty , and the persuit of happiness or the 14th amendment portion stating , `` nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . '' That depends on the meaning behind the words . I am not American , but I do approve of the 14th amendment *if it is interpreted in a manner consistent with natural rights theory* . Indeed , people do have a **negative** right to life , liberty and property . Nobody may rightfully deprive them of their life , liberty and pursuit of happiness by initiating aggression . The difference is that I do not accept a **positive** right to life . Others are *not obligated* to provide for anyone else . In fact , I prefer to think of 'life , liberty and pursuit of happiness ' as shorthand for 'men have a right not to have their life , liberty or pursuit of happiness taken from them ' .

This continues with an additional islander for a while . & gt ; Does the relationship the first inhabitant has with the subsequent ones constitute an Ancap relationship or a State one ? Where would the line be drawn ? Truly , I appreciate this exchange , I am wanting to see where the line would be drawn of what would constitute that slave-master relationship . The line is drawn at consent . The moment someone is threatened with coercive removal of their life , freedom or property , lest they provide for someone else , then that is slavery - but if they voluntarily choose to help , it is A-okay .

For this reason , using violence against humans ( an immoral act , as humans are moral agents ) to prevent harm to animals ( a morally irrelevant act , since they are not moral agents ) purely for the sake of it is immoral .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Because your question is terrible . No sane man would say that the situation I described is voluntary , because it is not about being able to ~opt out~ using whatever convoluted definition for ~opting out~ you have . For an interaction to be voluntary , the rights of both parties must not be violated ( or threatened to be violated ) in any option . In my example , a house intrusion is not voluntary . I can choose to opt out and save my life by running away , but I make that decision under the threat of physical violence : if I do not run , I will be murdered , and in any case my property will be violated . There is no option in which my rights are respected . Because I just know you are trying to make a parallel to the state , lets examine that . It is easy to draw comparisons between the house intruder and the state : the state 's minions show up in my home one day and demand taxes . If I do not pay , I will eventually be jailed , and if I try to protect by freedom and property , I will be killed . Sure , I can choose to run to Somalia and abandon my home , but *there is still no option in which my rights are upheld* .

You ca n't say `` the state can tax you because it 's the state '' , it 's circular reason . Is it voting that determines the legitimacy of the state ? Then one would have to conclude that the Third Reich 's murder of innocents was legitimate , because it was voted into power . In fact , many democratically elected governments have committed atrocities , from slavery to genocide , and yet nobody would consider those acts voluntary .

Sure , my parents were not as 'extreme ' as I am , but they formed the base on which I could later build my beliefs - just like every parent teaches their kids that murder is wrong .

Aliencreature1,explainlikeimfive,"Fear and pain are not the cause of a heart attack during burning . When cells are destroyed ( like muscle ) , they release potassium into the bloodstream . Remember that potassium is one of the substances used for executions , as it stops the heart in high concentrations . But carbon monoxide poisoning is usually the cause of death . Blood uses a molecule called Hemoglobin ( Hb ) to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and carbon dioxide ( produced when oxygen is used to 'burn ' food in the cells ) from the rest of the body to the lungs to be exchanged . Normally , hemoglobin is of the form HbO2 ( when it carries oxygen ) or HbCO2 ( when it carries carbon dioxide ) , both of which are *reversible* . HbO2 can 'break up ' to form Hb and O2 ( which we want to get oxygen out of the blood and into the cells that need it ) , it can pick up CO2 to become HbCO2 , and then it can detach from the CO2 in the lungs to let it leave with the exhaled air . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) is produced by the burning of various materials , and can also bind to Hb - but it does so irreversibly . The bond between Hb and CO when they form HbCO is so strong that oxygen ca n't push CO away like it does with CO2 , and thus the blood loses its ability to carry oxygen to the rest of the body . This is bad for all tissues , but it primarily affects the brain ( which is very sensitive to changes in oxygenation ) or it can cause the heart to stop ( muscle uses a lot of oxygen to function ) . We measure the severity of CO poisoning by the percentage of Hb that is occupied by CO . Values & lt ; 20 % cause mild symptoms like headaches , mild disorientation and blurry vision , and it just gets more serious from there . Values & gt ; 60 % are considered lethal . So basically , it is asphyxiation , except that usually there 's plenty of oxygen in the air - the body just ca n't use it . Death has various definitions : the most simplistic one is that the heart stops beating , but resuscitation can be effective in many cases and bring someone back from 'death ' . Brain death will occur a few minutes after the heart stops . Other causes of death that can result from burns are the excess of potassium I mentioned before , other electrolyte imbalances , fluid loss ( burnt skin can not hold its water and it just evaporates , leading to effects similar to bloodloss ) , obstruction of the airways by swelling as a result of smoke inhalation and heatstroke , but these generally happen minutes/hours after the burn and not immediately .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,pics,"Those rare cancers are not what is making health expenses so huge . Smoking alone accounts for ~10 % of healthcare expenses in the US . Anyone who smokes , despite all of the warnings that it causes COPD , coronary disease and cancer should absolutely be charged insane fees for insurance . They did it to themselves . Obesity accounts for another ~20 % . We live in the age of the internet . The link between obesity and disease has been well documented and reported ad nauseam . The obese should absolutely pay more for insurance . The same could be said for many of the most common conditions . 5 % of the population uses up **50 % of the healthcare expenditure** , with most of those being the obese , smokers and the elderly . Especially the latter should save up for expected healthcare expenses , like they would save up for retirement . And you do *not* understand how insurance works . Insurance is meant to insure against unexpected damage , but on average , the insurance company **has** to make a profit on *every single client* . Think of it as a bet : the insurance company bets that you wo n't need medical care , you bet that you will need it . The insurance company would not make the bet if it knows that you will need medical care ( e.g . covering COPD expenses on smokers ) or if you count medical care that you *already* need ( preexisting conditions ) . It is not a redistributory mechanism to spread the costs , it is a way to protect yourself against the unexpected .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,pics,"You skipped the part where I said *on average* . It is a combination of probability with expense , in simplistic terms a weighted average . The insurance company has to balance the money that it charges ( 100 % probability ) with the money that it expects to pay out in the event of a healthcare problem . If the probability that a client will get an expensive healthcare problem is high , then it needs to charge higher so the client is still more profitable to have than not to have . To bring preexisting conditions as an example : preexisting conditions have a 100 % probability of expenses related to the primary condition itself , and a variably higher probability of other treatments that stem from it . So a preexisting condition of atrial fibrillation has a 100 % chance of the medications needed to treat it , and higher chances of stroke ( usually 1.3 - 15.2 % more than the healthy population ) . The insurance fees must include the guaranteed costs of the drug ( usually beta blockers ) , and the increased probability of a stroke and the incredible expenses that come with it . The 'alternative ' , charging everyone *else* more to cover it , is just another form of income redistribution and to call it any differently is dishonest . & gt ; I am talking about single payer health care , what are you talking about ? Single payer healthcare is the single stupidest idea since pineapple on pizza . My heart goes out to anyone who has fallen for the emotional rhetoric of the left , and I urge you to read up on the year-long waiting lists in the countries with public healthcare . If you want to improve access to healthcare , the solution is not to commence a massive theft campaign to get ~the rich~ to pay for everyone else , it is to get the government the fuck out of healthcare . 1 ) End drug patents . All of them . The patent system is a disgusting affront to the free market and the cause of many of the world 's troubles . CULPRIT : THE GOVERNMENT 2 ) Deregulate the medical field and end the AMA 's monopoly on medical licensing , deliberately designed to prop up physician salaries by keeping competition low . Let trained doctors from overseas work in America after a licensing exam , without having to compete for a residency that they have already completed . CULPRIT : THE GOVERNMENT 3 ) Deregulate insurance and let mutual aid societies rise again . They were far , far more effective than modern insurance , but they were legislated out of existence so insurance companies did n't have to compete with them . CULPRIT : THE GOVERNMENT 4 ) End Medicare/Medicaid , one of the biggest causes of expanding healthcare costs . Remember how government-backed tuition loans made college tuition skyrocket , because the state was going to pay *anything* they charged ? That 's Medicare/Medicaid and related programs . The costs of fields that are not covered by the government , like aesthetic surgery or dental , have kept up with inflation and have not exploded like the rest did .

Once , it would have taken tens of thousands of men and whole weeks to burn a city to the ground - now , it can be accomplished with the push of a button . Nuclear armaments are the epitome of that philosophy , a weapon so terrible that they have kept the major military powers of the world at relative peace for almost a hundred years . Imagine what would have happened during the Cold War if the threat of MAD had n't kept NATO and the Warsaw Pact in line . Indeed , in a hypothetical anarcho-capitalist society , 'defense spending ' could consist only of paying an insurance company to guarantee security . Said company could use the threat of a few dozen hidden nuclear missiles as its only tool . Any potential attacker would recognize that the spoils of attacking do not make up for the catastrophic loss of life of nuclear war , and the incentive to attack is suppressed by the incentive to not be reduced to a pile of radioactive ash .",Greek,Greek

The protomolecule is spreading already on-board , but the vessel is still functional and its crew have n't noticed . 2 ) The Cant moves to assist the Scopuli , it is destroyed by the Anubis . The Expanse Season 1 starts . 3 ) Shortly after , the heroes are picked up by the Donnager . The Anubis joins 5 other stealthships and attack it . Four are destroyed , two ( Anubis and another one , X ) survive . 4 ) The two surviving stealth ships separate and head towards Eros Station to set off the experiment . 5 ) The Anubis succumbs to the protomolecule before it can reach Eros . 6 ) Julie hides the Anubis and heads to Eros herself . 7 ) X ( the second stealth ship ) reaches Eros and finds Julie 's carcass , allowing them to begin the experiment . They monitor the massacre and then leave , heading to Thoth . 8 ) X is destroyed while defending Thoth Station . 9 ) X is pushed into the trade lanes .",Greek,Greek

It has always bugged me , because the torpedoes always seem to launch on their own power or with a tiny push ( using RCS to move to a safe distance before firing their main drives ) . In addition , unless my sense of direction was messed up , the recoil that Julie experiences is vertical . A torpedo launch would be horizontal , since they are shown to launch from the side .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"And there is also a fundamental difference with how insurance works . The goal of insurance ( any insurance ) is to protect against the *unexpected in the future* , not to pay for every conceivable cost related to a broad subject . If you buy car insurance , it wo n't pay for your gas ( like for example it should n't cover guaranteed expenses like regular physical exams - unless it expects to save costs later ) and it wo n't fix the broken light you 've had for a year ( like it would n't pay for conditions that predate it ) . Insurance also expects every single one of its customers to be a net positive to its balance . They may pay into a single pool , but they do n't subsidize each-other through income redistribution : their contributions are matched to the risk of expenses they may incur , according to prior conditions , habits and other factors . In an insurance system free of regulation , the 20-year-old athlete with no preexisting conditions , no history of smoking or drinking and regular check-ups will have to pay far less than the 50-something smoker who weighs 400 pounds and suffers from COPD ( due to a lifetime of destroying his lungs ) and chronic pancreatitis and alcoholic liver disease . In a universal healthcare system ( or insurance with the crap the ACA forced on the insurance companies ) , the healthy 20-something is forced to subsidize the quadruple CABG of Joe Porkrib and his 400 pounds of terrible habits and complete disregard for his own health , and for Jenny Openlegs who was too good for condoms and has to pay for daily doses of antiretroviral medications for her HIV infection . Coincidentally , the health-conscious parent that has vaccinated his children against polio has to pay more to subsidize the healthcare of the child of the moron who thought their kid was an immune superman who could n't be touched by polio . Universal healthcare and other redistributory systems of healthcare funding breed terrible habits , reduce the focus on personal responsibility for one 's own life - ~90 % of COPD cases are a result of chronic smoking - and punish those who lead a healthy lifestyle by making them pay more for fewer services . Free market healthcare fosters healthy habits instead , and reduces costs through competition *if barriers to entry are removed* and the insurance companies stop competing with the wasteful pockets of Medicare/Medicaid/etc . Because of their large market involvement , they essentially dictate prices , which end up being absurdly high for what the drug actually costs - and thus force American taxpayers to subsidize R & amp ; D for the rest of the world . ( Disclaimer : I am European . 'Silly ' Americans paying for my drugs works well for my wallet and all , but it 's fucking retarded and it needs to stop . )",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Shitstatistssay,"That 's dumb according to one metric , but not another . Likewise , one person paying 500 dollars in taxes and the other paying 9,500 for the same service is also dumb . Imagine if a store did this ! Would you pay 10 dollars for a burger to subsidize other people buying it for 1 ? I would n't . A flat ( not flat percentage , *flat* , as in the expenses are distributed equally amongst the population ) tax is essential to curbing government spending . If John Doe has to pay 50 % of his $ 10,000 , he has an incentive to vote against reductions in the budget .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"'Pure bad luck ' ? What the fuck ? I acknowledge that luck plays a role . It may even play a significant role . But you ca n't say that it 's pure bad luck that makes people poor , or at the very least you ca n't prove it with any degree of certainty higher than attributing poverty to poor choices and bad management of money . Most 'poor ' are not homeless with barely a set of clothes . They are caught in a cycle of poverty of their own making ( poor choices in education , lack of marketable skills , criminal records ) that is propagated by their own behavior ( expensive vices like alcoholism , smoking , gambling , overspending on non-essentials ) and exacerbated by the state . Remember that laws like minimum wage were not implemented to 'protect the workers ' , but to force blacks into poverty by making it impossible for them to compete with whites . The war of drugs has destroyed urban communities and ruined the lives of 'criminals ' that harmed nobody . Mutual aid societies , which provided affordable healthcare insurance to the poor , were legislated away by the government . Drug patents upheld by the state prevent competition from reducing pharmaceutical prices . The solution is not more state . The solution is *less* state in every sector . Some examples are to get rid of the government enforced monopoly of the AMA and allow physicians licensed in other countries to work in the US , get rid of patent laws , remove all barriers to entry in the insurance market and for the love of god privatize Medicare/Medicaid after breaking them to smaller companies . They are the single most important problem with US healthcare : if they are willing to pay anything for a drug/operation/etc. , then hospitals/pharmaceuticals will charge as high as possible , thus setting the price floor for the rest of the insurance companies .",Greek,Greek

You have access to the internet , the suppository of all data known to man , where the most clueless 13-year-old can learn how to write code . Minimum wage *was* , in fact , used to push blacks out of the market . Consider this : because a lot of people were racist in the era , they preferred to hire whites in their businesses . To compensate , blacks usually offered to work for a lower wage , which had several advantages for them : 1 . Some money is better than no money . 2 . Valuable work experience was gained , which let them negotiate better wages in the future . 3 . They often learned a skill that they could then apply on their own . Even the most racist redneck wo n't shun an extra dollar when it 's offered to them by the object of their hate , and so they hired black people , despite being racists . Prejudice is not profitable in capitalism , and thus is was chased away by market forces - enter whites . Because they did not want to compete with blacks , they lobbied for minimum wage . Suddenly , employers did not have to chose between 'expensive white ' or 'cheap black ' , they had to choose between 'white ' and 'black ' because the price floor was the same . Oh gee , I wonder who a racist would pick without a financial incentive ... ... .. Blaming their behavior on capitalism is a terrible excuse .

I remember reading somewhere that the top 10 % pays 70 % of the taxes in the US , which leaves a measly 30 % to be spread out over 90 % of the population . The problem is that increases in taxes and a corresponding increase in government expenses is mostly negatively felt by the middle/upper middle class , while the 'poor ' think that the government is helping them by subsidizing services for them . If you make people pay equal money for equal services , they will begin to demand to be exempted from services they do not use . They will demand efficiency .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Should vaccinations be mandatory ? No . Can employers , owners of schools and any other private entity demand vaccination ? Yes . Would I vaccinate my own children ? Damn right I would , and I would n't hang out with anti-vaxers .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"I know that there exist cases of side-effects . Every drug in medicine is a poison , even the most commonly used ones ( e.g . acetaminophen ) and when deciding whether or not to administer it , one has to weight the potential benefits with the potential risks . Vaccines are no different , and anyone who says they are is speaking out of their ass . For the record , I am a medical student , so I also do not discount the potential for my own bias . But I have reviewed the evidence , I have studied the physiology , and I have come to the conclusion that most vaccines ( there are some exceptions ) benefit more than they harm . Naturally , I also support the right of everyone else to do the research on their own and draw their own conclusions , and I do not *judge* anyone for not vaccinating their children . I consider it the wrong choice ( even with all the cronyism ) , but I acknowledge their right to do so and wish them well . But I want my ( future ) children to benefit from herd immunity in the event that they are part of the population segment that does not respond to the vaccine . That means schools that demand vaccinations , for example , and limiting contact with potential carriers of disease . I would n't avoid anti-vaxers because I think they are bad people , I would avoid them because I consider them a potential risk to me . ( Which is , of course , my responsibility to mitigate , I would n't dream of forcing anyone to vaccinate )",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"& gt ; OK , since you 've investigated it , what would be your position on a multi-use vial versus a single use vial ? Should n't the medical principle be the same between the two ? The issue here is that when parents in 1999 tried to change to the single use vials to avoid the mercury , the drug manufactures removed the option . This issue here is primarily financial . I do not know where you are from ( presumably the US ) , but I have every vaccine that I remember taking up to this day has come from a single-use vial . But I understand why there would be economic pressure to save money by using multi-dose vials . Those same economic pressures might result in hospitals choosing to use single-dose vials as multi-dose vials , but without the antimicrobial component , that is hazardous and creates an additional incentive to phase single-use vials out ( or at the very least include an antimicrobial ) . If the demand for single-use vials exists , then they will be produced . If it does n't , then they wo n't . It 's a problem for the market . & gt ; Also along those same lines , what is the difference between taking a single vaccine and taking a polyvalent vaccine with multiple in one shot ? Sure it avoids an extra needle jab , but that should be a parents choice . Again , when parents tried to do this , the drug companies removed the option and now only sell the polyvalent . The same applies here . Extra needle jabs are always a positive , but a company can not maintain two versions of the same product if they do not both make money . Different facilities and equipment are needed to produce univalent and polyvalent vaccines , and if only a minority purchases them , it is simply not worth it to keep making them . It is a market issue . In addition , no study has demonstrated that separating the vaccinations has any significant effect on anything . On the plus side , multivalent vaccines also mean fewer doses of the ( harmless ) chemical additives , sooo ... ? ? ? & gt ; Also since you bring up the effects of all drugs having dangers , then why are n't vaccines treated like other drugs ? Not only are drug companies 100 % immune from lawsuit , but they do n't have to do their testing against a true saline placebo . Surely as a medical student you can understand the value of testing a drug against a true placebo . Instead , vaccines are tested against the entire soup of chemicals as the control , only removing the actual infectious agent , but keeping all the noxious chemicals . Anyone interested in science can see that this is dishonest . Because the chemical being tested is the active substance , not its excipients . Those have already been proven safe by previous studies , you do n't reinvent the wheel in every drug trial . & gt ; I know you 're just a medical student still , but this is a common error that many people make . Herd immunity exists without vaccines . All that herd immunity means is that a population has survived the disease . So if 90 % of a population contracts a disease ( e.g . chickenpox ) , then there is 90 % herd immunity . Therefore with or without vaccines herd immunity will be present . The only difference is that vaccines achieve higher levels of herd immunity than will naturally occur . & gt ; Regardless of this though , you can still benefit from herd immunity while not vaccinating your children . As long as the rest of society complies with vaccination or there is a naturally high incidence of the disease , then you 're still enjoying the herd immunity . Therefore all you 're really saying is that you do n't want to be a free rider when it comes to herd immunity . Each disease has a different threshold of immune humans that is required to maintain herd protection . For smallpox , that threshold is at around 85 % , which has to include all of those who can not take the vaccine ( e.g . immunocompromised , allergic ) , those in which the vaccine did not generate immunity and those who refuse to take the vaccine . By choosing not to associate with those who do not vaccinate , you artificially raise your 'effective ' rate of immunization . It is not a perfect solution , but if for some reason your child is not immune ( e.g . the vaccine did not generate immunity ) , preventing contact with those who are known non-immunes protects them better than allowing them to mingle . As I have said multiple times , it 's a market thing . & gt ; If you take the time to learn about how vaccines work though , then you 'll see that live virus vaccine recipients become carriers for the disease and can shed the virus . Jonas Salk , the inventor of the polio vaccine , testified that the majority of people acquiring polio today come from vaccinated people than the non-vaccinated ( i.e . wild ) type . & gt ; Bill Gates is a pro-vax guy , giving polio vaccines to poor kids around the world . You 'll notice that when he makes a claim of reducing polio , he has to say `` wild type '' , since scientifically everyone knows that the vaccine induced disease still exists . So there are areas that had only a couple dozen cases of polio each year prior to vaccines , that now suffer from hundreds of cases . You are talking about the *oral* polio vaccine , one singular example of a live attenuated vaccine that caused disease . It was still found to be highly effective aside from a very rare adverse reaction , and parents should balance the benefits of live attenuated vaccines ( stronger immunity , longer protection ) against the risks . I challenge you to produce some sources for the `` hundreds '' of cases , because a whole total of 37 cases of polio were reported worldwide in 2016 according to the [ World Health Organization ] ( http : //www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ ) . Thirty years ago , 'wild type ' polio resulted in ~350000 cases . EVEN IF vaccination-induced polio accounted for all 37 cases of polio in 2016 , that is still **a hundred thousand times less than what it was before the vaccine** . It is not even worth comparing .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"& gt ; Have you heard of T-calls ? It 's the stuff that fails when people have AIDS . Current scientific theory is that T-cell immunity is more important , especially for long term memory . When vaccines were introduced , they knew nothing about T-cells . The drug companies persist with vaccines , because they do n't have a product to sell people that stimulates T-cell immunity . I am just going to stand on this because you are 100 % wrong . Different phases of immunity are effective against different diseases . B-cell central vaccines target pathogens that are primarily countered with B-cell immunity ( e.g . most bacteria ) . The diseases that we do n't have vaccines for ( or have only partially effective vaccines ) are the ones that rely primarily on T-cell immunity ( e.g . HIV , chlamydia , TB ) . Live attenuated vaccines are a product that stimulates all phases of immunity . The pharmaceuticals offer it , but it is just not feasible for all diseases yet . Just because the government did something does not make it bad . A broken clock is right 2 times every day .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Capitalism is not inherently unsustainable , eco-unfriendly or anything like that . Capitalism 's only defining feature to the distribution of resources is **preference** . If the free market produces unsustainable outcomes , it is because consumers ( a.k.a . `` the proletariat '' ) vote with their wallets to consume more . If it produces harmful outcomes to the environment , it is because consumers vote with their wallets that they care less about the environment than they do about cheap phones . And that 's okay . **That 's democracy . ** Democracy in its purest form . In the absence of a government to dictate winners and losers , capitalism is the perfect method for distributing finite resources , because it balances cost ( how many resources are needed for a good ) , supply ( how much there is of that good ) , demand ( how many people want that good ) and contribution ( how much these people have produced ) . It weights individual preferences and 'calculates ' appropriate distribution based on a decentralized market . In many ways , it is to socialism what evolution is to intelligent design . But let us see how pure capitalism would be sustainable . The claim that capitalism is inherently unsustainable is intellectually dishonest , because it ignores the massive riches of the solar system around us and fixates on our little corner of the world . There are asteroids out there with enough gold to produce building-sized , penis-shaped statues on the roof of every home . Enough water to turn Mars into an ocean . There is not a single resource that we can not find in absurdity in space , and the barriers to getting there keep being broken . A little over a hundred years ago , the mere thought of flying sounded absurd , and yet today we have sent men on the moon , rovers to Mars and probes beyond our solar system . Nuclear energy can power the entire world with only the tiniest environmental impact . There is no system that can harness man 's desire for *more* to get there faster than capitalism , even in its crony form . What is really holding us back is the state . The state is nothing more than a freeloader , a parasite that feasts on the great success of capitalism . The state sets the poor up for failure under the guise of protecting them ( labor laws , taxation ) , it deprives them of access to healthcare under the guise of protecting them ( the FDA , AMA , etc . ) and it artificially keeps the price of goods high by imposing artificial barriers to entry and propping up monopolies that would have otherwise lost to competition . It also constantly devalues its mandated currency by printing more of it , just so it can spend it on those same futile programs ( or bombing brown people ) . Those contradictions you are seeing are not capitalism . They are the disgusting worm that is lodged in capitalism 's intestines , sucking the nutrients before they can reach those who need them the most . Just look at the effects that government programs have had : the war on drugs has destroyed african-american communities in the USA , where deregulation would have offered safer , cheaper alternatives , mandated social insurance has destroyed mutual aid societies ( used mostly by the poor ) and made them completely dependent on the government for healthcare , and stringent intellectual property and patent laws have given pharmaceuticals the all-clear to price-gouge insurance companies , thus raising prices for everyone . Automation and capitalism are the reason that , in the western world , all but the most destitute of poor can live in luxury unheard of for feudal kings . Maybe 'trickle down ' has been overused by economics , but it is a FACT in the realm of luxury and technology . In the 80s and 90s , only the richest could afford a cellphone . Today , not to have one is a rarity . Capitalism is what did that : it is the system that exploits human greed and vanity , both very natural parts of our animal brains ( because we are animals , just animals that can go to space ) , and lets it lift up everyone else . Sure , socialism might work with a hive-mind species , but we are not it . Several generations grew up surrounded by socialist propaganda in the USSR , and yet they all came out as greedy and self-centered as all the rest . In the end , people will look out for their own self-interest ( rational or not ) , and capitalism is the only system that acknowledges that and channels it towards improving society .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Again this `` argument '' . Lets examine it critically . If I come into your house - **your property** - and point a gun at you , demanding that you give me half of your money as a protection fee , should you be forced to leave ? Because this is the exact same scenario . An armed thug ( the government ) is coming to my property , demanding a percentage of my income ( taxes ) , and threatening to toss me in a 3x2 box for all eternity if I refuse . Should I try to defend my liberty , I will be summarily executed by the state 's thugs . How does that differ at all ? Is it the color of the uniform ? Can I wear blue and demand your money ? Here 's a slightly modified version of a post I made a while back that explains why property must be absolute , and why the utilitarian ethics you espouse can not be taken seriously if we want a consistent moral code of conduct . I hope it is informative . & gt ; Consider the Trolley problem , one of the most frequently quoted philosophical mental exercises . In the problem , you have to choose between killing one man or allowing several to die . That is where you probably disagree with ancaps , and why you will probably never understand our ideology : we do not believe that killing one man is ever moral , even if we have to let a million men to die for it . It does not mean that we do not see the utility behind it , but we can not justify it morally . & gt ; I prefer the fat guy variation of the Trolley problem myself . There are five people tied to the tracks , and the only way to stop the incoming train is to toss a very fat man on its way , killing him but saving the five others . Would you do that ? We argue that harming one to save others is immoral , and the only proper choice to the dilemma is inaction ( or self sacrifice if permissible ) . It is not about utility , because using utility as justification could put slavery , rape and genocide in a positive light under the right circumstances . & gt ; If you do not agree with the concept of property , then I wo n't argue with you further , as there is absolutely no common ground , and you would be better off hanging around in ancom circles . But if we accept that property exists , then it must be absolute : it is a woman 's ownership over her own body that allows her to decide who she has sex with . She has no moral obligation to provide her property ( her body ) to others , and others have no right to take it by force . Suppose that , after a grand nuclear war , there are only a man and a woman left . But the woman does not want to have sex with the man ; if you are consistent about utility , then you must claim that saving an entire species if worth more than a woman 's right to her property , and you could justify rape . But since I assume you find rape as abhorrent and morally impermissible as any reasonable person , I will just go ahead and assume we agree that you ca n't have exceptions to property . Or you can go ahead and apply your morals inconsistently , which means you are just eyeballing morality on what ~feels~ right - emotions have no place in determining what is just . & gt ; Since property must be absolute ( re-read my 'last couple on earth ' argument ) , then stealing it for any reason is morally impermissible : we agree that violating a woman 's property to save the entire species is rape , and rape is immoral , and I do not see what could have greater ~utility~ than saving the species . Again , we are trying to form a consistent set of ethics that does not depend on one 's feelings . If property can not be violated to save the human species , then it surely can not be violated to save a subset of it . & gt ; This is why taxation ( a violation of property ) is not morally permissible , even when the goal is noble ( to improve the lives of others ) . A good result that stems from an immoral act can not be said to be moral , because it is fruit of the poisonous tree . Whether or not it 'works ' is irrelevant when we are talking about morality : slavery 'worked ' too , but I do n't see anyone campaigning for it .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"You are not being intellectually honest by ignoring my entire post and coming up with gotcha lines . If you are so certain about the truth of your beliefs , then make an effort to disprove mine . We ca n't *both* be right .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"It is clear that you are not here to have an actual conversation , you just want to yell catchphrases and feel better about being an authoritarian no different than the fascists you probably claim to despise . If you ever change your mind and decide to have a honest discussion , I 'll be here .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"The first mistake is in believing that legal equals moral , and that voting makes a difference in the context of morality . Remember , slavery was legal , it predated the people of the time , and the government openly facilitated it . I dare you to find me one man who agrees that slavery was moral . Adolf Hitler was voted for by the majority of German voters , and every single horrific act of genocide and human suffering performed under the Third Reich was **legal** . Rape is still legal , or at least punished with some stern words and no action , in some parts of the world . So I think we will agree that whatever is legal is not necessarily moral . In addition , something can be moral but not legal : in some countries in Europe , if I am attacked by a home intruder and kill him in self-defense , I may get sent to jail . Defending my life from a violent attack is obviously moral , but it is not legal . In many parts of the world , the act of spending one 's life with the one he/she loves regardless of gender ( homosexual relationships ) is illegal , but I think you will agree it is not immoral . Since moral acts can be illegal , and legal acts can be immoral , we have to conclude that legislation has nothing to do with morality . Almost all of these laws are approved by the majority , so the opinion of the 51 % of the population has nothing to do with morality either . Consider the following thought experiment : tomorrow , after a passionate speech by Adolf Hitler Jr. on television , 51 % of the population of the world decide that they want to exterminate the jews . They have a majority - but is genocide suddenly moral ? They also decide to ban all ownership of Disney cartoons . Is watching the Lion King immoral because the majority banned it ? So morality is independent of both legislation and majority vote . It is logical to extend that to a more universal statement : *morality is independent of legislation , as well as the opinion of any number of people* . Rape is immoral no matter what the government and/or the majority says . Now then . If something is **a right** , then it *must* be moral . You can not have the right to rape , plunder and shoot infants . In other words , nobody can have the right to perform an immoral act . So we must agree that morality is a necessary condition for a right to exist . Morality must also be universal . There can be no exception to the statement that 'rape is immoral ' , because otherwise , morality has no meaning . If an act is immoral in one situation , then it **must** be immoral in all situations regardless of personal feelings . We ca n't eyeball morality based on what feels right , because then we are not talking about a consistent system of ethics . We have all of the information we need , so lets derive a conclusion from it . 1 ) Moral = Universal 2 ) Legal =/= Moral 2 ) Popular =/= Moral Theft is the forceful removal of property from its rightful owner . If I show up to your house with a gun and demand a percentage of your income , then I can not be said to be acting morally , therefore , **theft is immoral** . If you disagree , please do give me your home address , I need a new car . Taxation is an act of forceful removal of property ( a percentage of money ) from its rightful owner ( the taxpayer ) . Since the definitions are the same , taxation falls under the wider umbrella of theft : although not all theft is taxation , all taxation is , indeed , theft . If all taxation is theft , then all taxation is immoral . The government claims that it has a right to tax you , because it is legal . These are contradictory statements : if taxation is immoral , and legislation can not turn an immoral act into an immoral one , then taxation can not be a right . The government claims that it derives that right from the will of the majority , but as we saw earlier , the majority can not make an immoral act moral . Therefore we can only conclude that the government has no actual right to tax anyone .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"That is one great way to deal with punishment , although I have to wonder why people cling so much to the idea of incarceration . Smaller crimes can be handled with restitution of the victim .

Both of these systems can co-exist .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"& gt ; Why they have authority ? Because people vote them in to have the right to collect taxes in our economy . You claimed that the government has the right to collect taxes . I argued that it does not .

Lets try to replace a word or two and see how similar this is to the victim blaming of women abused by their husbands . & gt ; Its moral because NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO STAY , YOU CAN LEAVE WHENEVER AND NO LONGER BE ABUSED BY YOUR HUSBAND . It would be Immoral if you could not leave . Your entire argument depends on the assumption that the government owns the land . Private land ownership predates the existence of organized states , from the time of prehistoric cavemen who used giant clubs to bash the heads of intruders to pulp . People owned property before the government appeared . If the government stole that government from them by force , then it has just as much claim to it as I do to a stolen car .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Alright , I 'll bite . Why is rape wrong ? Seriously . Convince me . Give me a compelling , consistent argument that provides a good explanation of why refusing to have sex with someone is moral . The statist answer would be to say that 'because it 's illegal ' , but I am not asking about legality , I am asking about morality . And I have demonstrated several times in this sub that legality =/= morality . Or perhaps you are an 'anarcho'-communist . Is the human body not one of the most effective , adaptable means of production that exist ? Should it not be socialized for the benefit of all humanity , including the care of peoples ' sexual urges ? Statist or ancom , my ultimate question is the same . What is it that makes it immoral for others to have sex with me without my consent , but gives me the authority to decide who to have sex with , or what to drink , or what to eat ? The obvious answer would be `` it 's your body '' , but that implies ownership - property . And because there is no metaphysical quality that separates the human body from the rest of the material world , property either applies to all material objects , or none . You ca n't have à la carte morality . Fundamentally , rape and trespass are the same violation , just of different severity : they are violation of property . I own my body , thus I can dictate how and by whom it will be used , and I own my land , thus I can dictate how and by whom it will be used . Trying to separate one of the two means you are picking and choosing whatever your ~feels~ tell you , and that is not morality , that is rationalizations to justify taking the property of others and being able to sleep at night at the same time .

In addition , with the unlimited access to information in today 's era , putting out BOLOs and ostracism reports for the whole world to see has become as easy as pushing a button . We should n't kid ourselves by wishfully thinking that Ancapistan would be a utopia . There will still be murders . But for those cases where private defense agencies fail ( which I believe will be very rare due to market pressure ) , the freedom to defend one 's property comes into play .

This is just one example of why utilitarianism is a dead end . Moral systems must , first and foremost , be universal : they apply to everyone in the same way . Utilitarian ethics are in that regard doomed to fail over and over again *because nobody can agree on the measure of utility* . Lets assume that , through some advanced scientific process , a million people could be sacrificed so the remaining 6.99 billion would become 1 % happier . What 's the specific ratio of people to gained happiness that is acceptable for you ? *Nobody will be able to agree to a number* . Some will say none - but then that is not maximizing utility . I may say that sacrificing 6.99 billion people so I could reach the nirvana of happiness is moral , because I chose that as my measure of utility . Is a a system of morality that can justify rape , genocide and torture really moral ? I think not .",Greek,Greek

Your brand of pseudo-utilitarian ethics and belief system so intimately linked with ~~~social capital~~~ barely deserves the title . You would argue for genocide , mass rape and the tossing of children in canyons if the perceived utility of those horrific acts somehow `` '' '' '' justified '' '' '' '' it . You claim to base your stances on evolution when you know nothing about it , and the r/K selection theory you spout as fact has been dismissed by researchers over , and over , and over again .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,I 'm actually completely fine with open borders *as long as the welfare system is dismantled first* and the power of the legislative is severely restricted .,Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"There is nothing wrong with democratic processes *when they are not forced* . It is similar to how a company 's shareholders can vote , and not a violation of the NAP , as these were the terms that were signed on an explicit contract . In the end , it 's up to the property owner to decide . Personally , I would outsource management to a relevant firm that can maximize the returns on my investment ( which includes keeping the residents happy ) , and perhaps intervene on a few key issues that I care about . But other property owners may pick other management styles , from democracy , to autocracy , to tossing coins to determine the outcome of debates . None of them is *immoral* , as in this case no violence is used , and I do n't think they can be placed in a gradient of morality . We are talking about voluntary arrangements here .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"There is no 'public property ' . There is either unclaimed property ( no rules other than the NAP apply ) or private property ( the rules of the owner ( s ) apply ) . So the answer is very simple . 1 ) In unclaimed property : allowed . There is no victim , and bad aesthetics certainly do not count as aggression , so unless he starts spreading the love all over random people , he can do whatever he pleases ( pun unintended ) . 2 ) In his own property , even in public view : allowed , duh , unless a voluntary contract states otherwise ( even then , it is not aggression though ) . 3 ) In other peoples ' property : their land , their rules . I may not like the image of a naked dude walking around with his junk in hand , but I for one will stand for his right to do that as long as he is not aggressing on anyone and their property .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"In statist terms , you are right , but where the state is involved I will always err on the side of freedom rather than control . I can think of things that hurt my aesthetics more than some guy wanking in the street , and he is not harming anyone .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"From what I have seen in your responses , you suffer from the classic socialist/UBI/etc . problem of focusing exclusively on the results . You see what you perceive as a problem , in this case the automation of labor , and you come up with a solution ( Universal Basic Income ) , declare it as good and figure you can just handwave the immorality of the process away because of good intentions . It does not work that way . You can have the most noble of intentions , and the most perfect of results , and they would still be immoral if immoral actions were taken to achieve them . Your idea of a mandatory Universal Basic Income relies on the violent theft that is taxation , but you handwave it away , because according to you the ends justify the means . Under that light , you could justify the most horrific of acts , even slavery and genocide . That is our fundamental difference . We do not believe that the ends ever justify the means . An immoral act is immoral even if done for the best of intentions . That is why we are against UBI , not because we hate the poor . On your specific questions . Anarcho-capitalism is , at its core , simply the absolute respect for private property . Violence against people and property is forbidden , and enforced either through self-defense , private security agencies ( that may function much like today 's police but more efficiently and cheaply ) , and voluntary exclusion of criminals ( shop owners can refuse to deal with known shoplifters , or allow them into their shops , for example ) . It is the system of *anti* trust : I do not trust anyone ( especially the government ) to be good by default , so I do not give them a pass to use violence . We would have technological development , of course , and the automation of labor would be allowed because it does not constitute violence . But in such a society , one must not assume that automation will be a bad thing : in addition to reducing the need for labor , it also *crushes* the costs of goods , and creates new avenues for labor . Do n't look at today 's model of labor as the desired norm : if everything becomes automated , then prices will be so cheap that a day 's work might be able to give you a year 's worth of essentials . Charity also becomes much cheaper , because a tiny donation can feed many more . You could have a *voluntary* Universal Basic Income . The argument about monopolies has been used a lot , but the assumption is that monopolies are always *bad* . For one , large corporations are inefficient due to huge administrative costs . Plus , if a company raises the price/reduces the quality of its product to exploit its monopoly , harming the consumer , it opens the field for a competitor to swoop in and take its market share .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Thank you for giving your answer to the Trolley problem , it saves me the effort of asking . In the problem , you have to choose between **killing** one man or allowing several to die . That is where you disagree with ancaps , and why you will probably never understand our ideology : we do not believe that killing one man is ever moral , even if we have to let a million men to die for it . It does not mean that we do not see the utility behind it , but we can not justify it morally . I prefer the fat guy variation of the Trolley problem myself . There are five people tied to the tracks , and the only way to stop the incoming train is to toss a very fat man on its way , killing him but saving the five others . Would you do that ? We argue that harming one to save others is immoral , and the only proper choice to the dilemma is inaction ( or self sacrifice if permissible ) . It is not about utility , because using utility as justification could put slavery , rape and genocide in a positive light under the right circumstances . If you do not agree with the concept of property , then I wo n't argue with you further , as there is absolutely no common ground . But if we accept that property exists , then it *must* be absolute : it is a woman 's ownership over her own body that allows her to decide who she has sex with . She has no moral obligation to provide her property ( her body ) to others , and others have no right to take it by force . Suppose that , after a grand nuclear war , there are only a man and a woman left . But the woman does not want to have sex with the man ; if you are consistent about utility , then you *must* claim that saving an entire species if worth more than a woman 's right to her property , and you could justify rape . But since I assume you find rape as abhorrent and morally impermissible as any reasonable person , I will just go ahead and assume we agree that you ca n't have exceptions to property . Or you can go ahead and apply your morals inconsistently , which means you are just eyeballing morality on what ~feels~ right - emotions have no place in determining what is just . Since property must be absolute ( re-read my 'last couple on earth ' argument ) , then stealing it *for any reason* is morally impermissible : we agree that violating a woman 's property to *save the entire species* is rape , and rape is immoral , and I do not see what could have greater ~utility~ than saving the species . Again , we are trying to form a consistent set of ethics that does not depend on one 's feelings . If property can not be violated to *save the human species* , then it surely can not be violated to save a subset of it . This is why taxation ( a violation of property ) is not morally permissible , even when the goal is noble ( to improve the lives of others ) . Universal Basic Income would only be moral if every single one of the people who pay for it consent . Whether or not it 'works ' is irrelevant when we are talking about morality : slavery 'worked ' too , but I do n't see anyone campaigning for it . Monopolies are not inherently bad . In a truly free market , they are harmless , and I will explain why in a bit . The thing that makes monopolies so powerful and terrible is *government* . The government gives corporations the power to legislate themselves into the market , and increasing laws and regulations only make it harder for competitors to crush their dominance . See the patent system as an example of regulations gone terribly wrong . By contrast , lets examine a monopoly in the absence of the state . Ducky 's Plastic Duck corporation has been a monopoly in the rubber duck market for a few years . Producing a plastic duck costs 1 dollar , and with overhead required to running the corporation , paying back on initial loans and giving benefits to the employees , DPD must sell rubber ducks above 2 dollars to make a profit , and they do that with a healthy profit margin by selling at 3 dollars . Customers are glad to pay 3 dollars per duck , and the quality is satisfying - everybody is happy . One day , DPD 's CEO , Andrew Duckface , has an epiphany : because DPD has a monopoly , it can double the price at 6 dollars , and make the plastic ducks out of recycled chewing gum to save on costs , more than quadrupling profits ! The customers , of course , are not happy to pay 6 dollars for a terrible plastic duck that gets stuck on their hair and smells like somebody 's onion tofu . Peter DeLaDuck , an entrepreneur , sees an opening in the market : with some initial capital , which he borrows from a bank , he starts Peter 's Duckwares , a startup that can start producing quality rubber ducks at a total cost of 2 dollars per duck . They easily undercut DPD 's price of 6 by selling at 4 , and suddenly , there is no more monopoly ! A third competitor swoops in and innovates a solution to produce quality ducks at a lower cost , and he undercuts Peter 's Duckwares at 3 dollars per duck . DPD can either adapt by increasing the quality of its product and lowering its prices , or it can go bankrupt . The market has taken care of the problem ! Now imagine there is a government in place . Andrew Duckface , the CEO of DPD , hires several lobbyists to encourage congress to pass laws that regulate duck manufacturing . Now , a costly license is required to sell rubber ducks , and the licenses are limited to just a handful . In addition , a heap of paperwork is required to start a company , hire employees and do business , and because now all workers *must* belong to a union , the union leaders can be bribed to protest any competitors . Duckface patents the most efficient production processes , preventing others from using them even if they are simple , and now the barriers for entry are so high that DPD can raise prices as much as it wants without a competitor showing up . This is how government corrupts the market .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"First of all , you need to realize why , when arguing with a utilitarianist , you are not going to convince him . Utilitarianism is the same brand of cultism as marxism . They both rely on vagueness , and the sham that is the objective theory of value . Since there is no mutually agreed upon measure of utility , they can shift the goalposts as much as they want and claim they are being consistent . You ca n't fight against them because they can change the battlefield at whim . When you argue with them , you are arguing for the sake of your crowd , in the hopes that a few open-minded folks will see reason . I think that trying to take utilitarianists on on a fight of whether taxes are a net positive to utility or not is pointless , because the *best* outcome you can get is a 'lets agree to disagree ' , and you will have let the audience get sucked into the cultist rants . No , the best solution is to attack utilitarianism as a philosophy , to discredit it by displaying that a ) horrible things can happen under utilitarianist justification and b ) not even utilitarianists know what utility is . Go for the low-hanging fruit . 1 ) If killing a million people would make the remaining 6.99 billion 1 % happier , would that be justified under utilitarian morals ? After all , if we consider that 7,000,000,000 people get a 1 % increase in utility , and 1,000,000 people get a -100 % decrease in utility , the sum is positive - therefore , mass murder to make people just a bit happier is justified , as it provides a positive increase in utility . If they claim that utility is not calculated like that , then ask them to provide an accurate measure , and then adjust your numbers . They probably wo n't be able to give anything concrete , so call them out on it . 2 ) The easiest way to make them seize up is to use their own ideology to justify rape . Suppose that , after a grand nuclear war , there are only a man and a woman left on the planet . But the woman does not want to have sex with the man ; if your opponent is consistent about utility , then he must agree that saving an entire species is worth more than a woman 's right to her property - her body - and her rape would be justified on the grounds of utility . Produce your best evil laugh as the utilitarianist tries to backpedal on his previous definition of utility . It is very easy to create absurd scenarios where utilitarianism fails as a moral compass because it has as much consistency as the crap of a pigeon with dysentery . Fire away .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"As far as immigration goes , I reject state borders . The only borders that exist are those of private property , and their owners get to dictate who gets in and who does not . In a stateless society , the only 'restrictions ' on immigration should be a ) private property and b ) voluntary contracts . The problem with immigration in the context of a state is that the income of the original inhabitants is stolen to support the immigrants . I am against taxation on principle , but I *at least* expect what is stolen from me to be used to provide services to *me* , not people who have paid nothing into this ponzi scheme . In addition , those new immigrants are more likely to vote in favor of extending state powers , and in the process directly harm my liberty .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Practical justification does not equal moral justification . If I was about to starve to death , I would steal to feed myself . But I would not consider the theft to be any more moral than me stealing a plasma TV , and my victim would be morally justified to shoot my sorry ass for trying to take his property without his permission . So yes , the man trying to violently seize the means of production is immoral , regardless of the reasons . Now , on the topic of automation , if products become as easy to produce as pressing a button , then nothing stops a bunch of people from pooling a few resources together and buying a machine that produces said products . After all , the machine itself will be hella cheap , because it will be so easy to make - automation ! The automation of labor will not happen overnight , and there will be plenty of time for people to adapt . In addition , if we assume that you have somehow achieved your 'dystopia ' of completely automated production , it becomes incredible feasible to colonize the stars . Nothing stops people from pooling together a few resources to buy construction time on an automated production machine , make a ship and head off to the nearest habitable planet , where they can have their own natural resources and means of production . What , you think that we will suddenly automate production in one week , but make no progress in other technologies ?",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"I would be more sympathetic to someone who would vote to restrict state power , but the point still stands . If money has to be stolen to support them , then I do n't agree . And I am not from the US , so when I say state , I mean state as in country . I reject borders imposed by governments , be those federal , state or county . And ideally , I want the state to simply not exist , and restrict nothing . I would be in favor of *not taxing people , period* , even if it was to treat lung cancer . A better analogy would be that I would not want my tax money to be used to treat lung cancer caused by smoking , in the same way that I am fine with immigrants as long as they do not collect welfare and/or vote to empower the government . My personal preferences are different than morality though . The government has no moral justification to restrict immigration and/or smoking , as it has no moral justification to tax . I just do n't want to make the issue worse .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"This does n't happen in a vacuum , the world wo n't suddenly transition to automated production in one night . Anyone with half a brain will see what 's happening and buy their own automatic fabricator , or make one at home ( see homemade 3D printers ) , and companies will sell them because the profit they make will be huge . See other technological revolutions as an example . When the press , mechanical farming equipment and robotic manufacturing machines were invented , they were not hoarded , they were sold . 3D printers too . There is no reason to assume automated manufacturing will be any different when all the data suggests otherwise . Plus , most ancaps do n't believe in intellectual property . If you ca n't buy an autofabricator , get together with a bunch of engineer friends and build your own .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"The difference is in what I want and what I perceive as moral . I do not want immigrants to move into the country to take welfare , but I do not believe the state has any moral justification to prevent them from doing it . It has an obligation to *not give them welfare* though . Similarly , I do not want people to smoke , get lung cancer and use my tax money to treat it , but I do not believe the state has any moral justification to prevent them from smoking . It has an obligation to *not pay for their treatment* . I agree that the smaller/more local the administration , the better , on any issue . You will find no argument there . I do not want the *state* , as in a government at any level , to violently impose border controls on anyone , but I agree that smaller governments more closely reflect the desires of the local populace . In the end , I guess I phrased my original comment wrong . I am not against immigration on any level ( as long as private property is not being violated ) . I am against immigrants ( well , everyone ) collecting welfare . I would *prefer* that , in the presence of a welfare system , immigrants did not move into the country , or at the very least not be eligible for welfare , but I would not support a government initiative to keep them out with violence . What I want and what I find morally permissible are different .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"To have closed borders , you must have a state . By definition , an ancap is against the existence of a state for any purpose . The only borders an ancap should support are private property borders : the 'immigrant rape-gangs ' are free to move in unowned space , but they can expect lead if they try to cross the borders of my property without my consent . In Ancapistan with open borders , the rapes would have never happened . The city would have belonged to a COLA that could have vetted anyone living there by whatever standards it chooses , and private defense agencies would have enforced that and shot any raving 'rape gangs ' before they crossed the fence . Stop trying to reduce this into a binary question of 'closed borders or mass rape ' , because a third , effective , stateless option exists .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"First of all , I do not disagree with the concept of closed borders *in the presence of a state* , or at least in the presence of a mandatory social welfare system . If I am being stolen from , I certainly do n't want that money to be used to provide services to anyone other than myself , especially those who do not pay into the system themselves . But I do not want to make living in a state better , I want to abolish that and reaffirm the absolute respect for private property . Giving the state more powers ( namely the power to control movement of people ) , while potentially having positive effects , is still going to feed the bloated monster that is government . You can not point out a single thing and proclaim it the cause of all evil in the world . Open borders may have contributed to the rapes , but we are looking at several failures of the state at once , not an isolated open/closed border binary . We are being forced to pay for a police force that is completely ineffective at its job , our rights ( I live in Europe ) to bear arms and defend ourselves have been eroded into non-existence , and private property is being commandeered to house those immigrants . I agree , all of these are factors that contributed , but you seem to exclusively focus on the first and ignore the rest . Changing either of the other factors would have worked just as well to prevent the rapes : if self-defense was not criminalized in Europe ( I can be sent to jail for shooting a home intruder and for owning the gun in the first place ) , the victims would have been given a fighting chance . If private defense agencies had replaced the police , then their effectiveness would have been a requirement for their existence - a failure of the police only gets it more funding , but a failure of a corporation destroys it . I would argue that you **have** to choose between the right to bear arms and Rotherham , or the right to hire a private defense agency and Rotherham , just as much as you have to choose between closed borders and Rotherham . Now , on borders in an ancap society , I do n't disagree with you . Whatever COLA you sign is your prerogative , and as long as it it not violently enforced on me when outside your property , I could n't care less about your stance on immigration . Your land , your rules . You will find no disagreement there .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"As others have said , the only borders an Ancap should support are those of private property that belongs to physical individuals , as they are the only ones who can have rights . The government is an artificial entity that has no free will , and by extension can not hold property . But I agree that , in the presence of a welfare state , open borders mean that the government is stealing to provide services to others , and not those that it stole from . But in Ancapistan , feel free to sign whatever COLA regarding immigration you want . It 's your property , and I am not paying for it .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Alright , so ? Nobody has a right to life . Your only right is to not be *killed* by others ( unless it 's self-defense ) , but you do not have a right to be kept *alive* . Healthcare is exactly like any other good , in that someone has to provide it : nobody has a right to be fed , clothed , given water or medicine , including vaccines . Consider the alternative . Should be kill farmers who refuse to share their product with the poor ? How about doctors , should they be held at gunpoint until they provide medical care ? Are you seriously going to advocate for **slavery** ? Of course , humans are social creatures , so we will help each-other when given a choice , but voluntary assistance and support has nothing to do with rights . And the only reason vaccines are expensive is because the government is both making it excessively complex to develop them ( just the regulatory hoops that pharmaceutical companies have to jump through to get to human trials are insane ) and by directly subsidizing the cost and warping the market . You ask what would happen to a vaccine that cost $ 1000 . Lets take that to the extreme : what if a vaccine costs $ 1,000,000 ? What about $ 1,000,000,000 ? Should all be forced to pay a billion dollars so other people can be vaccinated ? And what of the benefit : vaccines are not 100 % effective . Should we all be forced , at gunpoint , to pay a billion dollars for a vaccine with a 50 % success rate ? What about a 1 % success rate ? The answer is clearly no . Utilitarian thought on this ( and every ) subject will inevitably fail , as it can not precisely calculate the cost of a human life in any morally acceptable way . Value is subjective , and that includes the value of life . In the end , the market will determine the equilibrium price : if a vaccine is too expensive , then it wo n't be used , and cheaper replacements will pop up . If , in a hypothetical scenario where the price bottleneck is manufacturing , it truly costs a million dollars to produce a dose of a vaccine , then it simply wo n't be used . Death happens . We can either bury our head in the sand and keep screaming that diseases are oppressing us , or realize that even in a perfect society , you ca n't improve everyone 's life .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"You mistaken freedom with violence . 1 ) Self mutilation should be treated as a health problem , not a crime .

You are free to do whatever you want to your own body , but not to the body of others . The moment you attack somebody else , you are a criminal . 3 ) I absolutely do not advocate pedophilia , as I answered above .

Similarly , using media that was produced in such a manner is facilitating a crime . What we can not ban is thoughts . I assume you have not read the novel 1984 , so I wo n't reference thoughtcrime any further , but you ca n't put people to jail for thinking about something . Everybody has violent thoughts : I , for one , have wished death on several fellow drivers on the road in moments of frustration . And that 's ok - I am not harming anyone !

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"First of all , this is a topic that is debated even within Libertarian circles , but the consensus is that a parent can not use ( or authorize ) violence on his children . That includes sexual violence . The extent to which that is forbidden is still a matter of discussion , because there are issues with forbidding a parent from giving his child any medication against their will ( even life-saving ) , but I think we 'll all agree that giving drugs to children without any therapeutic intent is immoral and should be illegal .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"We still have a long way to go towards a libertarian society , and those debates will have no doubt been resolved by then . But moving in the opposite direction ( more laws ) is not the right way . If you want an example of how bans do n't work , look at the Prohibition . Did people stop drinking ? No . But peoples ' lives were destroyed , many of them were murdered by the government using drinks tainted with methanol ( a deadly poison ) , and because drinking was illegal people could n't be treated for alcoholism without being sent to jail . How are drugs any different ?",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"First of all , you have to realize that , for *any* service , someone *must* pick up the tab . It is an economic certainty that ca n't be legislated away . When someone is cared for by a doctor , someone will pay for the time and resources devoted . If the government pays the doctor for his services , then the taxpayer is paying for it . If the hospital is not allowed to turn away really sick people , then the hospital is paying for it , and by extension the hospital 's staff and patients that will have to accept pay cuts and/or increased prices to make up for the loss . If the doctor is forced at gunpoint to provide the treatment , **he** is the one paying with his time and materials . So the notion of free healthcare , even at the emergency level , is a sham that falls apart upon critical examination . Because we ca n't put a value on human life , we also can not determine a universal 'price ' that is fair to save it : if there was a magical drug that can 100 % save the life of a stroke victim , but it cost $ 1 billion to produce , should the taxpayer have to pay for it ? The real answer to the problem of healthcare is that , in the absence of a violently enforced welfare state , the charity of others and reciprocity towards the community can help those in need . A local hospital has a vested interest in providing emergency medical care to dying people : it arguably costs very little ( I am a medical student , and the stuff we use in the ER is cheap ) , provides great PR value in return , and dead people make poor customers in the present and in the future . In addition , doctors who let people die for not being able to afford basic ER services would be shunned by their own community . Charity organizations can pay for expensive treatments , and if all else fails , there are loans and healthcare insurance ( which would be much cheaper in a free , competitive market not muddled up by the state ) . The exact same things apply to education . Someone *has* to pay for it , be that the teacher by becoming a slave ( he pays with his time and labor ) , the school 's customers , or the taxpayer . In a free market , universities and schools will have to balance their need to attract geniuses ( which add to their prestige ; you do n't dream of going to MIT because of its campus , but because of the alumni and their prestige ) and the need for financing . Some may focus on one end , by providing cheap tuition to those with high academic standards - and thus investing in their own prestige - while others may focus on educating dumb , rich kids . The market will eventually find an equilibrium that is acceptable to all . Education was not always so expensive . It is government meddling in the market that made it so . The government , by providing these favorable loans for tuition to everyone with a heartbeat , gave the colleges the signal that they can charge however much they want and the state will pay for it . The student is happy , because they do n't have to work for college , but the true cost is concealed from them until they actually have to pay back the loan . Take away the government , and universities would have to drastically lower their tuition or suffer through a lack of students .",Greek,Greek

This is not a debate about the necessity of deontology , because we 'd both be preaching to the choir . What I do disagree with is the notion that stating a preference for more freedom is immoral . A man who is being violently assaulted is not being immoral by begging the gang to only take his possessions , nor is he consenting to the theft : he is trying to reduce the magnitude of the violence he is being subjected to . He has no moral obligation to accept death at the hands of his assailants . Consider a different example . Say that you and nine other people are kidnapped by some gang , lined up against a wall , and told that you **will** be shot . You know that it is a certainty . The gang outmans you , outguns you and has you tied up so tight you can barely breathe .

Sure , accepting death at the hands of the gang is not immoral , and no man can be called immoral for **inaction** , but voting to be beaten instead of shot is also not immoral . You are not voting to reduce someone 's freedom to increase yours , you are voting for a net increase in freedom . Voting **to increase the oppression of others** is immoral , as it is the same as hiring a thug to beat up your neighbor . But voting **to decrease the oppression of others** is not immoral .

Aliencreature1,CapitalismVSocialism,"Wages are not exploitation . But lets start at the beginning . & gt ; Value noun val·ue \ˈval- ( ˌ ) yü\ ( Merriam Webster Online Dictionary ) & gt ; 1 : a fair return or equivalent in goods , services , or money for something exchanged & gt ; 2 : the monetary worth of something : market price & gt ; 3 : relative worth , utility , or importance & lt ; a good value at the price & gt ; & lt ; the value of base stealing in baseball & gt ; & lt ; had nothing of value to say & gt ; Every single definition of value relevant to economics includes *relative* and *subjective* . That is because value does not exist in a vacuum : if no sentient life existed in the universe , then gold , water and oil would have no value , because nobody had assigned it to them . To claim that value is a natural quality of matter is to ignore its historic definition . Feel free to invent some imaginary word about it , but *value* is subjective . In addition , equating value to labor fails in the simplest of thought experiments : if I dig a hole , and then I fill it again , did I produce value ? Clearly not . Value is a **subjective** measure of what someone is willing to trade for something . Lets say that I am allergic to peanuts : they are useless to me . They have zero value , no matter how much labor went into creating them . But a lover of peanut butter will value them greatly . Insulin shots may be worthless to me , as I have no use for them , but a diabetic will find them incredibly valuable . So we have to agree that value is subjective and is irrelevant to labor . Labor *can* have a value , as I would trade something to have someone fix my computer for example , but it is not the *definition* of value . Since I clearly own my body ( otherwise , I 'd love it if you could send me a few spare kidneys in case I need them ) , and I own my labor ( you ca n't claim that someone is being exploited for his labor without agreeing that he owns said labor ) , then I should be free to give that labor to anyone . In return , he can offer me something that he values *less* than my labor ( my wage ) , but that I value *more* than my labor . Both parties participate in a mutually beneficial transaction , in which value is created for both of them . I gave something of relatively low value ( my labor ) for something of relatively high value ( my wage ) , and my employer gave something of relatively low value ( my wage ) for something of relatively high value ( my labor ) . *But wait ! If I do not sell my labor , I will die from hunger ! * You will also die from hunger if you sit on a couch all day and do absolutely nothing to sustain yourself . Nobody has a right to live , because that implies others have an obligation to keep him alive , even if he does nothing . It is also impossible to ever receive the full value of your labor due to the laws of thermodynamics , so even an ancom society would not be free of exploitation as you seem to define it . I posted the piece below a few hours ago , and I think it should demonstrate my point . & gt ; Due to the inefficiency of biochemical processes , you are not receiving the full objective value ( hue hue hue ) of your labor .

Parents have no right to evict their children from the crib or from the womb and let them die . Instead both parents , the father as well as the mother , owe them support and protection from harm . '' Even if we agree with the other 5 points ( I do n't , but lets roll with it ) , this point is not libertarian . **Nobody owes anybody anything** simply for existing . From a purely deontological point of view , you could argue against specific methods of abortion , but the principle itself remains consistent with the right to **not** be violently forced to provide support for others .

I am aware that not all schools of libertarianism agree there , but deontology is the only consistent means of interpreting rights . The right of the mother to control her own property ( her body ) **must** be held to be absolute , even when it conflicts with the interests of others , because any other perspective is doomed to be inconsistent and allow abhorrent acts such as rape to be justified given sufficient utility .

I firmly believe that the NAP must be held absolute , because the alternative option is neither moral nor libertarian . Suppose that we accept that the NAP can be violated in some cases : **who will decide which those cases are** ? Without an argument from religion ( which should not apply to ethics discussions ) , there is no omniscient being that can magically determine which exceptions are moral and which or not - so we need a system to determine that . That system will , of course , be arguing from utility , and we run into the moral pitfalls of utilitarianism that I describe in the above links .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,ProLifeLibertarians,"As an anarcho-capitalist , I too want the government completely removed from the issue of abortion ( and all other issues ) . No ifs , no buts , no nothing . I may be pro-choice , but nobody has a right to force people who are pro-life to pay for others ' abortions . Now , on the topic of assumed consequences . Explicit non-consent trumps implicit consent any day of the week , and consent can be withdrawn at any time for any reason , and that is an essential principle to hold if one considers themselves a libertarian . Consider the sex argument again : can a woman not withdraw consent during the act ? She agreed to everything up to that point , but for some reason , she changed her mind and explicitly made her non-consent known . Similarly , she can withdraw consent from a pregnancy . Birth control has a failure rate . But more importantly , every pregnancy has some very serious potential complications that directly endanger the life of the mother . A woman should not be compelled by force to bear those risks , because she is the sole owner of her body and must be able to decide for herself what risks she wants to take . Again on the topic of obligations , at what point does the obligation end ? Should force be used to stop a mother from smoking , or drinking , or going on an airplane ? These are the slippery-slope questions that must be answered during a discussion on legislation . In the end I believe that the market , if left alone , will eventually resolve the issue of abortion , either through technological advances or ostracism of individuals who do practice abortion - but no violence should be enforced , because it has been demonstrated time and time again that the rights of a property owner ( the mother ) trump those of an intruder and/or guest ( fetus ) to that property , even those to life .

If I am somehow unable to provide for myself as an adult , I have no right to be cared for by others , just as I would not if I was fully competent . That is where I involve consistency . If we claim that individuals do not have a right to the labor of others , then that claim must be applied consistently and across all situations . I think that parents who do not do the best for their children are **assholes** , and I would absolutely refuse to associate with them , but without using a gun to force them to be good parents .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"1 . First , I would like to argue that compulsory education is not a necessity . In fact , it is overwhelmingly ineffective and a waste of money and time , time that would be best spent learning a trade or focusing on what the individual is good at . Forcing a math prodigy to sit through five hours of literature a week is only going to waste his/her potential and drive him/her away from both literature and from learning itself . As to where the education would come from , there are many answers . Private charity can and will take care of the poorest , as it has done since before the existence of governments , and without taxation to steal a percentage of their income , people will be more inclined to donate to a cause they see as worthy . In addition , private education institutions have a market incentive to procure the best and brightest in the ranks of their alumni , which is why they are even today offering scholarships . And of course there is the matter of self-organized teaching , where parents in a community can organize their own classrooms by pitching in , or teaching their strengths . 2 . The same as above . Charity has improved the lives of billions in the past few decades , and hospitals have a market incentive to reach out to the community . Plus , there is health insurance , which would no doubt be very cheap in a free , cut-throat market . 3 . The market , of course . If roads are such a necessity for modern life and trade , then people will gladly pay to use them ( which they already do , just indirectly ) . Or , new ways to transport persons and goods will be developed under the forces of the free market . 4 . I would argue that the government has failed at protecting us from terrorists so far . But even so , private security can do a far better job than the police , because its survival depends on its success . Consider this : if the police/military/FBI/NSA fails , they blame a lack of resources and so they are given more funding - they profit from their failure . If a private security contractor fails , it is going to lose its reputation , its contracts and its share in the market . 5 . Nobody . People are free to live their life in whatever way they wish , under whatever values they personally adhere to , as long as they do not initiate the use of violence . 6 . You are probably sick of this answer by now , but , the market . In a free market , racism is insanely unprofitable : you are willingly forfeiting potential paying customers , and your non-racist competitor is free to take advantage of that vacuum . You may not like blacks/whites/latinos/gays/gingers , and that is your right , but money does n't smell . Otherwise , oh well , you are free to do what you want - just do n't come crying when your competitor uses buzzwords like 'equality ' to crush you . In the end , the purpose of libertarianism is not to answer all of these questions - it is not a way of life . It is simply the belief that everyone can choose the way of life that they want , and they are then free to sort these issues out either on their own or in voluntary cooperation .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"Your basic assumption is that the state ( or anyone ) has a legitimate authority to define an activity as taxable . Lets see where that fails : 1 ) The state derives its rights from the people who vote for it . 2 ) The state is nothing more but a group of individuals . 3 ) An individual can not bestow upon another a right which he himself does not possess , for to do so , I could give my brother ( or a group of my friends ) the right to murder people in the street . 4 ) If the state has a right to tax , then the individuals it derives this power from ( the people ) must also have that right , otherwise they can not delegate it . 5 ) Therefore , I can define my neighbor 's income as taxable ( by me ) , and show up with a gun at his door to take it . He is consenting because he is engaging in activity I define as taxable - if I can not define it , neither can the state . 6 ) Therefore , taxation is coercive , because the state employs violence ( or the threat of it ) which it has no right to use . If it did , then so would all the individuals beneath it . By contrast , a voluntary agreement between two individuals is not coercive , because they both have the right to associate with one another and engage in contracts , which they derive from the ownership of their own bodies . 0/10 try harder .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"If prices are above the equilibrium , then it would be profitable for new players to enter the market and undercut the cartel . The cartel can then try to undercut them in a price war , even buying at a loss for some time , but that just opens them up to having their stock bought at low prices to be sold when they raise them again . Consider an example : in Ancapistan , there are 5 companies manufacturing and selling rubber ducks . The true market rate for rubber ducks is 3 $ /duck , and it costs 2,5 $ to make a duck , but the companies collude to raise the prices at 6 $ /duck , and hire a consulting firm to keep them in line . Bob 's Plastics Company , looking to expand its market share , begins manufacturing and selling rubber ducks at 3 $ , making a modest profit but dominating rubber duck sales . The cartel , looking to push Bob 's Plastics Company out of the market , lowers the price for its ducks to 2 $ - below the cost of manufacture , which makes it unprofitable for Bob 's Plastics Company to make and sell ducks . But now , Bob 's Plastics Company can buy rubber ducks cheaper than it would need to manufacture them . It builds up a stock , and when the Cartel raises its prices to 6 $ again , it can afford to sell the ducks it bought for a profit at 2,5 $ . The Cartel bleeds money off to its competitor . But even if all of the above does n't happen , it does n't matter . The beauty of the free market is that it empowers consumers to make their own choices : if they are unwilling to pay 6 $ for a duck , then they can boycott the cartel , or make their own worker-owned duck manufacturing plant .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"I think we can agree to define theft as 'the act of taking a person 's property without their consent ' . Therefore , the question becomes whether the money the government takes as tax is 'my ' property , or more accurately , if it is its own property . If it is not , then the act of taking it without my consent is obviously theft . Lets examine how property can be acquired . I think we will both agree that what I produce , I own . If I make an axe , it belongs to me , because it is through my labor that the raw resources were transformed into a usable tool . I can also give that axe to whoever I want , because it is my property , and I can ask for something else in advance . The other party is not obligated to accept that offer . So we have two modes of procurement : 1 ) Production ( or homesteading for land , which is the same : an unowned , raw resource is transformed into usable property through a man 's labor ) 2 ) Voluntary Trade Unless you can offer some third mode of property procurement , there is no other legitimate method of acquiring property . Has the government produced the products of my labor ? Of course not . Has it voluntarily traded for it ? Of course not . It may be offering services in return , but I never agreed to it . Since it has neither produced my property , nor has it traded for it voluntarily , it can not have a legitimate claim on it . Therefore to take it is theft .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"You are correct , it is rooted in morality . We agree that theft is immoral ( I hope ) , so we run into two problems when equating it with taxation in the eyes of the layman . 1 ) Most people do not really think the topic through . They have paid taxes for their entire life , they may benefit from the taxation of others , so they do not even bother to consider the equation . Some argue that it is not really 'your ' property , but if we accept that all property has to be acquired through voluntary contract ( or homesteading/production ) , then the state has no claim to it . Therefore , the violent removal of property from its rightful owner is theft . 2 ) Another problem is that there seems to be a cognitive dissonance between what people perceive as moral for an individual , and what they consider moral for the state . The rule of the majority has been elevated into a God-Monarch in the eyes of the people after centuries of brainwashing , so they believe that the same action ( theft , murder ) is moral if their deity does it . If we accept that the majority can dictate what is moral and what is not , then we run into very absurd scenarios . If the majority rules that first-borns must be ritually sacrificed on their 2nd birthday , does that obscene act suddenly become just ? What if they decide to lynch all gingers ? Hang the Swedes ? Behead a guy for not mowing his lawn ? From that we have to conclude that an action that is immoral for an individual to perform must be immoral for the majority .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"I do not see how price fixing in a truly free market would work . 1 ) If the price is fixed at above the market equilibrium , then competitors outside of the price fixing bloc are free to barge in and take over the market with lower prices . 2 ) If the price is fixed at the market equilibrium , then the consumer is not affected at all . Fixing prices works in our current society because the barrier for entry is too high in most fields . The sheer amount of paperwork , social security and welfare contributions and excessive taxation is enough to limit any market to the few 'elite ' , helping them consolidate their dominant position without fear of competition . In addition , the lack of copyright in a free society ensures that monopolies on knowledge can not be used to hold the opposition down . The exact same thing applies to monopolies . If the monopoly is selling at the lowest possible price it can be profitable at , then the consumer benefits . If it is selling higher than that , then competitors can take over .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"And exactly how can you enforce copyright in a society in which all exchanges are voluntary ? Sure , you can make it a term in a contract , nobody prevents you from doing that , but any persons not bound by that contract have no obligation to you not to copy your ideas . Consider the example of a beautiful painting . You keep the painting under wraps to protect it from prying eyes , but eventually , you sell it to another person in exchange for currency - and make sure the contract states that they are not allowed to copy it . If they do copy it , then they are in breach of contract . But any other persons who see that painting and copy it are free to do so , as they have no obligation to you . Any persons who copy those are free to do that as well , and so on . Now , there are free market solution to things like copyright . Either you can use encryption and other methods to protect your creations , or you can participate in a society in which everybody agrees to respect copyrights voluntarily ( at the risk of being excluded otherwise ) , but again , only if all of the exchanges are voluntary .

For the sake of the argument , lets assume that the embryo is considered human at the moment of conception . I will from this try and prove that abortion is not a violation of the NAP , or other Libertarian core beliefs . 1 ) We accept that the mother exerts sole ownership on her body , as it is from this core axiom that we derive all of her other rights . 2 ) As it is her property , she can allow anyone inside it at her leisure , and show them the door whenever she decides . 3 ) If the mother wishes for the embryo to leave her body , then we can say that the embryo is trespassing and is thus initiating violence . It is also parasitically draining the mother 's property of useful metabolites ( stealing ) , and it is polluting it with toxic by-products . In addition to that , the list of potential harms that it can bring on the mother is enormous . 4 ) As the embryo is in violation of the NAP , the mother may use force to evict it from her body , in the same way that I can evict a man ( even if he is homeless and destitute ) from my private property . Whether the embryo survives is not the ethical responsibility of the mother , in the same way that I can not be found responsible for the aforementioned bum dying from the elements if I kick him out of my home .

Aliencreature1,libertarianmeme,"The 'leave ' argument is the same used in abusive relationships , you know .

Again , whatever 'social programs ' I have made use of were in no way enough to justify the amount of money that was forcibly taken from my parents through their entire life . Indeed , if we added up the value of the services my family was given , versus the money we would have saved up if taxes did not exist , we would have a LOT of money left . You completely misunderstood my comment about the private sector - I am against taxation for both private individuals and corporations .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"By first understanding that democracy is not much different from a dictatorship . They both use violence , or the threat of it , to enforce the will of the tyrant , be that a lone dictator or a majority . They are both just as unethical . Even in a perfect , direct democracy in which everyone participates , a percentage of the population ( & gt ; 50 % ) will violently oppress the rest , be that 1 guy , 100 guys or two billion people . Anarcho-Capitalists argue that a group of people , no matter how large , does not have more rights than each of its individual members . A majority does not have any moral justification for initiating aggression . Anarcho-Capitalism works by holding the individual as the sole owner of his own body , the land he develops-homesteads , and the products of his labor . The individual is then free to do with these items as he wishes , as long as he does not initiate violence . He/she is also free to form voluntary contracts with others , which is the basis for free association . If I make a car and try to sell it to you , the decision rests solely on me and you . The will of the other 99.99999 % of the population does not matter . Direct democracy can be used in anarcho-capitalist societies , but votes are not binding to anybody who does not wish to accept them .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"1 ) Lets examine the question about the environment first . The assumption usually is that without an armed bully ( the government ) to force people to protect the environment , we would just set fire to all the forests and perform a daily dance ritual around burning oil fields . I like to use this argument a lot about topics such as these : we have two distinct possibilities . Either the majority of the populace wants to protect the environment , or they do not . There is no in-between , because it is a simple A/Not A statement . If the majority wishes to protect the environment , then in a Libertarian society , they will vote with their wallets and support companies that are eco-friendly and contribute to preserving the planet . In this case the government is unnecessary , because market forces will drive corporations to use environmentally sound practices or risk being shunned by the majority of their potential customer base . In addition , without crony capitalism to provide perverse incentives ( invasion of foreign nations for resources ) , investing in renewable methods turns into a sound economic investment . If the majority does not want to protect the environment , then any action the government takes in that direction is invalid because it violates the principles of democracy . In this case , the state 's actions are illegitimate , even if their goal may sound noble . As you can see , in both cases , the government is either unnecessary or unjustified in taking action to prevent the environment . By contrast , market-driven voluntary practices to preserve the planet would be at their very core moral , and in my opinion , more effective than state bullying . 2 ) Of course . As long as the rights of others are not violated , anyone is free to do what they wish . Want to form a communist commune and share everything ? Be my guest - as long as you do not initiate violence ( including theft ) . Want to be charitable and donate to the poor ? Please do ! In fact , aside from the good will of private citizens , charitable activity becomes a profitable venture to corporations by bringing in positive PR . 3 ) I am not an economist , so I can not really comment on that , but my personal opinion is that GDP as a measure of economic success is unnecessary in a libertarian society . If the government is forbidden from interfering in the free market , then it can not really do anything with that information , even if it is a perfectly measure . 4 ) Gun rights are essential to defending one 's life and property . Even if you could wave a magic wand around and make every single firearm on the planet disappear this instant , the knowledge of how to create a simple pistol using nothing but a 3D printer ( or just some machining tools ) is freely available . Potential criminals will always get their hands on weapons . The question is , should people have the tools to defend themselves ? And it is also an issue of property . Libertarianism is all about keeping the government out of everyone 's private business , and that includes what they own . A gun is no different than any other dangerous tool : it can be used for good , and it can be used for evil . 5 ) I recommend For a New Liberty by Rothbard .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Physical force is not the same thing as aggression . Aggression is , by its definition , non consensual . The moment an act of physical force becomes mutually consensual , it ceases to be an aggression . The NAP condemns aggression , not force . Similarly , self defense involves physical force , but does not violate the NAP because it does not constitute aggression . In light of that , two people could consent to use physical force against each-other , and because it is not aggression it does not violate the NAP . Obviously if consent is withdrawn during the fight , any further acts of force would be aggression and violate the NAP .",Greek,Greek

But if , as I believe , most people want to protect the environment in some way , then the market will take care of it .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"In the end of the day it gets down to what you consider a person , as the NAP talks about not initiating violence against persons ( or the property that they own ) . I agree that the reciprocation argument does have a lot of flaws , such as dealing with infants and the mentally disabled , so I tend to favor the species argument a lot more . It is certainly not absolute , but you have to draw a line somewhere . Lets assume that you do n't draw the line at species though : where do you draw it ? Life in general ? Do microbes have rights , and are we mass murdering them every time we wash our hands ? If not , then lets try drawing it at eukaryotes . Does yeast have rights ? What about multi-cell organisms ? Do my tomatoes have rights ? Animals ? Am I a murderer for swatting a fly ? Do you set it at brain mass ? If so at what weight ? A brain-per-weight ratio ? At which value ? The truth is that there is no perfect answer . Any method of determining personhood will be arbitrary , because biology does not deal in absolutes - it is a gradient . And that only takes into account biological organisms . Does a computer , even a highly intelligent one , have rights ? If so , at what processor speed does it acquire them ? You can not claim self-awareness as your line , because that excludes people in comas or with certain psychiatric disorders - and there can be no reliable test that tells apart true self awareness from a perfect imitation . Any discussion on determining personhood will get bogged down by those issues , and no ideology , libertarian or not , can answer them . So for now , we set our arbitrary line at our species , because the fact that humans have rights is the one thing most of us can agree on .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"'OK ' is a broad term . You have to distinguish between what is a right and what is good/bad .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"The mistake , in my opinion , is the distinction of one 's body from the realm of property . Your right to do with your body as you wish , and by extension to not be forced to labor for others under gunpoint , is simply an expression of the fact that you own your body . Without the concept of property - and it has to be an absolute concept , I 'll explain soon - I believe that there is no compelling argument against murder and slavery beyond intuition . And no legislation should be ever made on the basis of intuition alone . I believe that moral relativism is a sham . As no human being is perfect , we can not be trusted to decide what is right and what is wrong in the simplest of cases , let alone in complex socio-economic issues . That is why I choose to be a moral absolutist : if we decide that something is immoral , it has to *always* and *in all circumstances* be immoral , otherwise we leave ourselves open to terrible interpretations of it . If theft is wrong , then it must *always* be wrong , otherwise the lines become blurred and we end up with a form of newspeak . The right to property has to be absolute and inviolable for it to have any meaning , and to ensure the freedom of individuals . Nobody may initiate violence against your most sacred of property , your body , under any circumstances . And because there is no fundamental difference between your body and your other property ( they are both matter , and the distinction is completely arbitrary ) , that principle must apply to all of what you own , or it is meaningless . And , as a little thought experiment : how much of someone 's labor has to be involuntarily taken before 'forced redistribution ' becomes slavery ? We agree that taking 100 % of what someone makes/earns is slavery . Is 99 % not slavery ? Is 95 % ? 90 % ? At which point do you draw your arbitrary line ?",Greek,Greek

But take the government out of regulating communications , and then the ISPs can offer whatever services they want .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"I am from Greece too ! Welcome aboard ! To understand libertarianism , you have to agree with the idea that the ends never justify the means . You can have the very best of intentions , and perhaps the very best of results , but none of those can justify any immoral actions you took . Think of it like the fruit of the poisonous tree principle from law : if unlawful means were used to procure evidence , then any evidence stemming from it is also unlawful and may not be admitted in court . Similarly , if you have to do something immoral ( violence ) to achieve a result , that result is also immoral . If you agree with that , and with the statement that the initiation of violence is immoral , then you are half-way there to becoming a libertarian . Through those lenses , we can examine the issues you brought up . I doubt you will find any libertarian who wants the poor to suffer . In fact , most of us believe that these people are destitute because of the government that claims to protect them - and boy is it doing a terrible job at that . Laws , laws and more laws have been layered between the poor and any chance at a livelihood by declining them the right to work without licenses , union fees and absurd insurance requirements , and when they do find employment , the state steals a large percentage of their income . It also raises the barriers to hiring an employee : a business owner is less likely to hire someone whose labor is worth less than the arbitrary minimum wage , even though that experience in lowly-paid jobs is exactly what they need to find better employment . I believe that the free market can do a better job at caring for the poor than government ever did , and it can do so without using armed theft . Charity existed long before organized government , and in a free market , the barriers to entry are zero . Anyone can start a business , or seek employment with whatever terms they consider acceptable , without a paternalistic bureaucrat holding them at gunpoint 'for their own good ' . To understand healthcare in a libertarian society , one must accept that it is no different than any other good or service . Nobody has a right to the labor of someone else : I do not have a right to take a farmer 's fruit if I am hungry , I do not have a right to steal a soda from a store if I am thirsty , but somehow it is kosher to force people to cure me for free ? The solution to healthcare is to take the government out of the equation and allow market forces to take care of things . As it stands , the state ( especially the Greek one ) steals from the healthy through mandatory public insurance to subsidize the medical costs of those who cared little for their health . I , a thin thing that gets sick once a year , have to pay enormous insurance to pay for the insulin of the overweight guy who just could n't put the steak down . And we pay exactly the same rate ! In a market economy , a healthy lifestyle would be promoted by lower insurance premiums , and we would all get exactly our moneys ' worth out of the healthcare system . Medical education is also incredibly inefficient , and engineered to produce an artificial shortage of physicians - and I say this as a current medical student . I will nail education here , since it is very similar . If affordable education will provide a net benefit to the market , then somebody will make a business out of it and provide at ( or very close ) to the market equilibrium . 'Free ' healthcare and education are a sham : most people pay far more in taxes than they ever would in a private system , because the government has no incentive to provide efficiency . It thrives on leaking money from everywhere , and its failure justifies *increases* in funding . You are from Greece , and I am sure you have seen the terrible situation our public schools and universities are in . Do you think a school in such a state of decay would get any customers ? Would the horrible teachers we 've had to suffer through , who only care about getting through the day with the least amount of work done , be able to do that in a competitive market ? If you answered no , you are absolutely right - they would n't . And at last , the 'holy grail ' of corporate power . You said it yourself : the problem is that corporations amass political power , and use it to corner their markets through the use of state violence . They did not create the state , they merely use it because of its monopoly on force . And you want to *give more power* to that corrupt institution ? Consider the argument in another way : your neighbor is bribing the police to suppress you , and you want to *give them bazookas* ? The solution is much more elegant : take away the powers of the state , and corruption becomes meaningless . A powerless government can not be bought out by corporations , because it can not offer them the legislative power they want . Get rid of the state , you get rid of corruption . It 's that simple .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"Yes , I live in Greece ( hopefully not for much longer though ) ! But I do believe Greece is a case study of what any system that goes socialist for long enough will turn into : the other models of 'social democracies ' , like the Nordic model that is often hailed as the salvation of mankind , are still surviving on the momentum of free trade . In fact , many of them are facing major financial issues , and have been forced to deregulate to stay afloat . First of all , universities may be allowed to name their price , but they do not do so under a free market . Take the US as an example : the government offers those insane loans that cover education expenses , and at some point , the universities realized that they can ask for whatever they want and the government will pay for it . Program directors would be far less willing to have absurd tuition if their customers knew the true cost . Not to mention that , if there is a demand for cheap , affordable education , someone will provide it . It has worked EVERYWHERE else : Greek telecoms are in a constant war . I get nagged by COSMOTE and Vodafone trying to outcompete each-other with these insane bargains . RyanAir and other low-budget airlines have made traveling to Athens via plane almost cheaper than it is with train . Funding for education can also be provided by scholarships , as private universities have an incentive to attract the best and brightest - prestige and profit are very highly correlated - and students can also work to sustain themselves . Again , try not to look at the US as an example of a free market , because it is not one . Healthcare in the US is highly regulated at the insurance level . Insurance companies ca n't even compete across state borders , and that way , monopolies can flourish . Add to that the disaster that was ObamaCare , which increased the cost of healthcare for all under the guise of full coverage , and you get a trainwreck waiting to happen . Free markets only work when they are free of government intervention . A corporation is there for one thing : to make profit . It is the only thing stakeholders care about . With a government in place , which is little more than the highschool bully , the best way to make a profit is to corrupt that institution and 'employ ' the bully to shake down the competition . At the same time , the company 's customers do not *see* the shaking down : they blame the government , not the corporation that hired it . It makes sense to employ that strategy . Now take the bully , and take away his strength . Suddenly , the corporation has to either play by the rules of the market , or do its own dirty work and use force - and good luck getting any profit from a hostile customer base . In the end , when violence is not an option , it 's far more profitable to cater to the customer 's wishes .",Greek,Greek

Although , as long as schools are paid for by taxes , and in the interest of public safety , I propose instead that families that are excluded from public schooling are given a full rebate of the taxes they paid for public education . But there really is no right answer on how to handle vaccinations in public schools , because public schools are an inherently wrong system - you force people to pay for a service , while some of them do n't want to/are not allowed to use it .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"The mistake here is in assuming that there are no consequences to fraud in the absence of the state . The first and most obvious reason for which a policy based on fraud does n't work is voluntary association : would you do business with a known fraudster ? In a society where the only barrier to contracts is the willingness of the participants , trustworthiness becomes a highly valued commodity , one that corporations will go to great lengths to maintain - otherwise they lose their customers . Services that monitor breaches of contracts will flourish , because the demand for them will be there . And there are , of course , other models , such as DROs . Everyone signs up for a DRO and pays a monthly fee , like insurance , and in case of an accusation of fraud the DRO resolves the dispute . Then , depending on the contract the accused signed with the DRO , the organization either pays the victim out of its own pocket or tells the criminal to pay , lest they lose their DRO coverage . You are not forced to have DRO coverage , but I know I would n't do business with someone that does n't have it - much like I would n't want to share the road with uninsured cars . Another example is contract mediators that handle escrow . Both parties of a transaction give the items to the mediator , the mediator keeps a small fee that is agreed upon , examines the goods and the payment to ensure they are legit , and then exchanges them . Or insurance : you pay a yearly fee to car insurance in case you get in an accident . Likewise , you pay a yearly fee to fraud insurance in case you get defrauded . In the end of the day , the how does n't really matter . Free the market , and the solution to any conceivable problem becomes a fresh source of revenue for entrepreneurs to explore .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Nobody is claiming that anarchocapitalism will lead to some utopia where there is eternal peace and we all get together and sing kumbaya . We are arguing that , in a free society , these problems - including fraud - can be dealt with efficiently and , most importantly , without the use of violence . The important thing to note here is that you can not use violence to protect people from their own stupidity . That is the epitome of paternalism . Because quite frankly , if you get a cold call from some Nigerian prince promising you riches if you wire him a thousand dollars , and you accept on the spot , you can blame nobody but yourself . But lets agree that some scams can be more subtle - that 's why you delegate . A 90 year old may not be able to tell a scam from a legit offer , but they can pass it along to their DRO or any other relevant service for review before they make a decision , in the same way that you ask your doctor before taking a new medical treatment . And they can invest in insurance to protect them from the consequences of falling for a scam . If in the end they have taken absolutely no step whatsoever to protect themselves , then that is their own fault and nobody else can be blamed . And please . We live in the age of information : you could move to a different continent , and the DROs there would know all about you before you even fasten your seat-belt . Remember , it 's in their best interest to cooperate to provide a good service . If the consumers want something , namely accurate trustworthiness information about people they deal with , then somebody will figure out a way to provide it . Anarchocapitalism is not a solution to all the ills of the world , and it should not be viewed as such . It is merely a framework in which the solutions can be devised .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"I need to provide proof that , if I want to make a deal with someone , I can ask my lawyer first to make sure I do n't get defrauded ? Or that , if my lawyer wants to uphold his reputation , should run a background check before giving me the all-clear ? Or that a good background check does not know geographic borders ? You asked if there would be a lot of fraud in Ancapistan . I answered that I can not predict the future , but outlined several ways in which the market could counter fraud and protect consumers . You then proceeded to ask be about proof of a theoretical system , to which I can only give you logical reasoning ( the one I outlined above - if there is a need , someone will try and profit from it ) . People do n't want to be defrauded , otherwise we would n't be having this conversation . They want to be safe from fraud . That is a need . People also want to make money . That is a need . These two parties can satisfy both of their needs freely in the market : people who are good at protecting others from fraud ( the DROs , escrow companies , consumer watchdogs , whatever ) can offer their services to those who have money in exchange for a fee . If they want to be chosen over the competition , they will go to extra length to provide a good service at a reasonable cost . Do I need to proof of what exchange of services and goods is ? Do I need to prove that 1+1=2 ? Again , anarchocapitalism is not a solution . People make the solutions , and anarchocapitalism lets them do that .

It has the potential , and I outlined one such way . I will have to ask an oracle if it will . Here 's the thing : I ( and most anarchocapitalists ) do n't talk of outcomes because no outcome is certain . I can not even tell you with certainty what I will have for breakfast tomorrow , let alone come up with an infallible prediction of how a voluntary society would work . We talk of incentives and potential mechanisms , but it is up to the individuals that make up society to actually determine the future . Also , outcomes are overrated . I make it a point to never argue over utility , because that is not what anarchocapitalism is about : I *believe* that it will be more effective and provide better outcomes , but that is not why I support it . I support it because you can justify any atrocious act in the name of outcomes . If you try hard enough , any appalling situation can be justified if the outcome sounds noble enough .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"You are not missing much . It 's incredibly frustrating to start laying down an argument with a statist , and the moment you ask them if murder is wrong , they say that morals are relative and in some cases murder would be moral . Same with rape .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"I am sure that she shares most of your morals , such as not supporting violence and valuing self-ownership . Build on that : construct an imaginary neighborhood . In that neighborhood , there is an armed mafia that shows up to peoples ' homes and shops with armed thugs and demands a percentage of their earnings , lest they be locked up in a dark basement for a few decades . In 'return ' , the mafia provides protection from thieves , and even donates some money to the local soup kitchen . Most of the people in the neighborhood support the thugs . Make sure not to mention the government : keep using the word mafia . When she inevitably claims that what the mafia is doing is immoral , you can ask her what the difference is . It might not convince her , but it will plant some seeds of uncertainty .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"One of the most major aspects of libertarianism is that we do n't believe victimless crimes exist , so a lot of the socially conservative stances you may be looking for fly right out of the window - such as gay marriage ( although I am part of the group that wants the government out of marriage entirely ) . We also support the free choice of the individual : a business should be free to decide who it wants to serve ( the gay wedding cake issue ) and who can use which bathroom in its stores . Abortion is a different topic entirely , because you can not simply sign it off as victimless . The debate over when life begins is still too hot to draw any conclusions , especially any solid enough to draw policy on - which is why there is a lot of disagreement in libertarian circles . Certainly we all believe that the government should not fund abortion in any way , because it is a medical procedure and the taxpayer should not have to pay for it ( especially if he finds it immoral ) . Personally , I am pro-choice . I would rather not take a stance on the 'when life begins ' issue , because people much more knowledgeable in the field than me have debated for both sides . Instead , I look at it from the evictionist point of view : if we consider that the mother owns her own body , much like a home , then she has the right to kick anyone off her property for any reason . Moreover , since she owns her body , and by extension its nutrients , she can withdraw her consent to share them with the fetus and take measures to stop the theft . But that is only one point of view , and a lot of libertarians disagree . Our goal should be to reduce the government first , and then we can debate the exact specifics .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"Production is not the only way property can be acquired , otherwise society would be unable to exist . But lets roll with it and see what we get : you only own what you have yourself produced . I am a farmer who produces potatoes . My neighbor produces carrots . After years of eating only potatoes , I am sick of it : I want some carrots ! Thankfully , my neighbor wants potatoes , so we trade a few carrots for a few potatoes . According to you , that is immoral - I can not take my neighbor 's carrots , even if he agrees . Therefore , trade must be a moral alternative to production , because the opposite is as absurd as it sounds . Libertarians use `` do not take **by force** what others have earned '' , because the distinction is important . If I consent to give my property someone , then that is between me and them , nobody else . From that , we can easily see how the employer-employee relationship works : the employer is not taking the employee 's product by force , he is trading it voluntarily . Both parties gain something out of the relationship . The employer can magnify his production , which he could not do if he was working alone , but the employee has to assume none of the risk of running a business , nor does he have to invest in machinery and raw materials . But democratic worker cooperatives are not a problem for libertarians . You are , of course , free to run your business as you wish , with as many people at the help as you wish . So if you think it is more efficient , then go for it ! Just do n't demand that others follow you , because then you are violating their natural right to free choice .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"None . But in a hypothetical minarchist society where taxes exist , you have to ask what the tax will be used to fund . I think the most rational ( read : theft I can mostly stomach ) would be a usage tax . If you want fire department coverage , you pay a fire department tax - or hire a private company instead , or not get any at all . Same with police . Same with ~roads~ . If not enough people want the public option , then let it be starved to death .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"If the majority of the public wants to build it , then they will voluntarily pay . If they do n't , then the government would have no right to do it anyway . It can also be run as a kickstarter by a private company .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"Nothing stops the worker from forming a cooperative with other workers in a free market . In fact , if it is more efficient than the employment model , as you believe , then clearly it will win over the competition . The issue here is that the worker does not want to have to deal with the risk of creating his own business - the owner of the farm did . For one , value is not objective . Your potatoes are worth to me as much as I say they do , and you decide if the price is good enough to sell . Labor is just another commodity : the worker is not making potatoes and then giving them to the owner of the farm , he is giving him his labor . It is through the farmer 's tools and soil that the labor is transformed into the potato . Even more worrying are the implications of what you seem to advocate . Am I not allowed to make voluntary contractual agreements with others ? Do I not have free will ? And should I be compelled *by force* to not enter those agreements ? ~Society~ is not a thing . There are individuals , and if you have to harm an individual to help another , then you are certainly not ethical , no matter what .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Do n't let perfect get in the way of good . I , too , would enjoy to witness the collapse of the state through a variety of options ( my favorite is starving the beast to death through cryptocurrency , if that takes off ) , but any action that brings us closer to liberty is better than the alternative . The more free the world gets , the more it will realize that it does n't really need the state .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Of course the government is less efficient . The problem is that this is not a free market , because a free market requires freedom from coercion - the state has a monopoly on violence . You can put the best Kung Fu master in a room with a rookie with a gun , and the gun would win nine times out of ten . Slowly reducing the government will , in my opinion , create a chain reaction as the private sector moves in to fill the void with better , cheaper services . People all over the world have grown up believing that the government can do things better than the private sector : show them wrong , and you have won half the battle . Not that I would mind if the beast suddenly suffered a heart attack and died retching on the carpet . But until then , I would rather slip tiny poison capsules in its milkshake instead of just not meeting it .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"The real reason workers ca n't efficiently form cooperatives is the barriers for entry that the state has created . Corporations lobby to protect the status quo , and they employ government force to achieve that . Take that away , and you get a free market in which workers can , and probably will , form cooperatives . That is also why there is no framework for the workers to buy the company : free the market , and it 's as easy as bidding . You say benefits on society , but the problem is , who is society but the totality of the individuals that form the human race ? There is no panacea in the world : everyone has different interests . In addition , trying to legislate with improving society as the reason is illogical , because no human being is omniscient . Who defines improvement ? Exploitation is a loaded word . If the worker is not there consensually , also known as he has been forced to work at gunpoint or with some other threat of violence , then clearly that is wrong , nobody will argue otherwise ( except maybe the neoreactionaries , but who listens to those ) . But if he is willingly there , you can not call that exploitation - he is free to live if he does not find the benefit of working there bigger than the sacrifice .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"The right to eviction is one of the most important rights in libertarian ethics , because without it , private ownership of land and structures becomes meaningless - I ca n't be said to own my home if I do n't have the right to allow only those who I want inside it , and kick them out whenever I decide I do n't want them any more . And I *can* use lethal force to accomplish that . That same argument can apply to the human body . The fetus is infringing on its mother 's property . It is like a bum that has entered your house , and is fattening with your food which it deprives of you for almost a year , with a significant risk of causing you permanent damage . In such a situation , I would freely take a gun to defend my property from the bum - how is abortion any different ? Basic libertarian ethics : nobody has a right to what others must provide for them . It is the whole reason we are against social welfare . The mother is not infringing on the rights of the fetus by not providing for it , because the fetus had no right to the woman 's body and nutrients in the first place .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"Nobody has the moral right to improve society if others must be harmed to do it , no matter how small the harm . You can convince the owners of those corporations to sell them to their workers , but you can not force them to do it under threat of violence , *even if* it would result in some post-scarcity utopia . And , again , we see violence in the context of rights . No man has a right to anything another must provide for him . I do not have a *right* to be fed , because that requires others to do it for me , and the only way to force their cooperation would be violence . I do not have a *right* to my employer 's money . I have a right to not have it be violently taken it from me . What he actually pays me is between me and him . If the worker believes he is being exploited , then he can quit , but he does not have a right to seize the factory because he does not own it . The worker does not have an intrinsic value . Value is not some objective , natural property of all things , it is how much someone is willing to offer .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"The how is irrelevant . If I want someone off my property right this instance , then I have the right to force him off , no matter how he ended up there . Of course , you ( and whoever disagrees ) can deny me services from that point , but violence can not be used to prevent me from defending my property .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"No , we will not rejoice at that . The use of force by the state is abhorrent , even if done for a just cause . There are non-violent ways to protect health , such as societal pressure , non-association with unvaccinated people and monetary incentives provided by charity in exchange for vaccination .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Vaccines actually do work , but not always and not on all people . On some , it is simply ineffective , although the rates are usually very high ( in the same way that not all medicines work for all people ) . Others can not take them due to a rare allergy , or due to being immunocompromised ( such as an HIV infection , or the elderly ) . Herd immunity is meant to protect those people by preventing transmission of the disease in a population , so it ca n't reach those who are not immune . ( Source : I am a medical student ) But using violence to force herd immunity on everyone is not the answer . If there is a need for it , the market will provide : if I was a parent , I would be willing to pay extra for a school that assures me that all the kids are vaccinated . If I owned a company , I would not hire unvaccinated employees . It is their choice to not vaccinate themselves and their children , and it is my choice to not be associated with them .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Using violence to enforce a viewpoint is not the libertarian way , it is certainly not the ancap way . Most people , me included , believe that there is a net benefit in vaccination - but while I have seen the evidence and made an educated decision for myself , I can not force my conclusion on others through violence . People are free to make choices for themselves and for their children . The thing I can do is use my freedom to protect myself from what I perceive a credible threat , namely unvaccinated people ( children included ) . If I had children , I would value a school that requires vaccination for enrollment , and as an employer I would not hire employees without vaccination - or if I did , I would do so by demanding they provide me with insurance . I would absolutely not deal with a parent whose child died of a preventable disease . I may donate to a charity that provides monetary incentives for immunization . Plus , if someone does infect me , I can take them to a private court for damages . These are all part of my freedom of association , and do not infringe on any rights . But to everyone reading this , please do get yourself and your loved ones vaccinated . If you need to be convinced , read Sompayrac 's `` How the Immune System Works '' , it is a very short , easy to understand book that explains immunization to the layman . If you think you know better , then read it anyway - an educated decision is made by reviewing all the available information , even if it does not agree with your worldview .",Greek,Greek

Others are free to judge you for it though , and refuse you service .",Greek,Greek
Aliencreature1,CapitalismVSocialism,"I am currently training to be a doctor . That entails almost a decade of constant stress , effort , examinations and sacrifice , because medical school is hard , and even after I have graduated my life will be a constant torrent of worry and stress . Not only will I have to catch up on new medical literature daily , but I will have to take responsibility for the lives of dozens of people every week , suffer through night shifts , weekend work and holiday work - you ca n't shut the ER down on Christmas - and give up hobbies and other things that I enjoy so I can take better care of my ( future ) patients . There will always be the idealists who will do that for free . There certainly were many when we started a few years ago , but now , I doubt that more than 1 % of my class would choose medicine again if they could find an alternative that paid just as well and/or they had n't invested all of this effort into it already . They are not enough to provide free healthcare to everybody , that 's for sure . If today , you told me that I could take some easy office job for the same pay , a better schedule and low responsibilities , I would take it in a heart-beat . Not all work is awful , but usually , the essential work is . You ca n't have a world without doctors , but becoming a doctor and staying good at what you do is awful on your body , your mind and your psyche . Someone has to gather the garbage , but I do n't see anyone becoming a garbage-man because they like the work . Someone has to risk their life to protect others , but I do n't see many people signing up as volunteers for the military . Claiming that a socialist society would work because people 's attitudes 'would ' change , and they would magically like work that they found appalling before , is like trying to wish unicorns into existence . I am sure that if we pray hard enough , then people will also stop being racists , sexists and bigots . You have to build your system on people *today* , because trying to predict how social attitudes would work in what-if scenarios is little more than mental masturbation with no basis on reality .

Clearly , taking a poor man 's car without his consent is theft , I think I will find no disagreements there . But somehow , taking a rich man 's car without his consent is NOT ? The libertarian argument is that any taxation is theft , because it fills all the criteria for it . Private property is taken , with the threat of force , against the will of its owner . If the owner refuses , then he will be hauled off to a tiny 2 by 2 cell , and if he resists that imprisonment he will be shot to death . Where that money is used is irrelevant .

Every success of the private sector and every failure of government will just show more people that they do n't need Big Daddy State to take care of them . I have high hopes for cryptocurrency .

How the fuck do you define utility , and what objective standard do you use to measure it and compare the utilities of different actions ? I have never received an answer to this question . Lets see an example . You are put in a position where you must push one of two buttons . Pressing the red button will result in the rape of a woman , pushing the blue button will result in the murder of the man . Clearly , both of these actions are immoral , both on the grounds of deontology and utility . Utilitarianists would gladly press the red button , because in their views preventing a murder has more utility than the rape that is required to do it . But *how do different quantities of that compare* ? What if it 's 2 rapes for a murder ? 3 ? 4 ?

Aliencreature1,CapitalismVSocialism,"When debating morality , one must consider the most absurd of scenarios , even if they are 'in the realm of fantasy ' . If your morality system ca n't consistently hold up to *every* conceivable situation , then it 's shit - it 's not universal , it 's 'eyeballing ' it based on ~feels~ . I never advocated for marital rape . It is immoral just like any other rape , and the 'traditional `` moral '' norms ' do n't matter - what the majority considers acceptable is not necessarily moral and vice versa . That is why democracy is useless in matters of morality and ethics , and should not be used to determine them . Up until recently , the majority believed that homosexuals marrying was 'immoral ' ; did it suddenly become moral when a fraction of the populace changed their minds ? My answer to that is a resounding 'no ' . In this case , gay marriage was moral *anyway* , regardless of the opinion of the populace - no victimless act can be said to be immoral . In the middle ages , the majority was perfectly happy to burn witches and did so liberally . People thought that holding slaves was moral for a long , long time . And today , the majority in many parts of the arab world considers women property . So clearly , either morality must be disconnected from any notions of democracy , or we can just go ahead and declare all kinds of abhorrent acts moral . If , today , 99 % of the world voted to kill all gingers , would that be moral ? ( I will be collecting my complementary ginger sex slave today , thank you . ) A moral framework of inalienable rights is the only solution .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"It is a practical answer . Before the government moved in and started messing with education , college was easily affordable by most people . Because colleges were competing with each other to get customers ( students ) , all of whom were paying with money they directly controlled , there was an incentive to lower prices . Compare it to buying a computer : if I have the cash in hand , and then decide to buy a computer , I will take the cost into consideration and go for the best bang for my buck . If I have to personally take a loan to afford that computer , I will be careful with how I spend that money . Then throw the government into the mix . Suddenly , it provided favorable loans to everyone and their dog , and because the money had never actually belonged to/been in the control of the customer , price considerations were thrown out of the window . Colleges got the message that they could rise tuition as much as they wanted , and the government would foot the bill . Because the upfront cost was obfuscated , and loan payments were delayed significantly , the education passed as 'free ' while it was not . Students , because they never actually 'saw ' the loan money and could take one regardless of their field of study , were free to pick fields that had little to zero workplace application and poor job prospects . College is no longer a way to acquire the skills necessary to find a better job , or enter a scientific field of study : it is something everyone 'must ' do , because the free money gives prospective students a sense of entitlement . Plus , using the law of supply and demand , the value of college degrees goes down the less scarce they get . As a well-known Pixar villain once said , 'if everyone is super , then no one is ' . These effects can be seen in even more tragic magnitude in countries with free university tuition , such as my own ( Greece ) . What 's the solution ? Stop government intervention in college education , including government-backed loans . If someone wants to go to college , they can either foot the bill themselves , have their parents do it , achieve a scholarship for achievement and/or need , or take a regular loan with full knowledge of what it entails . Colleges will be *forced by the market* to reduce tuition , because their product is useless if nobody can afford it . The same can be applied to healthcare . Right now , insurance costs are artificially raised by huge barriers to entry , state-line limits that practically grant regional monopolies , a forced increase in demand by the ACA ( since it requires everyone to get insured ) , and absurd government regulation . You want to know how to fix healthcare ? Leave it alone . Many of the market suggestions I will suggest go against my own personal interest : I am a medical student , on my way to become a physician , but that does n't affect my sense of right and wrong . Right now , the government places incredible requirements for licensing and practice , even in cases where they are not needed . By deregulating healthcare , cheaper alternatives such as NPs and PAs can work on their own , and refer the more difficult cases to doctors . Throw in the education reforms I suggested , and you also make medschool cheaper , a cost that was ultimately passed on to the patient - the doctor has to pay back his loans !",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"& gt ; '' I think the biggest problem with libertarianism is its blind faith in free markets . Free markets are great for selling cars and TVs but suck when it comes to other parts of society like public health , the environment , labor , consumer safety , etc . A really great example is health insurance and preexisting conditions . Insurance companies have absolutely zero incentive to cover people who are sick or have costly chronic conditions . In an unregulated system , those people would simply die as no one would cover them . Wages are another great example . Some jobs can be done by anyone . Fast food workers do n't require special skills , and thus an unregulated labor market would value that labor far below what is necessary for a person to support himself/herself . I 've never heard a compelling argument for how these situations could be mitigated without government oversight . That 's to say nothing of the environment . '' & gt ; '' I 'm fine with the free-market for non-essential goods and services ... It 's a very effective form of rationing on that sense . For other things , they should be regulated by a democratically elected government . '' Actually , if you really think about it , *lots* of vital products and services are provided by the free market . The government does not produce food , farmers do that for profit , in a free market . The government does not produce cars ( our entire economy would collapse without them ) , corporations do that for a profit , in a free market . The government does not produce fuel , corporations do that for profit , in a free market . History has shown that whenever the government takes over these vital services , it fails completely and catastrophically . See the Terror Famine ( holodomor ) in Ukraine , or the poor quality of Soviet Ladas , or the oil crisis in Venezuela . In fact , the government has shown a complete inability to run any operation efficiently , sometimes resulting in millions of deaths . Central planning fails because it tries to come up with a 'one size fits all ' solution , and then it violently enforces that decree on every possible situation . By contrast , in the free ( er ) world , food is cheaper than ever ( see the obesity pandemic ) , cars are amazing and becoming better and more efficient every year , and oil prices have hit a new low . All of these are a result of a free market . In fact , food is so cheap that the government decided it has to pay farmers not to sell their product , because that would `` crash '' the market and make food too cheap . Tell that to the poor , right ? I am in healthcare too , in a country where the public/private divide is painfully obvious . The public sector is riddled with corruption ( unavoidable in government ) , inefficiency , and despite receiving more money than it would possibly need , has terrible service . Private care is efficient , and even though everybody is *forced* to pay into the government 's public health service , most people around here pay extra for private insurance that ensures they will be treated as customers . Because the patient is a customer . There is nothing that differentiates someone who needs to buy food to survive from someone who needs to buy surgery to survive , perhaps except the expediency that is required . `` But '' , I will hear you ask , `` patients ca n't shop around for the best hospital or doctor in a time of need . '' That is correct - which is why you buy insurance . The patient decides which insurance package fits their needs better for the price , and the burden of negotiating with the hospitals is shifted onto the experts , not the layman who just wants to stay healthy . The free market model for health insurance is the same as any other insurance , but the problem is that the government places incredibly barriers on entry and regulates healthcare to such a degree that it makes it impossible for free competition to arise - see the arbitrary state lines as an example . Car , life and home insurance are all very cheap , because they are less regulated . Chronic conditions are costly to treat , no matter how you finance their care . It should be expected that those who require chronic care have to pay more - otherwise it would be unfair to those who wo n't . But there are free market solutions to this : a healthy person could start paying chronic disease insurance from a very early age , creating a 'fund ' that can be used to care for him should he become chronically ill. Labor is another complex issue . Indeed , fast food workers are n't worth jack in a free market - but that 's not what a fast food cashier job is for . It 's work for teens and college students to gain some experience and earn some pocket money *while learning marketable skills somewhere else* . If you force fastfood chains to pay more , then they will just replace these jobs with robots . & gt ; '' Yeah . I do n't trust Koch Industries to regulate the byproducts of their manufacturing plants . You need some kind of oversight to identify and monitor pollution levels , and allowing corporate entities to determine those levels and make sure they are not exceeded is just not feasible . Profit will almost always be the priority for business , not safety . '' First of all , we have to ask the question *do we want to protect the environment* . It may sound silly at first glance : of course we do . It is a no-brainer . But *does the public want that* ? Remember that , if we are talking about a democratically elected government , *it has to do whatever the public that it represents wants* . So we can see two distinct cases : A ) The public does not want to protect the environment , at least in their majority , and value it less than having cheaper products . B ) The majority wants to protect the environment , and would sacrifice cheaper products for environmentally-friendly practices . Only one of those conditions can be true , as they are complete opposite statements . If we assume that A is true ( the public does n't care about the environment more than it cares for cheap goods ) , then there is **nothing** we can do , privately or publicly . The elected government has to represent the majority ! If the majority wants cheap gasoline and Big Macs more than it wants a clean environment , then that is what the government is obligated to give them - otherwise the government is illegitimate . I am not cynical enough to assume that . I believe that most people do care about the environment . In that case , they can vote with their wallets and support products made with environmentally-friendly practices , even at the expense of spending more money . This is a practice that we see in the modern world , where 'Green ' and 'Environmentally Friendly ' have become badges of honor for corporations ! A public that wants to protect the environment will do that regardless of government presence , even at a personal cost - otherwise the government is illegitimate to do that anyway . Of course , the average layman ca n't be expected to be an expert in environmental protection . That is why private watchdogs ( either non-for-profit or as subscription services ) can advocate on his behalf , reviewing corporate practices and products and 'endorsing ' them , or condemning them in the media . These private advocacy groups rely on their subscribers for their survival , and they must demonstrate results , or they will simply get no customers . For that reason , they will have to choose trustworthy labs to run the studies ( and these labs will go bankrupt if they are found to be lying to their customers ) , and watchdogs of the watchdogs can provide as many layers of protection as needed . Remember that the government *has a strong interest to fail at its job* . Whenever a government agency fucks up , it gains more funding . Whenever the police fail to stop a mass shooting , they get new deadly toys , more staff and less restrictions on their procedure that were originally in place to protect the public . Whenever environmental measures fail , the EPA receives more funding . *There is an active conflict of interest between government agencies and the people : the people benefit from success , the government benefits from failure . * Compare that to a private agency that relies on its reputation to get customers . If a private security agency fails to stop a shooting , *it will go bankrupt* . If a private environmental protection agency fails to stop/deal with an oil-spill , *it will go bankrupt* . In the private sector , the interests of the customer and the corporation are identical , because it is a symbiotic relationship that can be easily broken - whereas the government is a parasite that benefits at the expense of its host .",Greek,Greek

But how could you know ? You ca n't . It 's impossible to find records that go that old , and there is n't a modern dna test to see if your blood has 'divine ' blood in it . In fact modern scientists wo n't even recognize something as 'divine . 2 . It would not be weird , at all . They are called GREEK gods not because they are Greeks , but because they people worsipping them were called Greeks . ( actualy they were called Hellenes , a name with wich even modern Greeks identify themselves even though they do n't believe in the Hellenic religion any more . so ancient Greeks ( or Hellenes ) were of different countries ( city-states ) , but they saw a relation between them all as Hellenes . The word 'Greek ' is actually wrongly used today so widely .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"When you invoke a god , you call him or her to this place . The god/dess is a spiritual being ( you dont see them fully formed with material bodies ) , and for a spirit to connect to the material realm ( Earth , not the planet , the realm ) , it needs some kind of a vessel . The spiritual world is superior than the material , so when you invoke someone from there , you should better have a good , clean vessel for that someone . Statues have this purpose . That 's why you put statues on the altar , ideally the statue of a given god/dess when you invoke him/her . You offer the statue as a vessel for the spirit of the god/dess to be at . Now when it comes to the oracles , they prophesied by making their own bodies the vessels for the god/s to enter , to use the oracle 's body to speak through it .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"What you describe seems to me as the path of Platonism - Neoplatonism . This was a Hellenic path that combined philosophy and myth to produce theology . Mind you , this path while having lots of similarities with orthodox Hellenism , it also differs a lot . It 's kind of how Abrahamic religions all believe on the God of Moses , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , yet they are different . More specifically , Plato writes down that the Epic Poets such as Hesiod and Homer , ( that their books came to be considered the primary sources for ancient Hellenes to learn about religion ) used too much poetic license to make their poems more `` catchy '' , distorting the truth in the process . According to Plato , the one who would expect to find actual palaces of gods on Olympus was a fool . For Plato gods are powerful spiritual beings ( not consisting of matter ) . As you write , according to Platonic theology , the world ( material universe ) is an extension of the divine . The 'divine ' in this case being Ouranos , not as in 'Sky ' but as in 'Heaven ' , ie the spiritual realm , also known by modern political correct philosophers as 'The World Of Ideas ' . And as you wrote down , the gods ca n't change the laws according to NP . That 's because they did n't made it . Because according to Platonic theology , the universe was created by THE God , aka Creator , aka Demiurge . Basically Plato 's theology says that always exists a Supreme Being , that created Heaven and all of its Beings , and then the Universe , and then ordered the Beings called 'Gods ' to make humans . As for the anthropomorphic , material figures of the gods , the story goes like this : Originally Gods are from Heaven , but they were sent ( by the Creator ) to come to Earth and take material form , to make Humans on Earth , and to watch over them . Eventually the Gods left Earth , once they made sure humans could survive on their own without them .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,AskHistorians,"The Greek name for Greece is Hellas , which is composite from Helios and Laas , which would translate as 'Sunland ' . At the ancient times , Greeks would call 'Sunland ' the region around mountain Parnassus , which was considered to be the mountain of god Apollo , god of the Sun , and lies in about the middle of modern Greece . ( See how the land of the Sun is related with the God of the Sun ) ? The Greeks also considered themselves to be descendants of Deucalion and Pyrra , who according to the myth , after a worldwide flood , their ark landed on mount Parnassus . So the myth says that these two stayed there and had children , and thus Hellenes ( how Greeks called each other ) also means `` Sunlandfolk '' , as ( according to the myth ) they were children of this couple , born at Parnassus . By the time of Alexander the Great , Greece could be considered in a way his empire . Greece as in that it was ruled by Greeks . After Alexander and before the Roman Empire , there were 3 Greek kingdoms , one that consisted of modern Greece and parts of Anatolia , another that included Egypt and the Middle East ( Syria , Israel , Lebanon , etc.. ) and one from Persia to India . During the Roman times , Greeks identified as Greek Romans , and during the Byzantine times , Greeks just called themselves Romans . When the Ottomans invaded , they called Greeks 'Rum ' , from the word Roman . The Byzantine Empire had already been weakened though by a number of other invaders like the Crusaders .

Alithinos,BestOfOutrageCulture,"Wow that 's such a huge wall of text , with so many points ! I 'm a Greek living in Greece myself , and I 'll try to answer you , to give you a better idea about your fellow blood-brothers . First of all it seems that you are stereotyping people . `` Arabs wear clothes like these , Greeks were clothes like these , Others wear clothes like these ... '' That 's a stereotype right there . Not all Greeks dress like those you saw at Copenhagen . And you say right there , that 'European looking like immigrants as seen as good ' while others are not , is racism . It 's a far right wing preachery . Which was the Greek movie you watched that bashed 'Europeans ' and praised the people you write about ? Again here you split people to two sides based only on racial / ethnic criteria , like a standard far-right nationalist skinhead would do . Why one would praise Kurds ? Because they have courage and are the only dudes on Earth that fight body with body against ISIS . Because they have ISIS soldiers coming to murder them , and Turkey helping ISIS and bombing them at the same time , yet instead of giving up they fight with courage for their freedom . That 's why . Because they do now what your fellow Greeks did in 1820s to free our country , so today you are free in Scandinavia speaking racist bullcrap instead of being a sex slave in the harem of Ali Pasha being raped every day . So show some respect to people fighting for their freedom perhaps ? Instead of automatically thinking that anyone who has a bit darker skin than you is a subhuman and being envy to Scandinavians because they have brighter skin . Ridiculous . As for the Islandish music sounding Arabic , you are the first one I ever listen to saying this . Arabic songs have a dinstictive difference that becomes immidately recognized when you listen to one : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=QUBvVTNRp4Q If you are an audiophile or listen to more Arabic songs and Greek 'Nisiotika ' songs , you will learn how to immidately recognize which is which from the first seconds they play . Now truth is , that it is common for a number of Greek artists to buy music rights from Arabs to sing Greek on it . Why this is happening ? Well because Arab music is uplifting and easy to dance . And it has nothing to do with Turkey . Turkish music is inherently different with Arab music . Now when it comes to things like these , influences on music , geography plays a considerable role . Perhaps over there in Scandinavia , Scandinavian music is influenced by musics from countries that neighbour Scandinavia , perhaps Russian , or Slavic . Greece neighbors not only with Italy , Albania , FYROM , Bulgaria , and Turkey , but also through the Mediterrenean Sea , with Egypt and Libya too . So to an extent there are influences from there too . Why Greek musicians do n't focus more on being influenced from older Greek music ? Well , the right next older music is Byzantine music . And because that 's Middle-Ages music , and during that time Byzantium was a theocratic Christian Empire , Byzantine music is associated with the Church . If you visit any Church at Greece , you will listen to Byzantine music . And if we had to go even back on time , we would have to use ancient music from the B.C . years . But the common view is that that would be silly . As silly as wearing Spartan armor in everyday life . You say the rebetiko music is becoming popular ? Really ? Were ? Not in Greece in any way . What young modern Greeks really listen to is HIP HOP songs like these : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=VwBj9kg6A7g and https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=rXXzH9oo178 You have to check your facts . Rebetiko is a music genre from 1920s for God 's shake . How many decades back is your idea for Greek people based on ? As for Constantinupolis ... Well that is a very fringe idea here in modern Greece . It 's only a thing some local far-righters say , and the reason is because for 1500 years prior to the Ottomans , Greeks lived in the Roman Empire , and its capital was Constantinupolis . So for some people , who think Greece should continue to regain the place it had prior to the Ottoman invasion , their dream is a new Byzantine Empire . But these people are often seem like outlandish to most modern Greeks . And one more thing : Greece ca n't become a 'Middle Eastern ' country . Because Greece is the spot from wich West and East begins . No really . All countries in the West of Greece are called 'Western ' by the world , and those East of Greece are considered to be 'Eastern ' countries . So practically , Greece will always be IN THE MIDDLE . I am amazed how you did n't noticed that Greeks named the sea around Greece Mesoyios which means `` Middle Earth Sea '' , ( Mediterrenean ) , because Greece has always been in the middle between West and East . And that answers your main question . Greece is n't becoming an Eastern country . Neither a Western one . Greece always was and still is a Center country , sitting right there in the middle . And the oldest account we have for that is the story that says that when Zeus left 2 eagles fly on the opposite directions , they went full circle around Earth and met at Delphi , which is the center of Greece , which is at the middle of the Earth , and thus is considered the geographic center of the Earth . That story is millenia old .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,gamedev,"I 'm more of a programming than a design guy . I tried to use and learn how to do some stuff with Blender , but I ended being so confused that I gave up . And the reason is n't just the general or aesthetic design of the UI . The reason is that there are like so many different versions of Blender , with incompatabilities and differences between them that overwhelm someone new to it . The biggest problem is consistency . That if you working with the latest version , most or many of the old tutorials that are for the older version wo n't work for the new , so then you might uninstall the new and install the old , but then the old doesnt have X feature , and then you ca n't find a tutorial for a specific thing in the old , but you find it in the newer version , etc ... If blender 's UI mostly had more consistency between versions , so if you were learning how to do one thing in one version you automatically also know how to do it with the other , I believe more people would use it . Taking a button from one menu window and hiding it at another menu window with a newer version is just going to force you to spend more time in re-learning how to do the exact same things in the new version if you already knew how to work the old version , and if you are completely new to Blender you will only get confused because the tutorial tells you `` Click on THIS button and in the window that will show up click on THAT button '' , but THAT button is nowhere in the window that shows up if you click on THIS button ! : /",Greek,Greek

For Atheneans , becoming a hoplite was n't necessary for every citizen , equipment was sold at retail , and you had to be wealthy enough to buy the equipment and become a hoplite . The Spartans showed that they were willing to use unorthodox tactics to win a war , later on during the Pelloponesian wars , at the siege of Athens . The Athenians were trapped behind the city walls , because the entrances were surrounded by Spartans , who were more powerful . Athenians had a steady supply of foods , coming from Pereaus through huge long walls that connected Athens with Pereaus . But the water they were drinking was coming from a river , and they had plumbing that would allow the water from the river to pass under the walls , to provide water inside the city . The Spartans discovered this , and threw rotten corpses on the river to poison its waters , and then Atheneans started getting sick and dying by the thousands ...",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,gamedev,"I believe two things are the most important in RPGs : 1 ) To make the player feel like he or she is in a living , responsive , interesting world . 2 ) To make the player feel he or she is meaningful in this world , and his/her actions matter . A good fighting system would produce fun , but most probably its not going to be what will hook the player in to playing the game I think . Look at The Elder Scrolls 1,2,3,4 ... and maybe 5 . Their combat systems mostly sucks . Yet all these games have become fan favorites and have captivated lots of players for lots of hours . Lots of people say that their stories suck too . But then what is it that made people love them and hooked them ? The world . If you have a fighting system thats awesome , and it was the main factor of providing entertainment , you could as well make an arena game were it is only fights and nothing else . Someone else wrote choices and consequences . These two can be factors that elevate the investment of the player and the fun his acquiring , but in order for choices and consequences to be interesting , the WORLD of the game has to be interesting too . Who would care what would happen given a choice , in a boring , uninteresting world ? Elder Scrolls was just one example . Take Paper Mario : The Thousand Year Door on the other hand . It has a simplistic basic old as hell fighting system , and it has no huge choices , neither something groundbreaking gameplay wise , neither crafting , neither , neither ... Yet those who played it , say its the best Mario RPG they played , and one of the best RPGs they played overall . What 's special about it ? Its world . Its places , its characters , its universe ... So here is my personal suggestion / recommendation : Focus on making the world feel unique and interesting , and not being generic . Put some unique monsters someone have never thought of , instead of plain old orcs and goblins . Add strange and unique architectures , think about the cultures of the people who live there , and try to make different places having visible the way the culture of its people . Develop deep NPC characters with personality , clothing style , talking style , likes and dislikes , occupations , and not just empty quest giving vessels . Make the WORLD interesting , so the player has an interest to it and what happens to it . From there and on , anything else can elevate the fun and the hook for the player , but the basic thing that there needs to be is a WORLD that feels unique , alive , interesting .",Greek,Greek

Mostly because its distorted , and the directors who make the movies , or the developers who make the video games , take way too much artistic license , and end up showing something that resembles more of a parody of the real thing . And well , the general public 's view on Hellenism is negative I believe.. Think about how recent popular media portray it . The movie 300 shows the priests of Apollo at Delphi as money-hungry goblins who sell their country and faith for Persian gold . The Hercules : Legendary Journeys series which was rather popular , had a voice on the intro saying `` were the ancient gods were pety and cruel , and plagued mankind with suffering '' ...

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"Hello , I am a man and very happy that I found your community ! Here I answer two questions , regarding the recommended subjects on the top / thread starter post : 1 ) No moment comes to my mind in which I have mistreated a woman , but I apologize for any mistreatments I might have done without my knowledge . 2 ) Why I am inferior ? This was n't a sudden realization but something that grew more as time passed by . Originally I felt women and men were equal , as a boy . At my teens I started noticing that women were special , and there were two things back then that made me feel like that . One was the fact that I was finding licking a vagina more sexy than PIV sex or other kinds of sexual games . The other thing was that I was to shy and could n't communicate my feelings of love , although by early High School I had more women friends than men . I could n't communicate my feelings because I feared . I could n't find the best way to communicate them , and the idea of rejection made me feel that I would be worthless . Time passed by , and as I kept growing up I realised that I enjoyed more eating women out than being eaten out or having casual sex , and there had to be a reason behind that . I also realised that women have the inherent power to make my mind foggy and submisive . Ther bodies are beautiful , and my mind 's instict like reaction whenever I was seeing a woman naked was to weaken and desire to worship the woman 's body . I fought violently with my own self to keep the urge at bay , to let logic subdue passion . And I made it . And in fact , right now I can control my passions and instincts to a point way further than the average man , perhaps more than I should . Anyway I recognized that there is a mechanic , and that practically , a woman has by nature what she needs to weaken my mind to a state that made me feel too weak , and what did I had ? Some extra points of stature ? And some more muscle strength than the average woman , but hey I 'm not a brawler type of man anyway . Women could to to me something I could n't do to women , and at that point , when I realised my weakness , I also realized for the first time that I am inferior by nature . Later on my viewpoint was strengthened further more . Not only I had an inherent weakness and women had an inherent power over me , and I enjoyed eating vagina more than anything else , but as I am a person who loves knowledge , and researches , and studies various kinds of stuff , like for example mythologies , mystical stuff , etc , I discovered in ancient texts more clues here and there about it . And of course at some point I realised that birth is something more than I thought , and that the meaning of it was far more than I thought . Women are blessed to create life . Life is a miracle and women do miracles that men ca n't . Humanity could n't exist without women , and we owe our existence to women , on top of the rest . Thus this was a short introduction , and there are more reasons I could write about , and on these I already stated I could go into more detail in future conversations , but now I 'm kind of sleepy as its too late local time , and ca n't do it now . I think that the pagan / mythological / esoteric / arguments that sing along woman 's superiority are rather interesting and should be analyzed and taken in consideration , so I look forward on a discussion about it . I hope we will have interesting discussions , and that we will reach perfect conclusions , and grow . Happy to have found you !",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"Hello , man here . If you are really asking this in honest , here are some things we could do : 1 ) Communicate that the idea of Female Supremacy is something more than a porn fetish . If someone googles the term , about 60 % to 65 % is femdom porn sites , about another 30 % is forum posts by men who speak about an evil female supremacy conspiracy , and the results for genuine and serious texts or conversation about it are less than 5 % . That communicates the wrong message . The message that its just a fetish that a minority of men has . So one step would be to clear to people 's mind what we refer to when we talk about female supremacy , and how it is different from this fetish and porn genre . 2 ) Get rid of the hate rhetoric some use . In order to reach more people , some messages must be communicated in a more moderate fashion , and really hate wo n't let the idea go far along , and it would be a shame because the idea has potential . Humans in general react negative and form negative views the moment they see hate speech . And truly , recognizing a reality has nothing to do with hate . But then a question arises : Do we say that women are superior of men as a reaction that takes birth from hate towards men , or are because we have realized that this is just the truth ? 3 ) Stop using easily proven false pseudo-science and false scientific facts . That does more harm than good , because the moment one sees a lie on something , her or his whole idea about that something instantly gets worse and that something looses credibility by that . I say this because I see a lot of such arguments being made on texts I have read online defending femsup . So if we really want to bring more people , we should use arguments that ca n't be proven false . If we manage to execute and complete these 3 steps , we should then have reached our first milestone , and have made the field ready for phase 2 . The goal of the first phase should be to clear up misconceptions , to build a friendly and welcoming profile , and to be able to defend positions with strong and serious arguments . It 's too early yet to talk about the next phases . If we really want this to happen , we should focus on phase 1 , until we complete it .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I think there should be a piece of truth behind them . I 'm not saying that they are all 100 % real , but neither 100 % lies . Here are some points I think about regarding the subject : 1 ) Some stuff might have literaly happened , but we have to consider that the people living back then used their own language , the words they used to use to describe , and did n't had our vocabulary or modern scientific terminology . For example , one reads in Hesiod that Gaia ( Earth ) gave birth to Uranos ( Sky ) , and then they became a couple , and Uranos embraced her , covered her , had intercourse , and made children . Well if you think of them as actual people , the way Hesiod personifies them it does n't make much sense , but consider that it speaks about the actual Sky and Earth . Then it all makes sense . Scientific sense . Because Earth predated its Atmosphere ( Sky ) , and thanks to the rain and chemical reactions of the two , life started on Earth . Many myths to me personally seem like primative albeit correct explanations of natural phenomena . But its in symbolic language , or at least that 's how it looks to us today , because we use different terminologies to describe the same things . 2 ) Even from the antiquity there were some that questioned the validity of some stories the way they were passed on from generation to generation . Plato writes specifically about Homer 's epics , and accuses him of taking too much of artistic license , to the point of distorting reality and actually making the Gods seem 'worse ' than they are . So one has to factor in when reading so old stories the chance of them starting as honest tellings of things that happened , and with the time and artistic license taken in the midtime turning to stories distorted and changed up to a bit .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hmm ... I think that I understand . Here is what . The truth is , that the term we refer to 'Hellenism ' is kind of ambiguous . The way I , and I think most people understand it , is as `` the religion the ancient Greeks , and Romans believed at '' . The truth is though that there were more than 1 'faith ' going on in the landmass we call `` Greece '' , and during the time we call `` antiquity '' . For example there were the official cults . These most often considered the worship of Dionysus as wrong , and its worshipers as savages , and some city-states forbid it . Personally , I have concluded that there were 4 major different worldviews : 1 . The one described in books such as in Homer 's . That 's probably the most popular view , its the one were afterlife is about the Underworld , the Elysian Fields , and Tartarus , about gods living at palaces in mount Olympus etc . 2 . Orphicism . This is based on Orpheus 's books , ( entitled collectively `` Orphica '' ) which unlike Homer 's , are strictly relegion-centered . The worldview of Orphicism is rather different than the more popular , and at many ancient city-states `` Official '' belief which follows Homer 's books . Orphicists for example believed in reincarnation , that the soul makes cycles and lives many lives . 3 . Pythagoreanism . Pythagoreanism is mostly a way of life , which says people should perfect themselves to become godlike . Supposedly there is a way of life that leads to godhood . 4 . Platonic theology . Plato believes the gods never existed in a material form but where and are powerful spirits , created by THE God . As in there was always a single benevolent creator God , who created the 'gods ' , the Universe , and `` Heaven '' , as in the aetheric / spiritual realm . As you can see , even at ancient times there were a number of different theology schools / paths/ religions , that all involved the common , known gods and goddesses such as Apollo and Athena , yet had some rather different views . Kind of how Christians , Muslims and Jews all believe in the God of Abraham , yet they are so different at the same time . Which is why I said that the term `` Hellenism '' is kind of ambiguous , the same way `` Abrahamism '' would be ambiguous .",Greek,Greek

Ethiopians call their country Ethiopia , a Greek name that does n't have a meaning in their language , and Greeks not only do n't have a problem with that , but feel proud that the Ethiopians choose a name made by the Greeks . Now when it comes to Macedonia , its more complicated . First of all , note that Alexander is seen as the founder of our nation in here , and for that , he is quite revered . He basically put an end to the countless wars Greeks where fighting against each other . Now what the average Greek thinks is `` Why do they have to use one of the names used by our people for our people and do n't they come up with one of the thousands other of names that they could use instead ? '' Among the names I have heard spoken by fellow Greeks who think would be fitting names , are Vardaria , and Peonia . I believe you already know where the name Vardaria comes from , and as for Peonia , its another ancient name , of a kingdom that was placed exactly where your country is . The decision of your country 's recent governments is seen as an attempt of usurpation with the ultimate goal of making terittorial claims and getting a piece of the pie from Greece 's tourist industry , Greece 's main industry . The problem is that aside from the name dispute , there 's nothing seperating us . We are friendly with your cousins , the Serbians , and we could be even better friends with you , who are closer to us . But hey , your government picks up a name of an ancient kingdom of our people , places statues of the man that put an end to our civil wars and united us all in a single bunch , all around saying he was not one of us , and makes up conspiracy theories with scape-goating similar to how nazis scape-goated Jews . To tell you the truth , I know why you are doing this . You do it because you have a large population of Albanians , and want them to loose their ethnic identity and make them think they are `` Macedonians '' , because you are afraid that they might do to your country what they did to Serbia , and Kosovo . Start a rebellion to split the country to two pieces . And while I do n't want you to have problems with the Albanians , on the other hand I believe that there are better ways to keep peace and unity than this . Albanian nationalism does n't have to be neutralized by Albanian opression by making them think they are something else than what they are . Nationalism can also be beaten most of the times with education . Real education , teaching to people why there are n't truly superior and inferior races and nations , and how such ideologies are based on grounds proven false by science decades ago . But what does your government do ? It tries to supress Albanian nationalism , by promoting a new kind of nationalism , `` Macedonian '' nationalism , and to achieve unity between the local Slavic and Albanian populations , it demonizes a third bunch of people , Greeks . So it fights nationalism with more nationalism ... : / But N + N = 2N .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,GREEK,"Greek is a hard language to learn , so bravo for your tough choice ! If you have some knowledge of ancient Greek , it might be kind of easier to learn modern Greek . There is a very important factor that will help you a lot to bridge ancient and modern Greek . Although grammar might have changed a lot , most words both in ancient and modern Greek use the same roots . For example the modern word λατομείο ( quarry ) is made up from ancient roots λαας ( laas ) and τομή ( tomi ) , which mean 'stone ' and 'cut ' . Thus λα-τομ-ειο ( la-tom-eio ) litteraly translates to ( stone-cut-tery ) , ie the place were they cut stones . So if you know the basic roots of the Greek language , you can get an idea of what a word you first see is related to and part of its meaning without looking for it at a vocabulary , by breaking it to its roots , which are common for the most part in ancient and modern Greek .",Greek,Greek

As for Plato , there is this view that he writes down `` esoteric '' things in his books . Later teachers of the Academy like Plotinus and Proculs focused on the theologic / metaphysical aspects of Plato 's works , and studied them , and wrote their own books on interpreting and explaining these subjects .

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"The two sexes have both similarities and differencies . One is better at some particular things , the other in the other . It just happens that what the female is better at , is more important that what the male is better at . My view as to why women are superior differs from the views of some other members of this sub-reddit , but I do believe in female supremacy . Unlike snowy_angels I do n't believe that men are inherently evil , neither that the aggresivenes Misandr4eva writes about is instinctual , but I do believe that our world has gone way in the wrong direction and is sick . So why women are superior ? Because they give life . Sounds simple and ordinary ha ? Think about it a little more . You live because of a woman . Your mother and father got to live because of women too . The universe hatched out of the Cosmig Egg , also known as the first and single matterial body that consisted of all the matter before the Bing Bang . And I ask you , who gives birth to eggs ? Exactly . Woman is blessed to create life , and is n't that a miracle ? And do n't forget that a woman can get impregnated even without a man . We are not required for the species to keep existing , they do . And what do you realise once you analyze and think of that ? That we are inferior . But that 's not bad , not necessarily . You ask how can female supremacy not be hate speech , and I answer to you , that not only it is n't hate speech ( some might came to defend female supremacy because of hate towards men , but that 's not the rule ) , but for me its the opposite : love speech . And why it is Love Speech ? Here are 3 arguments : 1 ) Supremacy does n't necessarily means or include hate , abuse , or exploitation . That is a fallacy caused because the most famous supremacist did all these ( and even more ) , and I refer to that psycho , Shitler . But forget about him . Think of the cats , and dogs , and inanimate objects like chairs and computer keyboards . They are INFERIOR , and we acknowledge it , as we also acknowledge that Humans are superior to them . But that does n't mean that we hate cats or keyboards . Nor that we want to exterminate them or abuse them . I love cats , and keyboards . And acknowledging my superiority to them does n't make me hate them . 2 ) Men have ruled Earth and women for quite some long time . We had our time , our try . Would n't it be just if we now backed off and let women to take over and rule Earth and men ? I believe that this would be justice , and that we owe it to them , that it 's their turn now . 3 ) Do n't you love the one responsible for being alive ? It is women that bring us to life . Should n't we be thankful about it , and respect them and love them for it ? And I do n't mean our mothers specifically , I talk in general . Should n't we love , respect , and be thankful ? I think we should . And tell me , which is better way to show love , other than putting aside our ego , and letting love flood our bodies from toes to head , and recognize the reality , that it is women who create life , that they are our creators , that we owe them our lives , and that we do n't have such abilities , and alone we would be worthless and could n't keep our species surviving , and that respect , and love and servitude towards them , as also them having a higher say and taking charge in our families , and later outside , is justifiable because of all of that . To put aside your ego and recognize your place us a man is one of the atmost actions of love . And I 'm not talking about the love between only one man and one woman , I 'm talking about daily feelings of love for all women , loving Life herself . And I say herself because indeed , in most languages in which a word has to be masculine or feminine , Life has a feminine name , and in all mythologies around the world , Life when personified , is personified as a woman . So recognizing our position is an action of love , as also ... 4 ) Women acknowledging their superiority is also an action of love . Because with superiority comes titles , and with titles come duties and responsibillities . And is n't an action of love for them to take the burden of these off us , by acknowledging their superiority , and accepting their rights/responsibillities ? It is . So there you go . I hope this message helped you .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"Hi , I am a man . 1 ) On PIV : It 's what is required for making a new life , a new baby , but kind of banal and cliche . I 'm in the minority of men who enjoy eating pussy more than that . Why ? Because I like nice tastes , I also devour sweets like cakes whenever I find them . 2 ) Depends on the kind of pornography . Most of it is too cliche and puts women in degrading positions and I do n't like it . But among 95 % of stupid , disrespectful , sometimes uncanny and cringy stuff , there are some rare diamonds . Truth is porn is a substitute mostly used by men . Often because we have fantasies that we are feeling shy or embarassed to share . And other times because many have too much ego , that does n't let them be with women and resort to that . Some of us men are also too shy with women because we are afraid with you , your judgement . 3 ) I am indifferent . I am not part of it , and I ca n't talk if I do n't have an opinion based on something , and my lack of experience in LGBTQ makes me indifferent . 4 ) As the creator of the subreddit said , I believe its a good idea to let those men genuinely interested in speaking about the subject , with maturity and respect , to do so . I 'm new here and a man , but I am here because I believe that the acknowledgement that women are superior than men is n't something that should divide us , but something that should unite us . I believe that if you study a lot , you will come to the conclusion , that the sexes are not enemies , and that both women and men can be better than how we are in our modern society . The huge problem is the established indoctrination many men and women get by medias , families , etc , that teaches us wrong ways . If we could free our minds as a society , we could make this Earth a living paradise . IF ... 5 ) Why take it seriously ? Here is what . I 've been searching the internet for quite some long time to find a place where people can have conversations , regarding the superiority of women . What I 've been finding all that time was porn sites . Sites that tried to satisfy certain male fetishes for money . I was left hopeless , as I thought that nobody cared , that nobody was taking this idea seriously . And today I found this sub-reddit . And subscribed . And I hope it will be active , and that it wo n't suffer troll wars . So perhaps its the best we have for now , and that 's enough to have hopes for it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"Unfortunately there are some mistakes in the article , from pseudo-science arguments dropped to basic fallacies . Here are some : 1 ) Regarding life expectancy . That men will live up to 40 years and women up to 130 is completely made up and does n't have a scientific ground . 2 ) A proper ideology does not take in account technology , and has ideas that can be applied and implemented no matter the available tech . Thus declaring PIV as an illegal activity , is wrong . Because what would you do if for some reason the technology for non-PIV impregnation was lost ? How would the tribes of people in poor countries like south Africa , or the aboriginals of Australia survive ? Clearly not enough thought was put in to this . 3 ) Schools teaching witchcraft ? Seriously ? 4 ) The writer bases her ideology on the fact that suddenly in one day / night the world changes and women all over take over . This ca n't and wo n't happen , if change ever happens , it will happen very slowly and gradualy , from town / city to town / city , from country to country , from continent to continent . We can do two things : Either believe that it will never happen and go crazy and make a joke about it , or believe that we can change the world , and be serious about it , and base the `` what to happen '' on solid grounds . 5 ) Thus you ca n't end wars . Its in the nature of humans . Even matriarchal tribes of people have done wars . Unfortunately that ca n't change . 6 ) You ca n't put an end to countries either . There are women so patriotic and courageous that would grab a rifle , a knife , whatever they can , and defend the ideal of 'country ' with their lives , that make many men feeling embarashed . Take a look at the Kurdish women for example and how they fight ISIS . They are true heroines . 7 ) That vegan part at the end ... We do farm animals because we need them for healthy survival . Because we need nutritionals they offer . Eating meat made humans grow taller , raise intelligence , and strengthen our immunity systems . Necessary evil .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"A RPG is n't simply a game where 'you play a role ' . But a game in which the role that you play depends on your personal preference , and you can develop the character to fit that role . With that in mind , the more roles a RPG allows you to play , the merrier . In Mass Effect you play Shepard , sure , but you can make Shepard play the role you want him to play to an extend . You can be an angel , an arse , womanizer , a gay , a forever alone guy , a racist , a liberal ... In the Elder Scrolls you can typically be 'the chosen ' of the main story , or the assasin , or the thief , or the mage ... Thing is , in Fallout 4 you only seem to be able to be a good family person , or a carpenter , and well for some people the role play options seem less than enough .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"The thing is that while Fallout 4 can be a very enjoyable game , it does n't provide much of the experience we have associated with 'RPG ' . Regarding shallowness , its a fact that Bethesda 's games have becoming shallower and simpler progressively since Oblivion . Oblivion was shallower than Morrowind , Fallout 3 shallower than Fallout 2 , Skyrim shallower than Oblivion , Fallout 4 shallower than Fallout 3 . Note that I still love Bethesda games , and play them many hours each . Yet they leave a lot to be desired .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"But that is n't necessarily a good thing . Complexity is only bad when it gets in the way of enjoying the game . GUI complexity or controls complexity can become hurdle in enjoying the game . But gameplay complexity can be fun . Well some people perhaps wo n't like games were there are more things going on in them because they ca n't be arsed to learn more mechanics than 3-4 early on that they will repeat until the game is over . But for some other people , such a simple game will not feel challenging or intriguing enough to be enjoyable . So it is a matter of preference in the end . As for RPGs , traditionally , they were the games for those who did liked more complexity in the actual gameplay . Which is why they were n't so popular back in the 90s for example as they are today , and everyone back then only liked platform games like Mario , Crash Bandicoot and Sonic , that only had like 2 buttons , run / attack and jump . With Halo and Call of Duty the mindset of 'dumb down ' that was existing in the platform games came to FPSs too , witch ended with FPSs getting way more linear level design , fewer guns , fewer gadgets / power ups , less stuff like finding keys to open doors and discovering secret areas , less maps , etc . The dumbing down came up to a point where today 's FPSs consist of levels which are straight lines full of cutscenes that last 4-5 hours and punish exploration , and from like 30 to 100 multiplayer maps that FPSs were getting in late 90s / early 2000s , now they have like 4 maps , and they ask you to pay full price ... The FPS genre died because it lost its complexity , and now it has become an interactive movie like experience where developers put immersion breaking hovering arrows over characters and doors on levels that only have a single path to follow , so dumbos do n't get lost in a straight line . Poor FPS ... : ( And now ? NOOOWWWW ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The jinx of dumbing down is attacking RPGs too .

Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"The Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion . Unfortunately Skyrim was n't as exciting as Oblivion to keep me more than it . After a point I recognized that about 90 % of Skyrim 's quests were following a pattern , that they were all repeatitive fetch quests , so I got bored of this game quickly and abandoned it without even playing all of its quests . The uninspired writing , repeatitive gameplay formula , zero NPC character development , non existent facial expressions etc , of Skyrim 's quests made Oblivion look golden even though its graphics did n't aged well , and its combat system was n't that good . In case you have n't played Oblivion , I 'd suggest you to do so if you can cope with the old graphics and its not as much exciting fighting system . Because Oblivion might be weaker in these 2 aspects , but its stronger where Skyrim is n't : In having interesting and better written , more memorable , side quests and dialogues . Aside from games of the Elder Scrolls series , the games that I spent most time playing were the Zeldas of N64 , Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask . Although they are n't RPGs .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"Since you say come from Zelda , I 'll recommend you these two games : The Witcher 3 The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Here is why : Personally I grew up with a N64 , and I got for it the two Zelda games that came out and loved them . And IMO they are the best Zelda games period . ( Play them if you havent ! ) When I first played Ocarina of Time I was amazed by the fresh for its age 3d graphics , and the open-worldness of the game after you leave Kokiri Village . I could go at any place of Hyrule Field I wanted ! And I thought that its world was huge . And I kept thinking of that until I played The Elder Scrolls : Oblivion . Oblivion blew me out and made me feel the same nice experience all over again . Only that with Oblivion the graphics were way better , the world way larger , the NPCs way more , the swords way more , the dungeons way more , the side quests way more ... Just everything I liked , 20,30 times more ! ! ! My perception of what I considered a 'big game world ' radically changed with Oblivion . And as for The Witcher 3 , it has a weird Majora 's Mask kind of vibe , in that its dark and has a more mature vibe . Plus you will feel more familiar playing it since you come from Zelda , because in Witcher 3 just like in Zelda you are a specific character , the game is 3rd person , and the combat needs good reflexes with timing and pressing block or attacking at the right time . Plus , you get to sail boats ! ( yay ! ) And Geralt is attracting girls as much as Link does in OoT if not more , lol . So if you are looking to get into RPGs with something that feels more familiar with what you already played , go for Witcher 3 first . But note that playing Witcher 3 has a a widespread side effect : After playing it , every other game will give you the impression that it has awful graphics .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"Video removed . Anyway , regarding the game 's graphics here are my 2 cents : The game would look FINE if it did n't had an aweful texture streaming problem .

The problem can be solved with the ENB mod , but still , Bethesda should n't release broken games expecting modders to fix them .",Greek,Greek

As for people not getting what they pray for , I must ask : Did they followed Jesus 's path before asking from him anything ? Did they gave away their riches ? Did they forgiven the people they hated ? Did they helped other people without expecting anything in return ? Did they removed their pride becoming humble ? If not how can they say that Jesus is a liar ? You have to show some good will , to give something to get something in return . Years ago my father lost consience . I was terrified seeing him on the bed with his eyes open , not talking , not responding to anything . The doctors told us that his body could n't do the body functions and thus his condition was critical and that he had hours left . My mother insisted that he gets in life support system . Even with the life support system the doctors told us that his days were few and he would n't 'wake up ' . But my mother insisted . My father was in a comma with life support almost a year . And on 15th of August , the Saint Mary 's day for us Orthodox Christians I prayed to Madonna . The next day he woke up . He could talk . Doctors told us they did n't expected it and they were surprized . After some more days in ICU , he was able to come back to our house . And he lived long enough , about 10 years more after that . You can argue that this was a coincidense and what not , but for me it was getting what I asked through praying . If you are a good person and you do good deeds and help people , good will come back to you , even in ways you do n't expect .

Why did the terrorists did the attacks on France specifically ? If they wanted , they could have done the same in some of the other countries they passed through before reaching France . Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia , Croatia ... Yet they did n't . My guess is because these countries do n't pick sides on civil wars in foreign countries and do n't try to change the political statuses in the countries that the terrorists come from . France bombed Libya , and decided to support anti-Assad forces in Syria . That 's why it got attacked . When a foreign country decides to pick a side in a civil war in some other country , it immidately makes new enemies . And even after the war is over , and the people of the country become friends with each other again , the foreign country will still have bad reputation .

Alithinos,Libertarian,"Unemployment does n't mean people are lazy . It means businesses ca n't survive because of very little consumption , so they close . As for what lead to Greece 's current economic state , it has been lots of different factors . You do n't f**k up something that badly , so easily . I am a Greek myself , and learning all the news from past years , and doing my own bit of research , here are some very important factors : 1 ) Corrupted politicians . The politician elite from decades ago had made sure to establish immunity law that prevents parliamentarians from facing justice . The justice system ca n't call to jury a parliamentarian , and a parliamentarian 's crimes are erased when he stops being in the parliament , and the only exception would be if the parliament voted for the removal of immunity for select cases . In the past decades there had been many scandals in Greece involving improper spending of state 's money , stealing taxpayer 's money , etc . In the late 90s the equivalent of 96.5 billion euros was stolen from the share market of Greece shrinking its economy to half , and nobody ever went to jail for this . At 2000s , the government secretly took the reserves of the pension system and gambled it by turning it to bad share investments that lost their value , leading to a loss of 75 % of Greece 's pension money reserve . Again nobody faced justice in a court for this . And except from these 2 greatest scandals , there have been numerous smaller ones were the government would fake lots when it would come to giving infrastructure work on businesses to favor certain businesses , and the businesses in exchange would price the work higher than normal and would share the extra with the involved corrupted officials . Several billions of money were stolen from Greece , and if everything was healthy , its economy would be at least double the size today , and the pension funds would have 4 times more capacity . 2 ) The euro itself did n't damaged Greek economy , but the globalization rules that came with it , along with the spread of internet , did . Because Greek businesses used to be very local-focused and oblivious about what 's going on in the rest of the world . It had been the local culture , that a Greek would be making savings for most of his life while working at someone else 's businesses , to start his own small family shop one day . And this has been happening for some decades before Greece joining the Euro , and it was a feasible and succesful strategy . But when the Euro came , suddenly the level of competition skyrocketed . Not only each small and local family business would have to compete with other local businesses , but also with e-shops from all around EU . Because importing stuff from other EU countries would have no more import taxes and custom fees . As a result , one could buy from a foreign country the exact same good at a price considerably lower than what local shops where selling . Down to 1/5 of the local price . Which is why after the euro and the spread of internet , many small , local Greek retail shops started closing , raising unemployment . If you are selling a certain type of machinery at 500 $ and an electronic shop at some other country sells it for 150 $ , and the additional cost is only like 30 $ for the transfer fees , guess what , the majority of local consumers will start buying from the foreign e-shop , to end up paying 180 $ instead of 500 $ . You could argue that the local shop should drop its prices , but the production costs and taxes from country to country differ , so it ca n't be done beyond a certain point .",Greek,Greek

While they did increased my frame rate when not in specific places like towns , at towns the same thing is happening no matter what 's the settings .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,fo4,"From what I read on the internet after googling enough , the problem is probably caused because the engine instead of loading up the textures beforehand in the traditional way , it uses texture streaming , which loads the textures as you play , and that is what is causing the problem . Basically the game does n't load the textures during the loading screen but does so while you play , and most probably thus the bottleneck seems to be the hard drive , as the game literaly loads stuff from the hard drive to ram while you play , and the CPU and GPU thus wait for the game to load the textures from the hard drive . Yet still , I believe Bethesda should have listed a fast SSD at the game 's requirements instead of an HDD if that 's the case . Also note that this tech that is causing the frame drops , texture streaming , is what is also responsible for many textures not loading at all or taking too long to load while you play the game . I do n't understand why they decided to use a tech that causes problems like that . I guess so the can reduce loading screen times , yet that 's a huge tradeoff , and I 'd prefer to wait a few seconds , or even a couple of minutes more , instead of getting single digit frame drops every 10 yards / meters my character walks in the world .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,Amd,"I bought an HD 6850 back in 2011 . But it had a problem , and once I 'd install the AMD driver , my computer would crash either with a black screen or with colored bars . I took it back to the store and they RMA 'd it and gave me a new one . The new one had the same problem again . So I took it back too , and then they gave me a new one , and the new one had the same problem ... The cards would n't crash with the standard and generic Windows driver , but they would do with the AMD drivers , no matter the version . Eventually the warranty ended and I discovered this here : http : //www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/updated-amd-ati-2d-clock-guide.117633/ And it worked . Though there has been another problem too : I ca n't get the Catalyst to load the profile with the fix by default each time I boot the computer , so every time I boot it I have to pray that I will have enough time for the Catalyst to load up so I can manually load the profile , before the computer randomly crashes . Its such a stressful thing each day , and I wonder : Why is this problem happening guys ? It is after all a software problem , ie the hardware itself wo n't crash without the AMD drivers , so how can is it that a problem like thatis , that generates hard crashes was never fixed ? Plus , it 's about time to upgrade my graphics card , and I 've been thinking of buying a new AMD gpu , but I 'm afraid to do so . I 'm worried that the new one will have the same problem again .

For some reason the game 's frame rate drops at places and its not hardware limiting it , as hardware is underused . Plus as it also is stated by another user , changing most graphics settings does n't remove the drops . The only thing that reduces the kind of drops I 'm talking about is fade distance of things like actors .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"After answering some of your questions , I 'd like to comment regarding the authenticity more generally . What makes me curious is that some people over here in Greece name a number of special celebrations they organize with names of known ancient festivals , even though they do n't follow the practices of the particular ancient festivals . Perhaps there are practical issues that does n't allow us to truly recreate and re-establish the old festivals and mysteries the way they were , but then why to pick a particular name for a festival if you are going to do something else ? Once I saw pictures on Facebook of some people that gathered at the Autumn Solstice and celebrated , full with flowers and smiles . This confused me , as according to what I 've read , this particular day was a sad day . A day in which Persephone is forced to go to Hades because she had being tricked . And the ancient tradition was that people commiserated to the sorrow of Demetra losing her daughter . Seeing people celebrating at that day , people who say that follow this particular religion , was equivalent to seeing Christians celebrating Good Friday and have fun with it . Does n't make much sense . But I 've found out through the internet that there are those people commonly called `` recons '' ( those who try to reconstruct and do as the ancient did ) , and others , who just include Hellenic gods and goddesses to their own system , like for example new age or even Wiccans adopting Pan as the male god of the Wicca . And these groups have their own viewpoints on stuff and just mix stuff . The truth is that there is a number of different 'groups ' of people who do worship the gods in different ways . Not all are reconstructive . Personally I 'm more of a recon guy . I say to myself `` If I am to follow this and say that I 'm following it , I should follow it the way it has been presented and been '' and I use primary sources , ancient books that where written before the ban of the religion by the Roman Empire .

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"So I decided to start a thread on some Greek forum that is about tech stuff , and the thread was a guide on how to build a PC with hardware as close to that of the Xbone and PS4 as possible , to show that with 500 to 613 euros , someone could build a PC as close to console hardware as possible , but somewhat more powerful than XboxOne or PS4 .

Apparently according to peasant logic , consoles are magic devices that can run `` Super-Speed-Code '' which can make a game run on a 1.6ghz Kabini processor way faster than it would run on an FX8320 4.0Ghz cpu , and for someone to build a PC that will be able to handle graphics as good as console graphics with magic console optimization , he would need a $ 1000+ PC '' Sheldon_Cooper '' and `` Brotrainer '' defend the magic of consoles by using Doom 3 as an example , saying `` it played on 60 fps on Xbox but PC could n't run it maxxed '' . Of course it seems they ca n't understand what a difference a resolution makes , 'cause PC resolutions of that time like 1024x768 and 1400x900 are completely different beasts than 480i that SDTVs had , or the difference dynamic lighting with static lighting have .

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"While the most cost effective way to buy games is during Steam Sales through Steam , when a new game releases the price it has on a shelf is cheaper than its Steam price . The last 3 games I remember buying retail were Skyrim , Dishonored , and Tomb Raider . Tomb Raider on Day1 was 30 euros on retail,60 on Steam . Skyrim on Day1 was 40 euros on retail,60 on Steam . Dishonored on Day1 was 40 euros on retail,60 on Steam . I do n't really get why on its launch day a game might cost up to two times the price on Steam than it does on retail . Does anybody know why ? My guess is that Steam just decides a single price for everyone without taking into account various factors like cost of living , average wage , etc while retail stores factor all these factors upon setting the price . But there has to be more than that . I mean Steam might be international , but it makes billions every year , sure they could hire a few people to do some research .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"There is the Orphica Corpus that has survived , along with some related objects . Probably it is not complete . The Orphica corpus consists of a number of books directly attributed to Orpheus , while some of them that usually are included in it where where written by anonymous writers , followers of the Orphic tradition . In this corpus , there are lots of things including myths / history , ritual hymns accompanied by appropriate incense to burn at sacrifices , knowledge about the power of certain crystals and amulets / talismans , guide about afterlife ... Moreover , the theology of Plato is based on Orphic principles . And there were later philosophers that expanded on it , and eventually created what is today called 'Neoplatonism ' , which is perhaps one of the most complete and detailed theology / metaphysics systems there are in general .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,AskHistorians,"I only know about Egypt and Greece . Egypt is called like that because that 's how Greeks initially called it , and later on Romans adopted the name , and through the Roman Empire , the west came to call this country Egypt . As for the origin of the name , it is given in a Greek mythological genealogy of the human tribes . The name originates from Egyptos , the brother of Danaos . As for Greece , it is kind of more complicated . The Greeks were an indigenous tribe of the place we call Greece . Ancient Greeks ( in general , not the tribe ) though did n't collectively called themselves Greeks , but Hellenes . Greeks again were called like that after the 'forefather ' , Graecus , who was said to be a son of Deucalion . Ancient Greeks believed that the 'Greeks ' were the most ancient tribe / nation of the world , and thus the name in Greek is translated as `` Oldfolk '' . Because the ancient Hellenic tribe of the Greeks spoke the same language as the rest of the Hellenic peoples , and had the same religion , the Romans called collectively Hellenic peoples `` Greeks '' . And through the Roman Empire , the name was spread in the West . Similarly the first Hellenic tribe the East met when Alexander the Great occupied the Eastern countries , were the Ionians , and as a result most Eastern countries call Greece to this day the equivalent of 'Ionia ' .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hi . Personally I 'm not really active when it comes to offerings , ceremonies etc . I 'm more of a Pythagorian kind of guy , and among us the concept of 'Excellence ' has a special importance . Simply put this concept is the idea of improving ourselves to perfection , to become more like the gods . So that constitutes of constant improvement of one 's self : improvement of our physical bodies , mind , character ... What does that mean in day to day life ? Well one thing is I have decided to exercise my body every so often . ( In the path of perfecting my body ) . I was too obese in the past , now I 'm considered 'average ' . I also spend time learning new stuff , in the path of leading my mind do perfection . ( stuff like solving problems eg math , geometry , programming do work ) .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hello . I 'm not active in rituals but I 've been studying primary resources about mainstream and orphic , public and esoteric hellenic religion and metaphysics . I will try to answer some of your questions the best I can . *Wreaths and garlands have been associated and are part with many religious practices and rituals including wedding , funeral , and some mysteries . I think I remember reading somewhere that orpheotelestai ( orphic roaming priests ) used to wear flower wreaths during all rituals . I have n't ( at least yet ) discovered a source about hellenism priests in general wearing flower garlands in ALL rituals , but in some , sure . * I remember reading in a book of Iamblichus about the theology / metaphysical role of the statues . When you invoke a divinity , the divinity is going to come . But it is a spiritual being , and to be in this world he or she needs a vessel . The statues act as vessels for the gods and goddesses to get into , when you invoke them . If you do n't supply an appropriate vessel , there is a chance that the entity will come to you and use your body as a vessel . This can be a frightening experience , especially if you are not prepared . This according to Iamblichus . I think it would be a good idea to place on the altar the corresponding statue of the entity you are invoking . * Because there is n't the appropriate mutual respect for our religion that is required for a public altar to stay clean and pure . Because there is a certain etiquette and altars must stay clean and not be contaminated . And if the altar is at a public place , there are high chances someone will desecrate it . By keeping the altar at your apartment or house , or in general in your private property , you are sure that nobody will desecrate it , and you will also have privacy . * Not at all rituals or at all occasions . At funerals black is preferred . White symbolizes joy and purity . In general you want to be as pure as possible during a sacrifice , which is why there is the cleansing ritual `` Katharmos '' before the sacrifice itself . So you wear white because it 's a symbol of purity . * Part of the ritual .",Greek,Greek

At the revolution people saw everyone related with the royal government as evil , and the church at this time was part of the state . Thus they also turned against some bishops and priests that had good relations with the crown , and decided to separate church from state , and from that the idea of secularism came up . After the French , other western peoples decided to do the same and overthrow monarchies , and separate state from religious authorities . Now that you know what gave birth to secularism in the west , ask yourself : Are there the same factors that would lead Muslims to the same state ? 1 . Are they ruled by cruel monarchies that in purpose make the majority of people poor ? 2 . Are the royals apathetic , indifferent , or even snob and ironic to the hardships of the people ? 3 .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hello . : ) Studying Hellenism I found out that there are 3 major different traditions of theology involved and related . Here is a short description of each : The oldest - Mythic . This is the one that follows the old myths in a way we could call 'orthodox ' . In the beggining there was Chaos , and then chaos born Earth and Sky . Earth and Sky gave birth to the One-hundred-handers , the Giants , and then the Titans . Humans were built by Prometheus who used dirt from the Earth and water . After death , humans are judged on Hades , and either go to the Tartarus or the Blessed 's Islands . Orphic - The mysteries cult . In the beggining there was a Cosmic Egg , out of which the universe spawned . Humans were built by Prometheus , but ashes from burnt Titans was used as an ingerdient for the mix out which the human body was created , and the Gods offered humans Soul , as a result humans have a 'Titanic ' evil side , along with their 'Divine ' side . After death the soul of a human either drinks the water of Oblivion and forgets everything , or the water of Memory and keeps its memory . The soul is in a constant cycle of reincarnations . Platonic - The One who created all . In Platonic theology , the Gods , and the Universe where created by another pre-existing entity called the One . Humans were created by the Gods , following the One 's orders . Depending on the way one lives his or her life , after death he or she will either reincarnate on the mortal world , or might earn his freedom from it , and his Soul to stay on the 'Aetheric ' realm forever . Do you follow strictly one of these 3 traditions/theologies , or you mix beliefs of the three ? Please let me know , and tell me your opinions about it .",Greek,Greek

So let 's start with the way we Greeks call our country , which is with a name that sounds like 'Hellas ' . That 's a composite word literaly translated as `` Lightstone '' , that has the same meaning as 'Sunland ' . I guess the ancients called that place like that because of its sunny weather . So practically we Greeks today call each other a 'Sunlander ' . : P Now as for the name `` Greek '' , the Greek word sounds more like 'Grecos ' , and its a word related to 'graea ' , meaning an old person .

Alithinos,fo4,"Hi guys I wish I could have fun enjoying the game , but unfortunately I ca n't . The frame drops does n't let me . But I tested the game and I discovered that there is something really weird going on . While playing the game , most of the time my CPU would be used at about 50 % to 60 % , and my GPU at 70s % . http : //imgur.com/a/0EoRu That should n't be happening . Because what should be responsible for frame rates are CPUs and GPUs . Let me tell you that my RAM is 8gb in case you are wondering . Now when a CPU is fully used and a GPU is not , then that 's a `` CPU bottleneck '' . When the GPU is fully used and the CPU is not , that 's a `` CPU bottleneck '' , and normally , one 's computer will have one of these two , and the perfect scenario is to have both CPU and GPU fully used . But as you can see Fallout 4 does n't fully use either , for some reason . And there something more : When the infamous frame drops occur , both CPU and GPU usage falls down even more instead of increasing ... Which means that these two pieces are wasting time while they await for commands to execute . That means that the engine does n't send the CPU and GPU enough stuff to do . Which explains why people are facing the frame drops no matter if they lower the settings or not , no matter their hardware performance either . As you can see in my screen captures , the lower the frame rate , the lower the percentage usage of the GPU . And the same goes on for the CPU . So that 's it . The horrible frame drops are not a hardware issue but a software issue , and that means that the engine has some serious problem . I hope Bethesda fixes it .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,offmychest,"I see people use terms such as 'Platonic Love ' , 'Platonic Relationships ' etc , and they have no idea what they are talking about . Everyone and their mom seem to be thinking that Platonic Love is to love someone but do n't have sex with that someone . Well , you are wrong ! The term comes from the definition and analysis Plato does to love , in his book 'Symposium ' . If you would read that book you would discover that that the general assumption people have about what is Platonic Love , is far away from what Plato describes as love . So 'Platonic Love ' is n't being friends and hanging out with a person of the opposite sex , and not having sex with it . So what is 'Platonic Love ' you ask ? Well Plato recognizes two types of love : 1 ) Bodily love , which is the feeling of sexual urge you feel that is generated because you see a beautiful body of someone . 2 ) Spiritual love , which is the feeling of need you feel to be with someone , know that they are OK , and feeling nice when you are with that person . According to Plato a person can feel for another person both kinds of love . One does n't exclude the other . So basically one person can love spiritually another ( Platonic Love ) , and also feel erotic urges for it ( Sexual Love ) . And its a type of love not exclusive to straight individuals but also homosexuals . Plato says that with Spiritual love you fall in love with a person 's Soul , its identity , who he or she is , while with Bodily love you fall in love with its body . So basically the difference between the two kinds of love , is that . I just share that with the hope that a number of people can better understand what the term means , and start using it the right way , because I happen to feel spiritual ( platonic ) love myself , and people kinda get confused when I tell them about it , because they misunderstand the term .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,greece,"Greece 's downward spiral and why austerity does n't work , in a few simple sentences : Greece 's problem in 2009 was that government income was more than the expenses . A reasonable action that could have been taken would be to reduce the salaries of public sector workers , and close or privitaze the problematic sections . The IMF 's , EU 's and ECB 's solution to the problem was to raise taxes to astronomical levels . An action that cause a chain reaction that worsens a country's economy instead of improving it , because : As taxes go higher , everything becomes more expensive . And as products and services become more expensive , the demand for them falls down , causing an economic recession . Reduced demand means people spend less , and businesses make less money . As businesses make less money , they shrink and fire people . As people are losing their jobs , the jobless stop spending and paying taxes and maybe loans . Because you ca n't take 1 from 0 . That leads to an even further fall in demand , a reduction on government income , and bank insolvency . Because of the reduction of government income and local bank insolvency , the Greek state once more asks the Troika for help . Then the Troika once more demands in exchange for a newer loan even higher taxes , that are going to repeat the vicious circle and make things even worse , once more . This circle has be recylcing for the past 7 years , in which Greece 's GDP has fallen 69 % , unemployment was raised from 9.1 % to 26.2 % , the debt to GDP ratio was raised from 126.7 % to 176.9 % , and Greece has been loaned over 500 billion euros , to life support its local banks .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Hello . This question is directed to both Jews and Christians . I 'm a native Greek speaker and read in the original Old Testament written for Ptolemy , the Septuagint , a part ( actually many parts ) that are hard to understand . In Psalms 82.1 to 82.7 , the text literally writes : And God standed in middle of the Council of Gods to judge them . Until when you will unfairly judge , and accept faces of sinners ? You judged the orphan and the poor , you vindicated the humble and the hungry . You freed the poor and the hungry from the hand of the sinner . They did not knew neither they understood , marching in darkness , all of the foundations of earth rumble . I said you are all Gods , sons of the Most High . But you are going to die as if you were humans , and you will drop like the Archons . I have some questions : How can God take part in a council of Gods , since he is the only God ? Since these other Gods who are not God are punished by God with mortality , to die like humans , what were the so important crimes they did to lose their immortality ? Does that mean that in the beggining there was n't one God , but many Gods , and the other Gods lost their godhood and died because the God punished them ?",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,dating_advice,"Hello everybody . I desperately need dating advice . During my childhood and teen years I 've been kind of an introvert , a very shy guy . I would n't talk to girls I had crush on , in fear of rejection , or getting ridiculed , etc . So I do n't have enough dating or relationships experience . The only relationships I had , were with girls that they did the first step and hit on me . I tried to have relationships with two of them , although I was n't really interested in them . Just because I was alone and I had nothing better to do . And both ended very quickly , and I did n't had the opportunity to have sex in them . To tell you the truth , my biggest enemy was low self esteem . But now I am a grown up , yay ! ! ! ( or booo ! ) First of all let me tell you that unfortunately I do n't have social connections . : ( I always used to have few good pals that we would hang out daily . But as we grew up , they started taking their own ways . One moved to another country , one disappeared when he got in a relationship ... So I also have no friends now . The job I do is male dominated , there are no women there to meet . My hobbies are not such that would make it easy for me to meet new people . I like reading books , and playing games like board games , video games etc , also I like long serious philosophic debates . So I have this problem , and I ca n't meet women in real life . Then I 'd think the internet would be a way to find the special someone for me , but nobody seems to take people on the internet seriously . I have taken the decision to fight against my fear , but things are very hard for me . Nowdays I try to talk to a woman I like , but it seems I ca n't find the right way to communicate my interest . How do I even hit on a woman I got to know through Facebook ? I think I am very bad in this stuff . How to approach one without she thinking that Im trolling or that I am a pathetic pervert ? How should I hit on a woman with being offensive or boring ? I 'm a pure soul and I feel desperate . Depressed even . It feels like I carry some kind of curse to not ever find love . I 've tried a lot of things . I used to be fat , and back then I thought that women did n't liked me because of my weight . I 've done exercize and changed my eating habbits , and I lost all the excessive weight to be considered 'normal ' . I achieved nothing . I changed my style , I started making respectful copliments all the time , none of these helped me at all . I am 29 now and I feel like I have exhausted all options , and still I 'm alone in my loneliness , doubting about myself in sorrow . Please HELP ME",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,lgbt,"Hello . In all of my life I thought myself as being a heterosexual . I am a man . But lately I have doubts . The thing is that while I like women visually and I find them sexy , the way most women treat sex , me , etc is offputting . I do n't like how they over-complicate simple things , this hypocrisy straight women have , etc . I 've been watching gay porn too for some time now . And I know that if I wanted to do something with a man , I 'd find not one but many . So I 've been thinking about it lately . Now look , I feel something different when it comes to men . And that is that I ca n't get visually interested in them , I mean I wo n't say `` this is a nice looking man , I wan na have sex with him '' and I do n't feel 'love ' for men . But I started to think that some men worth my attention and sex , more than women . That instead of getting all depressed and anxious on trying to get Ms Super-Spoiled-Princess , it would be far more rewarding and easy , and less of a waste of my time , to get along with a man . I 'm confused . I get horny and visually interested in women , but the way they behave is offputting , while for men I might not like anybody visually , but the way they behave with simplicity and truthfullness , makes them feel that they worth my time and body .

It was something that had a weird kind of corona unlike any other I 've seen , one could see shapes in it . Its corona was HUGE in the beggining , but after some time it started becoming smaller until it vanished for like 10 or 15 seconds , and then it started growing big again but at a slower pace . It remained big for about 5 minutes , and then it started to shrink again , and the end the object completely vanished from the sky .

Alithinos,gamedev,"Hello . I 've been working alone at an RPG and it 's my first game . It 's about 30 days of coding at this point , and I am at the stage of building a 'prototype ' . Basically I want to try all of my gameplay mechanics / ideas first , and then build quests , dungeons , art around it . So the day before I programmed a bow and an arrow , and after testing their basic functionality , I had to integrate them with the rest of the systems that are already in place . I found out that it was harder than I expected . First of all I made a mistake early on when I was making the first weapon ( a sword ) , combining code that should be in a general class 'weapon ' , with specific code for melee weapons like swords . Not a big deal , I thought . I will just make a new class and take the appropriate variables and functions from one class and put them to the other . But it was n't just that . Because the whole inventory system and considerable parts of the GUI system that were both built about a month ago , had to be changed , because at the time I designed and implemented them I had n't figured out the architecture around different kinds of weapons . So I had to rework the inventory and GUI systems , and oh gosh , bugs , bugs everywhere ! Of course it 's my fault that it took me that long , as everyone says I should be writing thorough documentation , but I 've been like `` nah , who has time to write boring pages on a word processor , I 'd better write more code '' . But some times that is n't the way to go . So it 's morning and the Sun has risen in the place of the world I am , just finished eating something sweet , and still drinking my coffee . I 'll probably drop asleep soon , but boy , what an experience ! I just had to fix this to get over with it ! I 'm of the guys that never want to close the engine / IDE if the project does n't compile . I just wanted to share this experience , and I know the only people that will even understand it are fellow devs , so I shared it here . : )",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,learnprogramming,"Hello . I 've been teaching myself programming for some months now . By buying and reading books , writing the examples from the books on Visual Studio , doing exercises , watching tutorials on Youtube sometimes , reading at MSDN ... Up until now I 've covered basic programming stuff like the use of variables / constants , booleans , loops , and how to create / initiate / read / arrays and structs ... I 've now came to the point of algorithms , and early in the beggining the book writes about the Big O . So here is what I get : Depending on the design of the algorithms , between two or more algorithms that solve the same problem , one may be more efficient than the other . We can count that by expressing the complexity of an algorithm , and that is done in a matter of an algebraic function . So I count the amount of proccesses done in an algorithm , and I name this total 'n ' , right ? And then , the 'goal ' is to find how many process will be done depending on the amount of data , right ? So if let 's say an algorithm has 3 processes for each data element , and the amount of data that needs to be processed is 5 , that means that there will be 15 processes done , and that n = 15 , right ? So if then I double the amount of data , and the algorith still has to do 3 processes to each element , that means that the total of processes for 10 elements will be 30 , which will also mean that the Big O will be linear , i.e . O ( n ) , right ? But then , it seems that the only way for Big O to be more than O ( n ) is in the case of nested loops . If that 's the case , then is the 'Big O ' just an overglorified way to say `` be super careful when you place a loop inside another loop '' ? I have the feeling that its something deeper , and I 'm unsure . Please enlighten me , or suggest me to some resource that will simplify the concept enough , so I can understand it better . P.S.1 . I 've read about the other possible Big O values like O ( log n ) but still have n't progressed enough to know how to make binary search trees or how they work . P.S.2 . Up until now , that on in particular seems to be the hardest of what I 've come to learn .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,ConversionStories,"I 've been told that Christ is our savior , and that Orthodox Christiniaty is the one and true way to be and to live the way God wants , and I was catechised by the `` Religious Matters '' classes on Public shool , that my country 'Greece ' forces to all children attending the forced and public education system . I 've grown up being told in school of how Saint George killed the fire-breathing Dragon , and how Jesus died to save us from Adam 's and Eve 's sin , etc , etc . Though many times I could n't realise or take seriously some things of what I 've been told , because I had questions that my teachers could n't give good enough answers about . For example , if it was Adam and Eve who did the sin , then why are we , the rest humans punished ? How can God punish others for the crimes of the others , if he is just ? And about Saint George , how did he killed a dragon since in the other class our teacher said that `` There are no dragons , neither there were ever dragons '' ? I had many questions that they could n't answer me . Yet I believed in Jesus . I believed that he existed , that he had more powers than us , and that he would save us , and I even believed the stories told , that if we truly believed on Him , we would be able to do miracles like Him , or the apostles . So I lived my life doing things that I 've been told Jesus wanted from me . I did n't lied , I did n't steal , I respected my mother and father , I prayed daily , I fasted , I collected the 'Holy Flame ' that is said to appear out of nowhere in the tomb of Jesus in Jerusalem as God 's proof that he exists , etc etc . And I 've been told that if I truly believed and was a good person and asked things from God - Jesus , that I would be given . And I 've been told that God loves all of his children , and talks to the people he loves , and appears to the people who believe . So at one point , at my teenage years I was on a crisis . I was doing everything to be the way Jesus wanted me to be , I prayed for him , I plead him , but he never showed up . He never told me a thing , neither on reality or my dreams . He just did n't . Neither when I asked him something he did it , even though I offered anything in return and I was ready to sacrifice anything to show him how much I wanted what I was praying for . At some point I thought that perhaps there was something that I was doing wrong , and I started being interested in learning more about Christianity . So I picked up the bible and started reading . And I realised that it conflicted itself in many occasions . The New Testament conflicted with the Old Testament , and individual books of the N.T . conflicted with each other . I 've told about it , and I was said that `` only people who have the Holy Spirit can understand the Bible , you ca n't because you do n't have the Holy Spirit '' . So I was the fool guy . But then again , there where other things that I could n't understand . In John 's Apocalypse , John says that at some point the Abyss will open , and the King of those who live there will ascend to conquer Earth . The Abyss ? This is n't a thing the Old Testament writes about , the Abyss is something from Hesiod 's Theogony , and according to the ancient Greek religion its a place inside Earth ( the Underworld ) where Zeus closed the Titans along with their leader , Kronos ! ! ! What is the word 'Abyss ' doing in the Christian bible ? It ca n't be 'satan ' , because as we all know satan is an Angel , and Angels are bodyless spiritual beings , so an Angel ca n't really be 'prisoned in the center of the Earth ' . As if my initial confusing that I got by reading the Bible was n't enough , then came to my attention another book , written by a local author , on how the Spetugiant was mistranslated from Hebrew to Greek . That of course means that since the other versions of the Bible where based on the Greek version , they are too carry the mistranslation . In the Hebrew text there are words such as 'YHWH ' , Elohim , El Sentai , etc that are all mistranslated in the Septugiant and other bible versions . The word 'Elohim ' alone in some places it is translated as 'God ' in others 'False Gods ' , in others 'Angels ' , in others 'Servants of the LORD ' , etc ... The meaning of the Old Testament completely changes if in all these different verses you just read the same word , as it is in Hebrew . Another thing that was mistranslated was the Hebrew 'Gehenna ' . In the Old Testament its called 'Hell ' . But what was really Gehenna ? It a nameplace of an actual place in Earth , in Judaea , where the Gentiles where burning their bodies . Thus where the text of the mistranslated bible says `` The infidels will burn on Hell '' , the Hebrew text says `` The infidels will burn in Gehenna '' , meaning that their bodies will be taken outside the Jewish city where burning bodies is not allowed , to a seperate place IN JUDAEA where non-Jewish where allowed to burn their dead ! So much for 'Hell ' . But if 'Gehenna ' is not the Abyss , then what is the Abyss that John talks of ? Next , lets speak about another subjet . About the 'antichrist ' . Is n't it not obvious who was the Antichrist ? John in his Epistle states `` The body of what has commonly come to be called 'the antichrist ' is already alive in our times '' . Because I 'm Greek and antichrist is a Greek word , let me tell you a thing about it . 'Anti ' does n't necessarily translates as 'against ' , but it can also be translated as 'instead ' . If you take the second meaning of the word , then the `` antichrist '' is one that acts instead of the Christ , meaning it shows as being Christ , but is not the Christ , the same way a Vice President acts as the president when he is not , when the president is n't on his duty . That was from the Epistle . If we look at the Apocalypse itself , then John clearly states that there are two 'beasts ' , and what most people call 'the antichrist ' is a 'beast ' that has 7 heads , and specifically John says later that each head is a CHURCH , going on to such detail as to name each CHURCH with its own name . .It is pretty obvious that John means that there is already a COUNTRY ( body of the beast ) in his times , that in his future will have 7 CHURCHES ( the heads of the beast ) , and will present itself as `` Vice Christ '' or `` Ambassadors of Christ while he is missing '' . Oh dear readers , is n't it obvious who is that famous `` antichrist '' ? The `` Holy Roman Empires '' . The two beasts John talks about , are the two Roman Empires , from East and West . Each proclaimed that they where the 'Ambassadors of Christ on Earth ' , and each declared their leaders as 'Picked and blessed by Jesus , carrying the Holy Spirit , and thus transferring the Will of Jesus to Earth ' . And they each did crimes and sins according to what Jesus said . Crusades , Inquisition , slaughtering of Pagans , Jihad like religious wars against others , etc..Yet even though John says that the Churches themselves are the heads of the Beast , the churches keep singing their own song , and telling believers that the Antichrist is yet to come . But what is the CHURCH as we know it today , and how did it came up ? Jesus said that God loves all of his children the same , and will listen to all of them , and he took believers out on the field and teld them how to pray . According to Jesus , each human can speak to God and God will listen . Another thing Jesus said when he visited the Temple of Solomon , was that the Temple should be ... destroyed , because thinking that God could live inside a Temple is belittling God . Yet the Church has been preaching in the past that priests are 'above the common folk ' , and that the common folk needs priests , because they are the 'holy ones ' . They also ... BUILD TEMPLES ! ! ! ! Have n't anybody wandered why those who claim to be the wise in the religious matters and closer to God than us the common folk , act against Jesus 's teachings , contradicting themselves ? Well its because the Church the way it , is was formed by Constantine , a Roman Emperor . How and why a politician decides what the form of a religion should be ? He took some poor apostles and gave them jobs , and he designed what we call 'Church ' , to be a public service and part of the state / public sector of Rome , answering and ran by the emperors of Rome . Constantine took some simple believing folks , made them 'priests ' , and started giving them tons of money , and in return the priests called him a `` Saint '' . And since then they started preaching that the Roman Empire is Divinely lead by Emperors who are picked up by God and are given the Holy Spirit , and thus the Church became a public service of a state , that would support the political actions of the government with theological claims . For the shake of not having people presenting differing views to the `` divinely lead emperors '' , they also called all other religions 'satanic ' and banned them , and started killing non-christians with ridiculous accusations of witchcraft , etc . Christianity was distorted , corrupted , and deviated to become the propaganda tool of a government . All of the above where enough for me to grow a dislike against the Christian Churches , and to stop calling myself a 'Christian ' . But what made me embrace the theology of Plato and other Neoplatonists you ask ? Well get ready for more text . At some point while I was a teenager I had a vision . When I had it , I did n't understood that my experience was a 'vision ' , I thought it was a quite realistic , very weird dream . I saw many things happening in that single dream , along with myself dying , my soul ( which was like fiery energy ) , and going to a big fiery light , and uniting with it . When I united with it I came back to my senses or 'woke up ' , and my heart was beating too powerfully . I was scared in shock and awe.The next day the images that I saw where in my mind . I only understood a few things , most of it was just confusing , I could n't relate everything that I saw with something I knew . It was just awkward and weird.It took me some days to get used to normal life again , and to start living as a normal person . And I said to myself : `` It was just a weird dream '' . At that time I still believed in Jesus . Time passed , about 3 years , and the memories of that 'dream ' where still very colorful and alive , unlike most other dreams that are forgotten in seconds , minutes , or hours after you wake up . And I started having an urge , an idea was stuck to my mind , that perhaps the 'dream ' that I saw was n't just a 'dream ' , but a 'beafitic vision ' , that there was more to that than just a dream . So I decided to learn a few things about the most popular religions there where . The first thing I did , as I was a Christian at that time , was to read the Bible . And unfortunately it did n't said anything related . I read a few things about Islam , nothing . Buddism kind of was somewhat close , but was n't enough . Then I decided to take a look on the ancient Greek religion , Hellenism as is often called . So I read a few things , and I read ridiculous statements , such as that Zeus and the rest Gods are beings with material bodies living in some hidden underground base in Olympus and have spaceships and travel in Space.. LOL . Others claimed that the Olympians where born from the Earth and Sky , and that after humans die go to either the Underwolrd or the Blessed 's Islands , not even saying a word about Soul . I was underwhelmed . I gave up . I thought `` It was n't a vision , just a dream '' once more . Even more years passed since then . In the mean time I did the research on the Bible that I told before , in how and why I started seeing the Church with a different eye , and realizing the conflicts of the Bible , its mistranslations and thus misunderstandings , etc . Now , one of my hobbies since I remember myself was reading books . Many books . Fantasy stories , about Space , about History , about Science ... At some point I took an unusual decision , to start reading books of ancient Greek philosophers . I thought `` I 've read so many different books , but I never read something these guys who are often called wise by people wrote . Time to see why the world thinks they where so important , what they wrote , what they said '' . So at my hands came Neoplatonic books . And while reading , I had a realization that made me feel very strong feelings : I was reading in ancient text written thousands of years ago , an extremely ( almost scientific ) detailed analysis , on the things I had seen in my 'dream ' . Imagine how I felt . How would anybody felt , if he had an unexplainable experience , and at some point , almost 10 years later he discovered a book that would explain him his own experience , which up until that point he thought was unique to him , and a product of his imagination . I was shocked again . The book explained all the things I saw in my dream , that back then when I was a teen I had no idea about . The fiery body that I saw coming out of me in my dream fits perfectly the description by platonists / neoplatonists of what the soul is , with the spiritual fiery substance I saw being Aether . What I saw as a sphere of light that I got united with was the aspect of the One that is called 'The World 's Soul ' by neoplatonists , and the action of me uniting with it is called `` Henosis '' . Everything that I saw in my 'dream ' was explained in detail . Thus I 'm personally convinced now that this was a beafitic vision . Please note that I 'm a very humble and 'down to earth ' person , and that had I knew about what neoplatonism say before seeing this 'vision ' , I would n't believe that it was a vision , but I would believe that it was just a dream . But the fact that I first saw the dream / vision , and I did n't understood it , and that years later I discovered others obviously had seen about it too , and wrote about it , and claimed that this was the truth and indeed that what I had was a beafitic vision , I got convinced that it was indeed a beafitic vision . Because if it is n't , then how could someone explain that ? How is it possible for so many different people on the world to see the exact same things on a 'dream ' , and without knowing each other , or ever hearing or knowing in another way that others saw it too ? How is it possible for a man in 500BC , another in 300AD , and another in 2003AD , to see the exact same `` dream '' ? Especially if the man of 2003AD , had never before heard or read about this experience from these earlier men , thus the chance of him seeing in his dreams things he have read or heard about is out of the question ? After I realized that Plotinus was describing in his 'Henneads ' my vision , and that there is a whole theology system that the vision is based on , and that all this 'religious wave ' started with Plato , I got the urge of wanting to learn more , so I bought some books by Plato . Well much to my surprize , I 've been learning even more things , I 'm surprized even more , more questions I had about cosmology and theology are answered , and the world makes more sense to me now . It 's as if the more I read , the more I understand how Existence is and how it works , and that makes me feel nice . In the book `` Timaeus '' of Plato , it is written that the matter of the Universe was in the beggining consisting of a whole , and was split to pieces , and that these pieces became the stars , planets , comets and other objects of our Universe , which is exactly what the modern scientific Big Bang theory also says , that in the beggining the matter of the universe consisted of a single whole piece , and that an explosion happened ( Big Bang ) that split it to pieces , which became stars , planets , etc ... So , how could I turn my back to Neo-Platonism ? To the one theology that included the Big Bang in its 'creation story ' , and that fully explains what I experienced in my 'dream ' or 'vision ' ? I am thus now a Platonist - Neoplatonist .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"It generally considered 'justice ' that if one does some kind of a crime , then the very person who did the crime , is the one that should be brought to justice , and be punished accordingly to whatever are the laws in power . We do not blame or punish some , for the crimes of others . If you have a car , and someone steals it , then police should find the one who stole your car , and the thief should be the one punished , and not someone else who is not related to the incident and did not did the crime himself . Even if though the police finds one who is related to the thief , for example his wife or child , then it wo n't be neither the wife or the child punished , because different people have each their own unique intellectual , and thus personallity and character , and blaming someone for the doings of other is unjust . Thus , how is it considered just for God to keep his punishment against us , modern people of today , for things done by Adam and Eve ? Perhaps Adam and Eve where related with us , and are our ancestors , but we today never met these ancestors , and perhaps we neither accept or endorse what they did , and us our very own selves did n't did the crime , yet we are punished with mortality , diseases etc . Why is that happening , and how can we say that this is justice ? Some Christians say that Jesus sacrificed himself to take the punishment from humans , but in case I 'm not missing something , people are still getting old and ill and die , which means that the punishment Adam and Eve recieved , still lasts to the modern day and people of today .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,religion,"I 've been wondering about something . There are many different 'religions ' who confess that the universe was created by one entity , ( let 's call God ) and that this entity is good , and that be respect and worship we will help ourselves . Thus if there is only One God , and we worship One God , and this God is the one who created the Universe and all the other beings , that means that every of these religions have a piece ( maybe bigger or smaller ) of truth in them . So we all have a few things in common : A ' That the Universe was created by THE one God . B ' That the God who created us is Good . C ' That we want to worship the God , and be good . D ' That there had been persons in the material word we are living , who got a revealation or more from God . So , considering these commons , we realise that what really differs between different religions of the one God , are A ' The ways and customs that involve physical work to worship God . ( e.g . The Jew has to circumsize , the Christian to get baptized , the Muslim to visit Mecca ) B ' The explanations given about certain aspects that are to make us understand better these concepts or aspects . Here is what I think : God indeed revealed things to different people , of different nations . The reasons why there are differencies in explanations and practices is because the people who recieved the revealations were n't necesserily educated or did n't had perfect understanding of what they were recieving , ( they where after all human beings ) and they tried to explain and interpret what they saw the best way they could , based on their own pre-existing knowledge , education , traditions and customs . Thus the revealations of the visions of the people who had them , were interpretted by each one , based on the culture they already had , their education , and their actual understanding . That means that each religious wave that became , did n't necesserily happened because of 'impostors ' or 'decieved by the devil ' people , but because each of the people who got a vision , had a pre-established culture and background and education , and thus interpretted things differently . Thus it is no wise to say that 'the others ' are fooled and one of them is 100 % right , as this would be nationalism . Instead I think , it would be better for someone if he studied and learnt about what all the people who claimed they recieved revealations said , and try to find which details stem out of national and cultural backgrounds , and how these influenced the messages of these people . To make a research to discover the 'clear ' picture of what these people saw , and to remove the social and cultural influences . But then , do n't we see that the God is One , and Good , and loves us , and that even if some others are worshipping God with different customs and ways , their ways are because of their individual culture , and the essence of things is that all worship the One God , which is the same God , because there is One God and not many ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,Neoplatonism,"Hi there . I 've had a 'vision ' once , of myself dying and uniting with the One . When this happened several years ago , I did n't realised it was a vision , neither I knew that this 'light ' was documented and known as the 'One ' . About 10 years after I recieved this vision though , in what seemed to by random potentiality I got to learn about a very basic description about the One and the Union with it , which made me realise that what what I 've seen personally was seen by others some thousands of years ago , and they documented it well . I 'm now in a phase where I want to learn more , and I was wondering where should I start reading from , to get a better and fuller understanding ? Should I start by Proclus 's book on Platonic theology , on Plotinus 's Enneads , Plutarch maybe , or go directly to Plato and read Plato ? I 've already read a few books of Plato , Timaeus , Critias , Gorgias , Parmenides , Cratylus , and Phaidrus . Should I continue with Plato , and which are the most important works of him that I should read next ? Or should I go to Plotinus or Proclus ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hello , I was wondering , do I have to use a dedicated altar for sacrifices ? And is there a purification ritual of shorts ? What I tried to this point was placing stuff in different places , most of them public , but at times or places where there are n't many passerbys to avoid awkwardness . So what I did was to find a surface , place things ( like biscuits ) , and then chant the corresponding Orphic hymn . After that I asked something and then I dropped some water in a libation . I did that twice . The first time I went to a rock that is part of the nearby ruins of the temple of Demetra Agrotera ( I live in Athens , Greece so there are many temples visitable , or at least their ruins ) and I invoked Demetra by reading out loud the Orphic hymn to Demetra , at the day that was her festival according to the Attic calendar . At that time , I felt like some images came to my mind and as out of nowhere some thoughts came to me . I still wait for them to see if they are validated or it was just my imagination . The second time I went to a nearby park , and place the offering to a bench , and I invoked Zeus . I did n't felt anything though . I was wondering why that was . One idea is that perhaps it had to do with the place . Maybe the ruins of the once temple , still have some 'energy ' and are 'active ' in some way . ( ? ) Another thing : Is it considered bad if I 'm doing it while sitting ? And lastly , do you use written hymns and prairs from ancient sources , or do you improvise ? I thought it would be good to read from the ancient text , but while a modern-Greek speaking can recognize the letters and know how each one sounds , ancient text is hard to pronounce right and I miss the meaning of some ancient words . I also forgot ( missed ) to use the appropriate incense that Orpheus directs . ( Orpheus directs that while reading and invoking a certain God or Goddess , you should burn the appropriate incense for that God or Goddess ) Is that really bad ? Please help me . I want to do things right , but I 'm not sure what is 'right ' .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Once upon a time , during prayer I had the feeling that God talked to me . At that experience he told me that he had a mission for me should I wanted to follow him and do his will , and he also gave me a name , and he told me to not tell anybody what my true name is . This name though is n't a name I am familiar . It is a Jewish name , that might mean something that I do n't know , because I 'm not Jewish myself and I do n't speak Hebrew , yet I recognized the name is Jewish by the way it sounds . My question is this : According to Christian and / or Jewish theology , is it possible for something like that to happen ? Has something like that happened to other people before , and is thus my experience validated as a truly special experience indeed ? If experiences like this are recorded and explained , please tell me what the fact that I had such an experience means ? Why is God giving names to people , and what is the meaning of this ? And why is God not giving people names that are explainable in their own native language but in Hebrew ? I would really like to know what the name I was given means , but as you understand , I ca n't say it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"1 . The Latin name Jesus which comes from Greek 'IESOUS ' is a compound word from Doric IE which means 'cure ' and SOU which means 'your ' . S is added on the end of Greek names to add masculinity , as male Greek names and with consontants and the female names with vowels . Thus IESOUS means `` Your cure '' . 2 . Jews rejected Jesus.Because Jesus did n't fit the description of the Messiah according to Judaism . Thus they do not see connection of their religion to him . Jesus preached things that oppose Jewish religion . 3 . How is it possible that a God that is ompipotent and knows everything from always , and is wise and always right , made a 'mistake ' and gave a Testament that he then found wrong , making him change his mind ? Is n't it contradictory , and would n't it be blasphemous to say that God makes mistakes and changes his mind and word like that ? 4 . Why is Prophet John in Revealations using 'Pagan ' terms such as the Bottomless Pit ( Abyss ) , and he describes Typhon / Seth from the Egyptian and Greek ancient religions , as being the 'Beast from the land ' ? The oldest use of the word 'Abyss ' is found on Hesiod 's Theogony , and it said to be a place beneath Earth , where Uranus placed the Cyclops and One-Hundred-Handers , and later on Zeus jailed Typhon the Destroyer , Father of all Monsters , and king of the Giants there , and sealed the Abyss with a copper seal . John says that at some point the seal of the Abyss will be removed , and the king who is there with his army , will reign Earth . And he calls that beast 'Apollyon ' or 'Abaddon ' which both translate to 'Destroyer ' , which is an epithet of Typhon / Seth . Why would Prophet John write about 'Pagan ' or 'Mythological ' creatures , if the 'Pagan ' and 'Mythology ' stories are all lies ? P.S . Do n't see this as an attack , but rather a call for concern and research .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"This is a literal translation of the modern Hellenic poem 'Εγώ ο Ηνίοχος ' , ( I the Charioter ) written by Radamanthys Anastasakis . Note that the word 'Charioter ' is used by Plato to personify one of the three parts of the Soul . `` Kept deep in its embrace this soil held me immortal Until Intellect and hands of mortal loved ones , picked me up to the light . Brightful day . I breathe , I listen , I wonder . Woe , everything is lost . Altars , hearths , Name . And as I only held reins on my hand , they called me Charioter . I the Charioter , victor on the stadiums of the noble Struggles , birthed by the more than perfect marriage of this virgin land , Hellas , with the more than perfect Intellect , call it Aether or Reasoning . I the Charioter stay forever contemplative , and godful worshiper of my birth givers . I fought tirelessly , and I fight until the redemption of every Soul of Love and every land of worthy , and beautiful humans , mortals , who will live free , breathing Justice , Beuaty , Love . Oh benevolant , universal , Hellenic Soul ! Incorruptible seed of high reasoning , noble passions , unsleeping contemplates , for the nice , the true , the good . I stand on the immortal soil of Hellas , indestructible , in the passage of aeons . I the Charioter , that had been ravaged for so many aeons , now smoothly rise , to find myself leaning to your Soul , which leans to me . Leaning the same way , we both reached inwards . Eeeh ! I want you to live eternally ! Feeding forever all of your senses with essences that spring from the Divine . I see Apollo being my guard , blessing this will of mine that I have for you . I the Charioter , I know , Yes I am telling you , I know and believe it deeply . The Gods and their sacreds are alive ! Fire still burns . The sacred water of the Oracle still lights up . And the laurel steams to the deeps of my Soul , your Soul , and of all the true Hellenists , that moved by the forever flowing waters of the bay of the Phaedriads , return godful to the eternal past , to live the same way eternally the present , and thrice eternally the veil of Life . Do n't be afraid chosen Soul , do n't be afraid of pain , suck pleasurably the essence of Love , and your taste , as also the whole gigantic sphere of your existence will be flooded by the transcendent seed of joy , which is hidden deeply in pain.Do n't be afraid undestructible Soul . Learn yourself and you will feel each day a bit , each day more , each day even abundantly riches of colors , thrill vibrations , each day excessive ecstasis to get inside the vastness of your depths , the magic of the perfect pleasures of Love to the Greek Gods , Heroes , philosophers , and our unique ancestors . Just reward of noble struggles . I the Charioter , submerging onto you the look of my unsleeping eyes , see the glows of your Soul , I follow the steps of your contemplation , the curves of your feelings , as you begun as then -Do you remember ? - to shower at the Holy waters of the Castalia spring . I am happy for your cleansing . I rejoice for your consecration . I the Charioter , am happy as your Soul devotionally caresses me . Apollo , how much I 'm happy for the blinking of its eyes , just reward to old struggles . Thank you ! From Apollo 's heart to the Sun of your Heart .

Alithinos,Neoplatonism,"So according to Plato and neo-platonists , there is a 'God ' that is superior than the lesser 'gods ' of the older religion . And this one , the Creator of the Universe , is the one Plato in Timeaus names 'Creator ' , which was later called simply 'Nous / Mind ' . I was thinking in general how many of the concepts of Plato fit and are similar to the older Orphic believes . Reincarnation , Souls etc . When it comes to the Creator , the most similar deity that fits the description of Platonism 's Creator , seems to be the one that Orpheus calls Eros , meaning Love . Orpheus says that the first ever and most powerful 'God ' , that existed even before the birth of the universe , was Eros / Love . And if we think about his name , and what it means , it kind of makes sense I think : Love is indeed a creator , it 's love that leads us to create life . And indeed Love is benevolant , and omnipresent . I have been studying these ancient subjects , but only recently I connected the two different creation theories and theologies to discover these similarities between Eros and the Demiurge . Could the Demiurge , be Love itself ? ! Personified as Eros ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,Judaism,"Hello . Personally I was raised a Christian , so please understand that I do n't know a lot about Judaism , and one of them has to do with Lilith . I am an open minded person , and I seek to understand the nature of things and truths , because I 'm not dogmatic , but a searcher of truth . I was reading about Lilith a bit earlier , and how she was the first bride of Adam . And the descriptions of her that I read where saying that she is 'authoritative , misleading , sexy , evil , coming at night , hates the children of Adam and Eve ' . I also saw some pictures some people painted having her in mind , and some of them , those that depict her with dark grey skin , reminded me of something . Please give me some of your 'insider ' knowledge about her . Because something have happened that made me curious . Some pictures of Lilith I saw , and her general description reminded me of a dream I had many years ago . In this dream I was standing before the entrance of a building of unusual architecture , that it was at some desert , and behind my back I felt a strong presence . I turned to see who it was , and it was a naked woman with dark grey skin , that I understood she had some kind of authority or power , and that she had a bad intention . She was also beautiful and some aura that made her desirable . I tried to not make it obvious that I understood her evil nature and goal , and thus without showing any feeling I greated her , as if I did n't knew that she was evil . She then told me that I should leave the building and not enter at it , but that I should follow her , because she had to do something important to me , that it would be better for me . I felt a great desire and urge to do as she said and follow her , but something kept me . I fooled her and told her that I would follow her , and that she should lead the way . As she turned her back on me to lead the way , I came close to her from behind , grabbed her hands and touched my body to her , so I could hold her , and then told her 'So , who is the boss ? ' thinking that I outsmarted her , and I 'won ' . When I did that I felt a bigger sexual desire by the touching of her body.I also felt her surprize , but she got happier , she smiled as if she enjoyed that . She then told me that she underestimated me , and that I was n't fit for the role she had for me , which would be the same fate as many other men , as if I would be wasted with the initial role she had for me.She also told me that I earned a new 'higher ' role with what I done , that she now had a new plan for me . Then the dream was over . Please tell me if that story from my dream means anything to you , and if my suspicion that this woman of my dream was Lilith might be right . But then what could be the 'role ' she initially had for me , and what made her happy to revise her plan and 'reward ' me with a 'higher ' role , and finally what could be this building in the desert that she did n't wanted me to enter ?",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"If we take the names of the letters of the Greek alphabet ( Alpha , Beta.. ) and we split them to syllables according to the rules of Greek language , e.g . ( Al - Pha - Be - Ta ) it becomes obvious that each syllable has itself a meaning , being a root of the Doric dialect . With all the Doric words in line , if we read them , they do make sense , and they form a poem ! A poem that shouts Gods like Helios ( Sun ) , Mene / Selene ( Moon ) and Cronus . Yet its kind of mysterious and do n't know how to interpret it , what 's its deeper meaning . Here is my personal , rough and literal translation : '' Sun 's Light ( gives ) Life to Earth Mother , its force approaches and is thin , we live and wonder the Dawn , and the Father 's teaching . The Moon emits flakes , Oh Moon , Cronus 's thin particles of fire , stably approach , bringing and enstregnthening the Fall Oh , Great ! '' The fact that this poem was hidden all along in the alphabet is exciting , yet it births questions in me and rises my curiosity . Who is the 'Father ' ? Uranus ? Cronus ? Zeus ? What kind of flakes could the Moon emit ? What are Cronus 's particles of fire , and what is the 'fall ' ? In the end , does it says 'O Great ' as we say today 'oh great ! ' or does it refer to someone certain who is 'Great ' , like for example we read on some texts 'O , Someone ... ' ? I 'm out of ideas . My imagination tells me that perhaps at some point something like a metorite could have hit the moon , and debris might have fallen to Earth , and that someone decided to write a poem about it .

Unfortunately it 's too late for me to go for a university or something , so I will try to do it by myself , from home . So by searching on Google and Youtube , I found many tutorials and refference boards to help someone learn a programming language . Here is the thing though : While everyone tells you how to do something ( e.g . declare a class ) with a language , they tell you very little if anything to understand what that something exactly is , and how it works . Even those who claim that they do tutorials for 'absolute begginers ' , speak ( or write ) in such a way , that leaves many questions , as if they think I know things that I do n't .

Alithinos,gamemaker,"Hello everyone ! I 'm new here , and with making games with gamemaker ! : ) I started making my first game , a version of the classic 'snakes and ladders ' game , with GameMaker . Unfortunately , something unexpected happened though ! I made the board of the game by placing alternating objects , that each have a sprite of a different color , in chessboard pattern . Let 's call these objects `` board pieces '' from now on.One type has yellow color , and the other a shade of purple . Both board pieces have a depth of 0 , while everything else ( like snakes and the player 's pawn ) is at -2 , and there is nothing under the board pieces , no background or other board pieces . Upon hitting 'play ' to test the game on the GameMaker player , I noticed that the board was flashing . I changed the speed of the game ( frame rate ) and the flashing speed is relevant to the game 's speed for some reason . There are 2 alternating states of flashing , which I screenshoted , to show you what 's happening here . http : //i.imgur.com/mLM82V0.png http : //i.imgur.com/Lp15pfi.jpg ? 1 The first image shows the board how it is supposed to look .

Boot time was reduced somewhat , ( I have Windows 8.1 and the loading circular graphic was having 5 turns before booting up with the old RAM , and now it boots with only 3 turns ) . I also used AMD Overdrive ( since I have a compatible processor , a FX 8320 ) , to benchmark the memories with the 'memory test ' of this program , and my new RAM scored 69 more points than the old .

Alithinos,learnprogramming,"Hello , I recently , ( a few months ago ) I decided to learn how to program . Alone . To become a self-tought programmer . And there are some things that I 'd like to share , some considerations , that I believe anoter newbie like me might find helpful as precaution measures . * First of all I 'd like to say that the most important hindrance for someone trying to learn programming by himself , can be the source from which he chooses to acquire his information . There are lots of programming books out there , for every single language . The problem is , that most of them seem to be directed to people who already are programmers and familiar with various concepts and jargon . I started by buying two books , one is a behemoth of 1000+ pages for the language I picked up , and the other a general 'how to program better ' book . I thought that these would teach me how to be a good programmer with that language , but upon starting reading them I discovered I was mistaken . Because the authors of the books in both cases assume that I already know stuff I do n't , and the programming language book in particular , is written in a ( human ) language that makes it harder to understand . Aside from the money I spent , this fact overwhelmed me , it made me feel stupid . After that I started reading carefully all the details I could find on the internet pages for could-buy books , and reviews , and even samples , to check if some book is written the way I 'd need it to be . In such a way , that it does n't assume you already know lots of stuff , but instead explains you everything , with an easy to read writing style etc . This is TOO IMPORTANT for someone who starts learning . One book from the other can have a big difference and a huge impact on your learning . I suggest to everyone who decides now to start learning , to do extensive market research on programming books before buying one or more , and always read samples of them if he can find , so he wo n't end up spending hundreds of $ on material not intended , and actually not helpful for him . * Once you start learning stuff , do n't stop practicing what you learnt . You might think of 'hey I will take a break for about a month or two to do some other stuff , and then I 'll return ' , but that 's not a good idea . Because that way you will forget some of the stuff you learnt , and you will have to re-read and re-learn it , and the info you will need to re-read and re-learn will be mixed with info you already remember , making it harder to keep your excitement high while reading . If you want to take a break from learning new stuff , OK. Do it . But do n't stop practicing what you already learnt . Keep making new exercizes and trying out different stuff with the things you already learnt , so you do n't forget them . * Do n't try to learn too many things in one day . You might think that reading more pages of that programming book you got in a day will help you learn more , but the more pages you read and the more info you receive each day , the easier and faster you forget the things you 'learn ' . So instead of reading 10-15 pages in a day , and trying each new thing you encounter in the book once or twice , try that : Read 5 pages a day , and try each new thing 10 or more times , hopefully in slight variations . That way , by practicing more each thing you learn , you will become more familiar with it , and it will also stay in your memory more . * Not studying in a university or some other kind of school , has its downsides . You ca n't ask a book or a youtube video tutorial some question , like you could ask a professor . But you can ask Google . And there is a high chance , that your question is already answered . So go ahead and search for it , and it would be better to do it before / instead of openning a new thread in reddit or some forum , as if your question has already been asked and answered , you wo n't have to wait for someone to reply to you specifically . I learnt the first three points I wrote down here by myself , the hard way . I hope by writting this here , I might help someone who wants to start learning and has n't started yet . And I consider that the first point is the most important . Picking the right book for you when you beggin learning can make a huge difference .",Greek,Greek

In that , one word in Greek can have multiple meanings , and it is n't always clear with which it is used , and at least the way I see it , it 's open to interpretation . But in international versions like the KJV and others , the words chosen some times represent only one of the meanings that the specific Greek word has . For example , the phrase `` In the begging was the Word '' , is such a case when it comes to the word 'Word ' . Because the Greek word translated is Λόγος ( transliterated Logos , pronounced Lowosh ) . And well , Λόγος can either be translated as 'speech ' or as 'reason ' the same way we could say in English `` that was a good reason for that '' , or it could even mean 'Intellect ' . After all , the word Logic stems from Logos , logic literally meaning `` the act of Logos '' . The Greek word for 'word ' is Λέξις ( Lexis ) with Lex- being the root , which is where we get the word 'Lexicon ' from . The first time I read this phrase in English I was rather surprized and thought `` Do they learn that in the beggining there was a word ? Like an actual word of spoken language ? '' and it troubled me . Because I always interpreted the word Logos of the Greek text to be used with the meaning 'Intellect ' , as in the Intelligence / Wisdom of God .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Regarding the ancient Greek religion , the earliest entities the ancient Greeks worshipped were the Sun , the Earth , and the Moon . The earliest pantheon ( Minoan ) consisted of female only deities , and later they added up the male gods .

Alithinos,DebateReligion,Because that 's were the people who wrote these religions lived .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I 'll write you about two religions that existed in ancient Greece . Although most people know about Hera and Zeus , the truth is that this particular , was just the most popular religion during the classic era ( 8th to 3rd centuries BC ) . In the time frame of what we call antiquity , a number of different beliefs existed in Greece . What Plato ( lived at 5th century BC ) describes as the most ancient religion coming from Greece included only 3 deities : Sun , Earth , Moon . The Earth was considered the mother of humans . They believed that the first men sprouted out of soil like plants do . The Sun was called father , because he nurtured humans with his heat . The moon ... was seen as a secondary deity . Another ancient Greek religion that I think has this factor of uniqueness you are looking for is Orphism . ( Orpheus is said on ancient sources to have lived between the 15th and 12th centuries BC , modern historians does n't believe he really existed ) This one says that in the beggining there was a goddess called Eurynome ( All-Laws ) who gave birth to an egg . Another entity called Ophis ( Snake ) is said to have fertilized the egg . Out of this egg the universe was born . The universe is a living organism , with its own soul . The humans consist of two natures : the divine good / and the titanic / evil . Their bodies were created by the ashes of burnt titans , but they were given a Soul from Heaven . They had the concept of reincarnation . They believed that human souls originated in Heaven , and that Souls would 'fall ' from Heaven if they would lose the purity that is required to remain in Heaven . When a new baby was born , it was a sign that yet another soul had lost the purity of Heaven , so the people cried . When somebody died they thought that this person would go to Heaven , which is way better than the material realm , and thus they celebrated . They were vegeterians because they believed that killing anything was a sin . They believed that through living an ascetic life , their souls would become pure again , so Heaven can hold them after they die . If their soul would not be pure , it would be sent at another body , and it would be reincarnated .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Oh I see . So the writers of the Greek version picked one of the meanings the Hebrew word could have , and used that . The word used in the Greek version has the same root as the word used for THE God , but in plural . ( Theos - Theoi ) .

Alithinos,DebateReligion,So what you say is that the writer calls false gods simply 'Gods ' ironically ?,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"You know what ? I am semi-Agnostic / semi-Abraham , and perhaps semi-Pagan . Let me explain what I mean : I know that the One God that Abrahamic religions tell about exist . But at the same time , many things are kind of confusing , like the use of this word you wrote about . There are also other words that cause confusion too , especially in Christians , who also have the 'New Testament ' . The problem is that some parts make more sense if we think something that would be called heretical . That aside from THE God , there were also some other beings , higher than humans but under God . But look what is going on : there is a Hebrew book written that supports this point of view , known as the Book of Enoch . But at least Christians , ca n't decide if it 's canon or not , officially the Christian church categorizes as 'Apocryphal ' . And I do n't know how Judaism 's positions on it . The thing is , that if the Book of Enoch has truth to it , and indeed there were these other 'Beings ' , a lot of things make sense . Not only this verse I wrote on the thread , but also others , like for example those about the Nephilim giants . Now add to all of that this : ( I know it will sound weird , but please do n't consider me a crazy person ) I have experimented with a pagan religion , and I once did an invocation to one of the gods of this religion . But instead of the pagan god , a demon came and tried to get inside me . My understanding of all of this is that perhaps those that some ancient people called 'gods ' were not 'gods ' , but the beings that are described in OT / Enoch to have been given the order to watch and rule over humans , and 'fell from Heaven ' because they got corrupted . But I ca n't be sure about this , and I still read and theorize about it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,But then why do n't modern Jews and Christians talk about it ? What could be the motive for them to not accept that ?,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Here is one thing : life is hard and full of unjustice . For many people , God and the afterlife is the only thing that gives them hope . If they did n't believed in God , they would have no reason to continue living their lives . We believe that there has to be a God , because we believe that at some time those that endured life or were mistreated should be rewarded for being good , or else all the suffering would be for nothing . If there was some way that all people of the world could be convinced 100 % that there is no God and afterlife , riots , civil wars , and international wars would start . Because those who have been mistreated so far would have nothing to lose , and would start fighting to get what they deserve in this world and life . There would be chaos and fights on the whole planet as the poor and the mistreated would fight for what they have been missing all that time . For some people the hope that God will at some point recognize their hardships and good behavior is the only hope they have for anything . If God does n't exist , then Earth is a living nightmare of torture in which we have to suffer for the lengths of our lives for no reason , without ever getting something back for being good and honest and just . It is easier for many people to believe that there is a God , and that the good people are rewarded after death , instead of believing and accepting that life is a torture and there is nothing after it . Ideas of suicide passed at times from mind , but what kept me from not killing myself was the idea that God exists and has a reason for each one of us existing , a mission for every one of us . So I am alive awaiting for my mission , what ever is going to be . If I was 100 % sure that God does n't exist , I would be dead now . Not because there would not be God , but because God is the last hope .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I was raised in an Orthodox environment , and I 'm going to write here the Orthodox point of view , which goes back to the middle ages when the Church was split to two .

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"1 ) The exact time I was doing the ritual nothing happened . I did it on public place , in a park . At night , when I was at home , I was suddenly paralyzed . I fell to the ground and could n't move myself . I felt an evil aura , and I felt as if something was inside me . I communicated with that mentally . ( Mind that I did n't `` heard voices '' . I know well that having the impression that there somebody actually speaking to you with an audible voice is a symptom of scizophrenia . I heard no voice . ) Instead it was as if there was another 'intellect ' inside me , and I could understand what it thought , and it could read my thoughts . It was as if this other intellect had took over my body and I could n't move it . My eyes were open and I could see around the room , there was no visual presence of anything . I thought `` Why did you came to me ? '' and it replied `` You called us '' , and then I remembered what I had done in midday . Then I thought `` But I did n't knew you were going to get inside of me '' , and I felt it becoming furious , and at that point as I was trying to move my hole body , I started being able to slightly move my neck and fingers , they were moving though in a pretty weird fashion as I was fighting to take back control over my body . I started praying the praier that Jesus made on the hill that goes `` Our Father who is in Heavens ... '' , and before I had finished it , I felt the thing getting off me , and I was then able to move my whole body again . 2 ) How I know it was a demon and not the pagan god ? Because supposedly if you ask pagan gods gifts , they give them to you . And they are described as being 'good ' and not trying to take over people 's bodies and replace their mind / intellect with their own , effectively controling a human body .",Greek,Greek

According to the myth , Zeus left 2 eagles to fly from the 2 ends of the world ( West and East ) and they met over Delphi , signifying that there was the middle of the world .

Alithinos,greece,"# That they want to go on one of the rich central-western European countries to have more possibilites to become wealthy , because our country because of the austerity measures is in a very deep economi depression and there are no jobs . But they ca n't leave our country because of the Dublin treaties , and thus they are forced to live poor lives . They are stranded on a place that does n't have the wealth and resources to support them . # I know of some , but none is at the city in which I 'm living . # Every now and then , the immigrants burn the Refugee centers in riots against them being hold there . Which does n't really make much sense . Although the place they are placed to live is bad , it 's better than sleeping under the stars and getting wet by the rain . Often the immigrants fight with each other . They form nation-based gangs and have fights between them , for example Afghans vs Syrians vs Iraquis etc . # I 've heard that some of them do stuff here but I ca n't name one . # I have no idea . # We now have even more jobless people , so the percentage of poor people went up . # Personally not . Some ( mostly far-right wingers ) do , but I do n't . Our traditions have n't changed in the 400 years of violent Ottoman occupation , so there is no possibly a chance they will change by some poor , isolated , people with no political power at all . The root of the problems is that these people ( coming through Turkey the last recent years ) want to live the good lives , they want to chase the 'European Dream ' , and become wealthy . They want to live in countries other than Greece , because in Greece there is no 'European Dream ' but 'European Nightmare ' , economically speaking . But because Greece is part of the EU it is n't allowed to let them leave to go to the EU countries they want ( that would be against the Dublin treaty ) , and the EU also does n't let Greece to send them back where they came from ( Because that would be 'racist ' ) . So Greece is forced to keep them on Greece . On Greece , which has 28 % unemployment , and life has become twice more expensive than it was 10 years ago , and 10 years ago was n't fabulous to begin with . Because getting a job is very hard , many in order to survive try to find other ways to make money , illegal ways . For example the vast majority of drug dealers are foreign gangs , most famous are the Albanian and Russian mafias , sometimes fighting each other in rivalry over who rules certain districts and places . The best kind of immigrants in my opinion are eastern Asians , like Chinese and Korean . They are the most respectful , do n't cause trouble , and extremely rarely you will hear about someone of them doing something bad like selling drugs . Sub-Saharan africans almost all of them do drugs , and many of them sell illegally other stuff , that gets smuggled from their countries . People of central to western Asia like Pakistanis , Afghanis , and Syrians , make up ethnically and nationally based gangs that often fight each other . Afghans and Pakistanis in particular are the most frequent that take part in assaults and rapes . Albanians are the main source of marijuana smuggling , about 90 % of marijuana smoked here is made in Albania . But many of them are also hard workers , and work long hours in more than one jobs . Bulgarians used to be immigrants in Greece some years ago , but now all Bulgarians have went back to Bulgaria , because I assume that after the austerity measures in Greece , life in Bulgaria has become easier than in Greece . Romanians are also hard working people , but some of them steal stuff , even churches . Russians are mostly alcoholics . Some of them , get more easily integrated to our society than others . People of eastern Europe more usually make relationships with Greeks , and other people . People of eastern Asia like Chinese are more closed , they eat in their own ethnic restaurants and work in shops of people of their own nationalities , but are very respectful of our culture , the laws etc . People of middle and western Asia are somewhat equally closed to their own ethnic communities , but often have no respect for local culture or laws .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hello . I know what you are talking about . And that 's what makes this Hellenic polytheism special , is n't it ? That the vast majority of the people coming to it , do n't do it because someone else told them to or converted , but because we each felt by ourselves some kind of attraction . Some kind of unexplainable attraction to the pictures , the symbols , the sites of the temples . We felt some kind of emotional engagement in these myths unlike any we felt from other fairy tales , as if they all were familiar to us before we even read / listened about them . As if we always knew about them but had for some reason forgotten . Greek temples and the sites they are situated on have something special . For example , Acropolis hill in Athens , on top of which the Parthenon is located among others , has this unique characteristic : It 's a place that for some reason birds avoid to fly over , and do n't land on it . If you go atop Acropolis , you wo n't see any pigeons or sparrows , but the rest of Athens is full of them . I 'm a Greek , so I 'm in the fortunate position of having many ancient temples close to me myself too . Here this is what 's happening : The government officially does n't allow neither Greek polytheists or people of any religion to do religious stuff on what the government recognizes as `` ancient sites '' , and well , all ancient temples have been characterized like that . So it does n't give licenses to people for such things . But some teams of people have gathered and acted rituals unnoficially . You have to mind though , that because these places are often visited by other people too , if you go to actually make a ritual , perhaps you and some friends of yours , unoficially , you will get weird looks from people passing by . They might even lough or ridicule you . As for tumblr , personally I have n't noticed much debate . Here is the thing : everyone is entitled to their opinions , and on the internet that is even more accentuated . Now , there are a lot of kinds of different people that are interested in the Greek myths , religious and such matters . If you look deep on history you might find that there were some 'rules ' , but what I see is that many modern people do n't think of following these . So basically what I get is that there is a version we could call revisioned , and some are focusing more on tradition . The thing is that there is not some kind of official authority telling you what to do , as there is in Islam , Christianity , etc . You can do as you like . I just think that some might be telling you stuff to give you a better understanding , but then again I ca n't say for sure , because I do n't know about the particular subjects . For one thing , 'Artemisian ' means `` Of Artemis / Related to Artemis '' . There are places with that name , and people who live in these places are called with that name . One of the battles between Greeks and Persians is called `` Battle of Artemisium '' , so IMO I do n't think there is really a problem for you to call yourself that , if you think you are somehow related to Artemis , or something related to Artemis .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Well she is a character made up for comics books that is n't referred to at any ancient source . Pretty much like Xena , the Warrior Princess . Now I do n't know much about her character , only that she is a woman of the Amazon tribe , that has super powers . Amazons are described in ancient books as just another human tribe , in the sense that they are not 'demigods ' or 'supernatural ' beings . So how one is supposed to feel about a comic character that is somehow related with an imaginative representation of an ancient tribe , and in an imaginative universe that has some references with much artistic license / liberty to some aspects of a religion ? Well , it 's just another movie . It does n't harm neither do any good , as its a comic movie and it is n't presented as a 'serious ' historic one . Now do I like this movie ? I do n't know . The trailers seem interesting , but personally I do n't like the monotonous colors . Many movies for some reason lately have a very limited , unnatural representation of colors , and I just personally does n't like this fact , I prefer movies with natural colors .",Greek,Greek

It focuses on the different political systems that were active in the city of Athens , starting from the times of legend , and up to his time . He provides context about the culture , the social problems , wars , and other factors that played a role in shaping the different political systems such as Royalty , Tyranny , Oligarchy , and eventually Democracy . He goes on to much detail in describing the Democratic Constitution of ancient Athenian democracy , and the good thing is that instead of doing so with dry 'official ' bureaucratic language , he focuses on the point and and the thinking behind the laws and structures , which provide great context about he society of that time .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,quake,"I had make a pause in playing games and keeping up with gaming news lately for some time . Then all of a sudden I spotted this video on youtube while searching for other stuff , by Youtube recommendations , and he convinced me to look out for the beta . So I downloaded it . Now the game has some potential , but I noticed some things that in unison made my experience not enjoyable with it . : ( I 've been playing Quake 3 and Live for quite some years mind ... But the negatives can still be fixed , if Bethesda is willing to make the game more enjoyable . I hope they do fix it . Here are the negatives , of course IMHO . 1 ) Netcode is bad . I had a good ping ( 60 ) and the things happening to my screen were messed up . I 'd die and the death animation of my character would play before even the enemy 's shoot animation played . I 'd obviously hit enemies , but the game would n't register some of my hits ... Messed up . 2 ) Perhaps I would n't have a problem with the powers , if the game actually explained what they do and how to use them properly . It does n't . Some empty maps to practice and better explanations would n't go amiss . 3 ) In the beta there is a considerable lack of options . At least to what I 've been used to playing QL . For example I always had the option to auto-equip guns if newer or better . Now there is n't such an option , as there also are n't other options . 4 ) I want dedicated servers and a server browser . We are not playing in consoles , we play on computers . This match making is n't good . 5 ) What are player 's levels supposed to mean ? What is their function ? Does a player who is higher level than me has more health or something like that ? The game does n't tell you . If so , why does the game place people of different levels on the same games ? 6 ) I 'm one of those people that do n't like how the game has meters counting down the spawn time for power ups , and it has that voice telling everybody about power up spawns . I also did n't liked it in QL . Because that gets everyone too focused on power ups . So I saw the players all gathering up on the exact same room , where Quad Damage was , and all the fighting took place there , with people fighting over who is going to get QD . The rest areas of the map were empty , were not played . This became predictable and old rather quickly . And unpredictability was one of the things that made QL enjoyable for me . 7 ) Long loading times . Especially the initial one . I thought the game hanged up and killed it and restarted 3 times , before searching about it on the internet and discovering that that 's how it is supposed to work . So these were my personal complaints . Hope they fix this game 'cause it would be a pity to not fix it , because I think it has potential .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"You are wrong . Plato in 'Timaeus ' writes that in the beggining all the matter of what was to become the universe as we know it was concentrated and condensed forming a single body of matter that was later split by the 'Creator ' to multiple parts that formed stars , planets etc . Furthermore , he states that time began with the existence of space . If you take Plato 's account and remove the religious stuff related with it , you have an account that says that in the beggining all that there was was at one 'point ' condensed , and at some point it was splitted and started expanding . Which fits the narrative of the Big Bang , the major difference being that Plato writes the split and expansion was n't made from a typical random explosion , but that it was planned by a Creator . That makes Plato 's story ( that includes a mix of theology and natural science ) about the creation of the universe , the closest theology related narrative we have to the Big Bang . Essentially Big Bang is Plato 's story with the referreces to religious entities / concepts removed . I suggest you to have a read on this book 'Timaeus ' .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Here are some points : 1 ) Someone hears a voice . Like actually listening an audible voice , as if there was someone physically there , and that someone thinks that this voice is God 's voice . In that case there is the possibility of a fraud , or schizophrenia . The dellusion that there are audible voices is a symptom of that condition . People who listen to voices like this might become dangerous , yet do n't put all people who do have this in the same basket . Not all of them are dangerous , but some are . 2 ) The possibility of someone listening God in a dream or a vision . In that case things are different . We 'listen ' people talking to us in our dreams , and one might listen to God in that situation . Dreams and visions often are hard to differentiate , so it is plausible that someone will hear God speaking to them . That can be plausible theologically , and no , people who have visions / dreams are not inherently dangerous . 3 ) If God ( s ) did n't spoke to people , there would n't be any religions in the world . 4 ) Some religions provide ways that promise that if someone follows them , will be able to communicate with God . It 's in your hand to experiment and do as these religions say , to see if God will talk to you .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"I decided to try linux as a second OS at my PC 2 days ago . I downloaded and burned Debian to a usb stick . I could n't install it side by side with Windows 7 though , and in a moment of stupidity I formated the drive and my Windows was lost . But Debian open drivers were shit and could n't detect that my gpu can display 1080p resolution , so my monitor was stuck at 1280x1024 , and everything was huge and blurry . I decided to replace it with another distro , Lubuntu , which is Ubuntu , but with a lighter user interface . Lubuntu thankfully immediately recognized my screen , and everything seemed to work fine with it . But then I had to install Windows again , as a second OS . Trying to burn a ISO image on the USB stick , killed the USB stick . Then I got a dvd and tried to write the image of Windows 7 on a dvd , I did it with the standard app of the OS , but it was n't bootable . Then I burned another dvd , and that was crashing mid-installation . Then I decided to use my old Windows XP cd , and during the installation ... I received BSOD . ( ! ) It was a long day . I went to sleep and decided to continue trying to install Windows next day . Next day I decided to download images from elsewhere , to see if those will work . I burned more dvds ... Same shit . I tried another burning tool that I installed with apt-get too , same shit . I got bored of burning dvds and then throwing them to the trash bin and I bought another usb stick . I tried 3-4 times to install windows with that , until Linux destroyed that too . ( it would n't even show up in terminal ) Finally I used yet another dvd , another image burner program , and another ISO , and eventually ... After 2 days of work continuously trying the whole days to install Windows , having 2 usbs destroyed , and about 7 dvds useless , I managed to install Windows , deleting anything Linux in the process ! ! ! After that , I could use the legit media I have , to install legit Windows . How I was feeling for these 2 and a half days ? Like I was one of the biggest suckers and most stupid people in the world . I was thinking I could never install Windows on that computer again , and that I would have to replace a new hard drive , and / or a new dvd drive , and perhaps even a new motherboard . I will never try installing Linux again . Special Comments : 1 . The fact that 4 out of 5 of ISO burn apps for Linux have options ONLY for Linux distros and not for Windows is disturbing . At the same time there are numerous windows apps for burning Linux ISOs . I do n't like this bias . 2 . The fact that the standard and only format type options for drives 90 % of Linux apps have , are non-universal , non-readable by Windows , is disturbing . 3 . After I made a clean install and format on my hard drive with Linux , the Windows installer could n't see the hard drive . So to do anything to the drive with Windows , such as installing it as the only or second OS , I 'd have to first use the Linux iso to manage the drive so it will be visible to Windows , and then use the Windows image . I 'm sorry Linux fans . Richard Stallman is making captivating speeches , and makes me concerned with digital privacy and freedom , but there are lots of inconveniences , and by that I do n't mean having to use the terminal to do stuff that could be done through a GUI , but about stuff like the aformentioned . I was a non-biased person that was willful to install Linux and use it for everything except gaming , and use Windows only for games . But such bias as making the vast majority of burner tools to only have options for burning Linux distros , and formatting drives to types Windows ca n't see , and destroying USB drives , made me feel too bad and stupid for myself for even trying to get Linux at my main computer , because most Linux devs think that making installing Windows on a computer that has Linux an oddysey is a good idea .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,ELINT,"Jesus said people will join him in heaven . He did n't said people 's 'souls ' will join him in heaven . At least in the gospels , which are the canon for most Christians , he does n't speak about souls . In Christianity the mind of a human lies inside his body . A human is ressurected as a single being . A soul is a term used on pagan Greek metaphysics , according to which humans where made with a divine part that they share with the 'Gods ' which is the soul , and a mortal part that they share with the 'Titans ' which is their body . The 'soul ' is supposed to consist of two parts : the essence of Aether , and the intellect 'Nous ' of someone , which is the organ that produces thought and reason , and carries the memories . Supposedly , this 'soul ' leaves the body when human dies , and then goes to heaven , it is judged , and then drinks of the water of oblivion , and then is sent to a new body to live a new life . `` Metempsychosis '' or `` Reincarnation '' as you might have heard . The distinction between body and soul as two different things that can be split from each other was first documented by Orpheus who lived somewhere between 1500 and 1200 B.C. , and it 's obviously a pagan doctrine . Thing is the phenomenon of Jesus could n't be explained fully with the beliefs of the older Judaism , because according to Judaism there can be no 'son of God ' or 'God incarnate ' . So Christians who believed that Jesus was indeed a son of God , had a hard time trying to explain how this was possible , and basically had to start a completely new religion . So they took concepts and ideas from other religions , were they saw fit . The very festival of December 25th was a celebration of Dionysus 's birth in Greece and Rome , that was turned to Christmas . TL ; DR : You can still be a Christian , soul is a pagan idea after all .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Personally I 'm of the Platonic and Mystic path , so instead of focusing on things like libations and sacrifices , I spend most time doing things regarding my excellence ( Areti ) . It 's the more esoteric path , that focuses on the individual . Note that some others might not agree with Plato 's path . The idea is that one betters his or herself by acquiring the likeness of the Gods , something which is done by acquiring wisdom and the betterment of body and soul . So I 'm trying to follow a 'good ' diet , and excersize my body and the Intellect , that according to Platonic metaphysics its a part of the immortal soul . Plato suggests that by solving math problems and practicing dialectics , one makes the 'mind ' part of soul more powerful , and thus becomes closer to the Gods . It 's a kind of worship which with the individual worships the Gods by making himself or herself more like them . A later theologist said , that to become more like the Gods , each human should do something beneficient to humanity , as the Gods also benefited humanity , you know , Prometheus teached us how to start fire , Demetra gave us cerials , Athena wisdom , Apollo the prediction of future , etc . So I 'm also trying to find a way of helping people in some way . I also pray some hymns , but personally I do n't do invocations , because I 'm afraid that I might open a 'portal ' , which through other entities might pass .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"First of all lets define 'magic ' . In my understanding , 'magic ' is any practice or action that relates with something not explained by mainstream natural physics and chemistry , the 'supernatural ' . This does n't necesserilly has to be 'bad ' or 'evil ' . I 'll use Christianity as an example as its more probably that a bigger number of people are familiar with it . If you pray to Jesus , and you get what you pray , and its because you prayed that this happened , then you did magic . And Christians say that this practice is good , thus they also have good magic . So now that we straightened out what magic is , I will answer your questions according to my opinion only . * I 've done a few times such practices in the past , but I do n't do currently , as I want to be better informed about them , so I wo n't do mistakes . Thus for now I 'm studying and I 'm reading a variety of books to gather what info there is about it . * Magic is necessarily religious . Someone who does n't believe in Gods or a single God , or generally beings other than the usuals of this realm , or religious subjects like spirit , soul etc , wo n't believe in magic either . For there to be 'magic ' there has to be something else too , and that else is usually a subject that somehow is related to a religion . * Not right now . I did in the past , and I may in the future , but not at this period . * I avoid that right now . Because what I understand is that I 'm just a puny mortal and I have no authority to tell them to do anything for me . I 'm also someone who follows Plato 's explanations and catechism , so I believe that there are two realms , the Spiritual and the Material , and that the Spiritual is higher and better than the Material , and where the Gods and Spirits reside . With that in mind , I think that abstracting the Heavenly Beings from the joy of Heaven to bring them down here in the inferior material realm , I do them bad , something that they do n't really like . So I respect them and hymn them , but I do n't involve them on my personal wants . * I do stick with Hellenic , and you know why ? Because they just work . Since I already found something that works , why look for something else , risking of just waisting my time ? In fact , the fact that Hellenic things work is what convinced me to shape up my current worldview . I was n't convinced and I rather doubted that Hellenism had any truth to it , and being a sensible reasonable man that I am , I decided to use the scientific method in Hellenism . That is to develop a theory , make an experiment , and redo experiments to validate the theory . The theory was that there could be truth in Hellenism , and the experiment was to try Hellenic practices . What I 'd like to comment is on the mainstream image people have when they bring in their minds the word 'magic ' . Your average person will either think of Harry Potter and Dragons , or satanists . Which is quite a distorted image , I think it makes the word carry a negative energy . If you think about it though , was n't Jesus 's action of turning water to whine ... magic ? The very word 'miracle ' is meaning the product of a 'spell ' . So let 's not condemn a word and lets think with logic and reason , and say that 'magic ' is not something you do by moving a stick and saying 'hocus pocus ' , neither its something people who worship an 'anti-god ' do . As for theurgy , also known as divination , i.e . becoming like God , is n't that what most religions teach , anyway ? So there is this Hellenic idea of Areti , which is Virtue , which is to act like the Gods , be good and just . Christianity , the authentic at least , not how it turned to be now , tells that Christ loves , and shares , and forgives , and that his followers should also love , share , and forgive . So they took the concept of Areti too , which is a form of divination . Divination is when the human sees something good , and believing that this good will be good for him or her too , so decides to become good himself or herself .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Please note that I do n't claim to be an expert . While I 'm sure about what is the meaning of most words , I was n't sure for every single one of them . So the first thing I did for the words I did n't knew was to use tools such as this : http : //www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform , and a handful were guessed based on the context , the meaning of the other words in a phrase . Here are the syllable-words : Al , Pha , Be , Ta , Ga , Ma , De , ( l is ousted ) Ta , E , Psilon , Ze , Ta , E , Ta , The , Ta , Io , Ta , Ka , Pa , Lam , ( B is ousted ) Da , Me , Ni , Ksi , O , Micron , Pi , RhoS , Igma , Tau , Y , Psilon , Phi , He , Psi , O , Mega . Al is the Doric counterpart of Ionian El , which is the root for ( H ) Elios , the Sun . Thus ( H ) El-Las litteraly means 'Sun 's stone ' or rather 'Sunny land ' . Pha is the root of Phanes , literally meaning 'Light ' or 'Emitter of Light ' , and according to Orpheus Phanes was also the name of a primordial deity . Be ( Bi ) is related with the word Bios , which litteraly means 'Life ' . Ta is a demonstrative pronoun . Ga is the Doric equivalent of Ge , Earth . Ma is root of Mater , which is Doric equivalent of Ionic 'Meter ' meaning Mother ( De-Meter=Strong Mother ) De is root of Denamis , often spelled 'Dynamis'which is power or force . When 'E ' is alone it has the meaning of 'approach , approaches ' , as noted by Plutarch on the book 'On the E at Delphi ' . Psilon = Thin . Ze means life or living , e.g . Ze-us means the 'one who gave life ' . 'The ' was one of the syllables that I am not sure about . It could either be related with words like the verb 'theomai ' which means 'I wonder , I admire ' , or it could be related with words like 'Theos ' , which is God . There is also the verb 'theiein ' which means 'moving fast ' . Io is dawn . Ka was another word that I was n't sure about . It can either be related with 'kai ' which means 'and , plus ' , or with words like 'kaiomai ' and 'kaysi ' , in which case it would be related with burns and burning . Pa is rather straight forward , it is related with 'Pater ' , meaning father . Lam according to the Perseus dictionary can mean either 'why ' or 'what ' . I related Da with 'dasko ' which means 'I teach ' , da itself being a teaching . Me is part of Mene , which is an archaic name of the Moon . Ne is probably short version of nephis , a flake . Ksi is ejaculation , in that context I interpreted it as emition . Micron is a word even used today , meaning very small , tiny . I joined Pi with Rho and 'S ' from 'Sigma ' to form 'Pi-Rho-s ' which means 'of fire , from fire ' . But then 'Igma ' from 'Sigma ' is left without 'S ' , and 'Igma ' alone means particle . Tau means 'stability , stable ' , and its also why astrologers say that 'Taurus ' is one of the most stable zodiac signs .

Alithinos,TheForest,"Hello , I got it about 3 hours ago and I 've been playing this time . Thankfully in the hours I played I did n't encountered many bugs , the only bug that annoyed me was that some logs were disappearing and then appearing at random places . Though there are some other things that annoyed me , that are more of things to be tweaked regarding balance . I think the game should have a difficulty option . It felt unfair that being armed with an axe I had to inflict more hits to a mutant to kill him , than he had to slap me to take me to the cave . Especially when there are like many mutants and surround you , things get rather uncomfortable . Another thing I think is that IMO the character gets hungry way too often . I 'd prefer it if I had to eat something about every real world hour , as it is now , I feel its just distracting me from doing things like preparing shelter , fire etc . Other than that , what IMO needs tweaking is tree shadows . They are way too dark , at some dense forests it becoming harder to see than night . So with these issues aside , game seems quite interesting and good . I look forward to exploring the island . ( is it an island ? )",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,ELINT,"I am an Orphic / Platonic Hellenist , or Neoplatonist , call me how you prefer . My religion is the ancient Greek religion , which is nothing like what movies and shows show . Now here are my answers : 1 . Souls have no gender . The genders where created out of necessity for the reproduction of mortal material bodies . Souls were created before the creation of the universe and the bodies of humans , and originate from Heaven.A Soul is not made out of matter , but of Aether , which is a Divine Essence originating from Heaven . On Heaven there are no genders , because there is no matter , and the Divines does n't reproduce like humans do . The first humans did n't even had a bodily gender , but they were genderless and had no sex . They were coming to life by flowering from the soil of Earth , and it is because of the memories of this period that humans have been calling Earth 'mother ' since the most ancient times we know of . When Prometheus stole the Holy Flame of Olympus and shared it with humans , humans became rather powerful , and out of their pride started a rebellion against Zeus , who was the chief Divine watching over the mortal world . As a punishment for that , Zeus cursed humans and splitted them in half , and out of each different half of a human 's body , he made two new bodies , that of Man and that of Woman . Thus Men and Women started to exist as they are today . Gender is a curse we carry because of pride and rebellion against Divine Order . 2 . Depends on how one defines 'gender ' . Practically speaking , there are only three genders , because naturally there are only three types of biological body structures . There is male , female , and hermaphrodite . One 's biological gender is defined by the characteristics of their bodies . But then how is explained the feeling some people feel , that they are trapped in a body of a gender they do n't belong to ? Here is what . We believe that Souls are in a constant cycle of reincarnations , that lasts 10.000 years . By the end of the cycle , the Soul is judged based on the actions it did in its lives , and is either earning the afterlife of the Elysian Fields , or it is send in fiery Tartarus , or it is send to the Blessed 's Islands . But while a Soul is on Heaven , and before it returns to a new life , it is drinking the 'Water of Oblivion ' to forget the memories of its past life . There is the possibility that a Soul will either not drink of the water at all , or that the water wo n't be as effective , and as a result , the Soul might carry in its new life memories from its past life . But a Soul is n't always entering a body of the same gender , or nationality . A Soul might be an Iraqi woman in one life , and a German man in its next life . So there is that possibility , that when one 's soul comes to live a new life on Earth , it has n't completely forgotten its past life memories , and still has some feelings or memories from its past life . As a result of that , some people who feel men find themselves trapped in women 's bodies , while some people who feel women , find themselves trapped in men 's bodies . It is because on their past lives they were in the body of the other gender , and they carry something from their past life to the new one . 3 . I believe I covered this question with my previous answer . 4 . Souls are judged on the principless of Virtue , Justice , and Goodness . If one is a benevolant person full of love for everyone , who helps and respects everyone and everything , is always acting in a just way and helpful to the human society , and does n't do evil , this one will be rewarded accordingly . Those that do terrific crimes like genocides , torturing etc , will be thrown on the fiery river of Tartarus with the name Pyriflegethon . 5 . The Soul ca n't change itself a gender , because Souls do n't have genders , and ca n't have genders . Beacause genders is a means for material body reproduction , and a curse fallen on humans . Genders are a feature exclusive to material bodies , and Souls are not made out of matter , but out of spirit . Saying that a Soul might have a gender is like saying that numbers wear shoes . What can happen to a soul is to be inserted in bodies of different genders at different lives . But the genders wo n't be a feature of the Souls , but a feature of the bodies the Souls reside inside . 6 . The question is answered by the previous answers .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pagan,"Unfortunately there is n't a single source that I know of to explain all of these sayings . I was just reading one of Plato 's dialogues , and at some point a person in the dialogue speaks of the subject of taking things out of context , and gives two examples , both related to lines of Pythagoras . One of them is the one I already wrote , about the beans . The second phrase that is explained is the one about not accepting Swallow nests on your house . On the book was written that Pythagoras metaphorically called some people 'Swallows ' , based on some features of the swallows . The speaker of the dialogue goes on to describe the actual bird : `` Swallows come from far away , not because they like your region better , but for their own interest to flee the cold . They come uninvited , and they dirty your roof.Yet they never offer something in return , and are of no benefit at all to the landlord.They do n't eat the flies , neither they amuse you with some nice song like the beautiful nightingales do . Once time has passed and they can leave to go back were they came from , they ungraciously leave you without restrains , and ever thanking you for sharing your roof with them.These are the kind of men Pythagoras directed his pupils not to welcome in their houses '' . Hope I helped somewhat .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Your post poses two questions , one of them is : 1 . How is my religion more easily defended ? 2 . How and why my religion shapes my life in a better way than it would be without a religion . I will try to answer with compact but inclusive texts for both questions . 1 . Well my religion ( Platonism ) draws its creation story from the book 'Timaeus ' which says that the Universe was created by God who applied Order ( physics laws ) to matter which made matter to concentrate in one point of space forming a single unique body of matter ( called by Orpheus 'the Cosmic Egg ' ) that later it was 'pregnated ' by the Soul , which was something that God created , and as a result of the reactions of the Soulfull matter , the first single piece of matter exploded and was split to smaller pieces , which formed the Stars , Planets , etc . Looking at modern science , the aformentioned story is verified by the 'Big Crunch ' and 'Big Bang ' scientific theories . Another thing we believe is that Soul is a luminous energy that humans have inside them , and that the body of God is made of a huge Soul , way bigger , more dense , and of higher quality than the kind of Soul that humans have . Thus the near-death experiences of people , who say that they see themselves going to a 'Light ' , also verify our ancient theology . The verifications are just too many to ignore . 2 . Note that I was n't raised to be a Platonist . I became one after my own study , research , and empirical 'religious ' experiences . Thus I was n't forced to it , neither I decided to be what I am and believe what I do , or to pretend that I do , for the shake of tradition or to keep my parents happy . I became a Platonist because before I even get to know who Plato was and what he wrote about , I saw 'dreams ' or 'visions ' of things , that years later I discovered that some guy who lived 2500 years ago before me , wrote books describing things , situations and concepts that until then I thought they were products of my imagination . But is it possible to see the same 'dreams ' someone else saw and wrote about , if I never met this guy , or heard or read about what he speaks from anybody else , and had no idea whatsoever about these kind of things prior ? So you understand , I started taking seriously what I believe , because I saw things in my dreams , and years later I discovered that these things had been documented and described with tons of details in the past , without me knowing it until several years after I saw them . Is my life better ? Well lets say that my world-view changed . That I now understand the nature of our world in a different way that I did before . But how could we say that one of the different views is really 'better ' than the other ? How a man 's life changes if instead of believing that the universe was created because something that we do n't exactly know how happened , in a single piece of matter that made it explode , he believes that what made the single piece of matter that made the universe explode was Soul , given by the One 'God ' . ? What changes is that he gets some answers to questions that ca n't be answered in some other way . That you get to feel that you know how the universe and existence works better .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,religion,"Greek Polytheism and Hellenism are the exact same thing , so it 's not reasonable to have them as seperate , and the oldest evidence we have is from the Palatian Minoan Period , at 3000BC , not 2000BC . Orphism ( written as `` Greco-Roman mystery cult ) is older than 750bC if you consider what is said , that Orpheus lived some centuries before Homer , somewere between 1200bC and 1000bC . ( not 100 % sure , conflicting evidence ) Hermeticism took influence from Orphism , but the line in the diagram turns earlier , missing the connection . Neoplatonism is reformed Platonism , and Platonism started at the 5th century BC , and was violently ended along with the ban of other religions at the 5th century AD by Emperor Theodosius . The graph gives the impression that out of Neoplatonism came religions like Theosophy and Thelema , or that it evolved to these , but I ca n't see how this might be true . Thelema focuses on 3 Gods taken from Egypt , and adopts the Qaballa Tree of Judaism . If anything , it looks more like a mix of Egyptian and Jewish believes , than having to do anything with Platonism and Neoplatonism .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,paganism,"'Pagan ' is essentially all religions except from Christianity that existed on land that belonged to the Roman Empire , while the empire had a strict law to ban all religions except from Judaism and Christianity .

That practically means that any person in about most of Europe , the northest parts of Africa , and the westernmost parts of Asia that was n't worshipping YHVH , was called 'pagan ' . 'Pagan ' also means 'lake ' in Greek , so some connect the english word with the Greek that sounds exactly the same , and say that paganism has to do with worshipping lakes ( or at the lakes ) , and more generally nature ( or at nature ) . Thus as you understand , asking for a single source to learn about paganism is a very general question , as there had been quite many traditions and beliefs spread throughout an Empire that big ...",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hello . I 'd like to add something . From the time I wrote the first post , I slept once . I lied on the bed to sleep , but sleep would n't come , and at some point I felt as if presences were at the room.I tried to stand up but could n't , I could only slightly move my head forward , and the wrists . I googled and it seems that I had 'sleep paralysis ' . These 'presences ' I felt where near , where many in number , and I did n't really felt as if one was sitting at me , as most seem to feel when they have paralysis . I just felt and I did n't saw , but I felt they wanted to get inside me , and that they had partially done it . I understood at that point , that the reason I could n't fully control my body , was because others where partially inside me and were trying to get full control of my body.So I tried to speak and asked them 'why do you want to do that ? ' and they told me with one voice 'it 's because you asked for it , you wanted it yourself ' . And my mind went to the invocations I did ... wrongly.Then I said `` I 'm sorry , I did n't expected that you will get inside me , if I knew it I would n't '' , but they stayed silent and I kept 'fighting ' to retrieve my body . Then I started praying to the One God above all , call him or her or it Plato 's 'Demiurge ' , or Proclus 's 'One ' , or Abraham 's YHVH . And I started a long prair , and at the middle of it I regained full control of my body and I felt 'free ' , as if they were n't any more 'inside ' me . But I still felt they were in the room . Then I said `` Begone Demons and do n't come back . Because you are wicked and tell lies , and you made people tell lies about you , to get them in your trap '' And then I felt that they left , and I got peacefull and then fell asleep being sure that they would n't hurt me anymore . And indeed after that I slept , relatively quickly , without waiting with closed eyes for hours for sleep to come . So what now ? I think that one of these four possibilities is true : 1 . That doing the rituals not exactly as directed , will instead bring hurtful demons instead of the Gods or Goddesses . 2 . That while an invocation might work , and the Gods or Goddesses might come , they might not be all-benevolant , in that they might want to get a part of your body , and demand a 'bigger ' sacrifice than fruits or cookies . 3 . That perhaps we should focus on the One or Demiurge , the superior entity , and not the 'littler ' ones . 4 . That I just had a typical sleep disorder that is in no way related to anything 'special ' , meaning that my invocations did nothing and that I just had a known health issue . If someone has lots of experience with ritual invocations and / or have studied hellenic theology , please answer and give us your insight . If there is a risk for someone to bring harmful spirits by doing an invocation wrong , it something that must be known , because we should protect people who are interested from getting in trouble .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I am not a popular person neither I have done some great action like the ones you wrote about . What I did before that , was to decide for myself to follow whatever Jesus said in my daily life . Such as to love everybody , to pray to the Father , to not lie , to share things I have and give to the needy without expecting things in return , to forgive people who do bad things to me and not seek revenge , etc . At that time He spoke to me I had in mind to do something for helping other people . To try to make it the purpose of my life to help in some way other humans , yet I have n't done it yet . I did n't carried my mission the moment I was given it , because of a single thing : cowardness . I was afraid of what other people will say for me and do to me . Because the path that I had to take was not easy but full of stings . I humbly recognize this wrong of me . He showed Himself to me , he told me the name , and he told me what to do , but I failed Him , and myself because of cowardice.Since that moment I lost connection . I 've stopped seeing things bright with light , but they became simple . I stopped feeling His presence any more . I got depression . I live without finding anything compelling or satisfying . I do n't have the will to watch movies , and I do n't get any satisfaction from things that are to give such a satisfaction to people .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I advise you to look for books written by people who actually believed in this religion , and wrote them at a time where books where not easy to made and were n't massively produced , which made people to write because they trully wanted to express things , and not for money . Now , unfortunately , there is n't a single book encompassing the whole of this religion , like the Bible or the Koran of Christianity and Islam . Mostly , books written on Hellenism are each covering only a single subject . And if that was n't enough , many myths are symbolic and allegoric , having alternative meanings and needing interpretation , which leads someone who is trully interested to learn on what these ancient people trully believed , to have to face a mountain of pages . Now there are three kinds of books that are religion-related from ancient Greece . One of these types are stories that are read like common fables , the other is works of philosophy and theological explanation , more like essays , and finally there are books that contain methods of divination and practices . Of the first type of books , the 'story like ' ones , most popular are works like : Hesiod - Theogony Hesiod - Works and Days Homer - Iliad Homer - Oddysey Aesop - Fables Of the second type of books , which describe in a 'serious ' manner religious and spiritual subjects are : Most of Plato 's works Aristotle - Metaphysics Proclus - Everything from him Finally , some known works that contain divination practices are : Iamblichus - On the mysteries Diagoras - On the Initiation to the Eleusian Mysteries Orpheus - Lithika What I understand from your post , is that you are looking for a book that contains story-like material , and tries to be as inclusive a single book can get .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"If we decide to take what the ancient Greeks wrote about their own believes seriously , then according to an ancient book I read that I currently do n't remember its name , as I 've been reading lots of them , we would have to believe that once the Gods decided to live away from Humans ( after the end of the Golden Age or Golden Race of Humanity ) , and that as time passed the Gods like Zeus , Hera etc . were forgotten and thus people only worshipped the Sun , Moon and Earth , which were the only 'gods ' they could see . But then the Gods decided to end their absistence , and started visiting the Mortal Realm from Heaven again , and thus Humans re-learnt of their existence . As for the idea of a more woman-focused society , it kind of falls in the time that Hesiod refers to as the 'Silver Age of Humanity ' . The original 'Humans ' of the Golden age were neither Male or Female , and could n't reproduce themselves , but they were flowered out of Earth 's soil . Which is why Greeks called Earth 'Mother ' , and why they buried the dead inside Earth - to return the body back where ti came from . The Silver Age of Humans starts by the split of a Human to two parts , Women and Men , the loss of 'direct communion ' with the Gods , the begining of illnesses , and the shortening of a Human 's Life . The first of the 'new humans ' that would replace the old 'Golden ' ones , was a Woman , and specifically Pandora . Pandora got married with the brother of Promethius , who was Epimethius , and was also a Titan , as she could n't possibly mate with the Humans that existed until then , because they had no gender and genitals . So according to this story the Woman is older than Man . With the creation of the first Woman , and the split of Humans to Men and Women , the Golden Age ended , and the Silver Age started . On the Silver age , it is written that men were living with their mothers for 100 years , and then once they would become adults , they would loose their minds , and they would live less . So there is presented a time period where women where living considerably more than men , and mothers held their boys for 100 years . Perhaps someone could call that 'matriarchy ' , given that mothers had to keep watching and growing men for most of their lives , and the fact that they lived way more than men , could perhaps lead to a special admiration or respect towards women at that age . And it would n't be impossible to even hypothesize that as at this age the Gods were not present , and Women lived more than Men , and where the ones giving birth , and where not 'loosing their minds ' once they grew up , that even Women themselves could have been worshipped . Hesiod who lived in the Iron Age said that men were getting tired a lot during the Silver Age , and blames women for that.But it is also said that the Silver Humans were destroyed because of their impiety . With the above in mind , if we take the words of ancients like Hesiod , then there was indeed a time were humans were n't believing in the 'Gods ' , and that in that time women held a special important role on societies . But Hesiod proves wrong the theory that a single Goddess worship was replaced violently with 'Sky gods ' by some 'manly ' invaders . Instead he says that because this society had abandoned the Gods , the Gods decided to end it . An end that did n't came by 'enlightened manly invaders ' , but by the Gods and through a universal deluge , and the further degradation of the nature of Humans , that would also make them live shorter lives . So knowing all these stories , what I understand about this 'Goddess ' theory , is that it takes some parts of ancient writings , only the parts that are useful for the pre-existing intention , and distorts them using the half-truth method , to present a different theory of things , a theory that puts blame on 'men ' for the change of an older state of society . The impiety of the 'Silver ' Humans and the punishment of the Gods are erased , and in their place they are injecting the stories which say that the Silver humans were pious , and that change came by 'evil men with manly sky gods ' , further promoting impiety to the Gods , repeating what the 'Silver ' Humans did .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I find your intention quite good . Here is my most important suggestion for helping people learn about true Hellenism : Tell them to go straight to the source to seek knowledge . Instead of directing them to read book of modern authors , direct them to read religion-related books of ancient authors . This advise is for the following reasons : 1 . A modern author might be biased towards the ancient religon , because of his own personal believes , and thus communicate a wrong image . 2 . An author who lived at the time this religion was in full practice , and believed in it , is more credible on speaking about it . 3 . As in modern days books are massively and easily produced , they are a way for someone to make money , and many people decide to write things that they do n't know of , or make up things using their own imagination , just in an attempt to gain money . 4 . At the ancient times where books were n't a product you would find in a market , but books were written by the hand of the author , usually by people who teached , to use them daily , someone would have to be determined to share his views , and he would n't do it for money . IMO the best would be to start from the beggining . Tell them of the creation story of Orpheus , and demystify it . How the Firstborn Eros , God of Love , created the world by injecting to it the Soul which is symbolized with a snake . Tell them of the Cosmic Egg of Orpheus that gave birth to the Universe , and how this creation story is proved by science , as according to modern science the matter of what now are the parts of the Universe , were once united parts of a single and whole piece of matter , that as most of the bodies of Space , had the shape of an Egg , that was splitted to multiple pieces with the 'Big Bang event . This initial egg-shaped body of matter was Orpheus 's Egg , and thus science proves his creation story . I believe that when they will discover that modern science sings along with Orpheus 's creation story , they will really get excited and asking for more . Next tell them about the Divine essence and nature of the Gods . Plutarch in 'On the nature of Gods ' and Iamblichus in 'On the Mysteries ' give quite good explanations about what kind of nature the Gods have . Next tell them of the nature of Human Soul . Its parts like Intellect and the Soul 's body made of Aether that has inside it Intellect , how a Soul gives a material body life , and where the Soul goes after death . Tell them of the reincarnation of their Souls , and how they will either drink the Water of Oblivion , or the Water of Memory before coming to their new lives . Then tell them about Love , how the Souls of Humans were splitted by Zeus at the Golden Age , and how Women and Men since then search for their soulmates . Then I would speak about Virtue and the ethics that lead Humans to become more like the Gods , so Heaven can accept them to stay there . Next , I would tell them about the sacrifices and divination practices . Processions , Sacrifices , praying , libating ... I would also speak about Oracles , and how Pythia was becoming a Medium for Apollo to speak through her mouth . I would also make sure to tell of Plato 's Cave allegory , which is quite an educational material , and explain it . Plato 's allegory speaks of the experience when a mortal living on the Material Realm , gets to the beafitic experience of 'seeing ' the Divine Realm , that some call 'Spiritual Realm ' , others 'Realm of Ideas ' , and others simply 'Heaven ' . In all truth the 'Cave Allegory ' speaks about the vision people have were they see themselves leaving the darkness often referred to as 'tunnel ' by some modern people , which is the 'Cave ' of the allegory , and seeing the Divine Light , which is the 'Sun ' of the allegory . This is a vision often people say they see when they have what is called a 'near death experience ' . And it was the main experience that people would get at the Eleusinian Mysteries , -without dying of course- which were honoring Demetra and her daughter , the Queen of the Underworld known as Persephone . Most of Plato 's allegories are symbolic , and are hiding the experiences Hellenists would experience at the sacred and mystic Mysteries . Because communicating the experiences of the Mysteries in public , to uninitiated people was forbidden , Plato provisioning somehow that the Mysteries would violently end , hide various apocryphal knowledge in his books , in such a way that pieces of his text would look innocent , but they would have multiple meanings , and interpretations . So an open mind with determination could discover and recognize the truths of the Mysteries , at a time when the Mysteries would have ceased , and all the people who had been initiated to them had died . Plato 's work aside from passing ethics of philosophy , also contain hidden pieces of apocryphal religious knowledge , and it is quite an important and thrilling historic event , that someone foresaw the 'Coming of Spiritual Darkness ' which we call 'Dark Ages ' , and hid the pieces of knowledge that would otherwise would be lost forever in seemingly innocent texts . That 's my opinions and suggestions . Good luck !",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Plutarch was a priest himself . A priest on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi . His writings are as 'official ' religious writings can get.We have the writings of a priest , who wrote about the religion he practiced and was a priest of . We modern people can do one of these three things : 1 . Educate ourselves about what credible people of that ancient religion did , and revive it . 2 . Not educate ourselves , but believe in an abstract way that some beings we know their names exist , and do whatever might come to our minds . 3 . Do n't do anything , and reject that religion completely . Of all the three , personally I think option 1 is better than 2 . If you think about it , all religions have some dogma . There might be different views on some subjects , and they might receive some different explanations , like how there are like 10 denominations of christianity . But even these denominations agree on some common beliefs . So is Hellenism . There is this book by Hesiod , who says Humans go to Hades and are judged and then sent to either Tartarus or the Elysian Fields . Then there is this other book of Orpheus , who says that there is Heaven , and the souls of humans go there for a short time , and then are sent back to reincarnate . There might be different views , but one who wants to say he is a believer of that ancient religion , has to believe in some of its beliefs , or else what is belief , and what is a religion ? My personal experience tells me that of the things I wrote , some if not all have to be true . Anyway believe what you want . I just wrote what I would do in his position .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Perhaps words are not literal but symbolic . But then someone would have to interpret them , and get to their meaning .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I think its both about what you believe and what you do . A religion has two parts : A set of beliefs , and the practices . Practicing without believing I think is 'empty ' , like acting . Thing is theology do makes sense . I mean if you take the creation story of Orpheus for example , which I wrote about in my previous message , and how similar his story about an Egg giving birth to the universe is , with the Big Bang theory . My point is that if through these books that you seem not interested to , are written ways of actual practicing too , and someone ( like me for example ) does these practices as they are written , and finds out that they actually work , would n't that mean that these practices are valued since they are working ? And since they do , would n't it be wise to think that the explanation of how and why these practices work , that is given by the author , are right ? To be honest , I have doubts if people who do stuff , not the way stuff is directed to be done , see any results . Have you seen results by the practices you are doing ? Did your divination , theurgy , that is not 'by the book ' brought results ? Did you got what you expected ? Because personally , following what is written on Iamblichus 's 'On the Mysteries ' , and using the Orphic hymns , along with the appropriate incense , I did had results . I did more like an experiment , to see for myself the validity of what was written , and believe me I got more than I asked for . Invocation worked . Please tell me of your experiences with the Divine . I 'm curious to learn what people who does n't follow what is written word by word , get out of doing various other practices . Have you had a wish asked to a God granted ? Have you felt the presence of a being ? Have you recieved visions ?",Greek,Greek

First of all I get very bad performance for its graphics , which means the game is n't optimized in a good way . Secondly , I hate the fact that when enemies appear , ( out of nowhere but anyway ) all doors get locked ! Why the F is this happening ? Not only it does n't make sense , it also does n't allow me to flee a battle or retreat back , or try to bypass and progress without fighting ... And the last thing is , repeatation . Enemy spawning areas become too predictible quite fast , and of all the different moves you have in the game to learn , there is a single one that is simply a so much better way to attack enemies that makes not only OP to all special moves , but also weapons . I 'm talking about the forward katana thrust with Ki energy that leeches enemy 's life . Anything else in comparison is so weak , I keep spamming this same attack indifinately .

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Here is the thing . I read the Septugiant version of the Old Testament , and the New Testament in the language it was written , ancient Greek . The word that is translated to English as `` Hell '' from the original Greek text , is the word `` Άδης '' , commonly known to English speakers as `` Hades '' . I think that by itself answers your question . You say that Jews were n't afraid of Hell , yet it seems to me that you are ignorant about some other stuff , like for example that the Jews did n't believed that God could possibly have a Son either , neither that God Himself could somehow materialize Himself as a human . Neither Jews believe in resurrection . What I believe should spark curiosity to people is that John speaks of the `` Abyss '' in Revealation , and about someone who is trapped there and will be freed at some point . That 's more interesting , as the only other religious text we have speaking of the Abyss , and describes it as a place were evil ones are jailed , is Hesiod 's Theogony , which is a pagan book .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"There are also Apocrypha books that are n't included in official Bibles . One of the Apocrypha is the book of Prophet Enoch . In it , he writes that Fallen Angels started having sex with humans and as a result hybrid angelohumans were given birth . Angelohumans were evil in nature , and started canibalizing humans . According to Enoch , the purpose of the Flood was n't to clean the Earth from 'corrupted humans ' , but from 'sinful abominations ' , meaning the Fallen Angel - Human hybrids .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"No , no polytheism . Wrong in translation , yes . In the original Hebrew text of the Old Testament , there is the word 'YHVH ' which in other languages is translated as 'LORD ' , and then there is the mysterious word `` ELOHIM '' . The Hebrew word 'ELOHIM ' has been replaced with a variety of words of different meanings in the other editions of the Bible . It has been translated as `` God '' , `` False Gods '' , `` God 's Workers '' , `` God 's Sons '' , `` Angels '' , etc . And that of course creates way too many confusions , especially if you decide to replace the different words with only one word . Mind you , that Elohim is plural . In Genesis it says `` Elohim said let us make Human '' . Many people wonder why God would say `` let us '' , and they are oblivious that the word written in the original text instead of 'God ' is plural . But if you decide to say that Elohim means `` God '' , then you will be even more surprized later down when you read also in Genesis that Elohim sinned to the Humans , and because of that YHVJ punished Elohim out of Heaven . Does that mean that God sinned to the Humans and then God punished Himself , throwing Himself off Heaven ? Of course not . Answers to all these questions are given in the Book of Enoch , that the Church officially classifies as 'Apocryphal ' , not being part of the main canon . What Enoch says , is that GOD created 2 kinds of Beings : Elohim , Angels , and then ordered Elohim to make Humans . Enoch says GOD did that , for the purpose of sharing the joy of creation with other beings , out of His good Heart . ( or Will ) In no way though `` Elohim '' are equal to GOD . Elohim are inferior to GOD . But after Adam and Eve left paradise , GOD ordered Elohim to 'watch over ' Humans , and take care of them . As time passed by , some people started worshipping Elohim as gods , and some Elohim liked it and accepted it , and then started sinning . So Elohim is also translated as 'fake gods ' at some parts of the Old Testament . So that was your answer . The other `` gods '' are n't really `` gods '' , meaning they are in no way close or similar to THE GOD , in power . GOD made the `` fake gods '' , as His Workers on Earth , to share the joy of creation with other beings .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Christians adopted some theological concepts and explanations that came from non-Christian people . Or should I say the Grecoroman civilization adopted Jesus and His teachings and tried to include him to believes they already had . Apostle Paul talked to them about Jesus , and was spreading the word of Jesus , and NOT of the old testament . Even Apostle Paul , a Semitic Hebrew , ex-Jew , turned Christian , approached Athenian polytheists , telling them `` While having a tour in your beautiful city , I realised that you are very pious men . And I discovered that you had a shrine `` To the Unknown God '' . That 's who I am going to tell you about today . '' Apostle Paul did n't tell anything about Jewish theology and religion to the Romans and Greeks , but instead presented Jesus as being `` part of what you already believe '' , and do n't forget that that 's is also a reason why the Jews of that time conspired against . Jesus was already too much for Jews to believe in , but having a Jew telling Gentiles that Jesus was a Gentile , was even more ' ... ' for them . There is a little ( big ) interesting fact that most people today are oblivious about : There was an ancient religion shared between Romans and Greeks , that talked about a Single Creator God , long before Jesus . The oldest texts we have about this religion come from Plato who lived in the 5th century BC . According to Platonism ( and even more Neoplatonism ) , there is One God , that has 3 seperate 'elements ' or 'sides ' . Some GrecoRomans took Jesus 's father as being the God of Plato . The ideas of a Holy Trinity , a Soul that leaves the body on death , and goes to a place called `` Heaven '' , existed before the birth of Jesus in the Grecoroman world , and many Grecoromans integrated Jesus to Plato 's religion .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,Probably yes .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I am a Christian myself , of the few who calls themselves that name and have read the Testament of Jesus . While there are some passages that make people believe that Jesus was the Messiah the Old Testament writes about , it is rather obvious in the New Testament , that Jesus would be seen as a rather radical , and unlikely to be who he claimed to be , to many Jews . He ignored many of the laws of the Jewish Law , and talked very harsh against the priests / rabbies of Judaism . He even calls them `` Generation of viper snakes '' , so its no wonder that the observant priests of Judaism , and many Jewish people rejected him . He was rather revolutionary against the religious establishment . What I want you to think now , based on what I wrote is this : What if Jesus decided to 'come ' on Earth today ? Not for the 'End of the World ' that Christians expect , but to act the same way he did back then . What would not Jewish , but the very Christian priests of today , think of , and say of , a man who would do and say what Jesus said back then ? I believe a modern Jesus would have the same fate , no matter the country he would be born at . Perhaps he would n't get crucified , as this has stopped , but he would be surely ridiculed , and maybe he would get lynched and beaten by crowds or gangs , or he would end up in jail . Imagine a Jesus that would hang along with sinners , today . A Jesus that would visit a Gay Bar to talk to the Gays , sit on a bench with prostitutes and drug dealers , and call the priests of the Christian Church `` venomous snakes '' , while everyone speaks about him that he makes miracles , and he gathers crowds following him everywhere he goes . All that while saying that religious traditions and practices we Christians do , like baptism , marriage , etc does n't matter any more . Would the Christian Churches today recognize someone like that as Jesus , or any other of the Holy People of the Testament ? No , they would n't . Even if some written things about him were coming true , they would ignore these things , because of everything else .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Here is a tip : If you are going to call ( conjure ) a God /dess , have a statue of him / her on the altar . It 's metaphysics . If you call a God , his spirit will use the statue as a body / container to be in the material world we are at . If there is no statue , the God might get inside YOU , and that could be frightening , especially if you are unready and unexperienced . That 's also btw the way Pythia , the popular pristess of Delphi told her oracles , be becoming a medium for Apollo to talk through her body and mouth .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Well here is what , what I understand by the word 'Hellenism ' as we use it today , is meaning `` religion of ancient greeks '' . The thing is that between greeks ( and others , romans , phrygians etc ) there had been many different religions that could be called 'denominations ' of some sort . I mean there were at least 2 large 'systems ' , that while each included the popular gods/esses , on thier ethical an even theological side were rather different . So there is the 'official ' religion of the temples , and then there is the 'underground ' and 'fringe ' religion of Orphism . Aside from these two main waves of spirituality , there were even more smaller cults , like Pythagoreans , and later on Platonists , Empedocleans ... But one common thing has been Cleansing of body and soul , before coming to touch with the divine , in mysteries and some ceremonies for example . Now while I know that white clothing was popular , I had n't heard or read about it being a rule of some sorts before . Regarding weapons , it is was definately a rule not to bring them inside temples . In fact I remember a story a little , about an outlaw who thought it was a good idea to get inside a temple so as to escape arrest , and the guards who could n't enter armed , decided to build him inside the temple , so they took bricks and built an extra wall , trapping the outlaw to his doom . Keys , rings , belts and purses are also new to me . Now regarding meat and sex , I 've read in some books of philosophers who wrote about religious stuff , that things like that were common for priests , and people that were to be initiated in Mysteries , and the purpose was to cleanse the body . I think perhaps it has to do with the official cult - orphic differentation . Orphists did n't ate meat at all , as they thought that animals too have souls , and that thus even killing animals was bad , as killing humans was also bad . Bad I 've read about lots of blood sacrifices of animals , and then feasting with them .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,ancientgreece,"If you are in the mood of reading , read Aristotle 's `` On the Athenian Constitution '' and right after that Plato 's 'Republic ' . Both lived in Athens , and Aristotle gives a raw telling of the political history that lead to democracy , and the various laws of it , while Plato 's book is a criticism to the political system . Here are some other pros : * There could be no tax money stealing by corrupted politicians . * The rich had as much power as the poor . * Parliamentarians were chosen with lots . Each citizen was allowed to take part in the lottery 2 times , for the shake of having the persons recycled , so a greater number of people could take part in decision making . Regarding the cons , you noted some quite good examples .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I seperate Jesus and his teachings from people who lived after Jesus and added their own sauce . I do n't follow whatever priests of the church said or might say , but I follow what JESUS said . Eventually , at the age of Late Antquity , many Christian priests were corrupted , because of the benefits that the Roman Empire offered to clergy of religions . The Roman state paid salaries to priests of recognized religions , and was building temples with public expenses . So some corrupted people , who had made their jobs to be priests , started seeing other religions as threats to their income . `` If the other religion becomes more popular we lose believers , and if nobody comes to the Church , the state will stop paying me my salary '' . Many who called themselves `` Christians '' did things against the teaching of Jesus , while at the same time they were saying they were doing these things in the name of Jesus . But they were hypocrits . We should n't condemn Jesus because of the defamation from some people that used him for their own , petty interests . Personally I come from Greece , where you can still see the rage of the angry 'Christian ' mobs against the pagan world , in all the ruined temples , like the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens : http : //www.mlahanas.de/Greece/Cities/Gouvas/ZeusTempleAthens1.jpg I recognize what you talk about , as I have learnt the history of this place I am living at ( Greece ) very well . Back in the late antiquity , there were militant mobs of Christians that were pretty much like today 's ISIL . They attacked pagans and destroyed their stuff . And although I believe in Jesus , I do not endorse the actions of these mobs , I believe that they sinned , went against Jesus 's rules , and even dared to throw the blaming of their sins to Him .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Thing is that there are some commonalities between ancient writings . The details are far off , but the essence of stories told in ancient ( by ancient I mean in the B.C . era ) 'divine ' literature , have some common concepts and are describing quite similar events . Let 's take the Flood for example . In Hebrew literature , we are told that God did the flood to kill the Nephelim , but Noah was informed beforehand , and made the Ark . In Greek literature , we are told that because Prometheus stole the Holy Fire of the Gods and gave it to humans , Zeus made the flood to drown the humans for recieving stolen property , but Prometheus told Deucalion beforhand about it , and Deucalion built his own ship . On the Epics of Gilgamesh from the Babylonians , you get a quite similar story ... In an ancient book , it is written that the Egyptians knew of at least 5 floods ... There is also the theme of humans being originally in a better state , a state 'close to the divine ' and then recieving a 'downfall ' , to reach their modern state . Christians say that the first state of humans was in Heavens , and that they were tricked by an angel who had turned to a snake . Hesiod says that the first humans where the 'Gold Race ' , a race of humans that lived hundreds of years , had no illnesses , and where as virtuous as the Gods , and that gradually humanity deteriorated to Silver , from Silver to Bronze , and from Bronze to the Iron status , which is the race of humans living today . So if someone compared ancient stories , from the Medditerrenean and Middle East , he would discover some common ideas about ancient 'divine ' history of humanity : # At first humans where in a better condition . # An entity higher than humans but less powerful than the Ultimate Deity , gave something to humans . # The Ultimate Deity punished both the less powerfull one and the humans . # The state of the human being worshenned . # There was a flood driven by the Ultimate Deity 's will for cleansing 'outlaws ' of the surface of Earth . ... Where all these leads us ? In my understanding , there were SOME things that happened in the ancient times . Details and names are different , but the essence of what is being written on these ancient stories , is the same . Was the name of the one who caused the Flood YHVH , Zeus , or Ammon Ra ? Was the flood because Angels made babies with humans , and gave birth to angelohuman beings that God did n't wanted them to exist , or was the cause of the flood that humans recieved the stolen properties of the Gods ? Where humans in the garden of Eden and close to God , or where they the Gold race which was close to God ? ... Details are different , but the core events of the stories told are the same told in the stories of nations of a particular general area , at a particular time period . I believe that the fact that there are so many common testimonies should have us concerned .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Plato 's stuff is rather unique and interesting . He practically wrote about his own complete theological / cosmological system , in a way that one can find in it many elements found elsewhere . The thing that alerted me and surprized me the most , was that in the book 'Timeaus ' in which he writes his own creation story , he writes about a single , Benevolant , Omnipotent Creator God , creating the Universe , the Olympians etc . Before reading that book , I used to think that the Greeks were silly people that were worshipping statues until Jesus came . I was kind of wandered why they never told me on school , or heard on the tv , about ancient Greek monotheistic belives . Now of course even Plato includes beings like Apollo and Zeus in his story , and calls them 'gods ' , albeit he states that these 'gods ' were weaker and of lesser nature than The God , who created everything . All this mystery made me research a bit more on the subject , and I discovered there quite a many conspiracy theorists theorizing stuff . Some say that the Creator of Plato is Yahweh , and that the 'Olympians ' where Angels , perhaps the same Angels Enoch writes about , that were placed to watch over humans , and eventually got to sexual relationships with humans ...

I just think that so many different , seperated peoples from each other , could n't all just decided randomly to speak and write down about quite similar events like that , without anything really happening . A deeper reading on ancient mythology , religions etc made me realise that while details may differ a lot , there are quite a few events where there are very striking similarities between tales from different peoples . There has to be something that happened , that led these very ancient people to write about certain things .",Greek,Greek

Since the early times , the Romans depicted Jesus with very specific features of Middle Eastern people , like Israelites , Syrians , Libyans etc . https : //thepocketscroll.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/chris-pantokrator.jpg https : //vatopaidi.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/christ1.jpg http : //1.bp.blogspot.com/-SY-Tj_CVNEU/UYKLwOeE61I/AAAAAAAAAFM/8L6wmLhySOk/s1600/gorgoyphkos.jpg",Greek,Greek

At my teen years I had a shocking experience , a vision , that frightened me , and I could n't make people understand when I talked to them about it . I was wandering if it was just a very weird and lively dream and something to forget about , or truly a vision . I started at some point wanting to learn more about what the various religions say about , in my journey searching for a religion that would tell me about what I saw , I had the hope that perhaps there would be some religion that in its believes I would recognize what I saw . In the end , and about 15 years later , I found Neoplatonism , and also the Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster describe my experience . What I lived and saw was what is called `` Henosis '' , that is seeing your soul flying to a Divine Light , and uniting with it . So this is how I started reading lots of ancient books . Plato , Proclus , Plotinus , Iamblichus ... But I do n't actively do theurgy .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,woahdude,"There are many places that had been over the surface of the sea and at some point got under it . Especially in the Mediterranean Sea . This Egyptian city , an ancient town near Delphi , the island of Samothrace , the island of Thera ... Thing is Greece and to an extent Egypt and Lybia , are sitting right at the point where the European and the African tectonic plates collide . At the edges of two tectonic plates of the Earth . And not only that , but the area of the Aegean Sea , and the peninsula of Greece and Balkans to an extent were formed too late . The whole land that is in this area today was under the water and rose up way after the dinosaurs . Which is also why you wo n't find dinosaurs there , but in the highest peaks of Greek mountains you will discover fossils of fish . Greece became a land through extremely violent ( Cataclysmic ) geological events like mega-earthquakes and mega-volcanoes . And this kind of geological activity kept going on until the time people had learn how to write and record history . What 's my point with all of this ? That the ancient Greeks and Mediterranean people in general , lived through a series of multiple catastrophic events like the submersion or surfacing of whole islands in just a few hours . Thera , Samothrace ... It was a usual thing to see whole parts of land exist one day and not in the other . And do n't forget a detail we read on Plato 's book , about what the Egyptian wise man tells to Solon : That there had been many deluges , each one making a genocide on Greeks , which made the remaining Greeks left have to start advancing the civilization all over again . He says for that reason Greeks were oblivious to their own history , but that the Egyptians knew of it all , because the deluges did n't affected them as badly . And it is an Egyptian who tells to Solon of the story of Atlantis . Greeks did n't knew of that event . So the point is , that since in this area cataclysmic phenomena where so usual , and since real history and science have proved that whole islands can be submerged or surface from the sea in short time , it is quite plausible that once there could really exist an island named Atlantis . Of course scientists will tell you its a myth , because the Egyptian priest says that the Atlantis event happened so many several thousands of years before what science believes was the point where humans became civilized and started building cities etc . Is the history of humans older than what today 's scientists think ? Or is it an over-exaggeration of the priest ? Or could the whole story be fake ? Well the fact is that it is possible for pieces of land to be submerged , and that it happened several times in Earth 's history . The part of the story questioned is the time that the event is said to happen . The missing evidence to prove the story real , is Atlantis itself .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,religion,"If you do some research in ancient myths of the people of the Mediterranean Sea , you will discover that they share common stories about large flood ( s ) . It is generally believed that myths are stories that trying to explain some true facts , that get distorted as people try to explain the facts with various imaginative theories . The Greeks for example believed that there was not just one , but 3 huge floods . The Egyptians believed on even more floods . Scientists have tried to find the truth if any behind these ancient stories of destruction by ancient people of the Mediterranean Sea , and came up with quite interesting results . They essentially acknowledged that some huge floods indeed happened in the area . But it 's not that simple . One of the huge floods happened when the natural wall that existed where today is Gibraltar that separated the Mediterranean with the Atlantic Ocean was destroyed possibly by an earthquake , that lead to a HUGE mass of water from the Atlantic instantly flow on the Mediterranean , that raised the Mediterranean Sea 's surface level several meters or yards above what it had been , probably drowning a huge percentage of the ancient Mediterranean People . What today is known as the Mediterranean Sea , was n't always a Sea.It became a Sea violently in a huge event of cataclysmic proportions.The problem with this event however , is that according to science it happened in an age so old that according to history humans were too primeval and uncivilized to record it . The second huge event of cataclysmic proportions was the eruption of the Thera mountain - volcano , the most powerful volcano eruption recorded in human history . Its blast was so hard and huge that its ashes traveled all around Earth , with scientist recovering ash samples from places like Iceland and the Americas , that are dated at the age the volcano erupted . The event was in orders of magnitude more powerful than the earthquakes that caused the tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia in 2011 and 2004 . The tsunami of Thera would have been gigantic , and ancient accounts say that it was responsible for the extinction of various Mediterranean civilizations , including the Minoans . This event took place somewhere between 1700 and 1600 B.C . It is probable that the story of the Bible regarding a huge flood is based on real events . Perhaps the real event was mixed with elements modern science calls 'supernatural ' , which are part of the religion , and there is also that theory that not everything the Bible says has a literal meaning , but instead that some stories are allegories / parables .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,religion,"If you are interested in learning more about it , please hear my advice : Do not trust random people on the internet about it . Because many distort things and present them in a different and wrong way . The best thing you could do to learn what Platonism is about , is go directly to the source , Plato , and read some of the books he wrote . But because Plato speaks with allegories / parables , you could read some of the Commentaries written by Proclus on Plato 's theology , to help you understand some things that are hard to understand the first time you read Plato 's book.My personal recommendation is to start with Plato 's book that has the title 'Timaeus ' . Plato wrote about many different things , not only theology and religious stuff . If you are interested in learning more , then I think this book will get you hooked and wanting to learn more ! It is a book that you could say is somehow equivalent to the Christian and Jewish 'Genesis ' , in the sense that it is about explaining how the Universe came to be , the spirits , souls , humans etc . Even if you do n't end up believing what it says , you will certainly learn and have evidence for some quite interesting truths like these : # There was the belief that the world originated from a single superior entity in the 'wester world ' and Greece in specific , at least 5 centuries before the birth of Jesus . # The ancient Greeks / Romans did n't worshipped statues or other idols as for some reason documentaries and even some school books say . # Plato writes that the matter of the Universe was originallly and in the beggining all concentrated in a single 'place ' and consisted of a full piece , and that later on , with the intervention of the Creator this piece of matter was split to smaller pieces and was stretched on Space creating the Universe with its galaxies , solar systems , planets etc . If you think about it , that is exactly what modern science says , except they drop of the `` Creator intervention '' part . Science says that in the beggining the matter of our Universe was united and consisted of a single piece , and that the 'Big Bang ' happened at some point that split the matter of the whole piece to many pieces , forming our Universe . Quite an interesting parallel , do n't you think ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,tellusofyourgods,"Answer me two things if you are in the mood 1 : since a spirit is in everything , and since a spirit is not a person and has no body , how can a spirit be male and another female ? Is n't it wrong to ascribe traits of physical mortal beings in non-physical , non-mortal ones ? 2 : Is the evil spirit the cause of evil in the human world , and if so , then how exactly ? Does it try to make people do evil with its intention , or does evil somehow emanates from this spirit and thus the emanation affects some people who become evil , meaning that the dark spirit is n't really trying to make people do evil but does so because of its nature ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I myself am a `` Hellenist '' following the theology of Plato and his successors such as Proclus , Plotinus etc . There are lots of this unfortunately misrepresented and misunderstood , and thus I ca n't write everything and with enough details , but I can give a short description about a few of the most important and popular misconceptions . # 1 We do not worship statues , or think that a god resides in them . The story of the statues is that at some point these magnificent beings called 'gods ' incarnated on the physical world , and we build 3d representations of them in order to remember how they looked like . The statues in the Grecoroman world act as reminders of how the entities looked like when they showed themselves to us , and not as objects to be worshipped . # 2 We do not sacrifice humans , neither it was done in the past , as the Christian Church lies about our religion . Truth is that if you kill someone , no matter the context , then you are commiting Hubris , and Hubris is something the gods punish humans for doing it . # 3 The beings called 'gods ' are not supposed to literaly live in Palaces in the actual mountain Olympus . They are spiritual beings and they do n't `` live '' somewhere , they instead `` exist '' everywhere . # 4 We believe that in the beggining there was only One , single deity , that was responsible for the creation of the world . We call this deity `` The One '' , and is superior to all the 'Olympian ' gods and other deities and beings . # 5 As a Platonist I do n't think that the world of matter is bad and evil as some say , confusing Platonism with Gnosticism . I believe that the One decided to build the Universe because of love and benevolance , and thus made Universe being Good , and Beautiful . The misconception comes from the fact that we believe that the 'world ' or 'realm ' where the One , the gods , and the human Souls go after death is Superior than the world of matter . But that does n't mean that the world of matter is evil on its own . # 6 We do n't think that 'Evil ' exists on its own and is its own thing , or that there is a primordial 'Evil ' entity that causes evil to the world of humans . We instead believe that Good and Evil is like Light and Darkness , literaly . That means that as Darkness itself is n't a THING , but a state , which is the state of Light not being present , thus Evil is n't its own thing , but the state of Good not being present . # 7 We do n't take all the myths as literal stories . But they have meanings to be interpreted , like allegories or parables . For example Orpheus said that the Universe was born out of the 'Cosmic Egg ' . That 'egg ' is n't to be thought as an ordinary chicken 's egg , but as a sphere that out of it the Universe came out . With modern scientific knowledge , we could say ( Personally I 'm convinced ) that this 'Egg ' was the single body that all of the matter of the Universe was part of , before the Big Bang . Science tells us that in the beggining all the matter of the Universe consisted of a single object , and that because of an explosion that single object broke to several pieces , and its pieces became stars , planets , comets etc.So the metaphorical 'egg ' Orpheus wrote about , was the initial single piece of matter that exist in our universe , that birthed the Universe . That was just a single interpretation of one part of the myths . By doing the same thing , one can find many parallels with science , and thus the myths , if interpreted correctly , do make sense .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"It does , because in the end no matter what is the content of the beliefs , a religion is a set of beliefs . A number of ideas sticked together . And if we were to force people to not be free to think and believe what they want , then that would be fascism . And if a fascist state started by doing that , and discriminated thoughts , who is to say what other thoughts would get discriminated and banned later on ? In a world of equality , freedom and democracy , citizens are allowed to believe whatever they want - what they are not allowed is to do actions that harm other people or the state . Now if people have some need , or many needs , which are expressed through a religion and its practice , then yes , religions still have a place in our society .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,I mean the first being that existed . There are more than one Deities involved in this beilief . To be more specific I refer to what is commonly known as `` The One '' .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"Hm . Perhaps . From what I know the belief is that in the begining there was `` The One '' , that spun a lesser child . The `` One '' addressed the child to build a world , but for bad reasons . So supposedly the One made this world to be an evil prison , but then the 'child ' went against `` The One '' , and promised humans to build a better world than the one it made as instructed by the One , so from the few things I know , they think that the 'child ' of One is good , and that the One is evil . That 's what Plotinus says they believe , and I 'd like to hear a Gnostic 's own comment on that . Plotinus was against this belief , because he said that what Gnostics understand as `` child '' of the One , is n't really a seperate entity than the One , but a part of the One , and that the One built the world we live in , because He is good and benevolant and loves us .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"From what I understand , Gnosticism takes beliefs and concepts of both Judaism and the ancient Greek pagan religion , and mixes them , telling its own story that is neither Greek paganism or Judaism . I do n't know if they accept Jesus in some fashion or not .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,I do n't really know . There might be .,Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"First let me tell you about the Greek word that in English is translated as 'Gods ' . It is the word `` θεοί '' ( theoi ) , and it derives from a verb that means `` I move fast '' . Thus literally the word that in English is translated as `` God '' , in Greek means `` fast mover '' . The One was the first being that created everything , and the most perfect . The 'Gods ' are different entities from the One , that the One created , with their own free choice and intellect . They are spiritual in their original form , but have the power to 'appear ' in the world of matter . The 'Fastmovers ' or 'Gods ' were given by the One the mission , to build the body of humans , and then the One gave their bodies Souls . Each 'God ' is responsible for something in our Universe , and controls some force , or way , or natural phenomenon , and as a whole 'Gods ' are to make sure that the Universe works the way the One wants it to work . They are not 'avatars ' of the One , like Krishna is an avatar and incarnation of Vishnu in Hinduism . Neither they fully resemble the 'Angels ' ( Malakim ) of Judaism , but one could draw some parallels between them and the ( Elohim ) , the way they are portrayed in the Book of Enoch . According to Enoch `` Elohim '' is not a way to call the One God in plural form , but they are many , and are seperate from God . Enoch writes that these where 'Servants of God ' with fiery bodies , that took material form at some point . Our 'Gods ' also are said to have done things like these . So you could see Zeus , Hera and the rest more as a parallel to 'Elohim ' , being entities made by God , who have missions and also free will , than trying to parallelize them , with God.Of course , at least the Christians as far as I know , do n't believe that what Enoch writes on his book is true , and believe that Elohim does n't exist as seperate beings from God , and that the word is plural out of respect .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I did n't chose the font myself , reddit picked it automatically , or I did it by accident . 1 ) As for the accusations , I have n't read that on a historical account of old , but I 'll you what . It is quite usual in Greek TV , for shows to have debates between people from different religions . Christians , Pagans , Muslims , Gnostics , whatever . It is a usual thing Christians say on TV against 'pagans ' that `` you sacrificed people ! `` , perhaps forgetting the crusades , inquisition etc . But the wild accusations are not a modern thing . They started some time after the Roman Empire announced Chirstianity as its official religion . Being the official religion of Rome , meant that the religion would be formed as a public service , and would be controlled by the State , and would be part of the State , and the priests would be public servants , paid large salaries from the State , and take part in politics . Since Constantine Rome turned to a Christian theocracy . Many priests got corrupted by the wealth and power , and started seeing believers as cash machines , instead of people to be served . As a result they saw non-Christians as dangerous people , who were bad for business , and they first started discriminating and preaching against non-Christian people , and at some point they decided to act a 'Final Solution ' against non-Christians . Especially during the reign of Emperor Theodosius , the priests fanatized their believers with lies , to drive them in a pogrom against non-Christians , and thousands of non-Christians were murdered , and is also the point of history where most of the ancient temples of Greece and Italy got ruined . The majority of the ruined pagan temples in these countries were n't ruined by natural disasters or so , but by religiously fanatic riots . 2 ) I mean the 'spiritual realm ' . It is a state of existence and being that we ca n't grasp with our body 's senses . Something like the 'Paradise'.But note that as Paradise is mostly portrayed , its a place where humans will be with physical bodies . We do n't believe that there will be bodies . But that there , will be our souls , and that a soul can be split from the physical body .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,ELINT,"While today I believe on something , there had been a time that I was n't a believer . I was born and raised a Christian . Unlike most Christians , who just say they are Christians and perhaps follow some festivals , I decided to read the bible . What I discovered was that the bible has so many contradictions that it could n't been taken seriously . The Old Testament contradicts the New Testament , the gospels of the New Testament contradict each other , and what I 've been promised from Christianity was n't happening . I was promised the power to move mountains if I believed in it , and I could n't . I was promised that if I prayed God would do me the favor I 'd ask , and God did n't did anything . Another thing I disliked was that I realised that among many 'priests ' there were people who secretly did n't even believed the religion , and just became priests because priests are paid good salaries . Religion has been hijacked by wealth lovers . People are doing and preaching things without believing on them , but for money and fame . That disgusted me and sent me away from the Church . While I have sympathy for Jesus , and I 'm sorry for what happened to him , and I consider him a good person , those who after his death claimed to be the teachers of his word , were corrupted and distorted things for their personal interests . So I stopped going to the church and considering myself a 'Christian ' , because if I called myself with that name , I would place myself along with all the others who have been doing such and such things , and I would be embarassed for that . On my journey to the truth , I read a few things about Islam , your religion . Please excuse me for what I am about to say , but to me it seems that Mohamed was just a man with thirst for power who presented himself as a prophet , only to convince other people join his battle , so he can win the wars , and gain personal wealth and fame . I 've read about Buddism , and while many of the things it says seem nice to me and good , I think it lacks many things , and leaves many things ananswered . I 've took a look on Hinduism , and I was alienated and scared by the images of some deities they have . Then I started reading about the ancient religions with the many gods . Greek , Persian , Arabic , Chaldean , Egyptian ... And I felt that they had more to tell me . Particularly the Chaldean and Greek . Today most books in schools and even documentaries on TV give a rather simplistic view on these religions and often lie about them , to make them look bad . But if one starts read about them from ancient sources , I believe he will get a better and more clear view that will surprise him . It is as if you always believed something inside you , you always had an idea or feeling or concept of how something is , but it was n't what the religion you 've been grown with was . And that made you feel that you are somehow 'wrong ' , and deviate , that you are not a good human because you have something inside you telling you what is good , and what the people around you tell you is that this is your mistake . And perhaps you might believe you are mistaken . You might believe what they tell you , that even if you follow the strictest code of the religion , you are still bad because something inside you does n't fit what the religion you are grown up with says , so that makes you personally feel bad , as if you are a bad person . But what happens if by chance or out of curiosity you pick one of the ancient books , that modern people say are myths and lies , and you discover in them that they talk about the exact same thing that you somehow knew and believed secretly with your thoughts , the same thing the others told you that is a mistake you done ? Then you start seeing why they 've been telling what they are telling , and how our world became what it is . Because lets speak the truth : Both Christianity and Islam were spread with the sword . Christianity had Constantine , and Theodosius and others doing wars , killing people , and forcing christianity , through the Roman Empires . Islam had Mohammed and Mehmed 2 ' spreading Islam with swords through the Arabic and Ottoman Empires . Call me however you want , but in my opinion I think that a God who is trying to get worshipped by killing whoever is not worshipping him , and starts wars , and tells his children to kill each other is n't a good and just God . The God I believe in is a God that if you worship him it will make him happy , but if you do n't , then he wo n't care . Not because he does n't care for humans , but because he has too many and far more serious and important things to care for . Have a nice day .",Greek,Greek

If for the Big Bang to happen there where like 1 in a billion chances , and out of it for our solar system to shape the way it is , with a Sun no having more mass so as to absorb all the planets or not so small to let all the other planets fly away , there was again 1 in a billionth chances , and for the Earth to have the right mass to not let the atmosphere leave , but not so much to not allow the birth of humans and other species , and being in the right distance from the Sun , so its not so close and hot to not allow life , or so far and cold , there where another 1 chance in a billion , then the collective instances where `` it just randomly happened '' for everything to happen the way it happened , are way to many , to the point that if these chances where true in a lottery game , you would call it fixed . There should have been humongous amounts of luck for everything to be the way it is just because of pure luck and randomness .

Perhaps a certain number of big banks belong to Jewish people , but that does n't mean that the average Jew is an owner of a bank , or that the banks that are ran by Jews are giving away money for free to Jewish people . I know Jewish people who are poor , and none of them gets any 'payment ' from some bank just because he is a Jew . Banks are not social services that take money from the rest to hand them over to agerave Jewish people . Banks are private businesses that only care to grow and does n't take in to account things such as nationalities , or religions etc , they just want to make more money . Yet the foolish man attributes the doings of a few elite ultra-rich men to a whole nation , instead of condemning the rich men themselves . As if to say that because Germans once had Hitler , all Germans ever are nazis . That is n't true . And the exact same way it is n't true that all Jews are bankers .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Ahh ... I often take a look at some sites that have lists of ancient celebrations , and if one is close to the day I look , I write it a note about it . Mostly , these are celebrations of ancient Athens . I myself live in modern day Athens . If there is a special day about a deity , perhaps I might do something . For example , at the 7th of Boedromion ( 15th of September ) ancient Athenians celebrated Artemis.At that day I visited the area where the ancient temple of Artemis Agrotera is located . Unfortunately I could n't get at the temple itself because the area is barred . ( the government is not willing to pay security guards for it , but neither it wants people to get near because they fear of antiquity stealers , so they just block the way to everybody ) But that also meant that there would n't be tourists or other visitors . So I went close , and some ancient sculpted rocks where approachable . It would be more ideal if I were sacrifing some animal , but I only had some fruits . So I went there and placed them upon the rocks . Then I took out of my pocket a notepad that I had written the Orphic hymn to Artemis there . So I sung the hymn . Some guy was passing by at that time and looked at me with a strange look.Then I made a libation with some water . I felt something inside me . My mind got some images out of nowhere . I saw that the archeologists in Amphipolis discovered a treasure with gold artifacts and others . That what archeologists are digging in Amphipolis is n't a tomb - grave to a dead person , but rather another temple to Artemis . Since that day I 've been curious to see what they will find as they keep digging deeper into the hill . I 've been following the news with anxiety .

Alithinos,religion,"You remind me of myself some years ago . The first thing that seemed to me closer to how I felt inside me about God , was closer to the believes of Quakers , than that of the Orthodox Christianity , which I grown with . Yet I ended up myself in Platonism - Neoplatonism . The reason I started believing in this theology is because several years after I had envisioned a very 'weird ' dream , I read about the Neoplatonic beliefs , and I had this weird feeling of surprize one feels , when he reads in a book a very detailed analysis of things and concepts he saw in his own dream . Perhaps if I knew what the theology of Plato and his successors before seeing what I thought was a 'dream ' , I would believe that it was just my own imagination , my brain playing me tricks . But seeing what I saw before even knowing that Neo-platonism existed , and discovering about 10 years later that what I had seen was supposedly a beafitic vision that many other people had seen too in the antiquity and wrote books about it , made me invest time in studying the theology started by Plato , and much to my surprize , it seems to make sense . In the believes of Platonic & amp ; Neoplatonic theology , the Universe and everything in it derived from the One . The One is not a 'god ' like the 'gods ' that go by the names Zeus or Hera , and the One is n't even a 'God ' like that of Christianity , who is depicted as an old guy with a white beard . According to Platonism , the Creator of the Universe was a single being called `` The One '' , that consisted of three parts : Aither ( Divine Essence ) Nous ( Intelligence ) World Soul ( A fiery spiritual substance that is included on everything in the Universe ) According to Platonism , the Soul of a human originates from the World of Souls , also known as `` The Realm of Ideas '' , which is said that The One , and the gods such as Zeus etc , exist on . The Soul falls from Heaven if it wills the pleasures of the material world , and thus it materializes on Earth . Since that , the Soul gets trapped in a long circle of reincarnating in the material world , and to escape the material world and live forever in the Heavens , one would have to live his life ignoring material wealth and pleasures , and excercizing and perfecting the attributes of his or her divine part , the Soul . The Soul is said to appear on visions as a fiery , pulsing energy that carries the Intelligence of an individual person and is what makes the human body 'alive ' . When a human dies and he could n't avoid being dragged on by the material pleasures , then his or her Soul drinks the water of Oblivion , forgets everything , and joins the material world in a new body . If a human dies , and he followed the way of life suggested by the belief system , then his Soul wo n't drink the water of Oblivion , but the water of Memory instead , and will come back to a new body , but will keep all the memories from the last time it lived , and if a human manages to live rightfully for 3 lives , he releases his soul from the trap , and gets to live on Heaven , along with the gods , and the One .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"My first build was with a cheap & amp ; small budget case . It was back before my ascencion when I still had an xbox360 that as a peasant I bought in its first year of release . 3 RRODs later , I was out of warranty and Microsoft would n't fix it for free , and I could n't eat that I would have to buy another one only 2 years after I handed out 400 $ for it . Instead I bought a 150 $ graphics card ( Ati HD 4850 ) for my PC , that was considerably more powerful than an xbox360 . Unfortunately though , the case was so tight it could n't fit the card inside . So I had to buy a new case , and I decided to not cheap out this time . I bought a Coolermaster 690 , that costed 3 times the money of the old case . As I tried to unscrew the components from my old budget case to install them later on the new Coolermaster , guess what happened ? The screws supplied with the case were so soft , that the screwdriver instead of turning them cut its metal , and they were destroyed as they could n't be turned anymore , with my hard drive and optical drives trapped inside ! : O I had to violate the chassis with extremely violent force to break the HDD/optical drive cages , I even cut myself doing it , just to free my components from the budget low-end case . I 'm lucky my components did n't break that day . From that time and on an idea was solidified on my brain : I would never buy a 'budget ' PC case again . Thank God there is Coolermaster . Except from build quality though , there more things one benefits from , from a more expensive / better case . CM690 can take any graphics card I have been interested at , it also had space for the 212 EVO cpu cooler , its tool-free design makes it easier ... It have been supporting of most of the upgrades and new needs I have had since I bought it .

Before doing so , since I was on AMD 's AM3 motherboard I could have bought the 6-core Phenom II cpu . But I once more made the mistake and followed the instructions from some dudes in the internet saying `` games wo n't use more than 4 cores , do n't buy the 6core '' . Here we are,3 years after they told me to not get a 6core , and Crysis 3 , along with Far Cry and the new Battlefield already can use more cores than that .

In the center is the God who created the Universe , the First that existed ever . Next to the circle where the One God is , are smaller weaker 'gods ' like Zeus and Hera . At a ring even further from the circle and next to the gods are the Archangels . Further away are the Angels . Even further are Demons.Further are Archons . And in the end , at the most outter ring , are the Souls of Humans . The Soul of a human might 'fall ' from heaven , and come to a child that is to be born , and thus is born on this world . But the Demons are from this Heaven already . That does n't mean they are 'good ' or 'evil ' . It is said that some of them are good , and others are evil . A demon might indirectly makes his presence sensible and communicate with humans in the mortal and material world , but they do n't fully come in their full form or power . They ca n't have a body of their own , so they get in the mind of someone else who has a body . Thats how some people get 'demonized ' . But it is said that the demons do n't get to any person .

Alithinos,Archeology,"What makes me wonder is that none of the `` specialists '' who make statements about what this `` tomb '' is , have talked about a clue , as if they are all oblivious to its existence . The book `` Anthologia Graeca '' contains a poem from `` Antipatrus Thessalniceus '' who lived in the 1st century A.D. written for Amphipolis . In this poem he states that during his time Amphipolis is deserted and that nothing has been left standing , other than `` the temple of the Lady of Braurona and Ethopia '' . Meaning that if this poet is to be taken seriously , then what archeologists have found has to be a temple to a goddess . Of course subterranean temples are very unusuall in the Greek world . The only few that are known were the Necromanteia where necromancy took place , and the temple where the Eleusinian Mysteries took place in Eleusina .

Hronos on the other hand is Time itself , said to have existed long before Kronos , or Kronos 's mother Earth , before our Solar System even .

And the general economic shape of our country have made us change our habits to an extent , which affects culture .

Going every saturday night a night club and staying outside , getting drunk , until dawn next morning . Now we do n't go outside that much . In general , we 've been focusing on enjoying the simple , little good things in life . Now you may discover , that the Greek people are a complex people .

From the internet I kind of get the impression that Americans get offended too easily with stuff like jokes for example ( body features related jokes , nationality jokes , religious jokes etc ) .

A 'bad ' habit of modern Greeks is to use the names of important people of our history , mostly our ancient ancestors for the shake of bragging about it , while being ignorant about what these ancient people did and said , which made them great in the first place . You might hear somebody saying stuff like `` We have Socrates , we have Pericles , we have Alexander ! We did so many things for the world ! `` , and if you ask him about Socrates , he will know nothing about his life and work . A common viewpoint between Greeks is that all politicians are liers , corrupted , and thieves , and the word 'politician ' has negative energy here , sometimes it can be used as a slur . The Greek does n't vote the party that agrees with , or the party he thinks is the best among the political parties , but the party he believes is the least bad , and will do the least damage of all the others .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,paganism,"Hello ! I 've did some my own research and I discovered that there is n't a single thing such as the one and only `` Ancient Greek Religion '' , but that there is actually a number of religions believed by ancient Greeks , with some of them believing quite different stuff . And if someone does n't know that , that person might get easily confused as it reads incompatible stories and believes that happen to belong to a different ancient Greek religion . It seems most people who are in to Hellenic polytheism today are following the Iliad and the Oddyssey as canon . But there is also another path , like for example Orphism . And Plato takes clues from Orphism and comes up with a heresy , that includes a single `` Creator '' Yahweh style , stating that gods such as Zeus , Hera etc are inferior to the Creator and serve him . And at an ancient Greek book that I read , I found out that the people that the ancient Greeks considered ancients , had yet another religion , in which they only worshipped the Sun - Father , the Earth - Mother , and the Moon . So my question is , do you follow one of those paths specifically , or are you still in the process of learning more ? And why do you think most people that become Hellenists tend to stick to what is the popular of all the different paths , and there are n't as much Orphicists for example , today ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"If you still have beliefs from Christianity that you ca n't let go as you say , because you find that there is some truth in Christianity , but also that it leaves quite many questions unanswered , and you do n't like the church and clerics in particular , and at the same time you have something telling you that there is some truth in Hellenism too , then I believe I can direct you to a number of sources , that will answer some basic questions you may have . Here is what : You probably never knew it , but there is a religion that not only acknowledges that the universe was created by a single all-powerful , ever living , kind , good , God , but also that the gods such as Apollo , Dionysus , Zeus etc also exist . You probably think I 'm kidding you . But I 'm not . The spiritual path I 'm talking about is called Platonism , because well , the first who wrote about this was Plato . A good starter for the spiritual and mystical side of Plato 's works is the book 'Timeaus ' . There is also a series of book written by a later philosopher called 'Proclus ' , which is called `` The theology of Plato '' , and Proclus writes down everything in an extremely detailed fashion . The work of Proclus speaks about the nature of the Creator , the Gods , the Archangels , the Angels , the Demons , the Heroes , and Humans ... For some reason even the existence of that path is being kept secret . Even on theology classes they do n't talk about it .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I 'm more inclined to the Orphic viewpoint of death . Orphicism was a less popular religion shared by some Greeks and the Thracians , that went side by side of what I could call `` Popular Hellenism '' . According to Orphicism , there is no such a thing as Tartarus and Elysian fields . Instead , there is only Earth and Heaven . And when you die , your soul transcends to the Heaven , and there it is judged . If you lived life as a good person ( Orphics had some particular ethics ) , you would earn the right to stay on Heaven and exist there . If you were n't a good person , you 'd be sent down on Earth again to live another life in another body , after your intellect was formatted so the memories of the previous life are removed . So basically Orphics believed in reincarnation , and specifically that living a life on the material world is a consequence of the Soul making mistakes . Whenever a child was born , the Orphics would wear black , gather above it and lament , because yet another Soul dropped out of Heaven , and would have to endure the hardships of the material world . And when somebody died , the Orphics would celebrate , because they would hope that the person would go to Heaven and stay there , and thus its punishment on Earth would stop . Way extraordinary views , do n't you think ?",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Thing is Greeks who believe in Hellenism has a certain kind of viewpoint as ... You have to visit Greece to feel it . Every mountain , river , lake , and sea has its legend / myth . The country is like a big mythology ( Hellenic actually ) theme park . So you go at Acropolis in Athens and you think `` thats were Athena competed with Poseidon for the city '' , you get like 1000 meters away and you pass by Artemis 's temple , which according to legend it was built on the hunting ground of Artemis . The connection to the past comes off as something these people want to do , because they think that today 's world is worse than it used to be . Now Hellenism as a religion is perhaps the most inclusive religion of all . Yes you are welcome if you are Briton . Also if you are African or Asian . And you are also welcome if you are homosexual . Regarding homosexuality specifically Hellenism is the only one that touches it and considers it normal . ( After all its Eros who decides who you will fall in love with , and that explains love for the other sex . ) Here is an example regarding inclusivity of Hellenism : if you read the New Testament of the Christians , and in particular the gospel of Mark , in the original ancient Greek text , then you will find this line : `` Ελληνίδα εξ Συρίας γυνή '' . At english versions it is either translated as `` Greek woman from Syria '' , or `` Gentile Syrian woman '' . The word translated as Greek or Gentile is 'Ελληνίδα ' , and it means female Hellenist . There is a confusion because the name Hellene was used in the same way the name Jew is being used today , both for describing the name of a nation , and also for describing the name of a religion . So , even the Christian gospel proves that Hellenism is inclusive , and you are welcome . Actually , if you think about it , the people that we call 'Greeks ' were different people . I mean they werent initially a nation , but different tribes of people , with different body features and characteristics , and what made them all 'Greeks ' or 'Hellenes ' as Greeks call ourselves , was a ) The Hellenic religion , and B ) The Greek language . I 'm far out of topic now and I 'm sorry , but as the name creates confusion I feel the need to explain what 's in a name , to help people understand better . The word `` Greek '' which with the West calls the people who call each other 'Hellenes ' , originally was the name of only a single tribe of the Hellenic people . In the same fashion , the people of the East calls us 'Yonan , Yunan , Yawan , etc ' which comes out from 'Ionian ' which was yet just a single tribe out of the many . But we do n't still live in tribes ... Anyway , TL : DR ; You are welcome ! Acknowledging the existence of existing entities and adopting ideas is n't a bad thing in any way , neither it should be exclusive to only people of a very certain background .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,Neoplatonism,"While I was teen I had an experience that I would describe back then as a rather alive , awkward , weird dream . So strange I even felt shy of sharing it with others . What I saw in that dream was Henosis . That I died , and I got out of my body as a rumbling light / energy , and I started heading upwards with too fast speed , until I reached a Huge Light , and I became One with it . Since then I 've been reading about religions to find ANYTHING coming even close to describing such an experience . But even though I researched ( did n't had internet when I was teen ) I did n't even met the term Neoplatonism , as it was hidden from everything I read regarding such stuff . Eventually I got over it , and thought that it was just a strange dream with no purpose ... And I continued living life . But at some point I felt an urge to start reading about ancient Greek philosophy . I got a book of Proclus on my hands and ... Well there I was , reading on an ancient book a rather detailed explanation of what I until then thought it was a unique personal experience , and very awkward at that . Yet there was a man that not only had lived the same experience and knew it , but he had also wrote a book about the things 'seen ' in the experience . When I made that realization I felt a unique , never before felt strong feeling . For me Neoplatonism is n't something interesting that I imagine about or wonder if it could be true . For me it is giving a name to what I myself experienced . What I have to say is that it would be better to stick with Plotinus 's suggestion to not deal with rituals and magic . I 've made a mistake . You see as a 'reasonable ' man that I am , I still had doubts , and I thought of clearing them out by experimenting , and to experiment by doing rituals such as invocation . Do n't try this at home .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,occult,"Neo-platonist here , and it 's the first time I meet the term 'Chaos Magick ' . I only want to add 2 comments : 1 ) Neoplatonism is n't `` new age '' , its actually rather `` old age '' . As itself is an evolution of Platonism , and Platonism is an evolution of Orphicism / Mystery cults , and Orpheus is said to have lived somewhere between 1500 B.C . to 1200 B.C . 2 ) If you are in to REAL magic , be careful and do n't be hasty to try things out . I 'd advise you to spend years researching , reading books , speaking with initiated people etc before even attempting to do anything serious .

Alithinos,occult,"If you are a true Illuminati , then show us a picture with your cape and decorations .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,occult,"'Occult ' as DecadentEx said , simply means hidden or secretive . Usually occult contains a set of information that is not publicly available , widespread . There is a number of reasons of why this kind of information is secretive . One of them , the most important , is that not all people are ready to get to know that kind of information . Because most people are quick to jump to conclusions and make assumptions and lazy enough to spend enough time to properly understand some things . So to avoid misunderstandings out of people 's ignorance , some pieces of knowledge is better to be passed on on few individuals , who are ready for it . That of course has a negative side , that people again because of their ignorance might assume a variety of things about what 's going on , and often assume negative theories . Now , there isnt a single 'occult ' out there , its a general characteristic term applied to many traditions , of many groups , with different viewpoints , different pieces of information , different ways , etc ... For example where I come from , there is n't some Divine limit in every person to only do a certain thing , get in a certain profession . The Lord may have a mission for a person , but extremely rarely a random person will be given a mission , and even if the Lord gives that person a mission , the person still has the free will to deny . And when the Lord gives a mission , he is pretty clear on what it is to be done . But such missions are n't given easily . And when you are given such a mission , you also get a unique name , by Him , because every single entity that exists has its unique name , which is secret . So if He decides to give you a mission , you will know it .",Greek,Greek

A thing that I do n't understand is when some websites take it too seriously and say that they want to empower women , and on the other hand they have stuff like dressing men with women 's clothes , and having men penetrated with dildos . I mean if the couple likes such activities , sure go on and have fun ! But how is it empowering women to fuck a man with a plastic penis ? That is attributing power to the penis , something that the woman lacks , so subconsciously that would n't empower a woman , but make her feel less powerful because she does n't have a real one . See ? My love / respect for women goes beyond sexual related activities . So I think things .

Alithinos,hardware,"Intel has an architecture that makes it so a Intel cpu with the same amount of frequency as an AMD cpu , is faster than the AMD cpu . But AMD added more cores to its cpus .

But if a program can use up to 8 cores and you have an 8 core AMD cpu , and on the other hand a 4 core Intel cpu , you might see the AMD cpu being faster . Because while each intel core is slower than an AMD core , if you add up the processing power of 8 slower cores , they might be faster than 4 faster cores , because the performance of all 8 cores pile up .",Greek,Greek

Instead of adding more cores , they only added more integer units .

And it seems that Apollonius who is writing in a 'serious ' style , notices that 'some people say that ... and some other people say that ... ' . So in his writing he makes it clear that at his time there had been conflicting versions of the story . Now was Medusa born a 'monster ' or was she turned to one later on ? If she was turned into a monster and were n't born , was she really a priestess of Athena ? And if she had sex with Poseidon , did she wanted it or not ? I guess these questions ca n't be answered .

I have like 20 ancient books in my collection of actual physical books , and I 've read about as much other books online . Regarding a mentor , well there was this practiced thing , at least in the ancient times . More specifically , there were rituals of initiation . Some things were told by a priest-ess and could be talked casualy , other things were only unveiled at mysteries , that the initiates had to pass through long preperations to take part in . Nowdays though because we are too rare , its not unusual for people to go on and do things on their own . Thing is that at least according to my own personal opinion , its really harsh to know all there is to know and fully understand .

But it would be so much easier and faster for someone to understand by having someone who knows all that stuff and conversating with that person , than reading through thousands of pages . Because its like a large puzzle image , and with each book you kind of get yet another piece of the puzzle . Note that I do n't talk about simple stuff like 'Here is how to make a libation ' or 'Here is how two of you can get married ' . But about stuff like understanding the meaning of various stories that are hidden behind allegories and metaphors , and high metaphysics , etc . So that 's for now . I 'm going to write a comment with some holidays , crystals , invocations etc at some other time , when I will have the time and mind to open books and search for pages and write down to you the details . So goodnight .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"As I said in the previous post , it depends on what you call 'magic ' . What personally I call 'magick ' is the actions a human can do to have a specified effect / result on this world , by means not acceptable through official science , or should I say with the aid of supermundane entity/ies . Yet still its not just 'saying ' as a prayer . There is a number of ways that can work , and usually you invoke some entity following a ritual with an etiquette that besides speaking also includes other actions such as offering something perhaps to the one you invoke and ask something from . But as with every religion , there is a way in Hellenism too to ask things from the superior entity/s . As for a distinction , well the traditional distinction that I know of is between faith and practice . Doing something , like a prayer , an invocation , a libation etc , is different from having a faith and believing it as one is a mental process and the other a physical . There had been one philosoper , Plotinus , who said that believing is enough and there is no need for rituals , but that was just a path of the number of paths . My guess is that modern Hellenists does n't like the word 'magic ' and do n't want to be associated with it , because of the energy it has in our modern world . Because the first thing that comes to someone 's mind when he or she listens 'magic ' is perhaps Harry Potter , or something similar , and well , actual 'magic ' the way I mean it , is nothing like that . Aside from that , Hellenism is very sensitive when it comes to things the Christians consider 'bad ' . I mean there had been pogroms and genocides during the Roman times of Hellenists , and Hellenists were persecuted by Christians kind of how Islamic State persecutes non-Islamists today in the Middle East . But modern Hellenism is n't about bunch of people who just want to rebel against Christians and compete with them . So you said about Wicca in another post , what 's Wicca ? Its members call themselves 'witches ' and 'wizards ' and they say the worship some unfaced goddess and a generalized 'horned god ' , and lets be honest : Its just a made up thing to troll Christians . But we are no willing to troll them or compete with them , we just want to do what we feel and know of doing , and we try to not be controversial or offend them , because first of all we do n't care what they do , and secondly , we have been persecuted by them and its not a small thing . We just want to be seen as serious fellas that are harmless , to keep our calmness and sanity . So you might hear someone say `` no we do n't do magic ' , and there can be lots of reasons behind that statement . The word has so much negativity , and we do n't want to be associated either with what the average person considers to be 'magic ' and 'magic users ' . Let alone the fact that one has to be carefull when it comes to such practices , so even if we were doing 'magic ' , we would n't just say 'yes we do it , go ahead and do some you too ' , because that would be an irresponsible thing to do .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Depends on what you call 'magic ' . If invoking higher entities and asking them things , or letting one get in you and talk through you , or necromancy are part of what you call 'magic ' , then Hellenism has all of that . The Oracle of Delphi , a priestess with the title Pythia ( google it ) was letting herself become a medium for Apollo to talk through her , according to Plutarch . Plus , in Greece there had been Necromanteia . Temples of necromancy . Plus the word -mancy comes from manteia , which is a newer version of the word mania , and mania in ancient Greek was uniting yourself with the Divine , ie divination . And if you read Orphica , which are 'holy texts ' of a certain Hellenic tradition , that of Orphicism , that was seen as fringe by 'orthodox ' Hellenists , then you will discover that they are like parts of a grimoire . In Orphica you will find written things like what are the stones that have powers and how to make gem talismans , how to invoke certain Gods or Spirits etc . But magic according to Hellenism is nothing about willpower . The human has no super powers , but it 's the Gods or Daemons who may or may not do things a human did a ritual to ask them for . And one has to be ultra careful before attempting such a thing . When you do a ritual you open a gate , and who knows what might come out of it . And there is punishment if you do something 'bad ' here too . Remind yourself of the Iliad . Agamemnon did a spell to win the Trojan war , and he sacrificed his daughter for that . But murder is a a sin , ( sorry , I mean Hubris : P ) so he might have got what he asked for , as he won the war , but he did n't had the time to get pleasure from it , as he was immidately killed by his wife when he returned , and that was an act of divine retribution ( Nemesis ) . But all this is just one side of the coin , there is also another . You see , ancient Greece was a place and a time were there had been people believing different things , and preaching different things . For example if you read the 'Golden Verses of Pythagoras ' , he gives a teaching that says no to magic , and that one will reach the maximum he or she can , through a lifestyle more akin to Buddist monks or Hermits . He says that being a pacifist peacemaker is more divinating than any hocus pocus and incense . There are really lots of paths one can take .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,occult,"That ( too ) reminded me of the cave allegory . A sad truth everyone who seeks enlightment , and one who gets it will realise , and its good to know prior , to be prepared . Have a watch : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=UQfRdl3GTw4 Its natural to want to share , and its natural to get negative reactions by the `` prisoners '' . Warning , its easy to get depressed once you have learnt so many things and thus realised the true potential of humanity , and noticed that humanity does n't even want to know what 's better for it , because in the end people are to lazy to think . To help them understand and realise , they will have to think , and mainstream people tend to spend their time with activities that require as less thinking as possible , like watching a football match . I 've passed through the state were you boldly and simply talk to people about things that they are not ready to accept because of their disbelief and / or even enviness . And I changed my way of approach so as to not directly speak about the 'hot ' stuff , but reach to that through conversation that is about more mundane , material things . Yet when people realise that even when you are to talk to them about things absolutely plausible according to their own limited understanding of existence that yet require from their part to put their brain in use , they usually avoid getting into such discussions . Because there is a mental illness that is so widespread and common that people do n't even recognize it as an illness and consider it a healthy natural state . And that illness I write about is to attribute way much more importance to unimportant things than they deserve , and focusing on such unimportant things , while ignoring and avoiding the really important .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"I love games made from Bethesda game studios , both the 3d Fallouts , and the Elder Scrolls series . I 've also spent some time learning how to mod , and made 2-3 mods for Skyrim , even though they never became popular . I 'm an introvert person and I do n't have many friends , so I have a lot of time that I stay alone , and that brings depression . Because if you have nothing to do , your mind thinks of a number of issues that make you sad . And I love playing large immersive games because getting immersed in their worlds I kind of forget my issues , it helps me feel better by occupying my mind with thoughts about the game 's world etc , instead of the misery of my life . I used to play games a lot , and I always bought original copies because I do n't feel right to pirate . And unfortunately , my country ( Greece ) has had to apply a series of austerity measures that shrunk the income of people . So these days I can only spend up to 20 euros to buy a game , and unfortunately all good new games , like Fallout 4 cost 60 euros . That 's 3 days worth of work where I am currently . Too much . : ( So for like a year and maybe another half I 'm limited to be buying and playing either small indie games , or very old AAA games , from the 90s and early 2000s , because new games rarely get a significant discount during Steam sales that would allow me to buy them . So I feel like I 'm left behind when it comes to gaming , I am missing so many good games that come out these days , and I have no idea when I will get to play them . : ( Does my psychological issues and bad economic position make me deserve the giveaway ? I do n't really know . Only thing I know is that I 'm as excited for this game as every Bethesda fan is , and that if I do n't get it that way , I 'll probably have to wait many years until I will get to play it . Now as for my gaming history ... I started out gaming as a Nintendo peasant , with a NES . Then I took a SNES , then a N64 , a Dreamcast , an original XBOX , a Gamecube , and my last console was an xbox360 that died 3 times to me with RROD , and the last time was out of warranty , and that made me so furious I decided to end console gaming . I felt like if I had thrown 400 euros that I spent for the console and another 600 for games in these two years in a trashbin . I felt a sucker and I was angered because of that . I was already disatisfied by Nintendo for staying back in the graphics department with the Wii , focusing more on casual gamers , and lacking innovative ideas and thus rehashing the same old shit , and I never really liked the Playstations . Some time after I had took my decision to stop playing video games , as I was disappointed that much from the console realm , and my immature mind had no idea about PC gaming , I decided to take a look out of curiosity on the system requirements of PC games back then , in 2008 . And much to my surprize , I found out that the only thing the computer I had was missing to be able to play games that were modern at that era , was a graphics card . So I saved some money and took one , and thus I started getting myself familiar with the world of PC gaming ! What a revealation . My first games on PC were STALKER : Clear Sky , Crysis , and Oblivion . Not only games looked better on PC , but I could also buy them for less money , and they also had more customization options , and many of them had mods which were awesome and allowed me to do many more interesting things , and there was a community ready to help me ! PC gaming won me after I tasted it , and since then I realised that PC gaming is better than console gaming , and that PC would be my first and primary gaming platform from then and on ! The only thing I missed is some exclusive Nintendo games out of nostalgia , but overall PC is superior than any console . I wish I 'd earn Fallout 4 , but even if I do n't , thank you for doing the good deed and giving away a copy . Also thank you for reading this comment .

My impression is that Americans , at least most of them , do n't really care that much about politics . 2 . Believe me , Greeks judge people based on their looks way more than Americans do . More often than not your looks are going to be a major factor when you are looking for a job , and do n't expect a sexual relationship if you are not a frequent gym goer . 3 . There is a widespread belief among Greek women that the only possible reason for a man to talk to them is to have sex with them . With that in mind its too hard to make friends people of the other sex , often its hard to even start a conversation in many cases . 4 .

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Greece had a long running PC gaming magazine that existed almost 30 years . It 's name was 'PC Master ' long before Yatzee made the 'PC Master Race ' meme .

PC Master , a gaming magazine exclusively for PC , outlasted all other local gaming magazines , but unfortunately it died 2 months ago . When news were spread that this historic magazine that existed from the late 80s died , people that worked on it decided to start their own online magazine as a spiritual successor to PC Master . Local PC gamers are just too romantic to live without a magazine of some shorts exclusively for PC gaming , existing .

Judaea in particular had a 'problem ' with that , in that many Jews were even adopting Greek names , way of life and customes , and were losing their connection to their past . The Jewish festival of Hanukkah celebrates the survival and victory of the Jewish tradition over the foreign Greek lifestyle and culture , but even after the revolt , a number of Jews kept adopting the lifestyle because they wanted so . Note that it was n't just the Judaeans that were adopting Greek lifestyle and language and names , but also Syrians , Egyptians , etc .

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"a heavily story driven , single player , action / sandbox series with rpg elements . the series that introduced QTEs ( and the only one who did them the right way IMO , as I hated QTEs in all other games except Shenmue ) and save transfers between sequels for the first time , 15 or so years ago .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Shenmue had been an innovative series , with strong narrative . It was the first 3d sandbox game , where you were given a world in which you could do side-activities whenever you wanted to , like later you would also be able to do in the Grand Theft Auto series . It was the first game that when you were talking with NPCs it had cinematic camera movement , like later Mass Effect and Witcher did . It was the first game that brought QTEs . ( and the only one that did them right IMO . QTEs in Shenmue were n't a substitute for combat , the game 's combat was very much like that of fighting games , a key that punches , a key that kicks , a key for blocking , combos , special moves ... in Shenmue QTEs were mostly used in cutscenes as a way to test player 's responsiveness ) So a very innovative series if you think about it . Story-wise it follows the story of a Japanese young man in the decade of the 80s if I remember correct . His father was a Kung Fu master , that was having in his possesion a sacred artifact , that when combined with another one , the one who holds both gets power or a wish , I do n't really remember , but its like Dragonball in some way , were there are these mythical objects scattered in the world , and people want to find them and collect them .

Troika 's reforms shaped Greece to be a place were a business can legaly have people always working for them without paying any worker ever , practically legalising tax-evasion , and then Troika hypocritically wonders why unemployment rates are high and how tax evasion happens . I wonder if that is what this guy means when he writes 'modernization ' . Is modernization the abolition of all worker rights and market regulation ? Is it modernization to have companies to have people working 16 hours a day on the promise that SOME DAY they will get paid , but never being paid ? That 's like slavery .

In ancient Greece , there had been a number of different 'schools ' or 'traditions ' , or perhaps you could even say 'religions ' . And while most of them if not all of them agreed that there are gods , and called them with the same names , beliefs about things differed between some different groups . Homer and Hesiod wrote about afterlife concepts more popular in the west , that there is Hades , and there the mortal is judged , and then goes to either Tartarus ( were the wicked go ) or the Elysium Fields ( where the righteous go ) . The Orphic religion though , which was kind of 'underground ' and unwanted by many Lords and politicians , had rather different beliefs . Orphics believed that the Soul of a human is a different thing than the body , and that after the soul left the body ( Death ) it would `` Drink the water of Lethe & lt ; oblivion & gt ; ) `` and be sent to another body . They believed that through ascetic life , one would earn the privellege of not drinking the water of Lethe after his or her death , so the next time the soul is incarnated , it keeps the memories of its past life-ves . Thirdly , you also have Plato and the Platonists - Neoplatonists , who believed that the old stories were allegoric and had esoteric meanings to be interpreted . Platonists believed that there are 2 realms , the realm of matter and the realm of Aether ( Heaven ) were the spirits are , and that humans originate from Heaven , and 'fell ' to Earth because they wished to taste the goods and pleasures of matter . According to this theology , if the human manages to become good and stop caring about matterial pleasures , his soul after death will stay for ever at Heaven , but if the human does n't , then he wall fall off Heaven again , and be reincarnated . Note that there might were even more different set of believes . I just write down about the 3 I know most . These three though differ in even more subjects than just afterlife . Hesiod says that Prometheus first made made man out of dirt and water , and then the Olympians made together woman ( Pandora ) . Orpheus says that Prometheus made men and women using the ashes of the Titans that Zeus zapped with a thunderbolt , giving them life with aether . Plato says that the Olympians following the orders of the One ( Super Creator of the Universe and Gods ) made humans that were neither male or female , and that because the humans once rebeled against the Olympians , Zeus punished them by splitting them to males and females , which made each one weaker . There are many paths lying ahead . Choose your prefered , or make your own ! : )",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"What I wonder is where do the Kemetics , the modern ones , draw inspiration and info about the ancient religion . I 've learnt a few things about ancient Egyptian religion , mostly by reading the book of Iamlbichus `` On the Egyptian Mysteries '' . I also know that the books of Hermes Trismegistus ( Thoth / Djehuty ) are originally Egyptian , but I have n't read them . From most of the books I 've read , I draw the conclusion that the same entities ( or at least some of them ) were known and worshipped at both Egypt and Greece , even though with different names and traditions .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,pcmasterrace,"Hello and thank you for your kind deed . I live in Greece that has been hitted by a very bad economic depression , and I am unemployed . Unfortunately , I do n't have the ability to upgrade my PC now , and I do n't see me having the ability to do so in the near future either . Being unemployed is really bad . : ( I do n't have money to go outside for clubbing or cinemas or whatever , I skip meals , and I have LOTS of free time that I have nothing to spend it on . And on that free time since I have nothing to do , I end up overthinking things , and that makes me stressful and depressed . I could be spending some of the free time playing games , but unfortunately nowdays games come with elevated requirements , and my PC falls below of even the minimum requirements of some recent games , like GTA5 , Witcher 3 , etc ... : ( Which I 'd really like to experience . But even if I had a computer able to run them , still , I 'd have to wait until they are on a very low price on Steam sale , but I would at least have a chance of playing them . My gaming is currently limited to a few early access or old games because they are cheap , and do n't have high requirements . The upgrade would n't let me play the cool recent games immediately , but it would allow me to play them when the games I like are on sale . But without a computer able enough to run them , I will be 'doomed ' to play older games . I used to be upgrading my rig every now and then , to keep it modern . Do n't think of high end hardware , just mainstream parts , but I was refreshing gpu and cpu every 2-3 years .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I tend to prefer reading books written by ancient people , who wrote them when the religion was still alive and popular . Because modern historians and archeologists , base their own knowledge in part on those books , and I prefer getting information straight from the source . But Hellenism does n't have a single 'holy book ' , but there are lots of different books regarding Gods , metaphysics , etc . And even what we call 'Hellenic Polytheism ' is n't really one thing . Because there had be a number of different 'religions ' or 'denominations ' of Hellenic Polytheism , and while each one accepted and acknowledged the existence of the same 'Gods ' , the explanations about them , and other subjects like afterlife for example differ . Personally I 'm more leaning towards the more esoteric and occult-ish path of Plato and Proclus . This path is more close to the old teachings of Orphicism than the one that had been more popular at the classic era , that venerated the epics of Homer and Hesiod . So these are my primary resources : Books by Plato , Proclus , Orpheus , and Plutarch . These authors wrote lots of works though , and a list with all their works would be very big . Orpheus was a king and poet , said to have taken part in the campaign of the Argonauts , along with Hercules and other heroes . To him are attributed a number of different texts , including his own telling of the Argonaut campaign , liturgic hymns to Gods and Goddesses , and a guide on how to make holy talismans . Plato was a philosopher , that wrote on a variety of different subjects , injecting in each of his books a piece of theology . Most of his books are centered each on a single timeless subject like eg Love , Morals , Justice etc , and he analyzes each so deep , so as the dialogue ( Plato 's books are in a dialogue form ) dives in to the Divine , as there is this belief in Platonism , that the source of everything is the Divine . This gives a rather interesting / important viewpoint regarding the nature of the world , and how the Divine affects humans and everyday life / nature , etc . Plutarch was a priest of the temple of Apollo at Delphi , and wrote two kinds of books , one kind is biographies of historical persons , and the second is called 'moralia ' and are mostly explanatory and catechism texts on things like Virtue , Fasting etc . In some of his books I remember reading about the temple 's oracle , the priestess 'Pythia ' , and the way a woman could become Pythia , and what were the preparations she had to pass , how she was receiving the oracles , etc . Finally , Proclus was a rather interesting fellow . He lived at a time that Christianity had already become a recognized religion in the Roman Empire , and is one of the last thinkers and theologians of Hellenism . Most of his works are commentaries on various Hellenic religious books that predated him , like Hesiod 's Works and Days , and Plato 's Timeaus . According to Proclus and the other `` Neoplatonists '' of the late antiquity , the old books of Hellenism were not to be taken 100 % literaly , but had allegories , and were to be interpreted . So his works are mostly focused on interpreting and explaining older texts . Except from ancient books , I also respect and try to a degree to follow the Delphic Maxims - about 140+ short sayings that were found carved in the temple of Apollo at Delphi , such as `` Know thyself '' and `` Nothing Excess '' ...",Greek,Greek

Also make sure to not leave it for too long outside of the refridgerator .

Alithinos,greece,"As others have said , it depends on how old the text is or from which dialect . The Koine Greek ( Common Tongue ) which was used as Lingua Franca from the times of Alexander the Great , and was officially used by the Byzantines too , is relatively easy to understand and translate . But the further back you go in time , the harder it becomes . I guess an average Greek person would recognize and understand 90 % to 100 % of the words he reads of this form of Greek . The hardest texts to read are Homer 's , that are from the 8th century BC . These texts contain unique words not found in any other piece of literature , and some of them are translated in books etc upon assumption regarding on the context where they are used at . I guess the average person would only understand 5 % to 20 % of the words written in these texts .",Greek,Greek
Alithinos,AskHistorians,"Well Greek mythology has been popular to the media , and has many derivatives , as it keeps inspiring artists to create new stories . It is popular as a fantasy setting these days , as also Tolkien 's universe . But the actual Greek mythology was n't supposed to be a fantasy setting . Most of it was about giving explanations to various matters that could n't be answered somehow else , and as a form of early 'science ' . I say that , because most of what is included in the divinities of ancient Greek folklore , are personified natural forces or objects . For example Hesiod 's creation story says that first Gaia ( Earth ) appeared , and that she gave birth to Uranus ( Sky ) , and that then they got married and gave birth to Potamos ( River ) , Oceanos ( Ocean ) , Oros ( Mountain ) ... Interesting to know is that the Greek language is such , that most of each words will either be masculine or feminine . So Sky is masculine , and Earth is feminine , and that way its easy to come up with the rest of the details for attributing personalities to them . For me , the part of Hesiod I wrote about , is about is seen as a form of primative natural history : It basically tells that the Sky came to existence by Earth ( I assume Sky is the Atmosphere , as you know , without Earth 's mass for there to be substantial gravity there would be no atmosphere ) , and that then the Earth and Atmosphere had intercourse ( meaning the ingredients of these two were mixed and reacted with each other , ) resulting to the creation of the Oceans , Rivers , etc .",Greek,Greek

One way to get balance is to cut expenses , and the other is to start making more money . And the way to start making more money is to start having more businesses , and more efficient tax collection . The austerity policies that Greece has been following the past 5 years include ovetaxing the existing businesses to the point they will leave the country to migrate to countries with smaller tax rates , leaving your people behind without jobs . And in the end the reduced number of businesses and working people , reduces GDP , and in the case of Greece the reduction of its GDP was way more severe than the reduction of its government 's expenses , which means that the austerity plan had the exact opposite result than the expected , rising Greece 's debt to GDP ratio instead of reducing it .",Greek,Greek

The banks spent and used the deposits of the Greek people , and have had no money to give back to people who wanted the money , for years now . What our Greek government has been doing is to take loans from foreign countries , indebting our state , to give the money to our local banks , so the banks do n't go bankrupt and we can still be getting our money from them if we want so . In essence what basically happens is that banks stole and used our deposits , and to be able to take our money back , we have to pay the government more taxes , so the government gives the money back to the banks , so we can have the delusion that our money were never stolen . That 's why when ECB stopped the 'support ' to the Greek banks , capital controls came . Because plain and simply , the money you , me , and others deposited to the banks do n't exist . They do n't have them . They spent them while we had the delusion that they would keep our money safe , and now that people ask for their money in ordrer for the bank fraud to not become clear , the ECB has to give it new money , money that wo n't be our deposits , but money that our country will get as a new loan , and we will have to pay back through our taxes . So we have to pay huge money through our taxes to recapitalize the banks with our taxes , so the banks keep giving away money to people who deposited to them , so people wo n't realise that their deposits are long stolen and that through their taxes they pay the money that they will hypocritically get back as their deposits money .",Greek,Greek

Current ethnic greeks have a lot of everything in the area , some albanian , some slavic , less turkish than you would expect , but any orthodox - especially greek-speaking - of the ottoman empire could , in essence , become a modern-day greek . However , there is a thing that predates the whole nationality concept : the greek-speaking inhabitants of ancient greece , the hellenistic period , the eastern roman empire and the ottoman empire were refered to as a whole either as greeks , or as romans or ionians .

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskReddit,"That is not only ignorant , it is incredibly offensive . Congrats on the double whammy . Edit : If you want a car analogy , here ya go : You have a car . You need it to get to work . It needs regular service . So you take it to the auto repair shop . The auto repair shop decides your car needs some repairs , which it might , but fixes problems and non-problems alike , buys pieces of his friends ' junk yard and charges them as new . He bills your card for them . You do n't know much about cars , but you realize something is wrong . You take it to a different auto repair shop because you do n't trust the previous one , but it does the same . By now you car is not working well , but you can get to work mostly every day , and can pay your credit card bills . You switch between the two only available repair shops , but they keep promising a better end result and making everything worse . And your debt keeps piling up . And then you run into a pothole . you realize that the last guy switched your suspension for nearly broken ones , and your car needs real work this time ! But you cant borrow anymore . So one auto repair guy asks your friend , who has money and supposedly knows about cars , to lend you money . He agrees on the loan , on the condition he can have a look at the car and tell the auto repair guy what to do to fix it . He does have some good ideas - which the auto repair guy applies as worse he can , to keep his friends ' junk yard going . One of the ideas , however , is that you need a much smaller gas tank . The gas is n't enough to get you to work , so you resort to going slow , turning off the engine when going downhill , and whatever trick you can muster to get to work . But you re more and more late , and your boss pays you less . But your friend is the only choice you have to afford to service your car so you can get to work , even in these conditions . And then comes in a new auto repair shop , promising he can explain to your friend why you need a bigger gas tank , get him to donate to you some of the money to get your car working again so you can get to work on time and get payed more . So you give him your car to fix . And then he rips the parts off , yells at your friend that he is wrong on everything and to give you some money , puts the already bad car parts together in a weird way , and when the disagreement with your friend reaches a standstill , gets you in the room and asks you if you want a bigger gas tank . Which you do , it makes obvious sense . But your friend is pissed , does n't want to give you money , and insists that the only way he will help is if you have an even smaller gas tank . You are like `` wtf dude , this will never work '' , but the new auto repair guy agrees , and then ( yesterday actually ) decides that he wants a new contract with you . Meanwhile your car is ruined , you can only make it to work one day out of two , your debt is piling up and your friend is pissed at you and convinced he is right about everything . Which he is n't . And no auto repair shop seems to know what it 's doing . Edit 2 : since everyone is n't getting it , in the following story , the car s owner is the Greeks , the auto repair guys are the various greek governments , the auto repair guys friends are the ones benefitting from the greek governments ' corrupt practices ( both Greek and non Greek ) , and the friend who lends money is the EU .

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer ! My question is not so much about the term per se as about the perceived origin of the conquerors .

BTW , Ionian , Yunan , Yavan still is the term used for Greeks in Turkey , the middle east and a large portion of the globe .",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer . There have been many debates on what Alexander and Macedonians were . So far , what I have taken out of them is that Alexander and Philip saw themselves as Greek . ( some of the ) other Greeks considered them barbarians for many reasons , but the one that comes to mind the most is that they did not embrace the model of the city-state . So my question 's point is : were the armies of Alexander the Great seen as Greek by non-greeks , or as distinct ? Given that there was a fair deal of contact between the Greeks and the other populations of the area *before* Alexander 's conquest ( hell , Greek mercenaries fought against Alexander along the Persians ) , did the conquered populations understand themselves as conquered by the Macedonians or by the Greeks ? Or would they not even think in these terms ?",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thank you for your answer . Everything you have said has been argued well , even though I disagree with your conclusion . But by no means do I want to claim it is absolutely incorrect . It is a well-known fact that Macedonians being Greeks or not was already debated amongst ancient Greeks . The key word being `` debated '' . However , I have never encountered any Roman source which considers Macedonians to be non-greeks , besides in the reflection of more ancient debates . But I am not a historian . Perhaps you , or some other historian here , can show me otherwise . I apologize because I ca n't help myself but keeping going : The Macedonians participated to the Olympics since Alexander I ( although only their rulers could , which sets them apart ) . They had to use force against southern Greece `` to keep them on their side '' but it 's not like Greeks did n't use force on one another `` to keep the other on their side '' . They were militarily different but so were Thebans , Athenians and Spartans from one another , although perhaps ( ? ) to a lesser extent . You say that it is `` historically incorrect '' to call them Greeks , when it is at the very least highly debatable ( I know wikipedia is not a reliable source , but the discussion on the topic is interesting ) . After all , they claimed to be Greek and spread Greek culture to the whole known world at the time . One could say that they were - quite literally - arguably Greeks . As for the modern Greeks claiming Alexander 's accomplishments , that is , I believe , justified . Modern Greeks are in my opinion more the descendants of the Hellenistic world than of ancient Greeks . Modern Greeks are mostly the cultural descendants of the Greek-speaking people of the Hellenistic kingdoms , the Roman Empire , and later the Ottoman Empire . This means they are ( to a large extent ) the descendants of the people who became hellenized through Alexander 's accomplishments , the ones which made Greek culture so pervasive that , for example , the new testament was originally written in ( Alexandrine ) Greek , or that the Eastern Roman Empire switched its administrative language back to Greek after Justinian . Alexander is , amongst others of course , a founding figure for modern Greeks . That is why he holds such a special place in Greeks hearts , and why we ca n't help ourselves from replying to posts that question him being Greek . Of course , how much any nation can ( or should consider so important to ) `` claim '' accomplishments , especially so remote in time , is also highly debatable .",Greek,Greek
AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thanks for the answer . It has always been my understanding that yes , Greeks were not a monolithic block , and that Macedonians ( who did participate in the Olympics since Alexander I , so before the conquest of southern Greece afaik ) were a part of that block . Once again , thank you for taking the time to answer my question . I strongly disagree with you for many reasons , but this is a political and emotional question for a lot of people .

Do note that `` the commonwealth of Nations '' refers to pretty much the entire english-speaking world BUT the US .

Because from what I understand , ethnic identifiers were n't really in use in the Roman empire . There were cultural and geographic identifiers , and later ( ? ) religious ones , all of which were used as such . Can we really talk about ethnic identifiers , if that is the case ? Everything I have read points to the opposite direction .

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"& gt ; in the late 5th century ( not 6th ; I was wrong there ) we start to find Priscus ( second-hand reports of Priscus , mind ! ) talking about the easterners as Romans , and using the phrase `` the eastern Romans '' . That seems to be the earliest extant adoption of the term . If I am not mistaken , it was the first distinction between eastern and western romans . I believe both were just referred . As romans before . & gt ; I wonder if this is why being `` Roman '' became a thing after the split , and especially after Rome fell . `` Roman '' was no longer just a citizenship , it was an ethnic identity that was up for grabs : and for people living somewhere like , say , Syria , it may be that becoming `` Roman '' was a lot easier than becoming `` Greek '' I know this one ! By then , hellene had become an insult , meaning pagan . So noone wanted to be a hellene ( greeks never called themselves greeks , still dont ) .

Roman was a citizenship , not an ethnic affiliation , and was granted to all free citizens of the empire through the edict of caracalla in 212 - to most hellenized easterners before that . Hellene was also used in contradistinction with hebrew by Paul - who was a jew , a roman citizen and an easterner . So , again , not as an ethnic affiliation . Very early on in Christian history , Hellene was used in contradistinction with Christian - already in the 2nd century AD . I guess what I m trying to say is that easterners may have referred to themselves as both hellenic and roman , or as both roman and christian but not hellenic ( because they were Christians , not because they werent of hellenic culture overall ) , a long time before Rome fell .",Greek,Greek

In conclusion , I too think that M5 might be a bit too overrated in this list when it comes to their ranking , but my original argument was that your argument was way too simplistic : & gt ;",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,leagueoflegends,"At first i told to myself `` It surely must be Bjergsen getting that MVP title '' But thinkin about it , thoughout the years the title of MVP in all kinds of sports did n't only go to the most consistent player and the one with the higher upside , but also the one who got the best team results IN RELATION ( capitalised it cause this is a key word imo ) to his team 's expectations . Although Bjerg hard-carried a significant amount of games , the team as a whole did n't manage to get top 2 ( 5th place ) , which was expected of them . We also have to remember that TSM have burdened Bjerg with the shotcalling too , which we really ca n't call consistent . In conclusion , although Bjerg is a huge contender for MVP , I think Rush and Doublelift really managed to exceed expectations . Double showed suprising consistency and Rush showed insane ability to carry his team and snowball them . I do n't say I agree 100 % with the MVP decision , but I can see why they did n't give it to him .",Greek,Greek

Alpigami,GlobalOffensive,"& gt ; Rahim on the other hand is rather new to this type of thing , has n't got any experience from casting at LAN tournaments so you more likely to lean towards what he has to say Yeah but does n't that lean the dispute towards the Richard and HenryG side ? From what I have gathered , I am beginning to lean towards the fact that Rahim might have come off somewhat arrogantly to his fellow colleagues due to his inexperience with how casting an event works and his inability to adapt to his fellow casters style , therefore requesting what works for him , which really throws off the other crew members who are propably used to being able to adapt with any other talent that they are given . Sure I can agree with the community that RL really comes off like a d*ck , especially if u read his twitter , but truth be told , I think that this Rahim guy just is n't willing to take his part of the blame which he propably deserves , therefore making this whole drama even more confusing ( I 'm not saying full blame , I am saying a part of it ) . Those are my 2 cents about it .",Greek,Greek
Alpigami,GlobalOffensive,"& gt ; How are mom jokes more mature One pattern that I 've seen is this subreddit ( especially regarding RL ) is that he gets a lot of flak for using what people consider as immature or insulting words or phrases . When we are talking about people from Great Britain , we all need to keep in mind that what we consider rude or inappropriate , in their country is considered `` banter '' and therefore they do n't really think that what they are saying is somewhat wrong . In conclusion I think that both parties could potentially be at fault . If the events that hire RL want him to be a bit more measured in his casting and he does n't do that , then yes blame him all you want for that one , but if the events that hire him want him to be 100 % himself , then it 's time for the community to do some research on freaking cultures and realise that he is n't really doing anything wrong .",Greek,Greek

Balls was slumping this split so you really ca n't call him a carry . C9 bot lane is really consistent but it wo n't always carry the game for you cause they require that extra threat on the team , since they are more of a supportive bot lane . As far as Meteos goes , he is still top 2-3 in his position but we need to remember that jungle is basically a 2v2 matchup ( jungle-mid ) and due to meta shifts he ca n't play those carry junglers anymore.The point I am making is that picking a more aggresive player has higher upside than picking a passive one , specifically in the case of C9 .

Ofc we would n't have those iconic teams with franchising , but the owners are calling for franchising NOW because the league is not that profitable for any org right now , Riot is giving owners very little motive to invest money due to its structure , there was literally NO reason to franchise in early league cause there was n't any real structure till season 2 . Second of all , you are still gon na have buddy teams , players impact inside the orgs is gon na get bigger and GOOD players ( not any player , which is excellent imho ) are gon na have huge leverage over who they play with cause unlike popular opinion , teams inside franchising wo n't stay shit and hold to their Goldenglues or Cris'es . Franchising might actually make LCS even more competitive and talking about teams of friends ... You know I get it , my favorite team of all time is the old C9 , I loved the idea that a team of friends managed to compete with world class teams purely due to shotcalling and persistance , but If we are heading towards a professional sports direction , then this is a thing we might have to sacrifice.I 'm ok with it and I think you should be too : )",Greek,Greek

Not only did I get bombarded with downvotes but I got a lot of responses from people with CJ flairs who tried to convince me that Space is and has been a consistent player for a long long time . When I see responses as yours my heart warms a bit and I sincerely hope that CJ starts removing some legacy players , aka Ambition and Space for a start ...",Greek,Greek
