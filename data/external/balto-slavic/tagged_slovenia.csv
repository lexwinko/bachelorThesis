Farmers who only own a small patch of land can\\'t afford to industrialize to the degree that is possible in the \ '' new world\ '' where there is no historical baggage regarding land ownership ( or where that baggage is conveniently swept under the rug ) .

Not just immigrants to Slovenia , but people who live in those countries . Serb in Serbia and Serb in Slovenia are both \u010cefur for Slovenians . \\n\\nNo , this is simply not true . A Serb living in Serbia is a Serb . Infact it\\ 's the other way around ... It\\ 's the Slovene Serbs who don\\'t really fit in when they visit family in Serbia . There\\ 's a saying among them here : \ '' Bolje \u010defur v Ljubljani nego Janez v Bosni.\ '' ( Better a \u010cefur in Ljubljana than Janez in Bosnia . ) \\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; And that word \ '' \u010cefur\ '' came from the derogatory Slovenian term for Jews \ '' \u010civut\ '' . So for Slovenians , all people East of them are Jews , and that\\ 's an insult in Slovenia.\\n\\nOkay , this isn\\'t really true either . The word \u010cefur is used exclusively for Slavic immigrants from other republics of the former Yugoslavia . No one else . And the fact it comes from the Turkish word for a jew doesn\\'t really mean anyone is being called a \\'Jew\\ ' , whatever that means . I\\ 've never heard anyone call anyone a \u010divut.\\n\\nAlso -- The younger generation have taken up the name \u010defur as their own . They reffer to eachother as such .

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"we don\\'t have your high school , but we do have the gymnasium ( not to be confused with the German one ) that teaches general knowledge at a higher level than \ '' trade schools\ '' of sorts which still teach general knowledge but also have classes directed at various trades . Gymnasium lasts for 4 years and trade schools from 3 to 4 , usually from when you\\ 're 14 to 18 ( if you are born before June ) .\\n\\n1 . we grade 1-5 with 5 being best and 1 meaning failure , IIRC 0 - 49 % = 1 , \\n50-62 % = 2 , \\n63-75 % = 3 , \\n76-89 % = 4 , \\n90-100 % = 5 and it varies between schools and teachers a bit anyway.. grades are given for tests and oral examination and then averaged into semester grades which then average into the overall grade for the year of the subject . At the end of gymnasium is the all-encompassing Matura exam that is separate and independent from the grades of all 4 years.\\n\\n2 . In average you\\ 'd have 6 or 7 class hours in a day , one class hour being 45 minutes . That doesn\\'t equal 6 to 7 subjects in a day since some took up two class hours at a time . There are many subjects ( classes ? ) . You don\\'t take all subjects in all years , or even all semesters . *DISCLAIMER : from here on only counts for the school I attended . * From my days in gymnasium , 1st year I remember : Maths , Slovene , English , German ( some classes had French or Spanish or Italian , depends on what you picked when you enrolled ) , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Music , Geography , Physical Education , Computer Science , History . But Music and CS would stop after year 1 , in 2nd year you\\ 'd get Sociology ( only 2nd year ) , and in 3rd year you\\ 'd get Psychology ( only 3rd year ) and in 4th Philosophy . You also have obligatory \ '' additional classes\ '' that you have to pick out , and \\n\\n3 . those were usually the extra levels you talk about , so you could take Advanced Maths as the extra class , or you\\ 'd take Psychology again ( with different curriculum of course ) and you\\ 'd pick one for one semester and one for the other . The extra classes are also necessary when you pick two of the subjects for the extra exams in the final Matura exam ( consisting of 5 subjects , Math , Slovene , foreign language ( English , German , French , etc ) and two mandatory extras you pick ) , so if you pick Chemistry and Biology the two of four extra classes in your 4th year are those two and the two extra \ '' higher level\ '' classes . Here i\\ 'd like to distinguish \ '' class\ '' and \ '' subject\ '' more because there are many classes in one school year , as in , groups of students , usually up to 30 and labeled with letters ( so 3.B would be B class of 3rd year ) and all classes are taught the same subjects separately , so you don\\'t really mix students from classes in the ordinary subjects , **except** in the extra *classes* because there students ARE mixed since there are many more to choose from so groups get diluted . As I understand in the US you don\\'t really have \ '' classes\ '' like we do , you are taught every subject in a different group ( being the class ) depending on what you pick . Terminology differences fail me a bit here.\\n\\n4 . integrated systems come and go . We have Math as one subject but Algebra , Geometry and Calculus are all covered separately within it . Physics , Chemistry , Biology , CS and Geography are split.\\n\\n5 . Anything can be arranged if students are interested , but those \ '' exterior classes\ '' won\\'t count towards your final year grade .

Halofit,europe,"Years which really matter : 1941 - start of the war in Yugoslavia and the establishment of the liberation front ( OF ) , 1943 - the second session of AVNOJ and the establishment of the Yugoslav government , 1945 - total liberation of Slovenia.\\n\\nNoun associated with the warfare period : Armed resistance . \\n\\nNoun associated with the end of the war : Liberation . Mostly . The victory was followed by the reprisals agains collaborators and their sympathisers ( see Foiba killings , Otroci s petri\u010dka etc. ) . It was a shameful time . \\n\\nThe role of your country in the war : Part of the Yugoslav partisans , the biggest and most effective partisan resistance to date . The Yugoslav partisan tied down some 100k German troops during the war.\\n\\nThe perception of your country-men who fought within the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS : Ahh yes , the Homeguard ( domobranci ) and MVAC ( milizia voluntaria anti-comunista ) . Up until recently they have been ( rightly ) seen as traitors , who joined the Germans , Italians and Hungarians in their war crimes . However recently there have been numerous attemnts by the right-wing to whitewash their crimes and present them as patriotic liberation fighters . There have also been attempts to rehabilitate other quislings such as Gregorij Ro\u017eman , a bishop who openly supported the Italian and German occupation.\\n\\nThe role of national partisans within your country : The partisan were basically the only resistance during the war ( since the Chetniks spent half their time doing the dirty work for Italians - claiming to be \ '' using the enemy\ '' ) . It is difficult to explain just how much of an impact the partisan had on Yugoslavia . The leaders drew their legitimacy from their achievents during the war and the army doctrine effectively became one of pre-planed nation-wide partisan resistance . The entire Yugoslav state existed on the collective memory of the resistance movement . Once Tito and the partisan generation became old or died , the \ '' Yugoslav dream\ '' of equal nations living together fell apart as well , giving way to nationalism and infighting .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
