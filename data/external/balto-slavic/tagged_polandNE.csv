ANYWAY the racial tension you speak of is predominantly from one single demographic : blacks . And their unwillingness to integrate into the ( successful ) American system . Instead attempting to alter it ... .. sound familiar ... ... Islam in Europe ? So I would argue there are different levels of diversity . Level 1 is Poles accepting Ukrainians . Then you have Asians in Australia/Canada and `` Westernized '' religious folks from Turkey & amp ; Israel . But below that is the Africans and Arabs . Look , think and/or act just too different .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"If I can add anything about the song - this is n't a - so to say - 'killer ' song , or single , but maybe it should n't be ? It feels to me as this is the song that describes a moment when The Robot With Human Hair was born . The series always focused on problems - Robot always had it hard fitting with people due to his various problems . In part 2 he does n't gratuate high school . In par 2 1/2 he discovers and becomes addicted to sex . In parts 3-4 he struggles with drugs . This song , in my opinion shows how young and naive young people can be , thinking they do n't want the boring life , they want to have it all and wo n't miss anything . He 's talking how he is some kind of leader , as if he found the better way to live and he 's on the 'outside ' when they are on the 'inside ' - he is living the life of pleasures while they 're living boring , normal lives and he 's sure that his way is the better one and others will follow him . The song starts with the main protagonist reassuring himself that he should n't feel bad because it was in a way 'destined ' for him to live this life . The second Tilian verse feels like he 's breaking ties with those who would advise him to not do the things he wants to do . ( Like parents ) About the Mess first verse : Brain = Robot wang , he makes choices and thinks with his craving , no rational thinking involved . The onther line says that the protagonist wants to just fulfill his craving for sex . About I-8764 - when searched online , I-8764 will give you photos of particular wedding dress model , but it may be completely wrong . But these line mean that the protagonist does n't look at his girl/girls as a life companion , just rather as a person he has sex with and does n't have any feelings for her . Tilian 's second verse talks about how he devalues love as not something that the protagonist shares with one particular person , because he looks `` pathetic '' this way . Instead , he just feels addicted to feeling love , through sex f.e . The protagonist starts `` drinking the love '' , getting it no matter from whom or how . He feels like a savage , going from girl to girl and obtaining their 'love ' from them . He 's addicted , he wants all these thing and the WILL have these things . Jon Mess ' lyrics end it all with showing that protagonist knows how people think about him , how they say that his life is hedonistic , and he just does n't care about that and wants to corrupt those people instead by `` making them kiss their sistas '' . All in all , I think it 's a song about young people who get the wrong take on life and fall into their vices , thinking that that 's the way the life should be experienced . In whole , I think this song should n't be treated as some radio single , but rather as a fan-service for the fans that explains a little bit , gives context to the whole series of the songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"My thoughts exactly , I was pumped for the rest of the episode because I totally was n't expecting that ( I support Gen X'rs , dunno , I think they are underdogs so maybe that 's why ) and definitely made the episode better for me . Then I thought that the slide in fact was n't a red herring , because in the scene the pic was reffering to Chris was talking about who 's porbably will be voted out next , so in a way he was prepering for the next tribal council , the whole caption was just a stretch . Intentional or not , it felt great to think that you have been spoiled some information only to find out it was a total misdirection",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"What if in a situation when the whole tribe plays their idols the votes begin a new cicle where the idols stay used but votes proceed as normal . It would be either way the biggest idol flush or a hectic strategy of who out of the alliance stays vulnerable , who trusts that he is n't going home , who may be tricked into not playing idol and getting blindsided .

He may know that he sounds stupid but he has a much bigger crowd to cater to their likings than some hardcore fans on the internet . tl ; dr Jeff pushes the theme hard because he knows the Gen X will love it , and like it or not ratings are way more importent for him than some super fans being annoyed for a while .

1Sopel6,survivor,The difference is that Yul played the game in a style that I think was n't recreated - like a politician . Also he used his idol better then Tony ( manipulator Penner to flip just on the basis of having an idol ),Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Probably the big factor in the whole excitement of Legacy Advantage ( or lack of ) comes from the way the whole fact of possesion is played . I think that the production wanted for someone to spill the beans about the advantage with hopes of paranoia to ensue - `` what is it ? Is it dangerous ? Will it screw my game ? Will it help my game ? Can I manipulate the votes / the person to will this to me ? '' But the Legacy Advantage was only in possesion of two players who were nowhere near spilling any beans . On the other hand - I understand them , if I would have something like this I would n't talk about it at all , just wait till day 36 . Maybe that 's the advantage 's flaw ( from TV interest standpoint ) - it was n't advantageous to even mention the advantage . But also - imagine if the advantage was in the hands of someone other than not targeted Ken , someone who needed an unexpected safety gained from making bonds .

Colton went to the Final Tribal with the other two with thought that his leadership game style will give him a win , only to be crushed by a more under the radar , immunity winning and relationship based gameplay . Kind of a situation similiar to the Samoa FTC , but imo more understandable . EDIT : Also , I think if it was n't for the Immunity , Anne-Marie could have gone at F4 . Colton was left with two goats - Douglas and Joyce and decided to vote out Joyce in fear of her getting the Zhan Hu votes .

That 's why I was happy she 's gone because it lefts even the Edgic fans quite blindsided . With Ken I think it will be another blindside for Edgic community , when he 'll be booted around F5 and imo he 's getting a `` too perfect to win '' edit . ( and I suspect a heartbreaking betrayal from David ) Frankly , I do n't understand why I get downvoted here for stating that I like to be blindsided by the editors and unable to predict who goes next or to know who the winner is based on some confessional from episode 2 .

1Sopel6,survivor,"This is my first survivor season and I do n't understand one thing - why they do n't pick up on the hints that Jeff is giving them on TC ? Have n't they noticed that they 're specific and they sometimes are n't even subtle ( like asking Jason if he 's confident about the council while stressing the `` if everyone sticks to the plan '' part ) I know that editing gives us a much shorter look at everything that happens on the TC but do n't they know that Jeff is like an `` always watching big brother '' of the game and if he asks you about something , there needs to be something behind it ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Get a look at EnviroMine mod , it adds body temperature , hydration and sanity , pretty helpful if you want to make it as realistic as possible . Also to stimulate the exhaustion factor f.e . Mindcrack serie had it 's players play the whole season in one sitting which was around 22 hours I 've been thinking about similiar project and I 've got a few ideas how to translate some tv show aspects into the game so if you want to I can share them with you and maybe help you out on some of them .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"You should definitely check out Cordova , the only band I could truly call `` ambient post-hardcore '' , they have a nice variety of sounds on their first album `` If Only I Could Focus '' Songs : Most popular : [ She 's Broke Not Broken ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Ara3JHkuevc ) Heaviest : [ Bastards ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=XRdXmlC06SU ) Catchiest : [ When We Touch ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=KUdvQCj8YiE ) Most ambient/dreamy sounding : [ Memory Tree ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6aQz4oFncSA ) The last song is from their new album they 're releasing soon .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I always looked on this band as one of those bands that had one or two likeable songs , then someone posted `` Mr. Owl ... '' in the nominations and I 've got reminded that this album is really nice .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Ca n't say I 'm not a little disappointed ... but I hope Matt has a decent voice and decent writing because that 's the aspect I love ALLB for . So does it mean Kurt will be a solo artist now ? If so that would be also a little disappointing because he really fits better as a vocalist in a band , imo ( do n't get me wrong , I adore his solo works ) Well , I hope that at least that project with Thomas Erak will come to frutition ...",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,GameDeals,"If someone was interested - Pixel Survivors is a small game , for price of $ 1 is good to grab , it 's a little time game you play from time to time , dev is active and regularly adds new content . For this price I would recommend it on it 's own .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Name catched my attention , will check out later !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"On the other note ( disclaimer : it 's a pure speculation ) do you think `` Happiness II '' would be possible ? I like all of the singers and all of the eras of DGD but lately I 've came to the conclusion that sooner or later Tilian is going to leave DGD , imo he seems to feel and be doing better as a solo artist rather than a DGD singer . Also , his solo career seems to be doing well . Now that Kurt has left ALLB he 's a free agent ( I 'd be really surprised if he decided to continue as a solo artists with so many connections and musicians ready to collaborate with him ) and added the fact that through the anniversary tour he got closer to DGD once again ( you can see on the videos that he enjoyed playing his songs , on the first dates he wanted to sing the biggest part of `` Uneasy Hearts ... '' ) would you think that the return of Kurt Travis ( or at least a guest appearance on the album ) could be possible ? As I said , it 's just me speculating , curious about what do you think .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh it 's coming , it 's release is scheduled just after the release of this Will Swan/Matt Geise/Loniel Robinson project ...",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Sorry , was just joking as this project has been in the makings for years now and probably wo n't ever see the daylight",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,What ? They 've changed their label ?,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Also , they 're touring with likes of Touche Amore or letlive . so I think they kind of recognize themselves as a pseudo-posthardcore band",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Also , wishing all the best for Brandon , he has a great voice , I 'm curious what he 'll come up with next",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,dancegavindance,I 'm not getting why DGD is staying as a 5 piece when all of their music needs a second guitarist to play them . I 've been hoping for Bianchini to join them since Josh left,Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,There are dozens of us ! Dozens !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I loved those guys , sucks they broke up",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"Sadly , no . Will confirmed that the names and parts are based only on the fact that the song sounds like a continuity or has a similiar vibe as the other song , no real story to it . The most consistend are the first two parts of of Strawberry Swisher songs as both are talking about girls/relationships ( so it kinda fits ? ) The Robot series I would say are loosely tight only by the interpretation by the fans as they usually focus on varying topics and only `` share '' the main protagonist , if you even can find a one in those songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Angus may have deserved the win , at the F5 he was in alliance with everyone and was in a safe position so his win can be justified . I like Rodgers immunity path to the final . Gisele looked like Angus ' coat-rider to me so I 'm surprised she got two jury votes . Jeremy was the most strategic and if not for the tie breaker challange could have won the whole thing , so he 's one of the people who should come back in the future . I also like Dion 's game and I think he should get another chance in the future .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I also was very pleased with how the whole season played out , especially with the fact that how Jack could ride his game until the end even with him coming from the minor tribe ! Maurice and Ami were one of my favorites this season and chances are high that we may see them in the future . Also , check out [ Alternative Survivor : Australia ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/4nsv2p/s_alternative_survivor_the_australian_outback/ ) , it has just been uploaded !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yes , first season might have been slightly better but I blame it one the format of the two first seasons - there are no twists and the game is simple , but soon we will get more action going !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Thanks for the kind words ! Also , I support giving Dave and Dylan a come back in the future but could you explain why Simone ? I 'll be glad to know why do you think she should come back for All Star : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I rooted for Aisana and Big Bill and would love to see them getting a second chance . Jordan is a must in an All-Stars , that 's for sure .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"No problem , you make great music so you definitely had your spot on this playlist ! : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"To be honest , Tracy was set up as a cool , very friendly guy , a social butterfly that also could excel in the challenges . I can say that I expected to him to go a little bit deeper than he did and I think his story has n't been completed yet so he 's one of my favorites to get a chance another time . Also , I loved how at the merge the tribe immediately got rid of two great competitors - Tracy and Kevin . I was also shocked how easily Thomas had made bonds with outher like how you he made bonds with Tracy as you pointed out . I 'm glad you liked the season and I 'm happy that the castaways I create show some personality just from their looks , that 's the aspect I spend the most time on , because I want my series to present good quality .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,You meant Elias or Ellie ? : P,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , what an ending ! The last vote out was a great strategic move and , definitely one of the greatest possible ways the Borneo season could have turned out ! I like your season much more then mine : D I liked Samantha , Jason and Tom , they are greatly suited for and All-Stars season . IMO for second chancers , only Mercy ( and maybe Joseph ) could use a second shot at the game . Nice first season , first few seasons are a bit simple and thus boring but keep going , I like it !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yes , I was surprised how well she has been doing , and with a little bit more luck she could achieve something fantastic . How would you rate this season ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"That 's what I 'm planning on doing ; ) Dave had a nice game but I think that tribal council would be his last anyways . He simply found himself on the wrong team , otherwise he would have a shot . Add to this his medevac and you get a great cast for some future returnees/evacs seasons : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Ha ! My favorite won the season . The merge was great , especailly that double idol play . I 'm only surprised that second runner up got no votes and got less votes than the first runner up who was pretty much a goat .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I do n't know why you think that it is a awful winner . If you look at the statistic you notice that the winner was one of the most strategic players , had most immunity wins and was only one vote on the finale away from a perfect game . He also was in the alliance that run the game and if not for the idols - would be a final three . A pretty decent winner , imo",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"In the pre-merge I thought she would be one of the top contenders , she was good , she could definitely achieve more",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Jeff Probst and Santa Claus,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yeah , I think my set alliances a little screwed the way how the simulator was creating alliances in the starting tribes , which made Hana the odd man out , without any allies so her game was a little bit bland . I have regrets because of this but on the other hand , this worked in a way I would like it to work - a group from Borneo was voted out early to ensure that they wo n't have power once they come together ( at least I believe it was meant this way lol ) Cynthia played a really good game but at the same time it painted a gigantic target at her back and once the tribe got the chance to take her out , they took it . What 's your opinion on the winner ? I liked the fact that it was somebody I was betting to not even make the pre-merge .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Tracy & amp ; Adam need to be in HvV , their hot-and-cold relationship was the best thing this season , I imagine Tracy as a Villain with her mutiny , convincing her new tribe to vote out it 's members , idoling and purple rocking people out , throwing them under the bus . She 's a villian . Adam on the other hand was a hero , being so many times on the exile but yet not switching tribes , even when they were loosing , founding an idol which he never played and being loyal to his alliances . I was rooting for one of them to win , I liked the winner but I 'd rather see him as the runner-up . Tristan and Bruce were interesting characters , poor Jordan L did n't even get a chance to play : (",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Nana was considered for All-Stars but was cut in order to make room for Yolanda,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , the winner brought a perfect goat into the final . I liked the winner , Landon , Tasmin and Tamar could return for the all stars , I 'd love to see Sun again , someday",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The Dear Hunter ' song has now been changed from `` Wait '' to `` Whisper '' La Dispute 's song has been changed from `` King Park '' to `` St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues '' Many times I chose the most popular or the most played tracks , when in doubt I compared them . Also , I wanted to keep this as post-hardcore as I could so I did n't include more popular songs of bands that later on changed their style , hence `` Devil In Jersey City '' by C & amp ; C is on the playlist . With Underoath , you may be reffering to the fact that their later albums stray from this sound and are often considered to be metalcore . But `` A Boy Brushed ... '' is a good representation of the sound from this album so it fits imo . `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' is a staple of this sound of post-hc spectrum so it fits . Also , Glassjaw 's sound on their albums can change pretty often so it 's not easy to pin-point the best representative . Letlive 's `` Muther '' is the song they 're most known for , and `` The Blackest Beautiful '' production is polarizing even Letlive 's so I did n't want to include a song from this album . Sadly , `` What Is It To Burn '' by Finch is n't available where I am , I 'll think on some solution to that",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,I 'm glad you like it !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"All of them have been added to the playlist , thank you for posting !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh man , Solidarity and The Jester",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'd recommend `` Constant Push '' and `` Dark Souls '' . ( Dark Souls would be definitely the best song if not for the chorus ) `` Discovery '' is also a worthy contender . Songs 9 - 14 are from theirs previous material `` If Only I Could Focus '' released in 2013 and from these songs I would recommend `` She 's Broke not Broken '' This band is unusual , because it has many influances but is executed in a style that is rather not seen in the scene . The record flows with mellow guitars tones and drumming only to transition to loud , noisy sounds in a minute . Also , the vocals at places remind me of Chino Moreno of Deftones , the vocalist wails , whispers , shouts , screams and sings lightly . I would say this is how Chino Moreno fronted post-hc band would sound like .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I guess this album will be better then `` In the Unlikely Event '' and eventually be slightly better then Manipulator , and that 's fine to me for me , I 'm just happy that they 're playing shows and making music again",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Pretty decent track , you can see the progress these guys make",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,Russian band Fail Emotions is pretty decent in terms of electronic post-hardcore,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BeMeApp,"From my experience the bemes are the best when I hold the phone next to my forehead or chin because it captures your POV and in 99 % of times it 's angled in a way you imagined it to be . I do n't recommend shooting a beme from the chest level because nearly most of the time it 's totally out of frame if you want to record anything specific , it works out when you 're walking down the street , etc .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,I think `` Get Got '' would be interesting,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Well , there is no place for singing on DG tracks , I imagined it in a way that Tilian would sing in the mumbled verses and Jon would do screaming/rapping ( Secret Band style ) on choruses and the last verse of the song . Just imagine Jon furiously yapping `` Getgetgetget gotgotgotGot ''",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"EP rocks , ca n't wait for both albums !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The list is obviously still incomplete , you can help me by writing post-hardcore bands that I 've missed ( you can sort the playlist by the artist naem and just type the name of the band , if nothing shows up it means the band is missing ) Every band matters , no matter how big ! The playlist contains a one song from every artist , I tried to pick those song that are the most representative or/and are best to catch the attention of new listeners .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Bottom right is `` Instant Gratification '' by Dance Gavin Dance Yes , there is Glassjaw in there but sadly no Hopesfall - they do n't have any of their albums on Spotify , as of now , there is only a cover of `` Eye '' by The Smashing Pumpkins from some tribute album but I had a rule of no cover songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'm glad you like it : ) I only wanted to note that on your playlist there is `` Imagine Violet As A Farmer '' by The Personalized Kid Music Band , supposedly in the place were `` ... As Children '' by Violet should be ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few borderline bands that can be loosely associated with post-hardcore genre so I decided to include them f.e . Foxing 's first album is mainly emo but could pull riffs and shouts in vain of DGD or Circa Survive BMTH 's `` Sempiternal '' is taken as post-hc release , similarly to Underoath 's `` They 're Only Chasing Safety '' even though they 're a metalcore band . Also , songs from `` Sempiternal '' are n't forbidden to post here , so there 's that . I do n't listen to blessthefall but only saw an opinion on the internet and last.fm that they 're a post-hardcore band but , I 'll give it a closer look Sadly , there is no Ling Tosite Sigure on Spotify , trust me If they were there I would be included . But I can recommend you Sokokinaru , they are on the playlist and you may like them ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Turns out you were right , when I searched for them it did n't show me anything . `` Missing ling '' has been added to the playlist , thanks !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"That 's strange , nothing shows up for me . Maybe their music has a regional lock on it or something ... ( I 'm from Europe ) so as of now I ca n't do much about it , but I 'll try",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Well the main purpose of the playlist is to document as much existing bands as possible , it definitely is n't a good starting point for new listeners but can be used by the fans of the genre to discover something new",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh this is not how it works Network Ten is paying Endemol to create the show for them , so acquiring Ten by CBS may result in things like AUS being available in All Access , but they did not acquire the creative force , sadly . Also , I think that the US version would benefit sooo much only from extending it for another 20 minutes . I ca n't just understand why it 's the shortest of any Survivor version . When the series are starting ( Australia , recently one in Poland ) they always make the episodes long ( Australian is around one hour , polish one is an hour and a half ) so they can pay off . But US Survivor , the biggest of them all , with dedicated fanbase is the shortest and as of late needs to cut corners ( f.e . staying in Fiji , reusing challenges every season to save on creating new props ) while just by making episodes longer would give benefits to nearly everybody .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

In Fiji , taking Melissa McNulty into the cast , it would be the same format but the gender ratio would be mirrored f.e . in CI in Manihiki there were only two males ( Nate and Sekou ) and 3 females . In Fiji there were 3 black man ( Earl , Dreamz and Anthony ) and two black females . Same went for all the other ethnicities .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"It 's a change , for sure , but the more I think of it , it 's not completely out of nowhere , there were hints of this sound in their past discography ( Microscope , Supercharged , even Zzzonked to an extent ) It was strange at first but now I just imagine how fun it will be to bounce around in that heavy bass in the first part of the song . Their message is here , the guitars might have been more prominent but it 's ok and I think it will be better when we get the context of it on the album . `` Live Outside '' was a single but also a satire , this is bouncy with more power to it . Let 's also remember that this band released `` Hoodwinker '' not so long ago , so I 'd say that we 'll be fine ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,There are dozens of us ! Dozens !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,I do n't think there was anything portraing her as a real threat or an mastermind that the edit did n't show - Annelise for the whole season did n't stick strong to anyone so she was kind of there . tbh if she did n't stumble upon that immunity idol or did n't give an iformation about having it she would be riding the wave like Tara is doing right now . On an island where 9 people are fighting with fists she was on of those who found a knife . She was a threat that needed to be simply disarmed .,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"For the whole episode I was looking forward a move and it never came , I do n't know if my logic if flawed but ... Why not blindside Ziggy at this point ? The plan literally was just writing itself - they knew for sure that Ana is using her idol , you somehow get Ziggy to play her Super Idol . So you 're getting rid of two idols in one go . But here 's the plan - you know right then the 3 votes are going for Locky , one is going fo Annaliese . You take the remaining 7 and Ziggy gets clipped . And that would have worked even if Ziggy did n't screw Annaliese ! In one swoop you get rid of : two hidden immunity idols , one super idol , one flipper , original Samatau member and a challenge beast . Yeah , the Samatu are sitting together as a 3 , not as a 2 , and you 're exposing yourself by getting rid of one of your shields . But who 's going to win the challenges anyway . As we saw it 's really left between Jericho , Locky and Henry at this point . I just do n't know , this was so obvious to me , but is there something I 'm missing out that ? I know we see an end-product , but even Henry and Locky had all the info that I 've pointed out .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh , after my practices in hospital he has a typical mentality of an seasoned doctor - both weird and cringy in jokes / interests and with a feeling of superiority . I do n't think that he will last for long , especially with people who usually work under people like him . I have nothing against the guy but I can bet that he will be a flame out , I only hope this will be a hilarious one",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"What I love about the cast is that it 's a very diverse bunch , almost to the point when it looks like some fanmade fanfiction . Just look at the bunch that is left in the game I mean , you have whacky Luke , a sweet cookie-monster Jericho , an silent and seemingly always scared Peter , an hilarious alpha male Locky to the point that he looks like a caraicature of an archetype , an elusive shadow that is Sarah , a complete gossip girl and chatterbox that is Michelle , the underdog scrappy fighter Tessa , the smarter-than-he-thinks but still lovable dude that is Henry , the kickass chellange beast Ziggy and the one everyone loves to hate - Tara . And the best part is that all of them have that fire to fight for the immunity or to scramble and be strategic , and everyobody does it in their own style - Michelle can create a drama out of the tiniest information , Locky with his subtle as a punch strategies , Henry 's constant running and gunning , etc . Not to mention some good characters that we had in the pre-merge were also good .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Australian one proved that Survivor US got too meta , too full of itself . Sadly , US one probably wo n't learn a thing from that as it 's not threatening for their market .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes ! I also think that the boot order is ideal . The only ones I miss from pre-merge is Mark W ( I would have him in the place of Annelise anyday ) and as I understand that AK may have been getting on some people 's nerves I think his eventual downfall in the merge would be more satisfying then a pre-merge boot because of the swap . Other then that - yeah , everyone else left in the ideal place , just enough to show their characters , or would n't deliver anything exciting and were gone fast ( Kate , Aimee )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh sweet summerchild Welcome to the world of messism . In overall , Craig 's lyrics are mostly constant blabbing about girls , Travis ' are about relationships and are the ones that are filled most with emotions , Pearson 's are overly sexual . But Jon Mess ? That 's a whole other bag . He has a style in which he is both very blunt about the delivery but also very very cryptic about the meaning . If you want some insane lyrics from him check out `` Need Money '' . As to connections to video games , on `` Jesus H. Macy '' the lyrics '' Set it up , cover the plans , record everyone , make demands Positional strategy , split was disastrous , flanking the siege '' is in fact about Starcraft . I do n't think there 's more in terms of video games , but these lyrics are a total treat . Give them a look , in no time you 'll be on the back of the potato , making french fries in the snow .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"* Lead Vocals : Christopher deCinque ( of Closure in Moscow ) * Harsh Vocals : Cory Lockwood ( of A Lot Like Birds ) [ also clean and spoken verses ] * Lead Guitar : Alexis Pareja ( of The Number Twelve Looks Like You ) * Rhythm Guitar : Salvatore Bossio ( of Envy on the Coast ) * Bass Guitar : Ryan Jay Johnson ( of letlive . ) * Electronics/Backing Vocals : Rou Reynolds ( of Enter Shikari ) * Drums : Cory Eaves ( of Artifex Pereo ) I wanted to create a supergroup that was n't all `` big '' names , with restriciton to one member from each band , that could actually gel together and create a rather interesting sound and would complement eachother musically .

1Sopel6,survivor,"Tell that to all the UTR winners ; ) Calling the shots in benefitial for your game when the plan follows as you intend them but when the pyramid gets flipped upside down - you 're the first head of the chopping block . Just look at AK - went from bottom to top and I smell that he can be in another turmoil caused by Locky and Henry . Why is that ? Because from being the target of the majority he rose up and now is the target of the minority . And the thing in Survivor is - you never know when that minority becomes a majority . Revolution eats their own children . That 's what riding the middle is - playing enough to not be the last in the alliances pecking order but not playing too much to be the one calling the shots . And yes , I 'll agree that it 's result based as it will determine if we will remember it as a great move or as a stupid move . But Henry made his choices , gambled and the payoff may be massive . But well , if you 're getting `` JT flashbacks '' you probably are one of the crowd that disregard the whole idea of the move and only repeat the same opinion - in this case `` JT was a dumbass , he should n't give that idol to Russel '' . BUT , if the JT 's perception of Russell / what is going on in Villains tribe proved to be right , this gifted idol would be praised as the most brilliant thing in the whole series . It 's the gamble . JT gambled , Henry is gambling right now . As for Henry - guy saw an opportunity , took it , he has some connections back at his old tribe , he knows he will be valuable at his new tribe . Again - big gamble , big payoff . Thinking about that - yeah , JT and Henry seem to be the same kind of a player . I 'd like to call them `` the experimentator '' , they do crazy things if that little stroke of brilliance . Sometimes they play the perfect game , sometimes they come down in history as `` the stupidiest move in the history , hurr hurr '' . But still , JT is in the realm of legends , and Henry is 9 episodes in , a major character od this season ( at least for now ) I think that 's the way of percieving of good players . I would argue who 's thinking is really flawed here .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm sensing a Wentworth , but it 's the 1.0 version ...",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"* we definitely are getting some shade on Ziggy in the preview , that 's the downside of things - everyone know who has it . She may use it but everyone knows she 's dangerous with it * it has been 25 out of 55 days out there , it 's nearly the middle of season for them , so a good motivation for another half is a good idea . Besides , in US version they get the letters around the same day . It also helped to give some background to the characters , sympathise with them while fillin the filler . * well , it 's pretty naive to think that production would let that happen ... * also , a good timing given that the majorities on both tribes are getting to comfortable with their powers",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Same for me , `` Caught Up In a Lie '' is a decent track , not ground breaking , but decent . But `` Broke '' did n't grip me in any way : / What 's worse , the lyrical content is really good , and would be good if the instrumentation was n't that loud , the vocals drown in them . Also , I think that it could be a little bit less stripped out , bit quieter . Something in the liking of the passage in `` Tetra Hydro Cannonball '' from their EP ( [ this ] ( https : //youtu.be/6KYc9HwB_9g ? t=95 ) ) , I just think it lacks a bit of intimacy . I still have hope for this album , it 's their debut after all . I just hope that they wo n't make the same mistakes that their label mates Oranges made on their album , that songs were definitely `` swancore '' but lacked their own dashes of identity As to `` Galaxy God '' - this will be a re-recorded version so it 's not completely the same thing",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Bob is possible only in theory , given his physical build and advanced age I 'd say even Rudy Boesh has bigger chances of returning . Also , Chris was in the early mix for BvW with his wife but was cut rather early due to him being ( allegedly ) overweight . Just my notes that I think are worth mentioning and taking into the equation",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,Family visit ?,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"No , it has been there in previous episodes - although not so over-the-top like in this one ( it 's also present in Luke 's confessionals ) . This is also not so uncommon in the US version - it was quite noticeable in S33 , especially in Zeke 's confessionals . Possibly it 's a matter of lightning , lense like Ben 's wild hair and their color may not look so good on the background with morning sunlight , hence they need to create a contrast . Also , if he was to be inserted in post-production his crazy noodly hair would be a dead giveaway if the greenscreen was used ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"IMO twists are fine at this point , still better then Advantage Fest that was GC . And I 'm glad that the `` dumb stuff the American version has n't seen '' is there , because it makes the series unique , not another carbon copy of the format . 24 people was overbearing at the start , and the edit of some early boots left something to desire , but given the people who went out first - they were n't that interesting anyway , and them going home was always against our [ ed/lo ] gic and we were truly blindsided that way . I 'm not really that mad that I have n't known Kate or Aimee very much . That time was spent on some people that are main characters of the season ( atm ) And I think that at this point I can say at least something about the characters , everybody left got at least a little of their personality shown , but some are given to us in a more subtle way ( like Peter ) . ALSO , I do n't think the alliances are that hard to follow , especially since in both tribes people split into two groups and paired up in them , which imo makes things only easier to follow ( like you know that Jericho is always with Luke , AK with Tessa , Locky with Tara , Henry with Jacqui and later her with Kent , etc . ) and every voteout is based on the fight of the two opposing forces for the people who are more or less in the middle , and they are presented to us so we know who is the deciding force .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

The thing I would like to know the most are the rules - how many teams , how many times they play with eachother , how many relegation spots are there , if there are any specific rules for foreigners etc . I would also really love to know what ( and how many ) teams are playing in Tonga Major League as of lately . These informations will be used in the process of creating a modification that would add Tongan football league into the game Football Manager 2017 . The creator of the mod said that there is too little information to be gathered about Tongan football to create a good mod for it . That 's why I am asking about it here , can you help somehow ? : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,CK2GameOfthrones,"Situation is - Arya has been rescued from Harrenhall , I 'm Robb , King InDaNorf . I 've invited over a certain Harry from the Vale to my court , which I 've later gave Moat Cailin . I 've betrohed him to Arya and the time has come - Arya 's 14 , she can marry the Harry . A `` regular '' marriage is an option but I wanted to push a matrilineal marriage but there 's a problem - Harry does n't want it only because Arya is `` unlikely to have children '' . That was a bit confusing for me so I checked her out with charinfo - she has a `` fertility '' of -99950 % ! We 're for sure not getting any babies from that ! What 's worse , Bran and Rickon suffer from the same deal . What should I do ? Wait 2 years more until Arya is 16 , her portrait updates and maybe something refreshes ? I 've searched around the web , I 've come to this that the fertility is to assure she wo n't be having children too fast ( same goes f.e . for Asha Greyjoy ) But seeing that it affects the `` missing '' Stark children ( Sansa i a-ok ) I 'm wondering if everything is alright with this situation . Also , I 've checked Arya 's fertility before , after finding her when she was around 10 - it has n't changed / updated since then . I also tried to force the marriage by neg_diplo commands and accepting with Harry but game crashed . So ... is there a solution ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

I have won the league and now I am at the start of Ligue 1 and I ca n't loan players like this ! My wage budget is very tight so I ca n't pay high wages .

I was looking forward to loaning out some players to help me stay in the league but it seems that i could only get somewhat decent reserves for my first team . Why clubs do n't want to loan me some players so they can play in a good league but when I 'm playing in the lower league - they loan me them without trouble and do n't even want me to pay any percent of their wages ( even when they 're transfer listed and are unwanted in the club , and earn 500k a year )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , that was a really fascinating season ! I really liked how you could see the storylines forming . Also , very strangely I could see some parallels to real life Survivor Fiji players ! Kendra being first out to weaken the alliance of younger ones , Gigi voted out because of being annoying just after her , I especially liked how the younger alliance at the first tribal voted Gigi as a obvious vote out to strenghten the team and were basically blindsided . Hunter got very unlucky , but the fact that he was n't very promient to the story really fits well with that Armando was really robbed of playing the game , Sylvia Kwan style I liked how Izumi was voted out because of her feud with Manuel who was more valuable at the time Ferris voted out because of his Rocky-like character Whitney being the one to strat picking the new tribe at the twist and essentailly chhosing her poison by being voted 5-1 Lee got a little BrantSteelle logic - fucked because he should reconnect with his old tribemates or the opposing ones but sadly there are some flaws in the simulation Manuel was a fun pre-merge villain , not a great player but if there was some drama he was always included Meili is the ideal boot for the merge , as she did n't do anything to that point , and was booted at the right time for the story , leaving us with a very interesting group Monty Dickinson was a real dick and I loved every little moment of it , he gave me some Randy vibes , would like to see him again maybe ? Libby was a good player , sadly go picked off because she was quite savvy Autumn was a typical `` the leader won immunity so vote out his ally '' Chris was a great character , great villain and quite a challenge beast , would like to see him return Joshua was an ally of Ji-Tae and Ashley , he seemed to trust them but got blindsided when Ji-Tae started to build his resume . Being a comedian I suppose he could be a social threat Ashley would probably be another victim of Ji-Tae 's flip . But on the bright side - you have a great candidate for a team captain when you get to the Phillipines ! Leah was such a drama queen , kind of like Abi Maria , most votes received yet still dragged to the end as a total goat , just like Cassandra in Fiji Ji-Tae was a great character and my pick going into this season , I liked how he stuck with the older alliance at the start , survived at Ravu with Joshua and Ashley , later jumping into Moto camp . He had a good plan going forward but I feel people may have felt betrayed at the end . He seemed to me to be a good strategist but lacking in skill to pull that all off . Regardless , I still loved him , would definitely be a pick for a Second Chance season - because his storyline needs a second chance And last but not least - Von . Member of the younger alliance at Ravu . Started off as a villain but later evolved into a more mature person . He survived everything that fate tossed him and somewhat fought till the end and without a single vote casted for him ! He had strategy , he had immunity wins and he had respect of the jury for what he achieved . Truly a fantastic winner , he reminded me of Jay from MvGX as he would be probably regarded in the same way if he won his season . Overall , fantastic season , this lengthy comment and the fact that I could remember thing about every single contestant just proves that this is a quality rarely achieved on this subreddit .

1Sopel6,survivor,"In the first episode , when they 're stranded on the beach for a day you see the castaways splitting up - one half ( the younger one ) went exploring the island and the second half ( the older one ) stayed behind and started building the shelter . What we were n't shown is that those two groups formed alliances , because no one had a clue what 's this seasons theme , etc . Also , it happend naturally as older ones were scared that if they do n't stick together the younger ones will boot them . The same went for the younger group . This is how two , big alliances of ~10 were formed - Explorers and Builders . Later , when the crew finally decided how to continue the season with 19 castaways , one person would divide the tribes and would join the losing one . That person was Sylvia - a member of the builders . Calculating her chances she decided to split the two alliances as evenly as she could so she would n't end up in a position with no allies , regardless of which tribe went to the Tribal Council . After that we have pretty much seen what happened next , although it 's quite a crucial plot point that was left out of the final edit , that would explain why some people bonded so easily ( like younger guys on new Ravu )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm not an english native speaker but I find the music behind the conversations much much more bearable than in the american one . I 'll give you that the splicing is quite obvious , with additional one second scenes that do n't really add any much power to the words or anything , but only show us the contestant in different place , setting , wearing different clothes which adds another level to this . I think that by not revealing the AK 's idol the episode only got better . With that reveal we would n't have gotten the Chicken Idol scene . Also , plot wise - without the reveal we kind of understood the situation of the rest of the tribe - `` does AK have an idol ? I guess he has . Or maybe Adam is playing us ? '' . Lastly , after all - the idol itself did n't amount to anything , it did n't negate any votes . The format includes many people , their thoughts and stories , all at the same time , but I 'm not worrying that much about it , I 'm sure we will get into those characters when they will start to matter . This is n't quite te American standard , where the winner is hamfisted and forshadeowed since the first episode . Hell , the previous winner of AUS Survivor for the most part was for the most part a supporting character , people did n't see her chances even after the merge hit . So I would n't worry that much about it all - afterall , what do you even want to hear from someone who is in the middle of the pecking order in the main alliance and is n't targeted ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes , someone went and rewatched the scene when Adam finds it , it was non-transferable",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Hmm , so aligning with Sasha saves you from the boot at F5 ? In that case I have a new theory , spend every round talking once to the person that is going to be eliminated and once to Sasha . It seems that an alliance with him is crucial to the game but does n't bring anything new after the alliance is formed . I only know that talking to Margo is pointless because she 's just depressed and you ca n't help her ( unless you can somehow save her through the conversations ) -- wait , is Margo voting too if the vote is 7-1 ? Also , what would happen if you allied with Vinni ? We know Sasha guarantees us F3 and finale with an idol . But what if Vinni 's `` storyline '' gives us something else . tbh I 've never talked to her Also , this is less a `` game '' and rather a digital art form for an expo . I bet this is n't about being on the right side etc because you ca n't be on the first run , only with outside knowledge . Also , every character is pretty one-dimensional - Karo is a superfan , Jo works hard , Sasha is nice but naive , Margo is a depressed pile of mess and so on . There is - some - massage there , not quite sure what , I 've watched a short interview with the creator ( and host ) of the game . It was n't very explaining but the basis is that like in game of Survivor you need to interact , think and in overall move forward in the dog eat dog world . Or so I think that was the intent . So there is no our - the real-life Survivor fans - way of winning as you do n't talk strategy and ca n't possibly be in control . You 're never in the control of the game . But through trial and error you can solve what path the game wants you to take . Also , I 'm curious if there is some theme of going against the rules , like if you would have stick to the path all of the players take you would have never found the HII . I wonder if there is something else hidden somewhere , mainly in the lodge by the entrence ( I purely base it on the fact that HII are n't just hidden in regular rooms , but like the library in some specific ones ) . Also , waht I 've noticed is the second dialog with Jo is always written as if you were talking to her after her second immunity win , as if we were meant to talk to her in an order ( but that may be just an oversight from the developer 's part ) . Also , the last thing is the 4th wall breaking host that in The Stanley Parable 's comments on you dicking around the place , I wonder how far can you push her limits . Ok , main takeaways * it 's possible that the way to win is allying with Sasha to not get booted at F5 and talking everyday to the contestant that is going to be elliminated to maybe get their sympathy and get votes from them * Maybe there is a way to save Margo ( after all , the host points out that you did n't do anything after her death , maybe it has some role , like keeping Margo in game changes the outcome ? ) * there may be some room to screw around with the came with the big space that is the museum and with the narrator that breaks the 4th wall . There may be something left to uncover , because as the narrator says - there is no way for us to win the game , no scenario like that . But on the other hand - by the game logic we were n't supposed to be in the game after F5 . So this game might be about outsmarting the game . * it 's unknown what happens when you ally with the finalist - Vinni",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"I found a hidden immunity idol , on the 5th floor , instead of going through the stairs go to the library , somewhere after that there should be stairs leading you to a piece like this from `` fire making '' challange Pick it up , continue , put it in the pedestal in the voting room . The vote should be Jo . I do n't know if this is the solution , first time I played it I also got voted out at F5 , later by running around I found the HI , played it , and Jo went out in a 5-1 vote out Then I continued , Nikola has been voted out , I 've got left with Vinni and Sasha , the only person I talked to for the whole game . I do n't know how to continue past that , Vinni wins immunity so it 's me or Sasha and Vinni votes me . I do n't know what should be done , I have a few ideas * talk to Sasha till you make an alliance with him , later switch to Vinni * talk to Sasha and when asked , advise him to quit * I 've noticed that after the tribal I 've found the HII the floor that I 've found it on - 5th - started to burn down . Later , on the day that I 've been voted out the 4th floor started to burn down . I do n't know if a HII is hidden there ? When I tried to look for it the host said she 's tired of it and reused the `` break the wall '' challange , but it was impossible to beat * Normally it seems that you go out if you do not play the idol after the fourth challange , but when I played no votes were cancelled and Jo went 5-1 . Probably it 's how it 's supposed to be but maybe you can keep the idol and play it on the FTC and single handedly vote out Sasha I 'm probably somewhere close to beating this game but I do n't think I want to go through the creepiness of it If someone is interested in the `` boot list '' , here it is ( it 's always the same thing but maybe it 's helpful to be on the good side of the votes ) Ellis Asla Dana Margo Karo ( pick up the HII ) Jo Nikola My tactic was to stick with Sasha and Jo , but she is n't the late gamer . Talk to Sasha from the start , when he talks about Solidarity do n't tell him that the ship is sinking , on the next convo he will become your ally . Two or three conversations later he will consider quitting . I do n't know , anymore , game is very creepy and artsy-fartsy but on the other end , it definitely creates some interest and being against the game itself is also interesting . ( the game outright tells you after the vote out you are normally meant to be going but you played your idol that you was n't going to get that far and there is nothing left for you ) Whew , that became a longer post then I intended but if someone wants to try and solve this game I 'd be more than happy to know how it ends .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Thanks for your insights but : 1 . I think in a normal Survivor enviroment the villains would rather break the main alliances ( pecking order etc ) and reorganize with them and getting the additional votes from the last heroes who would n't have any other better option - this is how blindsides are made 2 . The quotes would make it more obvious but there are limitations .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yay , my favorite actually won ! I guess those who say that he played a weak game do n't really get into these simualtions as I do Pre-merge was kind of fun , Fang was a diseaster unfolding , happily the more interesting people from Fang got into the first swap ca n't say much about three first boots other then they were kind of typical I 'm happy Cody went so early , I hated him Naomi and Kelli greatly integrated with the other Kota alliance who while counting the number , eliminated those who were opposing them pre-swap - Grace and Jack . Funny situation how they were swap-fucked when on paper they should be safe among their own Later on , on double elimination , Kelli and Naomi greatly baited the rest of Kotas and blindsided Rico , who was on of the physical pawns of Alice , good move on their part On Fang Scott just could n't escape - he was a quite fun , grumpy pre-merge villain imo , could get a shot at SC down the line , maybe ? After the next vote Fang alliances could n't work together and the tribe imploded , with Kelli once again surviving Nadia being the merge boot seems kinda fitting , she seamed to me to be a strong competitor and a scrappy player , could be dangerous Alice was such a diva , wrapping guys around her finger , while using them as pawns and eventually wanting to get rid off one of her meat shields , but Vincent turned on her and Colby went rogue , leaving her behind Vince 's blindside more significatn for the btrayal of Anne-Marie , she sensed the danger and protected herself from the boot The next episode was about rallying the troops between Anne Marie and Eric , two big characters thus far Anne Marie was a big breakout character , one to return , thats for sure - she was a great villainous schemer at the same time , very rootable , she caused some drama , manouvered strategically . The finale 5 was a quite enjoyable bunch - Colby , thus far a pawn in other 's games , Sarah , an old kickass lady , Naomi and Kelli , a duo with trust issues and Eric , ( for me at least ) a Todd-like player Colby was booted , quite unceremoniously , I think that was done to not ruin the alliances that were going on - Eric with Naomi both keeping Sarah and Kelli on their sides , I think that everyone thought they had a plan and this just was n't the time to make the final move , as Colby was basically a free agent At Final 4 , Naomi finally woke up and wanted to make the last move that counts , recruited by Sarah she saw Kelli as an underdog story that could win the jury . On the other end Eric and Kelli , while being more strategic knew that it was going to be either of them so they teamed up and voted for a big jury threat - old Sarah . At this point I think only Naomi was out of the running for the title . Kelli got beaten in the firemaking and surprisingly that was the best outcome for Eric As to the votes at FTC - i loved the bitter throwaway Anne Marie 's vote for Naomi , because she was bittter to both of their blindsiders xD Roy has voted for Sarah as she was his tribemate ( also , I do n't think he was very inept in the game so I 'd guess that would be a good explanation ) Vincent was a close ally of Sarah , so it 's no wonder taht he stayed loyal and voted for her And , as to the winner - Eric . He had put on the jury Alice , who liked him more than other ( no wonder as for the whole season , she was sticking with the guys , it 's also a funny characteristic for her character ) Kelli admired Eric because he was the best strategist , after her . He also smooth talked his way to the win at the jury questions and swayed two lone guns - Nadia and Colby - to his side . I enjoyed that win , it was a very Todd-like As for returnee posibilities FvF - Alice and Scott Second Chances - Kelli , Sarah HvV - Anne Marie , Eric ( both villains , but Eric is more like an anti-hero - Todd , Sandra and Natalie A style )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , well , here 's a legend to your series ; ) I 'm dissapointed with the winner , at least Edmund was looking quite reasonable and was a character ( Kristen , Tanesha and Blake voted for him and they were the best jurors ) but oh well , you can say he was blindsided at the finale ! ( I think that he got too comfortable , looked upon himself as the leader of such successful tribe , but probably lost Sofia 's vote , as she thought he would n't ever betray her ) Kristen was a good villain with epic blindside , maybe you can fix her a spot somewhere Tanesha is simply a villain legend , I understand that as a creator you were rooting for her to win it all , just as Probst was rooting for Stephenie but her boot was inevitable Doreen is in fact a good SC candidate , but I do n't know what rules do you follow but she may be `` too old '' for SC - maybe a spot on Heroes tribe ? She had a very strange story I liked Edmund , maybe a little too confident but maybe he could return as a Favorite ? Blake was also good but nothing that really stood out imo he was good character for the season but I do n't see too much sense in him returning .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I think it works because it references to overall people 's traits so the theme is n't forces on the players as they practically do n't change their playstyle or personality - Kyle Jason , Scott Pollard and Cliff Robinson would always play like jocks , Spencer Garrett and David would always play like smartasses , etc . Also , characteristics like these make people on the tribes really gel together . WA is n't exactly the same . It 's similiar in the way but BvBvB theme bases on the overall characteristics - from personalities ( Alecia is feisty hence is a Brawn , Tai has amazing positivness and joy of life hence is a ( n inner ) Beauty ) to their jobs ( Sarah is a cop and brawn is the characteristic of the job , Peter is a doctor so he clearly must be an intelectual ) ending with simply their looks ( Anna , Lindsey , Aubry ) WA takes only one characteristic into consideration - the job . It 's just one link to the other format but it gives slightly different group HvHvH seems to be taking into consideration the personality and life motivation but I do n't know if it is n't too wide of a characteristic to create groups that would gel together . IMO they should try again with the collar themes to see if with better cast it can produce a better season . The cast of HvHvH would be pretty much set to the theme , maybe with a few changes in the cast",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Yeah , I would say we do , more and more every year as the generation that was born after the fall of communism is growing bigger . That generation also learns english .

Electronic music also is quite popular , mostly the british ones . ( But check our polish band [ The Dumplings ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Me_AJzcqOcg ) as they 're called `` the voice of the young polish generation '' ) Also , you know , pop and rap music . `` Core '' music is pretty much niche , but from them metalcore is the most popular here for sure ( mostly british band as they 're closer so they tour more often ) . But post-hc bands like Enter Shikari , Dance Gavin Dance , A Day To Remember , Bring Me The Horizon or Chiodos have some ( bigger or smaller ) recognition around here . And everyone is learning english because it is world 's most communicative language right now . Just as in past , in Europe it was latin or french .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Also forgot to correct - I dig the whole intrumentation of your band , really great alone , but the violin is what spotlights you from the crowd , so with good mixture of your nice riffs , your vocalists range and voice , that sweet bass as in `` Stronger Walls '' , your great drums AND violin on top of that you can be the pioneers of post-rock post-hardcore path .

Other great story involved a player that I got mid season that got really butthurt about a player that was loaned a season before and later sold . He was 21 yo defender , so okay , you may say that i sold a youngster , I 'll take that , but the player who was angry about it ( and nearly turned the whole team against me ) have n't even spend a day in the same club with the sold player , they did n't even know eachother and were n't even from the same continent !

Also , unclean vocals are present on this track too ( around 3:30 , followed with breakdown ) . They also use harsher vocals , not necessarily pure scream , but a shout/yell .

To be honest this is so far a friends label ( Oranges played shows with Stolas since 2012 ) with only Eidola and Adventurer being out of the DGD friends circle . I dig this song and I believe that Oranges are talented so I 'm okay with that , but BSR really needs to branch out in genres IMHO Someone suggested thath they should sign some hip-hop artists and I messaged them about Hyro Da Hero , who 's living in CA , made music with members of At The Drive-In and The Blood Brothers and is looking for label . Sadly , my message has never been even opened . I would love to see bands like VIS , Visitors , Microwave , Wayne Szalinski or Makari being picked up by some label but probably not by BSR .

F.e . Jon Mess sings about Starcraft II in `` Jesus H. Macy '' , graphical programming in `` Demo Team '' , `` pink and purple t-shirts '' mentioned in `` Need Money '' are only worn by `` real man '' , personal life , thoughts and himself in overall So as you can see , maybe there is some meaning behind his babbling .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"'Plan B ' was a colaborative work of Sacramento arstists to make something big and epic . But do you imagine how would they stick around with so many band members ? It 's just hard to operate with so many different people - get them in one place at given time just to practice . You need to remember that artists are also people with their own lives and problems . They 're crafting their own style as they want it , there are still some of the sounds that resemble these present on the Plan B in their later albums . If they would stay in the same formula , you could 've called them `` repetetive '' . What they 're doing is progression , doing something new . Michael Franzino did n't had to record solo because band did n't let him utilize his ideas in ALLB songs , he just wanted to make a solo album because the whole idea behind alone . originated from his breakup and he wanted to express his emotions and feelings through the music . But it 's HIS story , he is just a guitarist , not a singer , he just wanted to make this his own , personal stuff . He wanted to make this alone .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few methods 1 . I pick a tag I like and if the tag is big enough there will be four `` Hyped artists '' , by that you can find new and coming bands and also bands that released f.e . albums recently ( not to mention the section of `` Top Artists '' ) 2 . Recommended artists , you can find this on the main site , if you click to see more you will be presented with six pages of artist that you may like , also , last.fm will compare them to the artists that you have in your library so you can judge if you may like something by their similarities to the bands you already like ( If you go to the bands page and click on `` add to library '' or a plus icon on the right side of the page you will add them to your library so you can remember about them and check them out later . These bands are also counted while presenting you recommended music so you can dig deeper and deeper into the sound that you like and might build up a long list of bands to check out later ) 3 . Looking at similiar artists you like but it 's based for every user individually so it kinda works the same as the recommended music . Also , explore new tags of music that you 're unknown to you but you dig a band from that genre . 4 . Checking out the bands our favorite bands are playing shows with , by looking at who Rise Against toured in the past I 've found out about Architects and Touche Amore 5 . Stalk your friends . If I find someone that is listening to a lot of new music I visit their profiles often and look at what they 're listening lately ( in a month , in a week ) that is also a great source of new music If you want to you can dig through [ mine ] ( http : //www.last.fm/user/Sopel_1/library ) last.fm library and look for some cool sounding or looking band , maybe you 'll find something new ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

But I still dig it The Bank Of England and There Is A Price On Your Head were something new from the band 's sound IMO and it eventually rooted on me .

Would they depart to Blue Swan and release an album or two to get some funds to the label ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

936535898,Fuckthealtright,"& gt ; A `` literal nazi '' was someone in Germany during the third Reich who participated in the extermination of 6 million Jews and millions of homosexuals and minority individuals Or an old man born in 1860 , who was a fierce supporter of NSDAP and obviously too old to kill anyone . Also , & gt ; Between 1933 and 1945 , an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals , of whom some 50,000 were officially sentenced . [ 1 ] Most of these men served time in regular prisons , and an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 of those sentenced were incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps . [ 1 ] It is unclear how many of the 5,000 to 15,000 eventually died in the camps , but leading scholar Rüdiger Lautmann believes that the death rate of homosexuals in concentration camps may have been as high as 60 % . Homosexuals in the camps were treated in an unusually cruel manner by their captors .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
