2ntle,europe,"The comment on the end of the article drives the right point home that was not covered by the author : \\n\\n & gt ; From my personal experience and studies ( currently writing my thesis in Balkan history ) , this almost makes it out that those Serbs in Vukovar are totally innocent bystanders in the war and the current issue surrounding Cyrillic script . Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997 , two years after the war officially ended . Whilst in Serb hands , the Latin Script was banned . Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas . These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places . These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes . Under international pressure , Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape , murder , torture , theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated . Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims . This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society , thus we have a culture of separation ( cafes , shops , schools etc ) . Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County . For example , at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there . So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not . There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"Some parts from article . \\n\\n & gt ; This is more difficult to do than it sounds because the media\u2019s narrative about Le Pen\u2019s rise has been hysterical . The next two weeks will feature more of the same : articles decrying the potential end of Western civilization , the rise of fascism , and the potential unleashing of the horrors of Europe\u2019s past across the Continent once more . Many who never much cared about France will spontaneously generate opinions about how the West\u2019s hopes now rest on Macron\u2019s shoulders . If Le Pen wins , it will be the French Devolution . If she loses , complacency will set in , and Macron the empty suit will take up residence at the Palais de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e . He will continue status quo policies that in five years will bring us right back to where we started \u2013 or perhaps worse.\\n\\n & gt ; The key questions no one is asking are : Why did Le Pen oversee the expulsion of her father from the National Front , and why has she worked so hard to exorcise the party\u2019s most radical positions ? Stated differently , does Le Pen control her constituents , or do her constituents control her ? The answer to this question is important because it is the difference between the National Front being a reanimation of the worst of 20th century European history and a 21st century political party attempting to respond to economic , political and security challenges while still operating within the framework of liberal democratic norms . If the masses control Le Pen , we\u2019re back in the 20th century . If Le Pen controls the masses , we\u2019re still in our own century.\\n\\n & gt ; The second issue for these voters is immigration , and by extension , radical Islam . Three days before the election , on April 20 , a shooting happened on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that was claimed by the Islamic State . Paris and Nice suffered horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by radical Islamists in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . Le Pen\u2019s platform addresses this in two ways . First , she wants to strengthen the rule of law . She plans to do this by hiring more police , building more jails , and shutting down mosques with ties to radical Islam . Second , she wants to crack down on illegal immigration . This means curbing asylum requests and introducing more stringent naturalization requirements . Le Pen also plans to limit legal migration to 10,000 people per year . One may disagree with Le Pen\u2019s approach , but not with the fact that a problem exists and previous French governments have failed to address it.\\n\\n & gt ; Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man says , \u201cMen are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d Article 3 says , \u201cThe principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation.\u201d This is a contradiction . Article 1 is universalist ; it does not say \u201cFrench men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d It says all individuals enjoy these unalienable rights . But on the same page , Article 3 becomes pragmatic , attempting to ensure these rights are protected . Without enforcement , rights are abstractions . The individual may have rights , but we do not live in a world of individuals . We live in a world of political communities . The French nation is Le Pen\u2019s political community , and her policy is to defend it . For her detractors , Le Pen\u2019s great crime is that she does not consider it France\u2019s responsibility to ensure the unalienable rights of all men . For her supporters , she is the defender of the unalienable rights of French men , and to ask France to do more is to ask the impossible.\\n\\n & gt ; There is a dark side to France , as there is a dark side to all countries . But Le Pen is not a slave of the masses . She is a political pragmatist who is holding back something far worse , and she knows what the \u201csomething far worse\u201d is because she tried to exorcise it from her own party last year . This election is important because of what it indicates about the future of Europe . That future hangs on the nation-state\u2019s ability to respond to the concerns of individuals . We have seen what happens when it can\u2019t , and the result was far more disruptive than a French nationalist becoming the newest president of the Fifth Republic .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; First , there is the growing number of economically underperforming Muslim youths in Europe . This is traditionally a pool from which extremist groups recruit , and Hegghammer writes that this population looks set to continue to grow dramatically thanks to immigration and higher birth rates . Entrenched economic disadvantages will likely stop many young Muslims from gaining the full benefits of modern European societies.\\n\\n & gt ; The second , more important trend is the growing number of \u201cjihadi entrepreneurs\u201d \u2014 returned foreign fighters and other activists \u2014 who could inspire and recruit a new generation of European extremists . Hegghammer conservatively estimates there are now at least 2,000 radical Islamists in Europe with foreign fighter experience , time in prison , or both . While some may turn away from jihadism in the future , a small proportion will not.\\n\\n & gt ; The third and fourth factors relate not just to Europe , but to the broader world . Hegghammer suggests that persistent conflicts in the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia look \u201cset to supply European jihadis with both rallying causes and training opportunities for the foreseeable future , as it has in the past.\u201d Many experts believe that the conflict in Syria may still have a long way to go and that groups like the Islamic State will be very hard to fully defeat . The group could be training and blooding potential European attackers for years to come.\\n\\n & gt ; Compounding this problem is the final factor : the Internet . The Internet has considerable benefits for extremist groups , Hegghammer suggests , serving as a tool for \u201cpropaganda distribution , recruitment , fundraising , reconnaissance , and operational coordination.\u201d The rise of encrypted communications and social media have made it harder for authorities to keep up .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; Poland\u2019s history can easily be summed up as a continuous struggle against invasions and divisions . The country\u2019s geopolitical significance stems from its location between Russia and Germany . We have written about the challenges that both Russia and Germany will face in 2017 ; these challenges also pose unique problems for Poland , which is economically and militarily vulnerable . Recent developments have also helped Poland lay the groundwork for its eventual emergence as a regional power , as stated in our 2040 forecast.\\n\\n & gt ; Considering Poland\u2019s relatively small economy , which gives it more room to maneuver , the decline in German exports could become an opportunity for Poland to maintain and increase its export competitiveness . Technology transfers have accompanied Western investment in the country , and with continued support for national research and innovation and its relatively well educated and cheap workforce , Poland could remain competitive on the global market . One major challenge Poland faces in the medium to long term is its demographic situation , which limits its potential because the country has the second fastest aging population in Europe . But the success of socio-economic policies that drive competitiveness is dependent on political stability.\\n\\n & gt ; With Western Europe disinclined to prioritize any potential Russian threats , Poland is slowly acting as a small regional leader by working with countries to establish and support common initiatives such as defense against Russia . Within the EU , Poland will continue to be the leading voice of Eastern Europe , distancing itself from the EU\u2019s Western European members . Warsaw has been the main challenger of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project proposed by Russia , effectively blocking it when the country\u2019s anti-monopoly agency stopped the formation of the project\u2019s consortium . Seeing that Belarus wanted to improve relations with the EU to access European markets , and considering Belarus\u2019 dependence on Russia\u2019s slowing economy , Warsaw has worked to improve ties with Minsk . Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in October and said a new chapter in Polish-Belarusian relations had been opened . The two countries have economic incentives to develop closer ties , and Poland will likely take advantage.\\n\\n & gt ; Trapped between Russia and Germany , Poland is aware of Russia\u2019s increasing assertiveness and NATO\u2019s challenges , including its members\u2019 differing security interests . In the short term , Poland will likely feel the impact of Germany\u2019s economic slowdown . Adaptation to the new reality of a declining Western Europe will not be easy or fast . The current administration will continue to seek the right balance between extending control over the economy and political institutions , and making sure its public approval ratings remain high . Considering the country\u2019s defense imperatives , Warsaw will keep building strong ties with the U.S. and develop its regional leadership posture by working with Eastern Europeans on different levels.\\n\\n & gt ; Poland usually only makes mainstream news in the West when it has conflict with the EU over specific policies or when massive government protests erupt . The much more subtle and important thing to be aware of is how Poland is beginning to behave like a small regional leader . Warsaw will see increased tensions with Western Europe , and Germany in particular , partly due to economic problems , but mostly because of diverging views on security priorities . Increased Russian assertiveness will force Poland to invest in and make the most of regional alliances .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

In mid XIX century . Why do you think both languages have 30 letters , same grammar and why Croatian Latin and Serbian Latin scripts are identical and why both are phonetic languages etc ? \\n\\nThis I already addressed in my original post and clarified it in my second . I think I was pretty clear.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Also Croatian language had two-three purges , especially around WWI and WWI and recently in the \\'90s.\\n\\nCroatian had a few \ '' purges\ '' , but not like you think . They were never about targetting \ '' Serbisms\ '' ( are there really any ? ) , but loanwords in general . It\\ 's a lot like French puritanism . I\\ 'll give you the WWII one , their agenda was pretty obvious and I would not put past them that their goal was to \ '' remove Serb\ '' in every sense . However , WWI was a load of crap , since it never happened . Indeed , there was a lot of new words introduced in that period ( say 1850s-1910s ) , but it was , again , just to remove loanwords from Standard in general , primarily **Hungarian** and **German** since there were loads of them . No one had Serbia in mind , but some had Yugoslavia - which goes back to political tampering with languages due to agenda . Some words caught on , some didn\\'t ( as always ) .\\n90\\ 's was about reintroducing the words that fell out of use due to Yugoslavia ( people had to adhere to the Standard set by Novosadski dogovor which was mentioned here already , and abberations were definitely not tolerated , hence I called it forced instead of voluntarily ) . Some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in a sense two languages were more similar before WWII.\\n\\nYes , and after . WWII-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical Croatian language.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; For example did you ever heard of Miroslav Krleza ? \\n\\nOf course.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The greatest Croatian writer who ever lived ? \\n\\nWhile he is no doubt a great writer , that\\ 's debatable . There\\ 's a slew of great Croatian writers and I\\ 'm glad I can\\'t pick one so easily . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe sounds familiar ? \\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Heard about his book \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' from 1932 ? Yeah \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' , not \\'\\'Tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt\\'\\'\\n\\nWhat\\ 's the point ? You\\ 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . That\\ 's massive reaching and does you a disservice.\\nYou also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards Yugoslavian unity . \\nI doubt you ever read any of his works , but I did and there\\ 's nothing too different from today\\ 's Croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . \\n\\nJust check his \ '' Balade Petrice Kerempuha\ '' and see if you still want to claim Croatian and Serbian are the same.\\n\\nBut since you were so eager to bring Krle\u017ea up , I have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ \ '' Declaration about the name and position of Croatian literaly language\ '' ] ( https : //hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo % C5 % BEaju_hrvatskog_knji % C5 % BEevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ Novosadski sporazum ] ( https : //sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosadski_dogovor ) . So , he would very much disagree with you.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' hiljadu\ '' would be considered \ '' Serbism\ '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in Croatia\\n\\nNo , you wouldn\\'t . I\\ 've known people who freely used \ '' hiljadu\ '' when talking to teachers of Croatian language.\\nBesides , \ '' hiljadu\ '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from Greek language ) , not a \ '' Serbism\ '' . Really , are there any Serbisms ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by Croatian linguists , just to be as different from Serbian as possible.\\n\\nAgain incorrect . A lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . Google Bogoslav \u0160ulek , Adolfo Veber Tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Learn yer history bruh.\\n\\n\ '' Bruh\ '' , I know my history just fine . I don\\'t want to comment on your knowledge of Serbian ( I don\\'t really care ) , but your knowledge about Croatian history is frankly atrocious and it\\ 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a Croatian.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; We use both \ '' hleb\ '' and \ '' kruh\ '' , both \ '' vazduh\ '' and \ '' zrak\ '' , both \ '' sargarepa\ '' and \ '' mrkva\ '' etc . Bosnian and Serbian went for language richness , while Croatian went for language purity.\\n\\nVazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in Croatia . Not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into Standard . On the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in conclusion , no , Yugoslavia didn\\'t forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . \\n\\nIt\\ 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , I feel , based on your wishes . The idea of Yugoslavia **and** Yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . There\\ 's no denying it .

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; Well , I replied to a comment in regards to why Bosnia and Croatia are two different countries while Slavonia and Dalmacia aren\\'t.\\n\\nBecause of historical reasons . When you look at the maps of former empires , you\\ 'll notice that borders between Bosnia and Croatia were almost the same , they were borders of Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\\n\\n & gt ; So why religion ? Well , let\\ 's be honest.. A lot of seemingly insane views of other people have been caused by religion . So I guess I\\ 'm just trying to figure out if that\\ 's where it comes from down there . I mean , religion caused the killings of \ '' witches\ '' , gays , women ( doing anything wrong . ) , other religious groups etc . so \\n\\nReligion is not the point here . While religion had some part in formation of some nations ( primarily Serbs and Bosniaks/Muslims , to some extent Croatians ) , the problems were more of cultural/national/historical rather than religious . \\nCroatians were never very exclusive religion-wise , as you also had protestant , orthodox , etc . Croats . Heck , one of the orthodox was a famous writer during the national spring.\\n\\nFurthermore , even Croatian nazis considered Muslims to be Croats and they didn\\'t persecute them per se . For example , they turned one of the galleries in Zagreb in a [ mosque ] ( http : //media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/11-zagreb2-450.jpg ) . Those nazis also organised Croatian Orthodox Church.\\n\\nLooking at the religion as a source of all problems is a lazy and ignorant view , but the simplest of them - which is why so many people are prone to it.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I suppose it might explain some of the tensions down there if everyone was like 110 % serious about their religions and believed every word of their holy books.. \\n\\nWhat year is it ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; To me it simply doesn\\'t make sense to think that someone living 10 miles away ( Across a border ) is so different\\n\\nI left out the second part because it\\ 's a stereotypical nonsense.\\n\\nThe thing is because of cultural influence . Bosnia and Herzovina/Serbia were dominated by Ottomans and it shows , whereas the Croatians coast was always under the Italian influence . Northern Croatia ( Northwest particulary ) was under heavy Austrian influence . So , this is from where a lot of cultural ( and linguistical if you\\ 'd be looking into the dialects ) differences emerge.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest , a northern Croatian is more likely to get beat in southern Croatia than a Serbian or some other nationality . Just a few days ago there were some news of players getting beaten . So , all these rambles about Serbians/whateverelses fearing for their lives because they\\ 're so special is nonsense , since Croatians may get the very same treatment . Why ? Because assholes . You got plently of them as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why do Croatians care if someone\\ 's wearing a Serbian tourist t-shirt in Croatia for example ? \\n\\nThey rather don\\'t , they got other things on their mind to worry about rather than who\\ 's wearing what.\\n\\n & gt ; We don\\'t beat up people wearing German , English , Swedish or whatever football jerseys here for example..\\n\\nWe don\\'t do it either , other than hooligans , but they are more of an international problem ( see Dutch hooligans destroying Italian works of art , etc . ) and it\\ 's no worse than in other European countries . And these hooligans won\\'t beat just the foreigners , but anyone else who\\ 's not of their liking . Your viewpoint is very distorted .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Because of circlejerking .

Why ? Because it\\ 's not that important.\\nWhich again brings me to ... \\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t have a view.\\n\\nC\\'mon , you have some view .

They base their story around a picture and reddit user , without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources . It\\ 's basically like you saw it on reddit.\\n\\n\\nThis is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they\\ 're going to only go by the words of reddit users . \\nIn this case , nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners.\\n\\n\\nI find english articles about Croatia generally of poor quality , and often scarce and misleading.\\n\\nFor example , when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban , which was fairly covered , a lot of these sites were saying that 65 % of Croatians voted for banning of gay marriage.\\n\\nHowever , 65 % of those who went to vote voted for banning , and only 38 % of voter base went voting . But of course this gets no mention.\\nThis can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65 % of Croatians are against gays/gay marriages , while in reality the referendum wouldn\\'t even pass if it weren\\'t for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the EU referendum.\\n\\nI also remember reading an Economist article on Croatian elections , where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates ( which were used by common people in Croatia ) , which is just a huge low for a media.\\n\\nAlso , a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts.\\n\\nCroatia doesn\\'t get reported on often , and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it , I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; No , I may have some media created assumptions , but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there ? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region ? \\n\\nDrop the \\'region\\ ' and replace with \\'Croatia\\ ' and I\\ 'll agree , but otherwise no . I always hated this collectivism regarding ex-Yugoslavia , since it simply can not be under the same denominator . There\\ 's a reason it didn\\'t work , the differences are there . Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ? Unfortunately , it happens too many times.\\n\\n\\nSomething you may not be aware of , and that contributed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor .
