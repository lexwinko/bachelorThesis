1010x,russia,"May/Early June is perfect for the first visit . May 9 is a great choice , since the weather is guaranteed to be great thanks to some aviation magic and you get to see one of the world 's biggest military parades , although there 's going to be a lot of people and you may not get to see it in its full glory . Plus in May ( and summer as a whole ) , everyone is really friendly and you can actually see people smiling . Christmas or winter time in general is a whole other story . For me , Moscow in winter and in summer are two completely different places . In winter , people are generally less happy and the environment around you can get depressing . The general exception is the several weeks before New Year and the New Year itself since Moscow will get decorated in really beautiful lights , Christmas trees all over place , there are public events and New Year markets and the city itself is covered in a beautiful layer of snow which can be amazing unless you live in a similar snowy country . I 'd suggest May for the first trip and late December for the second one .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

1010x,hoi4,"I just saw last week 's developer 's stream of Kaiserreich where they are playing Russia and was disappointed on how uneventful it was . When I chose Russia during my first game of Kaiserreich , I decided to restore a rightful monarchy and made all the according choices , however , I got really screwed mid-way . Obviously , I had a 'Disaster ' stability and almost zero national unity , as well as huge shortage of infantry equipment . First , Soviet Union spawned in the western part of Russia . A Civil War , great ! I was completely unprepared for that so I had to consolidate all my troops throughout the territory and wait for them to unite along the front which took a lot of time and cost me in a lot of territories . My unarmed infantry was practically useless in offensive so I just held the line and hoped for the best , waiting for the planning bonuses and more infantry equipment . After a few months , I started an offensive and it was going great , Soviets were losing and I felt victorious . However , that did not last long as I got a telegram from Siberia , stating that they are seceding , permanently . I could not allow more divided Russia , so I had to declare war on them . I could n't actually start conquering Siberia right away , so I took 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive and put them in Ural mountains , hoping that they would hold until they can get reinforcements from the west after I 've dealt with Soviets . Soviets were still losing , but not as fast as I wanted them to , so the offensive was going really slowly but fortunately , the Siberian AI was indecisive and did n't push into my undermanned border which they could easily do . I slowly moved into Soviet territories , the victory was not near but it was almost assured , but then I got a telegram from the south : Don - Kuban union declared a war on me , damned cossacks wanted more land to pillage ! I had to take another 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive just to protect the Southern borders from the barbarians . Same as in Siberia , I also could n't launch a direct assault , so they just had to hold the line until I dealt with the Red Menace . My Soviet Offensive was becoming more and more undermanned , but it was still going strong : after all , people believed in their tsar and his Divine Authority . Russian armies were fighting on three fronts , severely underpowered and underarmed , so it could n't get much worse , could it ? Well , it could and it did . Right as I was pushing into Petrograd 's territories , the Tsar received another telegram : the King of Finland was asking for their `` rightful '' territories : pretty much all the land East of Finland .

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"Mein Kampf did not introduce any new ideas to the stage of Europe . MANY people were anti-Semitic in those days , which is one of the reasons why the book was n't shunned off in the first place , many North Americans also read the book and agreed with its ideas . ( If an idea is n't popular , then it would of never grown ) The Holocaust was not derived from Mein Kampf ; as it was stated by Hitler during the declaration of war to America , and the Holocaust was set up by Reinhard Heydrich and Himmler ( The two worst Nazis to have ever lived ) I have read the book for educational purposes and do not recall the Holocaust that Europe experienced being in the book . You can not blame the Wehrmacht for ignorance for what they fought for ( knowing and not knowing ) , as in the end : Humans are evil . EVERY nation has committed atrocities ( my heritage of Russia committing some of the worst ) and remember- History is written by the victors . D-DAY should remember all the fighters in the war , the allied forces also contributed terrible things in the war such as , Civilian Air Raids ( the bombing of Berlin was proposed by Churchill , and Hitler used this to bolster his support for the bombing of London ) the Dachau Massacre , the rape of Berlin , and the nuclear bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima )",Balto-Slavic,Russian

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"A number is still a number , both sides committed equal horrible acts in various ways . There is many more acts that I did not include for the allied side . ( I 'm sure the Axis have a very long list also ) Both of the sides did terrible things , the only difference is number BUT not morality . If the Allied forces are remembered for what they did , why not the Germans for what they did ?

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"Number is not a factor of what was committed during WW2 , it is the morality , and both sides did terrible things . The soldiers who fought for the war were put into those positions , many soldiers did not fight for what Hitler represented ( those were the SS and Waffen SS ) , many of the soldiers who fought in WW2 were already in the army and put into the war , and many of them were conscripted . ( The Nazis went far enough to put old men and children during the end of the war onto the battlefront ) We were not born in that era and we have no right to state why the Germans did what they did , but they were bullied around immensely after WW1 , as they were publicly humiliate for a war they did not start ( Austria started it ) and were bullied and harassed by the french before WW2 begun .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

( Pretty much black & amp ; anyone who is n't white , since they are the most easy to be visibly see ) Many countries such as France , Italy , Russia ( of course ) , Germany , and more have become prone to more and more right-wing parties against immigration . How does this make you feel ?

When I was in Westfall I met some friends who were killing those pesky hunting machines and we teamed up , became friends , and years later we are still friends .

Right now project cost more to maintain than it bring back - because it does n't have enough attention due to low funds : it literally can be interesting only as a form of fund with big sum in it . Project in question is http : //moredoge.com/ It is a `` dice '' / casino site which work for ~1.5 months already . I did n't advertise the site anywhere but in couple niche sub-reddits , site got handful of players , replies were mostly positive : http : //www.reddit.com/r/dogebetting/comments/2ftmhe/moredogecom_shibefriendly_dice_site_with/ Advertisement was so humble because I wanted to see reaction and behavior of players , real level of profitability compared to investments and advertisement expenses + there is n't enough prize funds for `` full-scale '' advertisement campaign in dedicated gambling communities . However during this period site was tested and developed further ( jackpot , partial jackpot , chat , affiliate program ) , and now it is stable , protected from DDoS attacks ( there were couple already ) and use HTTPS protocol ( premium CloudFlare account ) . Site is somewhat pleasurable to use and there were some really interesting visitors / players who bet up to 50k doges per single bet on other sites - for example J_Roc - but they left since bankroll was only 500k ( +1M in jackpot ) and bank could n't afford bets above ~500 doges ( I 've artificially lowered maximum income per bet by x2 factor to protect investment of my only present investor ) . So income from the site is only around 10k doges , but that 's approximately 50 % of all deposits players made during this month so you can get a clue - how profitable it could be ? Site has transparent statistic and investment information ( links are on interface ) + top losses and winning series and bets ( I 'll add weekly/monthly statistic - besides hourly stats - when more data will be available ) . As you probably know similar sites have hundreds of millions and billions doges in prize funds - but for this project it could be nice to offer to players at least $ 1-2 income per bet so I 'm looking for ~5 millions dogecoins ( 4M to go ) in bankroll before starting advertisement in dedicated gambling communities and on bigger cryptocurrency forums such as bitcointalk.org . Income shares planned as 60/30/10 between investors/jackpot/developer . Unlike on sites with huge bankrolls on MoreDoge.com you can get substantial part of income with relatively small sums ( for example 4M would yield ~50 % of total income - compared to ~1.5 % for a site with 250M bankroll ) .

3dom,MMORPG,Avatars graphic is on par with ArcheAge and GW2 . Animations are superb - including articulation . I was surprised because animations were really clunky in videos 6 months ago . Interesting part was an ability to choose running style - from anime-ish girly variant to relaxed jogging and sprinting . It seems we have first MMO game development company which realized running is important since we see avatars running like 80 % of time and it can make of break impressions about the game .,Balto-Slavic,Russian

3dom,EliteTraders,"Removed weapons , class 3 shield , fuel scoop ( for rare goods or emergencies ) . 100t cargo . 18.7LY jump range loaded . started with A FSD and later upgraded everything to A grade since I have to accumulate 17M+ cash anyway ( to get Type 7 ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

3dom,EliteTraders,This is [ on first page of `` gameplay & amp ; features '' section ] ( https : //forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php ? t=68771 ) .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,It 's not the station - it 's whole system . I got 27t of ant glue in Zeesze before patch - none of 3 stations in the system have it in stock now ( 2 of them have sale price for the item ) . It seems some genius in FD has decided doing ten 15LY jumps to sell 5-10 items in cargo - it 's normal gameplay . But perhaps there was another idea behind rare goods - like additional guaranteed ( very ) small income while doing delivery missions to nearby systems ? ...,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,"For those who are not familiar with the situation it sounds like you did it in 10 minutes . Perhaps you should mention `` run '' consisted of 1-2 hours of station camping , 40-50 minutes of jumping 150LY+ away ( 10-20 jumps ) with occasional interdictions , fuel scooping , accidental overheating and damage - using multiple third party tools to find route and destination . Now we are supposed to do the same job ( sans station camping ) with 10 items in inventory - for 160k .",Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,"In-game news feed has published couple articles few minutes ago - they hint on more slavery systems around ( Ngun , Kuyu , etc ) so it must be going .",Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,11 items for Type-6 with 100t . I 'm not going to jump around to accumulate cargo and then transport it 10+ jumps away so activity is pretty much dead to me now . Nerf on second day after release - this is the record so far .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,I 've started with the rare goods yesterday because everything else is either bugged or unfinished or boring or tedious . The only real effect FD got in my case - I just switched to other games until FD will introduce actually fun gameplay which wo n't require me to repeat exactly the same procedure 70+ times to upgrade FSD on Asp ( and there are 5 other modules to upgrade afterwards ! ),Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,http : //www.elitetradingtool.co.uk/ = & gt ; click `` Rare Trades '' = & gt ; Azure milk = & gt ; check distances to 5 goods nearby . Must be enough to fill Cobra or half of Type-6 . Apparently this is new rare goods gameplay - jumping into nowhere with half-empty cargo .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,I 'm looking at results of work of this artificial `` intelligence '' right now : station - Mackenzie Relay in Cemiess - has high demand for slaves with average price 10800 credits per ton . These guys are agree to buy slaves for 5900 credits per ton ! Minimum selling price in nearby systems is 10300+ And this system is being advertised in news feed ( as source of good deals apparently ) ...,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,& gt ; For me over 150ly trip route took around 1 min to load and after that i could set the route . [ This tool ] ( https : //cmdr.club/routes/ ) does it almost instantly .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteDangerous,Today I 've seen a Python stuck in the entrance . Station did n't care enough to shoot it so I had to switch mode to be able to dock .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,I believe A5 FSD module for Asp cost 3.2M alone . And when I 've slapped 1.6M worth B5 module on this thing it got less range ( 16.5LY loaded ) than my maxed Type-6 ( 18.8LY loaded ) .,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,I 've guessed A5 price as B5*2 - I did n't see it in the station . Cost of B5 was so high I 've sold Asp immediately and switched back to Type-6 . In which system do you see A5 modules ?,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,If I 'll get rank in the Empire - will it affect relations with Alliance and Federation ?,Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,Shield-less Cobra can handle 60 tons - that 's 70k income per run with 1200cr profit or almost 110k if you 'll do slave trades with 1800cr profit . You 'll be able to upgrade to Type-6 in few hours and start those rare goods runs soon . ( note : iirc A FSD for Type-6 cost 1.6M ),Balto-Slavic,Russian
3dom,EliteTraders,"I am getting 610 + 520 credits per 12-14 minutes run ( same system , 800ls ) and part of me dies each time because it is only 0.5 % of the money I need to purchase next ship ( Type-7 ) with upgraded FSD .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Russian government is about to declare BTC and other crypto-currencies illegal ( in 2015 ) so whole ExMo will be illegal if the company is based in Russia + considering political situation around Russia and possible severe financial sanctions I would n't use it , maybe for smaller short term deals only .
