936535898,europe,"I\\ 'll copy the description of Polish parties from rationalwiki.org : \\n\\n & gt ; Political parties\\n\\n & gt ; These parties have MPs after the October 2015 election : \\n\\n & gt ; Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( PiS , Law and Justice ) : The Cancer . Far right , nationalistic party with xenophobic tendencies that includes many outright paranoiacs and Catholic fanatics . It can be best describes as a personality cult of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski . Controls a large propaganda system ( websites , newspapers , magazines , a TV channel and now also the entirety of public media , which were quickly purged of anyone even remotely critical of PiS ) . Combines extreme social conservatism matching Catholic doctrine and leftist economic policy of the wishful thinking variety . At one point , all of its MPs voted for a total ban on abortion and its proposal for an in-vitro fertilization bill included jail sentences for doctors . The bad news is that , with a majority in parliament , they will rule for 8 years and send Poles further back in time than Marty McFly . The good thing is that no one will believe their excuses if they fuck up ( and they most certainly will ) . Already ruled between 2005 and 2007 ; the term was cut short by a massive scandal related to misuse of a newly created anti-corruption unit as political police . Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski is a de facto supreme ruler of Poland , since the president , the prime minister , and all Law and Justice MPs are completely obedient to his orders . At the same time , he did not assume any public office , leaving him completely unaccountable to the public.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Platforma Obywatelska ( PO , Civic Platform ) : The Boring Moderates . A centrist party with moderate positions , pro-European and promoting a non-adversarial foreign policy . Ruled between 2007 and 2015 , during which time Poland was the fastest growing economy in Europe . Now the largest party in opposition . Its downfall can be traced back to several key members leaving to take roles in European institutions ; long-time leader Donald Tusk received the post of the President of the European Council , and left the party to Ewa Kopacz , an uncharismatic speaker that is obviously incapable of inspiring voters . The party is still socially conservative , however , but less so than PiS.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Kukiz\\'15 : The Madhouse . Self styled as a \ '' citizen\\ 's movement\ '' rather than a political party , this group won almost 9 % of the vote despite not having any political program . The leader , Pawe\u0142 Kukiz , is a former rockman with explosive temper and very inconsistent views . Because the party is highly disorganized , their electoral lineup was a true curiosity gallery and featured a gangsta rapper , anti-vax activists and open neo-Nazis . Nine of his elected MPs signed a \ '' National Contract\ '' requiring them to uphold the \ '' cultural and ethnic integrity\ '' and support \ '' militarization of the Nation\ '' . [ 31 ] \\n\\n\\n & gt ; .Nowoczesna ( .N , .Modern ) : The Robber Barons . Neoliberal party formed by Ryszard Petru , a prominent economist . Supports tax breaks for business , flat tax , privatization and abolishing the government subsidy for political parties . Also supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\n & gt ; Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe ( PSL , Polish People\\ 's Party ) : Power Thirsty Farmers . An agrarian party that represents Poland\\ 's small farmers . Unfortunately , it often does so to the detriment of large farmers , which produce a far larger share of the crops . They have a reputation for rampant nepotism and a lack of standards - they\\ 'll enter a coalition with pretty much anyone . Barely passed the electoral threshold in 2015 , to the dismay of practically everyone except PSL members . Remains much stronger in local elections . \\n\\n & gt ; Koalicja Odnowy Rzeczypospolitej Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Nadzieja ( KORWiN , Coalition for the Restoration of the Republic \u2013 Freedom and Hope ) : Crazy Fogey\\ 's One Man Show . Headed by Janusz Korwin-Mikke , who is very much like Poland\\ 's Ron Paul , including fanatical online supporters known as korwini\u015bci ( Korwinists ) or kuce ( ponies - yes , ponies ) and associations with fascists . Policy-wise , he is a radical conservative libertarian . The party is so much a one man show that it says so even in the name . Janusz can\\'t even describe his grocery shopping without mentioning Hitler ( he says \ '' Hitler\ '' more often than an average Pole says \ '' kurwa\ '' ) , rape , paedophilia , insulting the interviewer or doing something similarly controversial . He has a passionate hatred of communists and \\'leftists\\ ' , blaming \\'socialist ideology\\ ' for every crime ever committed . This includes the Holocaust , since he considers Hitler a socialist ( though at the same time he claims Hitler didn\\'t know about the Holocaust and that Poles had it better under Nazi German occupation than now ) . He is a fan of Ayn Rand , having called her \ '' the greatest American political writer\ '' . We could go on , but the guy is so crazy he merits a separate article.\\n\\n & gt ; Razem ( Together ) : A New Hope . Social democratic party in the style of Western Europe . Managed to win 3.9 % of the vote despite being formed just a few months before the election and having no wealthy sponsors ( unlike .Modern , which was formed in a similar time frame but was bankrolled by prominent businessmen ) . Its flagship postulates are the strengthening of labor law protections , support for a deeply progressive income tax with a top bracket of 75 % , government investment in housing for rent ( equivalent to council houses in the UK ) and social equality . Formally leaderless . Its support received a large last minute boost after its member decisively won a debate that included the representatives of all eight nationwide electoral committees . The mainstream accuses it of radicalism and driving the support for the SLD-TR-Greens coalition below the parliamentary threshold .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Oops.\\n\\nhttp : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Bible # Slavery_in_the_New_Testament\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe New Testament makes no condemnation of slavery and does no more than admonish slaves to be obedient and their masters not to be unfair . Paul , or whoever wrote the epistles , at no time suggested there was anything wrong with slavery . One could speculate that this might have been because he wanted to avoid upsetting the many slave owners in the early Christian congregations or to keep on good political terms with the Roman government . Or , more probably , he simply thought slavery was an acceptable fact of life as did practically everyone else at the time.\\n\\nEphesians 6:5-8 ( NASB ) : 5Slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to Christ ; 6not by way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . 7With good will render service , as to the Lord , and not to men , 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free.\\n\\nChristian slaves were told to obey their masters \ '' for the sake of the cause\ '' and be especially obedient to Christian masters : \\n\\n1 Timothy 6:1-2 ( NASB ) : 1All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against . 2Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but must serve them all the more , because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . Teach and preach these principles.\\n\\nThere are instructions for Christian slave owners to treat their slaves well.\\n\\nEphesians 6:9 ( NASB ) : 9And masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with Him.\\n\\nColossians 4:1 ( NASB ) 1Masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a Master in heaven . [ 6 ] \\n\\nOne passage often cited by apologists as supposed evidence for New Testament condemnation of slavery is 1 Timothy 1:10 . However , as the King James version accurately translates , this condemnation is of \ '' men stealers\ '' ( Greek : andrapodistais ) , [ 7 ] i.e . slave raiders who kidnapped and sold people as slaves , not slave traders or slave holders in general . So Paul only singled out slave raiders to be considered \ '' lawless and rebellious , \ '' and to be categorized with murderers , homosexuals , liars and oath breakers.\\n\\nThe rather bland admonishment to slave masters by Paul is more than balanced by the demands for absolute obedience made of slaves . It is also rather telling that the masters are likened to God and Jesus , while the masters are simply told that they have a higher lord . So much for Jesus as the embodiment of the underdog - Paul could have pointed to Jesus\\ ' imprisonment and death as a cautionary tale to slave masters that even humble ( d ) characters can be important . [ 8 ] \\n\\nBefore the apologist plays the \ '' but Jesus didn\\'t condone slavery\ '' -card , following all these Pauline examples , try reading Matthew 18:25 , where Jesus uses slaves in a parable and has no qualms about recommending that not only a slave but also his wife and family be sold , while in other parables Jesus recommends that disobedient slaves should be beaten ( Luke 12:47 ) or even killed ( Matthew 24:51 ) .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

AThousandD,europe,"This is really an unenviable position we\\ 've all found ourselves in .

To my mind , it\\ 's almost as if , as someone once put it , [ the only winning move is not to play ] ( https : //youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo ? t=3m34s ) . That , however , is not an option . \\n\\nStill , the whole refugee issue - and the migration that is piggy-backing along - it\\ 's so complex , that I fear no one - not even the experts - are able to grasp the whole complexity of the situation and formulate a holistic , well-developed response ( due to multiple factors , e.g . : time constraints and the need for urgent action , fiscal constraints , demographic constraints , public opinion constraints , etc. ) . Therefore , we make do with these ersatz solutions , born out of the need of the moment : Germany asks Hungary to let them pass , then starts giving signs that it\\ 's ready to do *realpolitik* and , as the *de facto* leading player of the EU , force the hands of those who have lesser bargaining positions.\\n\\nI would stay my hand for now , lest I cast a stone in anger - which I really don\\'t feel - against my ( German ) brother . \\n\\nOn a fundamental , human level - I can understand why Germany welcomed the refugees . I\\ 'm not sure if I\\ 'm qualified to mete out judgement , but I can imagine worse decisions could have been taken . At the same time , apart from the fundamental , human level , there is also the economic level and this is where politicians come in , because , it seems , they are the ones making shitty decisions , so things don\\'t get shittier . Or perhaps they will , but then it\\ 'll most likely be other politicians who\\ 'll be having to deal with that mess . But who can tell that before-hand - we\\ 're all fallible humans , limited by our flawed perceptions and marred by imperfections of our characters and none of us can tell the future with certainty.\\n\\nAnd then there\\ 's the local ( here : Polish ) perspective . You can hold it against me , and I hope I don\\'t risk a ban ( I\\ 'd be sad to go ) , when I write that our economic backwardness , what we call here ( pardon the expression , but Polish , and Poles , has a tendency to be much more direct and , for lack of a better term , visceral than English ) \ '' 20 years behind the blacks\ '' ( dwadzie\u015bcia lat za murzynami ) , an expression which epitomises the handicap dealt to our country/economy by the 20th century ( and which , I would argue , is not meant to be offensive to Africans ) , meant we have never yet had to go through the perhaps sometimes misguided and short-sighted policies of multi-culturalism ( mind : I\\ 'm not saying no to immigrants or refugees ; I\\ 'm saying I believe there are good ways of assimilating foreigners into a country and there are bad ways of failing to assimilate foreigners that may , further down the road , lead to multifarious negative consequences , for various parties involved ) .\\n\\nThus our economic backwardness was our chance to observe the solutions that worked in terms of integration policies and a chance to avoid the mistakes of those policies that have failed , or back-fired.\\n\\nBut now , our hands are being forced by the constraints of time and we\\ 're being pressured into a policy that , the apprehension exists , has not been thoroughly thought through.\\n\\nReally , I fear this is a game no one can \ '' win\ '' , but we , Europeans , are going through the motions anyway . Again , you can hold it against me , but from where I\\ 'm sitting , the future is a very uncertain thing and that\\ 's not making me happy.\\n\\nLastly , apologies for this being rambling-ish ( I usually try to be comprehensive , but clear about what I write ) , but I like to understand things and the current refugee/migrant situation is something I can hardly make heads or tails of and it\\ 's obviously very upsetting .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Now that homogeneity is being put into question ; like I previously indicated , I believe there are good ways of going about de-homogenising this country , if such is the historic inevitability , and I am led to believe Poland , [ historically ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland ) , has had a pretty good record of co-existing ( mostly ) peacefully with ( at least some ) other ethnicities in the confines of one state.\\n\\nIt\\ 's just that I believe rushing the issue right now may be counter-effective .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Neither was Poland starving *en masse* prior to EU accession , nor were the sums that it benefited from sufficient to \ '' feed\ '' anyone effectively for a year.\\n\\nConsider : Poland is a relatively populous European country , the largest from the EU newcomers , with some 38 mln people - making it the 5th biggest country in the EU , were we to exclude the UK , which is now removing itself from the equation . Were we to divide the 2014 EU benefits value you\\ 've provided and used per capita , I come to a figure in the region of 452 Euros per year per capita ( 17,436.1 mln Eur / 38.53 mln people as per a 2013 World Bank estimate acquired from a search engine ; I\\ 'd appreciate it were you to check my maths , just to be on the safe side ) . ( Also , using a nominal GDP 2016 estimate value of $ 508.857 billion , which Google translates into 480,711,361,133.07 Euro , I figure that the 2014 benefits constituted something in the area of 3.6 % of the national economy - do check me on my maths again , which is huge , but I stand by the view that it would be an exaggeration to say it was \ '' feeding\ '' ) \\n\\n452 Euro per head per year ( 1908 PLN using current values ; coincidentally , that\\ 's almost exactly the current minimum wage , but per month , not per year ) . If that\\ 's \ '' feeding\ '' , then - pardon the indiscretion - I have to ask where you are from.\\n\\nLastly , you seem to be taking an issue with this whole structural funds thing .

I can confidently wager that quite a fair number of people ( if not an outright majority ) in Poland even don\\'t know that \ '' sowiet\ '' means \ '' rada\ '' , since it\\ 's not a word in Polish , but Russian .

AThousandD,europe,"& gt ; Yes , also in Polish\\n\\nI find that a dubious claim . The word \ '' sowiet\ '' , as far as I\\ 'm aware , only entered the vocabulary as a loan word and then primarily as an adjective to describe the Soviet Union - \ '' Zwi\u0105zek sowiecki\ '' ( as explained [ here in Polish ] ( http : //sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/sowiecki-czy-radziecki ; 3265.html ) , the foreign loan word was used to emphasise foreign influence ) ; there was , however , also the name - \ '' Kraj rad\ '' , literally \ '' the country of councils\ '' , and after WWII the name \ '' Zwi\u0105zek radziecki\ '' was promoted , to obfuscate the foreignness of influence .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
