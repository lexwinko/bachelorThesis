A_Nest_Of_Nope,europe,"As expected the argument of oil prices always comes up . Yeah tell that to the people that lived when Yeltsin was the president and when he sold the entire country to 20 people.\\n\\nAs for the reforms , what happened with **Yeltsin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia had undergone a radical transformation , moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally integrated market economy . Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected \ '' oligarchs\ '' , which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.\\n\\n & gt ; Yeltsin\\ 's program of radical , market-oriented reform came to be known as a \ '' shock therapy\ '' . It was based on the recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists , including Larry Summers . The result was disastrous , with real GDP falling by more than 40 % by 1999 , hyperinflation which wiped out personal savings , crime and destitution spreading rapidly.\\n\\n & gt ; The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and subsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth . For example , the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often become the owner of the same enterprise . Under the government\\ 's cover , outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group of individuals at key positions of business and government . Many of them promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad producing an enormous capital flight.\\n\\n & gt ; Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and a dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; In the 1990s Russia was \ '' the largest borrower\ '' from the International Monetary Fund with loans totaling $ 20 billion . The IMF was the subject of criticism for lending so much as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the money and a large part of these funds could have been \ '' diverted from their intended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country illegally\ '' .\\n\\nWhat happened with **Putin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed . Much of the reason for the recovery was devaluation of the ruble , which made domestic producers more competitive nationally and internationally.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2002 , there was a significant amount of pro-growth economic reforms including a comprehensive tax reform , which introduced a flat income tax of 13 % ; and a broad effort at deregulation which improved the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2008 , Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity prices . GDP grew on average 7 % per year.Disposable incomes more than doubled and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold.The volume of consumer credit between 2000\u20132006 increased 45 times , fuelling a boom in private consumption.The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2008.\\n\\n & gt ; Inflation remained a problem however , as the central bank aggressively expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble . Nevertheless , in 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved \ '' unprecedented macroeconomic stability\ '' .Until October 2007 , Russia maintained impressive fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000.\\n\\nPutin absolutely did nothing , it\\ 's all because oil !

They are 800km close to each other , they are both on the sea with big commercial and military harbors , Moscow has literally no need to get some more harbor from there , there are no resources that they already don\\'t have , there are no such big ethnic Russians in there to justify an invasion . \\n\\nBaltics are in NATO and Europe also , Russia may be described as \ '' Imperialistic\ '' by some people now , but they are not stupid , seriously .
