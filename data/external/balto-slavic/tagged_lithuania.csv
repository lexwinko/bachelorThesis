5thKeetle,europe,"It is controversial , not all empiric data has been researched and as a matter of fact the term rusification is debatable and usually misused . A single paper does not constitute \ '' very well researched\ '' , as in it does not mean that there\\ 's a consensus in the academy , hence not very well researched .

Lithuanian historiography is always evolving and changing , past biases are better understood and the need for a less biased research is starting to take hold . When I write papers , my professors ask me to find an actual source and study it myself rather than cite a pre-1990 historian .

5thKeetle,europe,"It was called the \ '' removal of polish fundamentals\ '' and the point was separating the Lithuanians from the Poles culturally , so that Lithuanians wouldn\\'t get up in arms with the Poles again ( acculturation was one of the goals as well , but the Russians never thought they could assimilate Lithuanians and didn\\'t attempt to , they just wanted to integrate us ( most likely ) ) . Note that only the alphabet was changed , from Polish ( with all the SZ , CZ etc . ) to a Cyrillic alphabet . The language was untouched . We did not have our own alphabet back then . \\n\\nAlso , Lithuanian printing press was not completely prohibited , there\\ 's a lot of nuance there as well . Somebody shared an article about the prohibition ( the author obviously didn\\'t even spend a minute in the archives researching the matter , BTW ) , a collection of sources was cited there back from the USSR times . I have read those sources , especially regarding Muravyov , they did point to the fact that not all Lithuanian books were banned and there were discussions as to what should be banned and what not . I have also located one source in the archives stating that a Lithuanian got arrested for having a POLISH letter with him , pointing to the fact that it was the connection with the Poles that worried the Russian officials rather than the Lithuanian language itself ( they couldn\\'t understand polish so they were worried it contained something bad ) .",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

In elections you pick among a couple of parties that after elected tend to favour the wealthy elites . During the last 25 years the VAT ( which is regressive ) was increased , tax on dividends decreased , yada yada . A democracy works to better the lives of the many while using the elections as a way to legitimise its power and to remain acountable to the people .

There was no such balance of power here.\\n\\nLithuania was not a powerful state . Even having said that , having strong military power does not make it a Kingdom . \\n\\nIt was not considered a Kingdom because the ruler was not crowned by the pope or the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire .

So by just being old , the loan does not become illegitimate.\\n\\nOn a sidenote , reading what you wrote here makes the issue even more strange for me . It seems that Germany was given time to grow before starting the payments . Why can\\'t we allow Greece to get it\\ 's shit together and then start paying , instead of loaning them money to pay for loans ? Dawes plan you\\ 've mentioned was created specifically because Germany stopped paying reparations money ( defaulted a lot of times , compared to Greece ) and the french occupied Ruhr for controversial reasons . Dawes plan was renegotiated so that the payments would be possible to Germany , although as far as I know the Dawes plan was not perfect and was renegotiated a lot of times , even before 1953 .

They block the roads because then the news cover them and they get some exposure.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's about reducing all subsidies , as if they\\ 're there , they\\ 're inevitably end up going for the wrong people\\n\\nSo should we stop ALL government payouts ? All benefits for the jobless , all funding for school programs , road constructions , everything ? There always is some amount of money that goes to the wrong hands . But the solution is NOT to cut everything completely , it\\ 's to cut it to those wrong hands.\\n\\n & gt ; At least when the businessman wants profits , they\\ 'll do their best to provide a good service and therefore benefit the rest of society\\n\\n ... what ? No , there are two ways to increase profits : you either increase quality ( costs rise too ) or reduce costs ( quality drops but sales rise ) . No businessman is working as a good samaritan whose only goal is to benefit the society . That\\ 's why they\\ 're called businessmen , they work for profit . If a cheap , shitty product makes more money , then that\\ 's what they will go with.\\n\\nAlso , please stop posting 30 year old crap videos from \ '' strawman and not a free market\ '' country , they are not relevant to our current situation .

Or some guy who\\ 's never even been to Europe and has no idea what EU is ? \\n\\n & gt ; These have always existed and will continue to exist.\\n\\nThat\\ 's quite a strong statement . Mind you , I\\ 'm not talking about farms where a family grows just enough food to feed themselves . I\\ 'm talking about farms where they only grow one type of stuff and then sell it . If we cut the subsidies , then it won\\'t be profitable anymore and they will stop selling stuff . \ '' In the long run\ '' doesn\\'t really mean anything here , people won\\'t just sit quietly without a job for a decade.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know about it , if everybody is allowed to operate , then yes , it\\ 's a free market , only the most competitive businesses will thrive.\\n\\nIt is a free market and it\\ 's a horrible mess with insane prices and fees on everything . That\\ 's what happens when you let the businessmen do whatever they want . That\\ 's why it will never work . Someone has to control them.\\n\\n & gt ; What do you think is paying for those more expensive calls now ? \\n\\nNo one is paying for them . The prices were high because the companies were able to put whatever price they wanted . They could make it 1 euro/min and they did , even if the actual cost was one tenth of that . What are you going to do , sign a new mobile contract just for one week holiday abroad ? That\\ 's why the governments had to step in and say \ '' Sorry guys , but these prices are unreasonable . Cut them.\ '' \\n\\nThe opposite is going on in the agricultural world right now . The farmers are operating below the lowest limit . That\\ 's why they need subsidies . It simply wouldn\\'t be profitable for them to keep operating without them . \\n\\nNow you may say \ '' Oh that\\ 's not a problem , someone else will come along.\ '' Well sure , someone else will , and then you\\ 'll go back to paying 1 euro/min for your calls ? I don\\'t think it\\ 's a good solution.\\n\\n & gt ; And who are these angels and good samaritans who will organise society for us ? \\n\\nThat\\ 's why we have democracies and why we elect people to do stuff and enforce rules , to make everyone equal . It may not be a perfect system and there are glitches every now and then , but it\\ 's much better than no government at all . Look at Somalia if you want to see how a country without a government looks.\\n\\nI watched part of that video and I still don\\'t see how any of it is relevant to all of this . Those are the very basic concepts of trade , the first baby steps . They ignore the enormous amount of change that the current market underwent . \\n\\nLook at it this way : you have a limited amount of money to spend every month , right ? Now imagine if the prices of agricultural produce have doubled . Could you still feed yourself and your family ? What about those who were living paycheck to paycheck before the increase ? \\n\\nYou might say that the sellers will just import cheaper food from abroad , but then what will happen to your neighbour farmers ? If what you say happens then there won\\'t even be cheaper food from abroad , as almost all of it is from other EU countries . We don\\'t import milk or meat from China for obvious reasons . Yes , it\\ 's cheaper than anywhere in EU , but the price is not the only thing that influences sales .",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian
