100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough . But when an entire coal pit closes , and hundreds of people loose their main source of income all at once , the town wo n't recover for generations .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

How often do you see rioters paying for the damage they 've done ? & gt ; I do n't doubt they 're that stupid at all , but I do hope that now the police will enforce the law and sentence the lot of them for it instead of just standing idly by while a bunch of children smash up the place because they do n't like someone . Your desired outcome demands that certain conditions are true . For example it means that the police can stop riots effectively and quickly . Also that even if they could , they would want to get their hands dirty , in this particular case for the sake of someone who 's likely to be abhorred by most people . The existence of the phenomena of riots means that at least one of those statements is sometimes false .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Then Obama and the `` reset '' came but relations soured again . Now Trump has come in , and it would not be surprising , if things follow a similar pattern .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"It is difficult for me to imagine the interests of an abstract ideology like Communism , which is why I 'm asking about the interests of the working classes . In that case the argument goes like that : 1 . The working class in modern ROK lives much better than in modern DPRK , with North Korea being practically a byword for repression and misery . Not saying that South Korea is perfect , just that workers would rather live there than under the Kim dynasty . 2 . Those that sympathized with DPRK would have aided the North in its attempts to conquer the South . 3 . Their aid would have increased the chance of the South being ruled by those that now rule the North . 4 . Thus leaving those people alive would have substantially increased the risk that future generations of South Korean workers live under repression and misery . 5 . Thus killing those people secures the well being of the working class . They may have not done anything wrong , but given the stakes involved letting them live would be an unacceptable risk . Other options could have been explored but the invasion left the South 's regime with no other choice . So , the question is , do you see any problems with that line of reasoning ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Given that , would you agree that Liberal governments are , in their suppression of far left movements motivated by ( perhaps misguided ) concern for the well being of their people ( including their working class ) .

And even more importantly why are so many people here discussing it as if it was a serious possibility ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,The reason why the war there was ended as quickly as it did is largely because both sides there fought ( mostly ) competently . In the Syrian conflict on the other hand the most we armed side is absolutely unable to conduct even the most basic operations . If Syrian government was able to do something as fundamental as maintaining a tight siege the war would have been over by now . But as it stands now the Ghouta pocket seems quite well supplied . In that sense the experience and knowledge the Ukrainian army got from that war is probably more valuable than whatever the various Syrian paramilitaries got from the five years of civil war .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; There was no will to continue the fighting in any meaningful way . There was . The reason why the fighting reached stopped was because it became abundantly clear both sides were unable to achieve their aims . By the end of the summer of 2014 it had became clear that at the present moment the Russian government had no ability to create a Russian state in the Ukrainian south and east and if such state were to be created it would probably collapse in less than a year taking the Russian government with it . By the end of the autumn of that same year it became clear the Ukrainian government could n't retake the areas the separatists already controlled because the Russian military would deploy their full forces if they tried ( and of course the gain from retaking those regions has always been questionable ) . & gt ; There are tons of operations done successfully but I think you are minimizing the situation . You 're right . Sorry for exaggerating . & gt ; 1 they do n't have the man power because of the reasons I stated to hold a full seige for an effective amount of time and still tend to all their fronts while maintaining multiple offensives . IS is fighting more opponents than the Syrian government , yet they somehow maintain the siege on Deir ez-Zor . & gt ; The second issue is that there is just to much lucrutive black market deals going on in Ghouta I 'm sure it is looked the other way because of the amount of money involved , difficulities combating the black market , corruption , and the need not to piss off his local population further . Ghouta need only be contained for now . Also I fail to see how failing to deal with a pocket that undoubtedly ties in a non-trivial amount of troops helps one to deal with his manpower shortages . Well , here it is . The Syrian government is not capable of conducting a siege because of it 's own corruption and incompetence . And pissing off the local population is no excuse . If they wanted they could have blocked all supplies apart from basic necessities . The rebels there would have still surrendered because of lack of munitions . You see my point is that the length and intensity of a conflict is rarely proportional to the skill with which it has been fought . In modern wars rarely drag on for very long unless the major adversaries in it fight in a defective manner . And there is much more military skill to be gained from fighting against skilled opponent with good soldiers and officers as compared to fighting against poor soldiers led by poor officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As of the US envoy , the one who should effectively counter treats of military nature against him are the local Kurdish warlords . With some luck IS could probably assemble diversionary groups of 30-50 men in Kurdish territory without being caught . Thus Defending an envoy against anything the IS could organize in the area around Kobani would probably require no less than 50 men in any case . Unless you have actual military deployed there of course . But 50 soldiers from special operations just protecting a guy is simply a waste of those men 's capabilities .

Though I still maintain that the main reason why Germany went to war was it 's obligations to Australia . & gt ; Oh and the text of the alliance mentions other great powers as well : It says that the parties should maintain benevolent neutrality in case one of them was attacked by a country different from Russia .

From what I gather the computer game `` King of Dragon Pass '' where the peasants could n't marry without the approval of the clan 's government is a pretty accurate representation of bronze age society . On the other hand once capital starts to accumulate the inherent limitations of collectivist systems become intolerable as wealth increases . Living in submission to a higher goal and forcing others to do so is not something most people would do if they did n't think it was needed for the good of the family/nation/race/humanity .

We 'd take the word of a businessman with a grain of salt if he 's talking about psychology , politics , military logistics or sociology and those contain a lot more useful information related to the running of a company than economics . The most successful guy in finance is Warren Buffet who advises to ignore all economic factors . In this case Mr. Thiel has completely failed to consider that businesses compete for investor 's money . No bank , nor fund , nor a rational person , will ever buy a 5 % bond over a 7 % one ( assuming both issues are equally sound ) . Nobody in their right mind would buy a share with P/E of 20 over a 10 ( assuming similar growth prospects/soundness of business ) . Businesses that fail to provide adequate return on investment wo n't be able to raise the money needed to keep up with the competition and would eventually be given over to some corporate raider to liquidate if that continues . Competition for customers will be moderated by competition for capital . This guarantees that capital gets accumulated and companies ( as well as investors ) have the money to innovate and try new things . As for Mr. Thiel 's Google example , I 'd seriously doubt Google feels secure in it 's place . This website we 're reading right now is apparently a replacement of something called Digg which lost it 's user base to Reddit in a matter of months . The collapse of MySpace was similarly swift .

Of course that ca n't continue forever . And when the system collapses the capital base would already be exhausted and unable to maintain the same quality of life as in the good old days , at least for a good while , even under a new system that does n't suffer from the contradictions of the old one . Thus Khrushchev could claim that his workers lived under comparable quality of life as people in the United States . By end of Brezhnev 's reign such claims no longer seemed plausible and by the time Gorbachev came into power it was clear to everyone that communism could n't last much longer . On the other hand leaders who put the expansion of the capital base before worker 's quality of life like Stalin often had reductions of quality of life so severe that they qualified as crimes against humanity .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Many regimes have been criticized for engaging in campaigns of brutal suppression against communists and communist sympathizers . From as far right as Chilean dictator Pinochet to as far left as the German social democrats , many regimes have found it necessary to suppress and sometimes even cull their communists , under the pretext that if communists were to take power many more would die . Among the left of center commentariat , the cruel logic behind such actions is either roundly criticized or outright rejected as intellectually dishonest and self serving . ( This in stark contrast to left wing governments which do quite often consider communists a grave danger to the interests of the working class . ) Yet there is one such regime seems to be largely forgotten . South Korean ( semi- ) autocrat Syngman Rhee suppressed communists with extreme prejudice , first sending them to gulags and then killing them when DPRK forces were about to liberate those camps . Estimates of the death toll put it at 100000 to 200000 . But we all know what he was fighting against . Even conservative estimates of state killings in North Korea are usually above 200000 for a mere decade or less . No one can deny that the South Korean proletariat lives much better than the workers in the North . Given all that , the question arises , as to your opinions on the actions of President Rhee . The Northern state is , from what I 've heard , not considered socialist , but rather closer to fascism . Yet it is certain that the Southern communists would have aided this fascist regime in its numerous attempts to conquer the peninsula . Reunification was , after all , one of the goals of the South Korean Workers Party . So was their destruction justified or not ? Or were those agents of fascism that marched under the red banner somehow different than the ones that marched under the swastika ? Perhaps one could argue that the amount of people killed was too large or that mass killing as a method is counter productive , but would n't that be a tacit admission that slaying South Korea 's communists would have been ethically sound and in the interests of the proletariat , if it were an effective suppression measure ? And if you were to say that Rhee 's actions were justified , questions arise about all those other regimes in the history of the world . Was Pinochet wrong ? Should the Social Democrats have murdered Rosa Luxembourg ? Was the CIA justified in overthrowing what could very well have been another fascist regime hiding under the red flag ? The CIA is a spy agency after all , they should recognize a fascist tendency in a government even before it is known to the general public , should n't they ?

A side effect of the First Past the Post system that the UK has is that party leaders are largely controlled by their parliamentary groups rather than the other way around . Any claim the Labour leader might claim on the right to set party policy would come from his election by the party 's membership .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Well , can a system always produce exactly as much as needed ? The answer should obviously be a `` No '' , you ca n't determine the needs of society with a high degree of accuracy without exactly foreseeing the cultural , political , scientific and ecological developments of the future . Thus we can assume that an economic system can only be designed so that it 's levels of production follow some probability distribution . But if the expected value of production is the exact amount society needs , you 'd suffer from occasional bouts of underproduction . It would mean that every crop blight starves some people . Thus in order to ensure that people are supplied with necessities a system should produce more than it needs . Hence why , for example every year the EU collects and throws away mountains of tomatoes . An argument could be made that luxuries are different , but the distinction between necessities and luxuries is rather arbitrary . Motor vehicles are vital necessities in some parts of the world and luxuries in others . There were points in history where a diet with enough calories to sustain an adult would be considered a luxury . So there 's an argument to be made about treating everything as a necessity , since misidentifying a necessity as luxury would have dire consequences , whereas misidentifying a luxury as a necessity is overall harmless .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

This suggests that males were not diverting resources towards females with whom they could potentially copulate on a short-term , and were therefore not exchanging meat for sex . Although males in the Ngogo community did share more with estrous than anestrous females given their proportional representation in hunting parties [ 14 ] , these sharing episodes did not confer males with immediate mating advantages over males who did not share meat with females ( Ngogo : [ 14 ] , Gombe : [ 20 ] ) . One important limitation of the above studies is that they have focused on short-term exchanges of meat for sex ( i.e . within the estrous phase of the female ) . Given that in this species dyads form long-lasting bonds [ 21 ] , and exchange services on a long-term basis [ 22 ] , it is plausible that exchanges of meat for sex could occur over a longer period of time than the estrous phase of a female .

( In fact it would mean that joint stock companies would dominate all sectors of the economy where output can be improved by injecting capital . ) I 'm sorry if any part of that was unclear . Also are you under the impression I somehow believe in socialism ? Sure , the question is addressed to socialists , but most other people who answer are n't socialists . Their answers are also missing what I believe is the key issue with cooperatives , namely what I tried to point out , so I felt compelled to add mine to theirs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Because firing 10 % of the workforce every time the cooperative has to take a controversial decision is a recipe for success .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"So , the majority decides , the minority accepts it . It does n't matter that they own a piece of every asset of the cooperative , so long as their opinion is unpopular enough , they ca n't protect themselves from losses in any way . It 's not like disagreeing with decisions made by the owners of a company , I do n't own any part of the company I work for and if I did I could sell it . I have no legitimate reason to care for the company I work for . My inability to liquidate my share of a cooperative without changing jobs , which is never an easy process , gives me reasons to care for it . Can you imagine how bad it 's going to be if the minority turns out to be right ? The grumbling , the `` I told you so '' , the hatred towards coworkers that have squandered a not insignificant part of the group 's wealth . Imagine the hatred you now see towards supporters of the current American president , only a thousand times worse and directed towards people you have to interact with every day . Even if the minority was dissuaded from a strike , management would have to convert the cooperative into a company in order to get people to talk to each other . The complete lack of liquidity of parts of a cooperative presents a great problem for the rights of minorities . There are a thousand ways in which the problem would express itself , which particular one is irrelevant . Unless somebody has discovered a reasonable solution for it vast sectors of the economy would be inaccessible to cooperatively governed organizations . The only solution I see is conversion to a joint stock company .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"I do n't think you understand . In a joint stock company I can increase or decrease the my ownership of the company for some money but most importantly *at no personal cost to myself* . In a cooperative I have to change jobs , which is *a significant disturbance to my life* . Saying workers should quit their jobs because they disagree with business decisions is like saying Americans should move to Canada if they disagree with political decisions . It 's just silly .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; you can quit and relinquish your share in a company and divorce yourself from all potential risk of a decision with without having to get another job first . Can I work permanently for the cooperative without owning a share or is it like giving my employer a 2 week notice ? & gt ; alright , so you 're a worker now in a capitalist business . a decision has to be made . your boss has full control , and makes a decision you hate , and your only options are to bend over and take it , or quit and go work somewhere else you think will have a boss that will make decisions for you that are more to your liking . So long as the decision is not about my compensation or work conditions , I do n't have to care . He could waste company money on crack for all I know , yet for me it does n't matter . Company money are his money not mine . Sure , if his decisions are utterly horrible at some point he will bankrupt the company and I 'd be out of a job , but my savings , be they in deposits or in stocks would still be there . As opposed to a high capex co-op where I 'd not only be out of a job but my net worth will also take a significant hit . Were Daimler a cooperative it 's workers would each own a share amounting to half a million euros . At that point the loss of the share of the company is going to be a lot more painful than the loss of the job . Edit : Added the example at the end .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; no So my point still stands , does n't it . I can get rid of my share only by suffering a great disturbance to my life . & gt ; it is your money when your employment stability depends on his successful management of the company . I doubt many people would willingly work for a boss that blows all the company money on crack . If he pays well , why not ? My employer 's shitty decisions only affect me if they are extremely shitty and even then I 'd usually have enough time to prepare if I could see it in advance . Since I do n't own any part of the company I 'm not going to loose anything , am I ? & gt ; yes , that 's how it works . if the profits are more socialized , so are the losses ( again , to a percentage that you agree to ) . you stand to gain a higher wage in a co-op , but this is balanced out by greater risk . So let me get this straight . I 'm in for a lot . In a hypothetical car manufacturing cooperative my share would be worth a few hundreds of thousands of dollars/euros . Yet all those money are at the complete mercy of the annual general meeting . I ca n't get those hundreds of thousands back without changing jobs . Those hundreds of thousands can become more or less , but there 's nothing I can do to protect myself from a change in their value . Do you not see the problems with that ? Do you think most working class folks would be OK with letting the majority do as they please with hundreds of thousands of their money ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; I like how you complain about your employment disruption disturbing your life , and then in the same breath say you do n't care if you lose your job as long as you got paid in that time . There 's a difference . If the policies of the American government are bad enough to cause a civil war , most Americans are going to try to emigrate . On the other hand nobody 's going to be emigrating because Trump is a president . Most people would are just nasty to his supporters . Is it that hard to see how the observable realities of Democracy translate to the Democratic Workplace ? & gt ; if that 's all that concerns you , you can still work for a co-op , get paid well , and quit before it starts struggling . it 'd be the same thing .

100100145,investing,"The general error of Keynes ' theory is something called the Lucas critique . The crux of it is that while 2 variables may be correlated , an economic policy that uses the knowledge of that correlation may destroy it in its attempts to exploit it . To quote Calaghan on the correlation between inflation and unemployment which is quite important in Keynes ' economics : & gt ; `` We used to think you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by boosting government spending , I tell you , in all candour that that option no longer exists . And in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion… by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step… ” In general people are n't stupid and if they figure out the government will raise inflation they are going to demand higher wages , making the inflation raise ineffective at lowering unemployment . Likewise any economic theory that does n't base it 's sweeping observations on the study of small scale economic interactions ca n't survive prolonged contact with reality . It should be obvious how Lucas ' critique lead to more advocacy for more laissez-faire . As 30 years of economic theory were proven to be wrong , lots of people thought that we do n't have good enough understanding of an economy to conduct beneficial government interventions . Who knows what would people be saying in 30 years about current theories , after all ? In the 80 's a lot of people soured on macroeconomic interventions ( basically spending money for the sake of spending money ) in favor of mircoeconomic ones ( privatizations , the less popular nationalizations , altering regulations and other stuff that affects specific sectors rather than the whole economy ) .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Calaghan ( hardly a proponent of laissez-faire ) admitting that this theory no longer works , I can give you the American [ misery index ] ( https : //inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/ ) .

Nobody watches the Fed raising inflation targets then goes to their boss and argues for higher wages . This is n't how the economy works . Nobody watches them **now** . These days inflation targets are low and boring . Thus under current FED policy we have a Philips Curve . When inflation targets were higher and more interesting workers and more importantly union bosses would actually start looking at them and the Philips Curve will disappear . And even if workers were illiterate brutes who could n't read the inflation targets , they 'd have to notice that prices are rising considerably and they can no longer afford to live as well as they did before .

Yet once you become morbidly obese you do start modifying your weight depending on your eating habits ( or you die young , I guess ) . And regardless , whether the Lucas Critique is right or wrong should n't affect the validity of naive Keynesian modelling . The empirical fact is that by the 1970s there was a general agreement that a number of correlations between variables which were observed before WW2 no longer held .

I meant giving me a link to something or at the very least the naming someone who has successfully applied the theory . & gt ; Yes , but the accuracy of an economic theory is not the only criterion by which the government uses it in some way . There are obvious reasons why a government in a capitalist society would not use Marxian economics to fuel its understanding of what is going on and make policy based on those insights . Whether government 's are naturally inclined or disinclined to choosing to listen to surplus value believers is irrelevant to my argument . My point is entirely based on what happens once a capitalist country acquires a government that is inclined to listen to surplus value believers . If surplus value offers special insight into the market economy it is reasonable to assume that they 'd do better than governments that listen to orthodox economists . If the contrary is true that 's evidence against surplus value , is it not ? & gt ; I think you and I have different criteria what determines the usefulness of a theory . Your criteria is narrow and predisposed to promoting ignorance , because it prematurely tosses aside a lot of things that may be true and can be useful for human development , but not immediately applicable in people 's direct lives . So , let me get this straight . Surplus value may be true . On the other hand if I ever behave as if it were true I will not gain anything and would likely bring harm to me and those around me .

Thus they probably wo n't act against him until defeat is imminent . Furthermore both Russia and Iran are likely to obstruct a removal of the President rather facilitate it . You see , war devastated Syria is likely to need a lot of money to recover from the war . Thus a different Syrian leader might succumb to the temptations of the famously wealthy land of the House of Saud and the practically limitless wealth of the free world . As for the terrorists , if the object of their hatred was removed and the policies that caused it were to stop , I think there is hope . If nothing else it will stop the number of terrorists from growing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , the government controls by far the largest share of Syria 's population , yet it suffers from a well pronounced lack of reliable soldiers . This would imply that most of the population in government controlled areas is hostile or at least unsupportive to it . By contrast both the various rebel militias and the Islamic State control very little population , but do n't seem to lack men willing to risk and even sacrifice their lives in the name of the faction that they join . I do think that strongly suggests both the various rebel groups and IS are more popular than the government . As for the rebels being split into a multitude of separate groups , each with its own political designs , I 'm want to remind you that the Solidarity Citizen 's Committee was a quite disorganized political group , that consisted of people with many different ideologies , united only by their desire to see the communists gone . It still won elections by a landslide . EDIT : Clarified some things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,I do n't think that many support the government 's enemies . They just could n't care less about a government that could n't care less about them .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't know . Should n't government soldiers believe they are fighting for their lives and families ? At least when they are fighting something like the Islamic State ? That should be a good motivation . Furthermore the Nazi Volkssturm never had problems with making heroic last stands . The Red army never had problems fighting in far worse conditions and with far worse survival rate than the government 's troops now . And in the first world War nobody had problems recruiting pilots in spite of the ridiculously low life expectancy . I do believe people in general are quite willing to sacrifice their lives for their countries , it 's just that nobody would want to sacrifice himself on the altar of his superiors ' incompetence . Thus I strongly suspect if the commander in chief of the SAA was someone people believed in , the government 's manpower/soldier quality issues would go away . They control by far the largest share of the country 's population , surely they would be capable of finding enough decent soldiers . Edit : Fixed some unclear stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , as to the point about about islamism see my other reply to that other post . History is full of examples of men throwing away their lives for secular causes with the same lack of concern for themselves as suicide bombers . All that is needed is a cause soldiers would believe in and trust in their high command . Those things are , I think we can both agree , severely lacking in Syria , and nobody is going to really support a government he mistrusts . And if a government is going to allow corruption and nepotism to propagate in something as critical to its survival as the military , do n't you think the other spheres of government activity would be affected as well ? How do you think a corrupt and incompetent police , secret police , agricultural authority , industrial regulator , health services , regional authorities , etc . would affect civilian morale ? & gt ; EDIT : to be honest I had no idea what the solidarity citizens committee was , but a quick wikipedia read mentioned that the committee did n't even last a year ? That is precisely where I was going . Even if separate groups have different ideologies , they can be very popular together when they defend a common popular cause . I do n't think most people that support JaN would go home , if the group were destroyed . They would just join another one . Thus it is not meaningless to talk about support for the rebels , in spite of the fact that `` rebels '' is a category rather than a coherent group . Edit : I 'm bad at grammar .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It seems it is necessary to repeat myself . They `` fight '' for the government because they were forced to . SAA conscripts are directly forced into the armed forces .

If you live in a relatively safe area and join the NDF , you 'd be patrolling the streets , rather than dying on some distant front . I do n't think we have any reason to believe NDF members are more committed to fighting for the government than the SAA 's rank and file . As far as I can see , they get routed just as easily . And further while the rate of defections might have slowed , I do n't think the rate of desertion has slowed down significantly . Furthermore , seeing how the armed forces have recently suffered a rout on 2 separate fronts , I do n't really see any indication that the government 's soldiers , both SAA and NDF , are willing to fight and risk death in the name of the president .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"For one you could make sure that everybody hears about the intervention . That way when IS or JaN suffers a defeat , it could lead to terror attacks in Russia .

Interesting perspective and also probably correct to a significant degree , though I do think there is some evidence to suggest that it is not the main reason for the whole affair . For example Putin would have never used term Novorussia unless he was preparing for conquest . And Alexander Dugin 's infamous textbook for the Russian Geneal Staff Academy advocates the destruction of Ukraine trough splitting the country , as well as the style of warfare that is now often called `` hybrid '' .

Back then their commanders did show the same lack of regard for the lives of the men under their command that the SAA is known for . While I do n't doubt the Iranian armed forces are much better than the Syrian , I suspect it might not be because they lack the problems the SAA suffers from , but because they have them but to a far , far lesser degree .

100100145,syriancivilwar,Couter attacks are costly though . And as far as I remember the disaster in the southern Idlib region began as a counter offensive to recapture Idlib city .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Since the rebels have n't taken the road trough some kind of lighting offensive and since holding is probably preferable to retaking , I 'd guess if they were to take the road they would have to defeat the reserves in Aleppo either way . Apart from that both of Assad 's firefighters , Hassan and Zahreddine are currently busy , it 'll be a while till the road is recaptured . And if the rebels are smart enough the couter offensive could be extremely costly , when it finally comes . Edit : I really should n't write long posts from my phone .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , after going through quite a few pro-Iranian , pro-Syrian administrations the Lebanese state is now weak and corrupt , allowing for Hezbollah to flourish . After the al-Maliki 's administration , which was quite friendly to Iran , Iraq ended up with an army that ca n't fight . And lo and behold , Iran-backed shia militias are coming to the rescue . Do you see the pattern ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,V. Yankovic was democratically elected to be Ukrainian president it is not like Russia has chosen him to be the president there . Surely he must have represented his people 's interest not the Russian government 's .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I was n't thinking about the association agreements as much as the utterly outrageous way Yankovic treated his generals . And even in that regard your arguments do n't hold up . Yes sure , he wanted to save government finances . Which were in the state they were in because he , unlike the `` corrupt oligarch '' , had a mansion half the size of Malta .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , I doubt any government with Hezbollah in it will try to strengthen the LAF . And further considering how Hezbollah treats its political opponents , its only a matter of time before they start arming themselves , leading to a most unpleasant sequence of events . As for Iraq , I feel Maliki 's ousting had far more to do with his extreme military failure . Calls for his removal were first issued in Iraq and then echoed in Iran as it became obvious he could n't remain a prime minister . To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders , but then again Yankovic did n't follow Russian orders either . Instead his associates describe Moscow 's men making their way to his inner circle , driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him . Or it could be something even more innocent , like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him . Maybe he did n't even think about the way his presidency would affect Iraq , though I still think Iranian foreign policy strategist are n't that foolish .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,It 's not like Saddam 's army was that great either . And yes the Iraqi government was literally bankrolled and armed by the coalition . Then relations with the coalition broke down .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,If some foreign force appears to save the government are we sure this is going to be the conclusion rather than an interlude ? Iraqi militiamen probably wo n't stay in Syria for the years of counterinsurgency that are likely to follow .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"200,000 Syrians are in the army . How many of them fight and how many desert at the first opportunity is debatable . Furthermore , for the survival of the government , the reality is that numbers are going to mean far less than actual military effectiveness and many around here would cast doubt in government victory even if the government had not 200 000 , but 300 000 men at it 's command ( assuming foreign support were withdrawn ) . So , as you can see even those arguments , that you think are totally unreasonable , might be based on a reasonable line of logic . How correct that line of logic is , can usually be discovered trough an inquiry into it by a critical mind . So please , if you believe that somebody is making an incorrect argument , ask him about it . That way you can persuade not only yourself , but also a reader in his or her incorrectness and perhaps even learn something from him , regardless of whether he is correct or not . I assume you are n't here just to broadcast your beliefs , while failing to persuade anybody in them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , the question is , why would IS try prevent the army from reaching Palmyra ? The area around the city is mostly open desert , where they would be at a major disadvantage , against a conventional army with airplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war . If they are smart , they are going to fight only in the city itself . And unfortunately IS commanders do n't strike me as particularly inept .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , `` state terrorism '' exists as a term . Whether the government engages in it , if it does to what degree , and how important is it for the government are all open to debate . And I do n't think the view that state terror is critical for the survival of the government , or at least the government in its present form , is absolutely devoid of arguments in its favor . Again , it could be wrong , but it ca n't be just be dismissed , it has to be proven wrong . Furthermore , if someone makes an argument that seems to you weird , bizarre or totally wrong , ask him about it . If his position is totally without merit , this shall become self-evident . If it 's not at least you are n't going to look like a someone , so lacking confidence in his views , that he 'd rather not debate opposing ones .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"From what I 've seen , my impression is that IS never really tries to defend what they ca n't defend . Rather , to keep the narrative , when they loose something important , they quickly capture something else instead . For example their force in Tikrit did n't seem to me as one built to repel the Iraqi forces converging on the city , but rather as one built to delay them . Yet after they lost Tikrit they captured Ramadi and Palmyra , and thus the narrative was kept intact . Now I think they have some chance of defending the city , so they will try to defend it . Also one should keep in mind that though IS 's lack of concern about it 's soldiers ' lives makes it seem otherwise , the organization is quite flexible strategically , thus meaning a general rule about what they do ca n't be true all the time .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed it did n't . My point is not that the lack of defensible terrain around the city makes it easier to defend . After all common sense dictates rather the opposite is true . I instead claim that , because of the terrain any attacker would be capable of reaching the city , since the defender 's best strategy would be not to resist an offensive to a significant degree , until the city itself . So IS 's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself . This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed . Thus being 3.5 km away from the city does n't mean much . The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided . As I mentioned so far it proceeds as SAA planers would want ( and expect ) it to proceed , yet it probably proceeds as IS planners would expect it to , as well . Edit : Fixed the repetition in the last sentence .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , keep in mind that the strategy I described would have been adopted ( if indeed this is the actual strategy of the IS ) because coalition air power would mean IS would not be able to use large concentrations of troops in battle . Also as far as I remember the Ramadi attack was supported by an impressive number of VBIEDs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If it was a dune or a hill , would n't they be spotted by aerial reconnaissance ? EDIT : And further I 've always assumed such a large number of men would , when moving , scatter reconnaissance vehicles around , so as to avoid an ambush of the whole force . EDIT : a word .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , looking at the Donbass war , I feel like every Ukrainian or separatist brigade and artillery battery has like 10 drones with it , most of them bought by fundraisers , so they ca n't be that expensive . And even if aerial reconnaissance is out of the question , would n't ground based one work as well ? I assume a group large enough to capture tens of soldiers would be large enough to be visible .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see , you are right . I still do n't see why the SAA does n't use more drones , since they seem quite an artillery heavy military , though I suspect that this question belongs to a dumb question thread more than it belongs here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't see how a guy 's beliefs damage his credibility . Who is to say it 's not his experience in the air force that turned him against the government ? And Assad could n't have lasted so long if he did n't have the support of some parts of Syria 's population . Yet there would be no civil war , especially a civil war as brutal as this one , if he was n't utterly hated by another part . Almost by necessity those 2 parts of the population must have been treated in a vastly different manner . And need I mention , there have been very few Alawi rebels . Edit : And on the point of Assad lasting so long , I do n't have to remind you how long the apartheid regime lasted with practically no support from the black majority .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well my reasoning was that ATGMs would be a new threat that the SAA has never faced before , while an ambush is amongst the oldest tricks in the book . So assuming SAA commanders are inflexible embodiments of bureaucratic inertia , they would follow their tactical manuals , which would account for the possibility of ambush . And no , you did n't sound mean .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Thank you .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"But is n't the forcing a retreat ( or making the enemy unable to resist the offensive in some other way ) part the one that consumes the most time and effort ?

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Yeah there is . Counter-propaganda . All it would take is one tech-savvy guy with a laptop connecting to some wifi in Olgino and spamming a few hundreds/thousands searches for `` reddit '' . It would n't take too much of an effort really , seeing how Reddit is not terribly popular in Russia anyway - even /russia has only 16,497 followers . Generally , english language social websistes are incomparably less popular that domestic ( russian ) alternatives , such as vk.com to facebook Not really . Google does tend to notice attempts at manipulation does it not . It 's not like advertisers do n't try to manipulate google to make their products look more popular .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Those are two different things . You are probably thinking about manipulating adsense ads or something . You ca n't have it both ways - paid trolls operating from a office in Olgino boosting the ranking of a search term , and discounting the option of someone doing counter propaganda from the same area . All I 'm saying is that if google data was manipulated , it would probably require a greater level of sophistication than some guy with a laptop running some kind of script . It is reasonable to assume it would require the kind of internet service used by a medium sized or maybe large business for example . At this point you begin to wonder whether the whole effort do discredit Russia is n't too risky and too costly to be really worth it . & gt ; If paid trolls do exist , I would tend to argue that both sides cancel each other out . Not really , the ones with more resources at their disposal would be more noticeable , would n't they ? And considering that Russia is known to spend much more money on propaganda than Western countries ( There are no less than 20 national TV channels in Russia controlled by the government . ) , I 'd say Russian ones are quite likely to amongst the best funded out there , would n't you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Why not ? It 's supposedly an organisation that houses hundreds of people , is it not ? It 's not like someone would go to Olgino and hire hundreds of people in a plot to discredit Russia . & gt ; Nah . Search queries are not bandwidth intensive , on the contrary . Still , I assume you are going to need some amount other traffic in order to impersonate a lot of people . And the question remains , why has n't the Russian government or anyone in Russia uncovered this plot to discredit the country . You 'd expect they 'd someone in their security services to uncover such a needlessly complex and expensive plot to discredit their already unpopular country . & gt ; As I have shown , western trolling campaign is being conducted even by the official military units . Knowing the huge discrepancy between Russian and western military budgets it is the West that has the upper hand by a wide margin . Once again , even the Russian military puts much more importance on propaganda than western military . The Russian defence military has it 's own television channel . Neither the American nor British not French military have the same thing . It is reasonable to assume that those that put great importance on propaganda , will spend much more on it , compared to those that value it far less . & gt ; Also besides direct media ownership you should be counting in the the myriad of non-governmental organizations and projects funded by the West , as it is a form of propaganda as well . The propaganda value of an NGO is extremely questionable . The propaganda value of a TV channel is not .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I do n't think that impersonating an organisation with hundreds of people on its payroll is a simple task . It would require an effort large enough to be noticed . And it that is what had really happened , at least someone in Russia would have noticed . Since plotting to make it look like the Russian government hires internet trolls ( trough some company in St. Peter in that case ) is a plot to discredit Russia , regardless of what you say , someone in the Russian counter-intelligence would have done something about it . And once again , there is no reason why anyone in the west spend so much effort , and risk so much on a harebrained plot to discredit Russia . It 's already a highly unpopular country in most of the world . Most of the countries where Russia is popular are autocracies or oligarchies anyway , and popular opinion in those kinds of countries does n't really matter . And there is nothing you can say to convince me , or most reasonable people at that , that the country where the government controls 20 TV channels , including most of the major ones , spends less on propaganda than countries where most TV channels are private . The american military might have made a game , or hired a sports team , the Russian military , apart from maintaining the TV channel I mentioned , organises massive annual parades , and events like Tank Biathlons , designed to promote it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As far as I can remember , the Houthis have been loosing territory and cities , have they not ? & gt ; What is more likely to happen , even if KSA really starts shipping in heavy weapons , is that RuAF will simply have a more target rich environment . Because Russian airplanes are practically invincible to air defense , are they not ?

If NATO countries do nothing in a war between Russia and Turkey ( so long as the war escalates to the point where Russia counterattacks on Turkish soil ) , do n't you think that every headline of every newspaper in the western world would consist of nothing but sardonic puns on `` Peace of our time '' ? Let us be honest here , the only reason why we have n't seen a major western military engagement recently is because the Western world has so far been , strategically , on the offensive ( an extremely imprecise term , but unfortunately I can think of no better ) , in both Syria and Ukraine , with all of Russia 's recent actions being a reaction against pro-Russian governments collapsing or being at risk of collapse .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Here are the main problems with that . In order to achieve a lasting peace , the current Syrian government ( or any Syrian government that has come as the result of a `` reform '' of the present one ) would need large scale , persistent economic and military aid , provided over an exceedingly long period of time . Thus if FSA commanders have any reason to doubt that foreign support for the government will continue for the next say 10 years of conflict and recovery they are better of continuing their resistance . Throwing one 's lot with Bashar , a peacetime leader whose only major achievement is plunging his country in a civil war and a wartime leader under whose command the Army has required persistently larger foreign support , is just too risky . To put it simply , supporting the current Syrian government is to bet your and your family 's life on Iran , and now Russia being always there to help the Syrian army . As a corollary to that the Al-Nursa Front is far more valuable of an ally . While outside governments dislike that organization , it does n't depend on the fickle support of foreigners for its continued existence . Finally , there is no reason why the Coalition should support the Syrian government . The word terrorists does not make all the major rules of strategy and policy invalid . As of now Russia , Iran and Hezbollah are fighting those terrorists . Since the coalition governments consider Russia , Iran and Hezbollah enemies and in case of the last one terrorists , there is no reason why the coalition should try to end the fight between their major enemies . It is far better to let them fight each other and sap each other 's strength .

100100145,ukpolitics,"Then , do you think a society should sacrifice it 's ability to advance in order to increase social mobility ? Because high inheritance tax will only encourage old people to spend money on luxuries ( and probably tax avoidance schemes as well ) rather than invest .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; That 's not society sacrificing it 's ability to advance , it 's the rich sacrificing their ability to give unfair benefits to their lineage . The economy of the country is not a game . It 's the source of the people 's quality of life . Efforts to make it fair should not lower the standard of life it provides to all people , from the poorest to the richest . & gt ; Personally , I believe the elderly should be free to enjoy themselves rather than be so focused on making life easy for their family . We also have an economy based on spending , it 's not a problem if they spend on luxuries instead . When a company receives money from investment it spends them mostly to research and develop a new product , usually a product for the lower strata in a society . When a person buys a luxury product he only benefits himself and the usually quite few people that made the product . It 's also a matter of what we value as a society - would you rather we had a new line of microprocessors or some old guy had a yaht ? & gt ; If they did n't inherit it , they earned it , why should n't they enjoy it ? And why not have them give it to whomever they wish . & gt ; Also , people owning houses and passing them onto their children does ensure that there 's a gulf in society between those who 're lucky enough to have a home from their parents , and those whose parents were poor . Not really . A house is not that difficult thing to construct . Where I come from people would often build their own , sometimes just with the help of their families and extended families . Why would the poor have problems getting accommodation of their own ? & gt ; Tax avoidance is obviously going to happen , but refusing to do the right thing because of criminals is ridiculous , you just keep closing the loop holes . Because when you give people the choice of either loosing hundreds of thousands or becoming criminals the choice they are going to make is clear . And if you try to stop their criminal activities , they will simply offer a good part of the sum to your tax inspector , and he will make the same choice as well . & gt ; But anyway , this is just ideology . If you believe that your place in society should be entirely based upon your actions , you need inheritance tax . If you want people to be born into being rich , and never having to do anything themselves simply because of their luck to be born rich , and on the flip side with so much old money you accept the fact that those from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to succeed . If that 's fine with you , social mobility is n't for you . I 'd rather not sacrifice everyone 's quality of life to make everyone 's quality of life closer to everyone else 's quality of life , would you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; It 's hard to lower someone 's quality of life once they 're dead . I 'm talking about inheritance tax here , lol . Yes and my argument against inheritance taxes is that they affect the way old people employ their money , in a way that ultimately hurts everyone , though mostly the poor . & gt ; And then the yacht company buys metals , woods , and plastics . They all employ people down the chain , who then spend on other goods and so on . It 's a chain , and you 've got to keep the money moving . The more transactions the better , this is why deflation is so bad , once people feel products will be cheaper in the future they stop buying luxuries and hoarding cash and the economy grinds to a halt . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts , but it 's affected by it . And far more poor people will benefit from a rich guy spending money on shares , rather than yahts . & gt ; Because all land is owned , and if you 're lucky enough to own any land , permission is hard to get . If you go ahead and build something anyway councils then threaten to demolish it . We do n't have anywhere where someone can turn up with a positive attitude and a handful of tools , chop some wood and build a home . It 's against the law . Do n't you think that messing up with inheritance taxes is a poor substitute to addressing the actual issue . If permits are hard to get , there will be a housing shortage one way or another . If there is a housing shortage , quite a lot of people will be screwed up . If it 's not tenants paying exorbitant amount of money , it 's going to be people driven to homelessness because the new owners of the house , free from the burden of rent , have no incentive to share it with anyone else . The only way to deal with a housing shortage is to encourage the construction of more houses and that includes stuff like easing permits and allowing a procedure the legalization of illegal buildings . Where I come from , in some ( admittedly rare ) cases the municipality has been known to offer legalization of homes built on their property if people just agree to buy the land on which the home has been built , and at the ridiculously cheap rate of 0.61 euros per square meter at that . & gt ; Is n't corruption awesome ? It is not . It is a fact of life though , and if a policy of the government encourages corruption that has to be accounted for . & gt ; Yeah , fuck the poor . They should stay poor so that rich people can inherit everything they can from their families and never have to work . People should know their place in society and stay there . Well yeah , fuck the poor . Who cares if their lives get better ? Nah , they should be forced to live in pain and misery , just for the British people 's sadistic delight . As long as occasionally we force a rich guy to swap places with a poor one it 's all ethically OK ... Now do can we please refrain from making turning each other 's statements into a mockery of themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,UkrainianConflict,"`` Russia 's action in Ukraine was controversial '' does not imply that the conflict is over and the Russian actions towards Ukraine are accepted . Instead it implies that Russia 's actions in Ukraine are a thing of the past . At this point , it should be clear to everyone that Russia has lost its initiative as well as its ability to control events . Saying `` Russia 's action in Ukraine was controversial '' is like saying `` Serbia 's action in Croatia was controversial '' in 1992 . We are seeing a reduction in fighting not because Russia 's actions have been accepted but because Ukraine is awaiting an opportune moment to act .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Or that all negotiations with Russia have reached a dead end and they have now decided to take measures that would neutralize their aid to the Syrian government .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"That would be an unnecessarily aggressive course of action , but even that is not impossible . For example Russia might *bomb* the group participating in the train and equip program . If the whole thing has to be made more convincing to corpses are not that hard to acquire in a country in the middle of a civil war . Both NATO and the Arab countries posses significant numbers of soviet era aircraft , that could make a bombing run or two if that proves to be necessary . And of course there is the matter that the government of the Russian Federation has been screaming false flag left and right recently , so few will believe them . The times when the Syrian government bombed rebels that were fighting IS could be pointed out as well . If the whole thing is executed well enough Washington will be very outraged indeed at Russia deliberately sabotaging their efforts . Since the groups in the train and equip program were already forced to sign documents stating that they would not fight the Syrian government , only IS , there is no way to interpret Russia 's action but as a deliberate attempt to support the Islamic State , in the hope that this will help Assad politically . The American government will have no option but to declare that any Syrian or Russian military aircraft that enters or approaches rebel airspace could be shot down . If executed carefully and intelligently , there is no reason why the whole thing ca n't go as smoothly . But of course it 's probably not necessary to go that far . More subtle methods definitely exist as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If the US declares an area of Syria off limits for Russian aircraft what could Russia realistically do ? You are right though , the US is unlikely to take that step unless things change dramatically , since far simpler measures could do as well .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"The United States does poses stealth aircraft , you know .

The operators of those systems as well as their commanders should be well aware that if they do , they , as well as the entire Russian military mission are going to perish and there is nothing that anyone could do to save them . You see in general it 's the weak that have to fear escalation rather than the strong . Because escalation will only allow the strong to bring their might to bear against the weak .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Ok , first of all you have no idea how this AA performs against stealth fighters . I wager very well , but you can bet that the US does n't want to find out on the battlefield . NATO has been in possession of S-300 systems for quite some time now . It is extremely unlikely that those systems were not taken into account when designing their stealth aircraft . & gt ; Secondly , if you think Russians wo n't follow orders , you are delusional . The Russian army consists of conscripts and professional soldiers , not fanatics . They could follow suicidal orders , but they might choose not to . & gt ; Thirdly , even if the coalition wipes out this force which they wo n't , Russia can commit to a full ground invasion through and with Iran . Of course , right after they conquer the south Caucasus that is . As well as Iraq , as well . It 's not like Abadi is going to forget the reason why he is not fighting Islamic state armored and mechanized brigades . & gt ; Or they can just secretly pass a ballistic missile tech to NK putting the US under nuclear threat from NK . The Chinese are not going to like that , are they ? & gt ; Fourthly , the US will never risk a full scale war with a country that can wipe out the world several times ove And so will Russia .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's funny how Putin used to talk about Novorussia and how the South and East of Ukraine should n't really be part of that country . It 's funny how the Russian military academies have textbooks that say that Russia could not remain a great power if Ukraine continued to be an entity with its own independent desires . It 's funny how they recommended that Ukraine be divided into smaller states that Russia could control . And yet once it became clear that there is no way they could ever take and hold the South and East , once it became clear that the country could n't be divided , the goal of the Russian operations in Ukraine suddenly became much more limited . If you observe how the strategic situation has changed as a result of the Russian military intervention , you will see who won and who lost . Because now , with major parts of the pro-Russian population in Ukraine quarantined in the People 's Republics , the government in Kiev has never been more secure in its power , and could only be replaced by even more Russophobic forces . Now Russia has been effectively been cut of from Europe and it 's likely to remain so foe the forseeable future . Because now , Russia has a determined enemy right at its border , ready to use any moment of Russian weakness against Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I have to ask , given that back in the days Putin personally questioned why should the Ukrainian south and east be part of the country , do we have any evidence that he ever had such limited aims ? It 's interesting how goals can retroactively change , in order to make sure they were achieved successfully , is n't it ? And the whole using the Donbass to destabilize the country only makes sense if the Donbass was under government control . Now that it 's not pro-western forces are more secure in their power than they have ever been . Before the war the Donbass was , due to subsidies secured by the Party of Regions , a major drain on the Ukrainian budget . Nowadays Russia pays for it . The difference between annexing the region and splitting it away from the country is quite minimal . And I 've been hearing about the sanctions being lifted for the past 6 months . There is simply no reason for them to be lifted . They damage Russia and no one else . Finally , Russian pipelines being announced with a lot of fanfare happens quite often . Russian pipelines being built is a much more rare occurrence , to say the least . Another pipe being announced does n't indicate anything . I 'm sorry , but the Russian operations in Ukraine can be interpreted as a success , only if you do n't analyze the situation too deeply .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"My Russian is not very good but I think I think I could give you the gist it . The soldiers refuse to fight unless given written orders as required by military law . The military prosecution refuses to answer inquiries by the Presidential Human Rights Council on that matter . They military prosecution has instead given the case to the FSB . The FSB is threatening the soldiers with convictions for felony . For one reason or another they avoid mentioning articles of the criminal code , but informally mention `` state treason '' .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I can understand the article the source of Gazeta seems to be the lawyer of the soldiers and officials from the Presidential Human Rights Council , rather than the soldiers themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Do you have a source for that ? A link to the articles in question ?,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see . But at least in the article , it 's the lawyer that describes the situation to the press , so I would guess someone connected to the case has already contacted him . Though it probably does not matter . Since the orders were given in clear violation of the law , the soldiers probably ca n't be charged for disclosing them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed , and the internet researchers have come with them . I just do n't think they were here before , or , if nothing else , at least they used way more subtle methods in their research .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The end of Bashar al-Assad probably wo n't be the end of fighting , but it 's likely to dramatically turn the government 's fortunes . If the president were to be removed in a tidy way ( like an military coup for example ) quite a significant amount of rebel fighters would probably stop fighting or defect to the government 's side . Furthermore the government will no longer be intensely hated by large sections of Syrian society , which is an important prerequisite to long-lasting peace in the country . More importantly , in order to secure victory , the government desperately needs to conduct an army reform , and an enormous amount of the measures the government has to undertake are obstructed by the mere existence of the current president . If he were to be removed the SAA would at least have the chance to become a decent fighting force . So Bashar al-Assad 's probably wo n't end the war , nor will it guarantee that the war ends at some point in the future , but at least it would create a way out of this mess . This would be quite a massive improvement as compared to the present situation . The SAA being destroyed , right now , on the other hand is more likely than not to lead to unpleasant situations . The SAA being destroyed over the course of multiple years , is a more complex matter .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Of course they might increase the amount of planes they send , but doing so will tie up quite a lot of resources . And Russia needs to have quite a lot of resources prepared to deal with potential emergencies on more important fronts , seeing how the Post-Soviet area is mostly filled with hostile countries awaiting the moment to strike and disloyal allies that have to be kept in line . Both could probably rely on powerful allies outside of the post-Soviet space , in case of hostilities with the Russian Federation . Because in spite of all the talk about the Western World abandoning friendly post-soviet countries , they have so far received all the help they needed . Military procurement plans have already been cut , so Russia ca n't afford to spend too much on large scale campaigns on faraway fronts . It is my strong belief that in order to have a lasting effect on the course of the war , the Russian military 's involvement will have to be continuous . Because of that , and because of everything I said above , I believe the Russian government will not be willing to direct significant amount of resources towards Syria 's battlefields .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russian tactical doctrines , unlike American ones , actually advocate putting helicopters in harm 's way , though . From what I undetstand in general Russian helicopter casualties have always been much higher than American ones in comparable conflicts .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The SAA is worse . In fact I 'm going to say that the Syrian Arab Republic is more corrupt and in general worse for its people as a regime than fascist Italy . Autocracies that proudly proclaim themselves as such are in generals much less corrupt as compared to autocracies that claim they are democratic . In that sense the Syrian state has more similarities with imperial Rome than with the dictatorships of the first half of the 20th century . It is certainly more unstable , worse economically , and more self destructive than any of the fascist states ever were , with the major exception of Germany . And it goes beyond mere personalities . Fascist Italy managed to depose Mussolini , the German generals made like 5 attempts on Hitler 's life , yet the SAA 's generals just stand by while Assad leads the SAA and the entire Syrian state to its doom .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Its kind of sad , really . Before the Russian support , the Syrian government looked like it might adopt a reasonably good defensive strategy , they even seemed to reach some kind of stalemate with Jaish al-Fateh in the Al-Ghab plain .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"In Afghanistan there was an Afghan Military as well . And while the idea that the US should just support the South Vietnamese Army , rather than to fight the war on its own only gained traction when the Vietnam war was coming to a close , the idea that Soviet troops are there to assist and nothing more was an integral part of Soviet strategy in Afghanistan from the start .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russians may not have supplied MANPADs to the Taliban , but from what I understand at the point of the American invasion of Afghanistan such rockets were readily available in the region , which was not true during the Soviet invasion for the most part . And once again we are comparing 2 separate wars with just one . As for Vietnam , once again I 'm going to say that the conflict is not comparable Afghanistan . North Vietnam was a country with an actual army , armored troops and air force . In Afghanistan the USSR fought militias . The wars can not be compared .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If they really cared for that , they would have been ready to do whatever it takes to bring victory to the SAA . By now it should be obvious to everyone that the commander in chief is a massive liability . Yet no attempts to remove or kill him have been made . Yes , in event of a rebel victory there is a strong possibility of sectarian violence . But that is not going to be a problem for the SAA 's senior officers . Because sectarian violence is something that will happen to other people . High ranking officers and their families , meanwhile , will spend their time in comfort and luxury somewhere far away .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I remember the definition a republic is a state in which political power does not stem from the private matters of a single family . So any single form of government apart from hereditary autocracy . Thus the Syrian Arab Republic can not be called a republic , since it 's rule is in practice hereditary and autocratic . You are right though , contrasting autocracies and republics is incorrect . I should fix that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"There might not be another option I 'm afraid . In recent years Russian foreign policy has been driven more and more by populism . Because of that I believe that the Russian government is going to be extremely hesitant to undertake any action that may hurt it 's popularity . That limits the courses of action they may choose . Giving up now is n't going to be perceived well by the Russian public . `` It seems that the side in the civil war that we have been supporting for 4 years now as stalwarts of stability is actually incapable of fighting , so I guess we 'd have to give up . '' is a statement that could be very difficult to sell . If the Russian government does not step up its intervention and does not achieve any significant effects on the ground it risks looking weak , probably out of touch as well . So that is out of the question as well . So unless there is another option , it might be the case that picking up the SAA 's slack is the only way they can proceed from here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"People in the Russian government have suggested the use of the same mercenaries and right wing paramilitaries they used to send in Ukraine , so that is a way to go around the unpopularity of sending ground troops into Syria . Granted this would be reinforcing an under-performing army with another under-performing army , but nothing is perfect . It may not turn the tide in the war , but most likely would result in periods of temporary success for the Syrian armed forces . The Russian government can reasonably hope , that in the time it takes for the rebels to adapt to the new threat , there shall emerge a way for the Russian government to disengage from the conflict with its popularity intact . Edit : In practice things are quite likely to go bad , but they are unlikely to go bad immediately . Since I believe the Russian government is quite shortsighted , that would be acceptable to them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"They would get far less volunteers , probably only the most dedicated among the religious fanatics would go to Syria with nationalists staying away , but the Russian Federation can draw ample amounts of mercenary soldiers from among its population . Because of conscription there is no shortage of trained men . Because of the economic and social system , there are enough poor people willing to risk their lives for relatively small sums of money . They would probably be sufficient to compensate for the lack of volunteers . And it 's not like the Russians has to or could afford to send that big of an army in Syria . In Ukraine they send tens of thousands of men , sending ten thousand men to Syria and supplying them there would be a major logistical challenge .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The Syrian army has been receiving training and advisers from Russia/The Soviet Union since the nineteen-sixties . If the Russian army could have helped , it would have done so decades ago .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I find that kind of arguments interesting . It 's so typical of Russian foreign thinking . Those oppressed people have no agency and no ability to act on their own . Instead they are mere tools to be used by other nations . I will tell you this , those Shia in Saudi Arabia either will rise in rebellion or they wo n't , it 's their decision to make . And the only country that could do anything to change their decision is neither Russia , nor Iran but Saudi Arabia itself .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The thing is they ca n't just switch from throwing armor at the rebels to throwing bombs at them as they seem to want to . The rebels and their allies will just adapt to that . Instead infantry and armor doctrines have to be altered in order to become viable in this war . Unfortunately to implement such a strategy is likely impossible without an overall army reform . And good luck getting that with this president . Edit : To add upon what I said I want to add that the Syrian government seems to think that the solution to any problem it encounters is more stuff . First it was more soldiers , which is why we got Hezbollah and the Hazas . That worked for a while , but eventually advances ground to a halt . Then it was more generals , which is why we got the IRCG generals . But more generals does n't equal better tactics and strategy . Now they seem to have decided they need more bombs , hence why the Russians are here . This too shall fail .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So there was some kind of riot in Najran , but it was defused relatively quickly and with very little bloodshed . My point still stands . And beyond that , considering that the only sources of information I 've been able to find about those events are wildly conflicting second hand accounts , the earliest of which seems to be from [ 2008 ] ( https : //www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0908web.pdf ) , I suspect that the events that transpired in the province in 2000 might have been much less serious than they are presented as in your article , and maybe in HRW 's document as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Ukraine was hardly backed by the west in the battlefield was it ? Anyway , the answer to your first question is yes , but not for military reasons . The Donbass rebellion had no chance to last simply because it was n't a rebellion . The most striking feature of the whole separatist movement there is just how unnatural it was . The Ukrainian government could send its army to quell the unrest , simply because a great part of the unrest involved armed men , often times hailing from foreign countries , seizing police offices and municipal buildings . It 's not so much that the Donbass people could n't have fought against the Ukrainian army , as much as that they would n't have risen up in the first place . To illustrate my point I will note that there was a point where the whole pro-Russian unrest designed to form the state of New-Russia looked like it might succeed , but after the events in Odessa it became clear that supporters of the new government , already battle hardened in street fights with Yanukovich 's special police , were neither intimidated , nor incapable of dealing with an enemy equipped with firearms . In an organic unrest the events that transpired in that city would have only inflamed tensions further . Instead the entire pro-Russian movement in the Ukrainian south east seems to have been recalled , from all regions except the Donbass , where the Russian government could dispatch an overwhelming force and thus ensure the pro-Russian side succeed . Ironically enough if the Russian Government had never resorted to creating a pro-Russian `` revolt '' the Ukrainian government would have now faced the possibility of an actual pro-Russian revolt . Such an event would have been much more difficult to suppress as it would have been politically difficult for the Ukrainian government to send the army against a genuine rebellion . When Yanukovich tried to do that the general staff simply refused his orders . Also pro-Russian protests would probably have been more effective if they involved large groups of people , rather than small ones , trying to compensate for their size with violence and occasionally with firearms . But instead of allowing a genuine revolt to form , and then supporting it , the Russian government decided to organize the revolt all by itself . As for Syria , the rebellion had largely been successful , without any significant foreign aid , before the point when the Syrian government got foreign aid of its own , in the form of Hezbollah troops . And I 'm going to say that rebellions can sometimes succeed without foreign aid , and sometimes they ca n't , but in any case , the a revolt can only hope to be successful , if it develops naturally , on its own , trough the grievances of the population . A `` rebellion '' raised by some foreign country , ( if you can even call it that ) is by bound to fail to achieve it 's goals , and it 's mere survival would require enormous amounts of foreign support . ( The post I was responding to was responding to was suggesting that Russia should raise a revolt among the Saudi Shia , in retaliation to Saudi Support for the rebels . No idea why it was deleted . )",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The fact remains that we have no first hand accounts of the events , no documentary or material evidence to point us at what really happened , and both the author of your article , as well as his sources are likely to exaggerate the extent and the level of success of the whole thing . And to be frank , the series of events described in the article hardly make sense . All Saudi security servicemen in the town ran away in the face of the armed rioters around the governor 's residence , yet the governor was unharmed , and the whole incident ended incredibly peacefully and incredibly quickly . That sounds incredibly unlikely . And nothing that happened in 2000 indicates that the people of Najran have any desire to rid themselves of Saudi rule . Iran and Russia may provide all the weapons they wish to anyone they wish , but without a real rebellion they would achieve nothing , except anger the Saudi Government .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

That is correct , What I 'm saying is that it 's generally considered incredibly humiliating for a president to lack the support of those in his own government . & gt ; I was n't aware that the US Congress wants a no fly zone against Russia .

Regardless of what people around here may think , refusing a call to arms by a NATO member would have consequences far more serious than going to war with Russia . A war with Russia risks escalating things to the point where nuclear weapons are used , refusing to defend a NATO member would guarantee that . And no , the Falklands war is not indicative of anything . It 's just that Britain never requested military aid , mostly due to political reasons . Nobody refused Britain any help it requested , or needed . And in spite of that American carriers were sent to assist the British if they met any resistance they could n't handle .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; If Turkey , for whatever reason , starts undertaking independent and aggressive action , characteristic of a rogue state , resulting in a conflict with Russia . In my view , it would almost certainly be denied military assistance from NATO and perhaps even expelled from the alliance if regulations permit doing so . You suggest that direct military action is the only possible response that NATO members could take , despite the NATO Call to Arms ( Article 5 ) specifically leaving that decision in the hands of individual members to do what they deem wise and not necessarily thorough armed force . I think if Turkey happens to be in a war with Russia , the necessity of the use of armed force would be obvious , would n't it . & gt ; When keeping in mind the rational distinction between defending an ally from aggression and aiding an ally 's aggression . No western politician will have legal , moral or political difficulty justifying their lack of military response in such a scenario . Once again , this scenario involves the leadership of Turkey losing their minds and committing an intentional act of war against Russia . It is not a realistic scenario . Do you think the general public in America , or Britain or France cares about legal technicalities . The way they are going to see it a NATO ally has been attacked , because they refused to let a Russian ship trough their seas . Western politicians can ignore that only at their own peril . & gt ; I am afraid that I do not follow your logic here . How does a Turkey losing a skirmish or limited regional conflict with Russia guarantee the use of nuclear weapons ? More so than an actual war between NATO and Russia , where Russia is the party being attacked ? ? ? If Russia can attack a NATO country because of some legal technicality and get away with it , the question becomes can Russia do the same because of some vague moral statement or something . It 's not like the Russian government has shown itself to care about international law . To stick to the letter of the laws in that case would be interpreted as a sign of weakness . And the problem with showing signs of weakness , is that soon after you do it , you will be forced to prove your strength . & gt ; What makes you think that this hypothetical scenario would be called anything but a `` conflict '' or a `` crisis '' . We are not talking about a full land invasion of Turkey . Only about limited naval and aerial skirmishes with potential for bombing of military infrastructure such as ports , airbases and SAM sites .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The general public in America , Britain or France does not care about Turkey or Russia or Syria or NATO . The public however does care about joining in on unnecessary , bloody and expensive wars . Doubly so if this war when taken to its natural conclusion carries a very high likelihood of the apocalypse . I 'm sorry but I just do n't see anyone standing idly by while the Russian government imposes it 's will upon a NATO country . And if someone stands idly by , I assure you , that 's not going to be popular . & gt ; The Western media has found itself to always be closely aligned with the current foreign policy decisions of the respective state . It would not be difficult for the media to convey the government 's position to sway public opinion on their side . The western world is not Russia . Media around here would rather attack a government than support it . And abandoning a NATO country would give them ample opportunity to attack . & gt ; That not `` some legal technicality '' , its international law . The basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states . Its purpose is to avoid needless wars . An illegal naval blockade being an act of war is not some obscure technicality , is one of the oldest and most fundamental laws of the sea . I 'm sorry but what are you talking about ? `` Blockade '' ? ! The only thing Turkey would have to deny Russian ships passage trough it 's territorial waters . Need I remind you that the only reason why Turkey does not use that right is because of some document signed almost 80 years ago . Thus a legal technicality . Though come to think of it , I doubt said document would authorize an armed attack against Turkey , if the Turkish signature under it were withdrawn , so it might not be even that . And need I remind you how laughable the whole `` basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states '' is , when you realize it 's we are discussing Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Because sticking with allies is something so fundamental that everyone understands the need to do it . If you stop doing it , you loose all your allies , it 's elementary common sense . The public does n't care about conventions , the UN , international law and all that . They understand international relations in simpler , yet far superior ways . They divide the world into friends and foes , and realize that foes should not be allowed to impose their will upon friends . I assure you , few would like a war , but that does not mean people are unaware of the consequences of betrayal , born out of cowardice and weakness . And because nowadays , in a moment of Russian weakness unlike any we have seen in a century , it 's easy enough to crush Russian attempts to impose their will upon NATO allies . It would be easy enough to hold of the Russians at Turkey 's borders and in the black sea , while coalition air force ends the Syrian government , thereby depriving the war of its purpose . The Warsaw Pact being dead makes the situation worse for the Russian government not better .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"International law is little more than a code of conduct , is it not ? To expect that someone would follow a code of conduct when dealing with those that have shown an utter contempt for that code of conduct is just silly .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , the dispatch of an elite infantry brigade was announced more than a weak before the brigade in question actually engaged the enemy in the area . If that 's true , it 's downright insane . Whatever problems the SAA might have , it is a well established army that has fought in multiple wars . I find idea that they would disregard military secrecy in such a horrible manner unbelievable . Also , are SAA 's elite soldiers really so undisciplined as to post information about their deployments ? From what I understand even JaN has cracked down on that practice . Though I can certainly believe that might be the case if the elite brigade in question has lost an excessive portion of its officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Observe , for example , the difference between the methods the Islamic Republic of Iran uses in promoting favorable viewpoints as compared to their arch rival , the Saudi Kingdom . Iranian news outlets , including state news organizations , all behave like tabloids . You 'd expect that a state TV channel would try to maintain a good standing , since it 's reputation is intrinsically linked to the reputation of the state it represents . Yet PressTV has quite justifiably acquired reputation for being deceptive and obviously biased . Overall , Iranian propaganda is crude and amateurish . When people see a story by an Iranian news organization , they expect misinformation . In comparison with Iran the Saudi government deals with foreign media in a far more traditional manner . While Iran has 2 state news agencies and a government TV channel , KSA has only 1 official press agency . The Saudi equivalent of FarsNews would be Al Arabiya , an agency usually taken far more seriously . Saudi media , unlike their Iranian counterparts , rarely tries to deceive it 's viewers and when they do it 's usually done well . As a result any deception they engage in is far more likely to be believed . Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have censorship but in the Kingdom the censor is not the preferred way of controlling the media landscape . Instead the Saudi state encourages a cultural and economic environment hostile to criticism of government . A consequence of that is the fact that they are more than capable of influencing media beyond its borders . It is said that even Al Manar reporters are hesitant to attack the Kingdom . Overall , there is a lot to discuss about Iranian propaganda . It should be clear by now that I consider it to be terrible , and beyond that vastly inferior to the more traditional means of persuasion employed by their main rival . ( I avoid the term propaganda when speaking about Saudi Arabia , since usually the term is used to denote rather crude ways to get one 's point across . ) The reasons for that are something worthy of discussion .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I 'm afraid the course of the war at the present moment would contradict the idea that telling the enemy your intentions can somehow work to your advantage . Observe that the Syrian Army is vastly superior to the forces of the Islamic State in both manpower and weaponry . Perhaps the Islamic State may have some advantage in terms of fighting spirit but it is nowhere near enough to compensate for the superiority of the SAA 's forces . The SAA usually announces it 's offensives beforehand whereas IS does not . The SAA operations are sometimes successful but sometimes end disastrously . IS on the other hand has come to be known for their surprise offensives that catch the enemy off guard and thus capture large cities in mere days . In contrast to the SAA 's occasional great failures , the Islamic State achieves the occasional great success . The SAA 's failures have lead to a point where the government has been driven to searching salvation in foreign force after foreign force , first Hezbollah , then the IRGC , then Iraqi militias and now the armed forces of the Russian Federation . The Islamic State has been attacked by multiple foreign forces and , while it has been weakened to some degree , it still seems to remain militarily viable . You say that wars are won and lost by the calls of generals and their ability to exploit a situation . But the logical consequence of that is that the enemy 's generals have to be kept as ignorant as possible of the situation , because that way they are likely to make the wrong calls . Edit : Clarified some things . Fixed some other things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's not a matter of an ability to condemn . Whether you can condemn someone or not does n't really matter , condemnations are just words . What matters is that with regards to the Russian Federation and their allies , the US can now violate every article of international law , without this affecting their relations with other countries . When the US invaded Iraq relations with other countries suffered . When the Russian Federation annexed Ukrainian territory , the diplomatic damage was enormous , to say the least . Yet if the US declares a no fly zone upon Syria now , I assure you , few will care .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Perhaps he has . The Russian Federation and it 's allies ca n't demand that international law be followed , if someone else is violating it . Or rather they could , but doing so would result in nothing but in their contemptuous mockery .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Deposing governments without UN approval , the US 's worst violation of international law , was something that both the Soviet Union and the Western powers would do occasionaly during the Cold War . Territorial expansion on the other hand was considered inconceivable . In practice the reason why the American government could violate international law and still cite it is that the US never violated it in a manner that shows an utter contempt for that law . Like it or not the fact is that trough its territorial expansion the Russian Federation has suspended the Cold War era rules of conduct between nations , to which the set of rules we call international law are a product of . American violations of international law were always conducted in such a manner that they would avoid a similar effect . There is a reason why the United States allowed Iraq to have an independent government of its own , and a major part of it is that they can now expect that other nations conduct themselves in their dealings with the US within the boundaries of international law , with the occasional acceptable violation . This is why you do n't see many people laughing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The idea that Russia would n't defend itself against a US attack is pretty ridiculous . In fact , they have every reason to escalate such a fight to a level where they have parity . The only way they could have parity is if things escalate to the point of use of nuclear weapons . And , to repeat what I said in another post , do you honestly believe that the billionaire rulers of the Russian Federation would risk loosing all they love and cherish for the sake of Russia 's pride and great power status ? Because I highly doubt this is the case . & gt ; The president publicly discarded his opinion . Yes , it 's rather humiliating . Rather more humiliating for the president I 'm afraid .

When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938 it deeply destabilized Europe . In spite of Germany having the muscle to get away with it , the diplomatic consequences were severe enough that a year later Germany found itself in a war with several major powers . When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 peace in Europe remained undisturbed . The diplomatic consequences for the USSR were far less significant . And you keep talking about weak and strong but you seem to forget that those terms are , by their meaning , relative . You repeat the whole strong and weak thing all the time , but you seem to forget that Russia is much weaker than the West in every regard except in strategic weapons .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is there really little to gain from picking up a fight with Russia ? I do n't think so .

All of a sudden , the Russian Federation would loose every ally it has in the Middle East . And beyond that Iran , for example , could reconsider it 's squabble with the Gulf monarchies , and that is something the US would benefit from greatly . I 'm not saying that a conflict with Russia would necessarily be worth it though . There are enormous risks involved in the whole thing . In this case the risks might be great but the reward is great as well . Whether the risks would be worth the reward is not a judgement for me to make , but rather for the people that read intelligence assessments and similar documents , but I assure you the choice is far less clear than you present it .

Most demographics maps say they were mostly Bulgarians with Greek and Serb majorities closer to the countries ' borders . Bulgaria fought many wars with reuniting with Macedonia being the major desire . But after losing the second Balkan war which was completely fought because of Macedonia and WW1 which Bulgaria basically joined to get Macedonia there was a decrease in tensions and there were much larger problems in Bulgaria that it had to deal with . After WW1 Yugoslavia was created and I think that is where Macedonia as a nation really developed . So by 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia there was a legitimate Macedonian nation that wanted to govern itself . An issue with this though was that Macedonia had no real history as a country , and no national identity past the part of the people feeling Macedonian . So in order to create a Macedonian national identity the government started separating the language with Bulgarian ( which tbh had already developed differences ) amongst other things while taking huge liberties with history like making outright wrong claims like saying they were descendants of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,Liberal,Capitalism is based on how the economy of the world has worked since the first coins were minted . There was always capitalism in the US ( at least after the Europeans arrived ) . I dont agree with Laissez-faire capitalism and I think there should be a socialist counter balance to capitalism but communism is going way too far . As a liberal I believe in equality and equality means that people have the right to work harder to achieve more . Its not a perfect system but until we get a better one we have to deal with it .

I do not reject Crimea 's desires but reject the way Russia invaded another nation , annexed territory from it and sent soldiers , supplies , and weaponry in that same country to support separatists . The referendum was illegal and of course so was the annexation . Ukraine is the one who needs to decided whether to give them a referendum or not , even though I personally would like them to choose which country they want to be in , especially because of the confusing situation of Ukraine .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,videos,"Ukraine 's government was corrupt and bought by Russia . Which is one of the reason why the people started protesting . Then the police responded with a very heave counter offensive indeed killing some people . But it wasnt a rebellion , it wasnt a riot . It was a protest turned violent by the police at certain points at certain places in Ukraine 's capital . Then the president escapes to Russia leaving a trail of corruption left to be discovered by the people . The whole protest was over by the time that Russia sent soldiers and tanks to Crimea and annexed it . At first they even denied sending any troops which is what they also did in Eastern Ukraine before even Putin admitting they had sent soldiers and heavy military equipment to aide the separatists and fight Ukraine . My country has done these things like in the early 20th century when such things were normal . But it is expected more of the modern states in fucking Europe . Plus I say again , just because other countries have done similar things it does not justify Russia in doing them as well . And critique of countries doing dumb shit is highly needed from the inside and the outside so it stops countries from doing such things . But Russia has no people on the inside who can call out because many of them turn up with bullets to the back of their heads if they do and also Russia controls all significant media organisations in the country and is very successful at mind-washing their citizens .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

If a city or a ranged unit can attack an enemy you no longer get a notification , also no notification if an enemy enters your borders . Very annoying in multiple-front wars . 2 . The warmongering system is dumb af . I declare one war after 200 turns and everybody goes to hating me when I had been attacked by all my neighbours at least 2 times per civ until then . This makes no sense . Plus why the hell is the war penalty harsher at the start of the game ? Surely war is much more despised now than during the medieval era . This is not historically accurate and breaks my immersion . 3 . The trading system with other civs is the most annoying aspect of all . I heard that they made it so that the more you have compared to the other civ the more they will want from you . This is completely illogical . At the end of my game people stopped even giving me anything and just wanted gifts , anything more would offend them . How is 1 luxury item worth 3 of mine because I have more than them ? Makes absolutely no sense and basically makes it impossible to use this aspect of the game if you start winning . 4 . The automatic change of unit selection . Oh.My.God . I have selected a unit stop throwing me on the other side of the map to play what you want . I have sent units on incorrect random trips so many times by mistake . I have selected move order and the dumbass game selects the other unit while I am clicking . Why ? ! Just let me have the option to turn it off . 5 . Smaller things : Range of ranged units sometimes change . One turn I can attack a unit the next turn I cant . I cant understand why this is happening . Other smaller annoyances with the AI in diplomacy . Why dont I have move your troops away ? Sometimes they can say that to me if I have 1 unit 2 tiles away but I have not once been able to use it myself . Why are land units so strong when being transported over water ? I had a battleship , a rocket ship and a submarine all trying to stop a small invasion force of 5-6 units ( mechs , tanks ) and I was only able to sink one .

Ive come to universally being hated in both games I played , in the second one I was much more passive only declaring war very late into the game and still . 5 : I think in most of these cases yes .

What about the Bangkok Titans 0-6 ? ANX is more likely a miracle run than a sign that other IWC regions are on that level . INTZ won the first game due to EDG completely underestimating them and then they proceeded to lose every other game . If that game was a BO2 or BO3 INTZ couldnt have taken the series because it was a fluke . IWC has become better but only so that the pther regions cant beat them without a gameplan and some prep . Imo IWC earned their first seed last worlds and thanks to ANX and ANX only they have maybe gotten competitive enough to maybe be given a second seed for next years . But still I believe that its most likely that one of the IWC seeds will just mean one less competitor in one of the groups and easier quarters for the other teams in the groups which is rather unfair .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,videos,"Well as I said the book is my only source on this . Obviously its written for the general public with the purpose of being entertaining so its not the most factual but its generally regarded as *good enough* . The book covers the whole of human history but if you ever hear someone talk about it it would be about its depiction of the earliest humans , that part is also regarded as most factual ( by what I have heard/read from other people ) . I also have a huge interest in early humans so I found the first half of the book very interesting though once it got to Ancient Greece , the Renaissance I lost interest because I already knew enough about those periods to not need the gross oversimplification and compression .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,videos,"The way I saw it is that it was the restaurant and the lifestyle of a head chef that made him lose himself and this is shown throughout the movie by characters mentioning his lack of time and his fanaticism in achieving his goal of being a great chef . The movie ending with him again being a head chef at a restaurant kind of makes the journey a bit meaningless . Why is he going to be able to see his son/ex wife now and he didnt manage to before ? Through the movie I thought that Jon 's character was trying to rediscover himself and the passion to cook and I thought he did that with the food truck , I did not see it as a road trip thing . I do actually enjoy the movie but I mean from my point of view there *is* some concern if he is writing for the show .

But what I still miss is songs like Taro and Matilda or things like the reference to The Good the Bad and the Ugly , etc .

People have said that I need to go for support equipment and artillery but I ca n't even manage to produce enough 1918 rifles to last the war . Last game I managed to hold off the Japanese and start pushing them back but then they annexed French Indochina and I could n't fight on two fronts . They also managed to land a shit tonne of troops next to Nanjing even though I have the whole coastline and ports protected by the 30 or so Juntuans but they seem to be useless . They ca n't fight off a landing of more than a couple of units and then are completely useless in fighting the Japanese off the coasts before they reinforce . This is why I positioned 3 secondary coastal defences made up of 4 full force infantries ready to repulse any landing that manages to gain a foothold and that seemed to work until I had to send them to Fr Indochina .
