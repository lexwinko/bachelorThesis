20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Maybe I went overboard a bit . Possibly fueled by decades of being unable to speak with anybody on this matter in a rational manner . I think there is a big identity crisis in Bulgaria . We dont know if we are Slavic or Turkic ( proto-Bulgarians were , 500 years of Ottoman rule and as you said a lot of resettlement ) or Thracian , etc . because the truth is we are all of them . So no we have very little in common with the Proto-Bulgarians . At this point the only thing that is left is the name . Then I remember studying in school that the major population make-up of the Balkans when the Bulgars arrived were Slavic , this is incorrect . They were definitely present but there was another bigger group which were one of the oldest European population , which have stayed in South-East Europe for thousands of years . We see most of those people in countries like Croatia , Serbia and Bulgaria . If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million natives . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I am Bulgarian . Why am I Bulgarian ? 1300+ years ago some 30 000 steppe people showed up in the general area where Bulgaria is situated now . They were the Bulgars . What they found was a bunch of unorganised Slavs and Thracian descendants numbering about 2 million people . Quickly they incorporated them within the new Bulgarian state with the Bulgars forming the ruling and military elite . Wars ensued and little by little the proto-Bulgarians either mixed in with the native inhabitants or died off in these wars . I am very inclined to believe that all Bulgars had died off ( As they were semi-nomadic warriors they comprised the biggest chunk of the army , they did not deal with other things , so when an army was destroyed a massive chunk of the Bulgar population was destroyed as well ) or mixed with the local populace beyond recognition by the time the Byzantines conquered Bulgaria some 300 years after its creation . \\n\\nSo here I am . Its 2016 some 1000 years after I believe the Bulgars in this region were no longer an ethnicity . But still our country is called Bulgaria , I call myself Bulgarian but after what ? Some word that used to mean something 1000 years ago . Why do I not call myself Byzantine ? Or Turkish ? The Ottomans formed the longest lasting government that ruled these lands . I only care about my culture and traditions because they were inherited to me the same way another culture and traditions could have been inherited to me . \\n\\nSo I realised , nationality , religion , culture and traditions . All these things are random . They should **not** be the basis of my character . They should not define me , they should not define my inspirations about the future or my interpretation of history . I realised nationality is something , used in the past to drive the masses to do what the Kings and Dictators told them to . History was changed , culture and traditions adapted , so your kid would grow up and thoughtlessly drive himself towards the trench of the enemy for this made up symbolism and made up norms . \\n\\nHow silly it is , that we divide ourselves into nation-states because 300-800-1300 years ago someone thrust a sword in the ground and said that ethnicity and culture and traditions would not grow from now on at this particular place . \\n\\nWhen it comes to having a government , I dont care if its made up by only Bulgarians . What I care is that it has the same basic principles as I do , which are equality , human and civil rights and that everybody has the liberty to pursue happiness . The same way religion was separated from the state , so should nationality .

So we cant just suddenly stop \ '' evolving\ '' because most people like the traditional ways . This is humanity . Always improve , become better to enhance your life . \\n\\nThe nation should not promote nationalism and patriotism and it is actually pitiful that our state does so aggressively , as if they are afraid our established culture and traditions are going to shift . But that is what culture is . It changes , it adapts and it grows . We are so judgemental of the Muslims in the Middle-East for standing behind their societary and cultural beliefs even though they are sexist and sometimes barbaric , but when someone tells us to re-evaluate our societary boundaries we go super defensive because \ '' dont you insult our culture\ '' and \ '' We are proud to defend the values our ancestors fought for\ '' .

Trading going North mostly ends with Romania , there is some trade with Russia and Poland but 99 % of the Russian trade goes through the Black Sea and through , you guessed it Trakia . Varna and Burgas are very important for trade , not only for tourism , so the Trakia highway is very much necessary , I assume I do not have to explain why port cities are very important to trade . Plus the Turkey Highway ( Maritsa was it ? ) connects to Trakia at about 2/3 of its length , and you even didnt dispute the importance of that trade route .

Again I do not think the government has been perfect but I think they have done very well considering what the pre-EU governments did which is close to nothing.\\n \\nI believe the Veliko Turnovo-Ruse highway will be paid for by the end of the year . \\nAh so typical , complaining there is no funding to build highways and complain when the government increased the price for the *ridiculously* cheap vignette .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I also feel like a lot of people in the EU and especially reddit are getting confused between the TPP and TTIP . I know I was . At some point there was so much negative info on the TPP that when I heard about the TTIP I thought it was a deal that stemmed from the TPP . Are people just jumping on the \ '' fuck the TTIP\ '' bandwagon without thinking ? \\n\\nI mean we definitely should be sceptical but we ought to give it a good reasonable thought before simply discarding the deal .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I was actually defending the Bulgarian Muslims .

Maybe its less lying and more him saying dumb things and then taking them back but he has one of the worst truth-o-meter ratings in politics . \\n\\n & gt ; This is why I find these remarks that he isnt serious .Because the criticism he faces amounts to little more than disdain for how he expresses himself\\n\\nAt this point nobody is not taking him seriously .

He says BS suddenly when we call him out on it we are obstructing democracy . \\n\\n & gt ; Also banning people from entering until we can review our policy is a good idea . Your only objection can be moralistic . And it would be silly because prior to 1964 America didnt allow lots of people to immigrate . Muslims were essentially on that list\\n\\nIt is not . I do not see any issues with the current system . Also a reasonable person says \ '' we need to make sure our immigration system is working fine\ '' a xenophobe says \ '' ban all Muslims\ '' .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Well the stats in Wikipedia are a bit different but yeah Bulgaria was doing well compared to the other Eastern Bloc countries .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Nobody said countries should be forced into a federal government .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I hate the idea of a nation-state and would hate to live in a ethno-segregated world . What is Bulgaria anyway ? Because 1500 years ago 30 000 Bulgarians settled and mixed in with 2 million Slavs and other ethnicities and formed the military and ruling elite of the country everybody in it will be Bulgarian forever ? Who cares what the country is called , by now it is just a relic of some name that used to mean something a thousand years ago . What matters to me is that we secure a good and equal future . I do not mind if they wrote the signs in Turkish in the Turk predominant regions . They have as much right to live in Bulgaria as we do and as human beings they have the right to be treated equally and fairly . If they become a major nationality then fuck it lets rename the country , but it is unreasonable to do it now when they are only around 12 % . Treating them as equal citizens does not mean we need to go to the other extreme and become half Turks or something.\\n I have never fought for a segregated nation-state not that you have fought for anything either . But if we go with \ '' we\ '' and \ '' them\ '' they fought for this land too and Ottoman Bulgaria is the longest governmental state that has existed in these lands .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"That is incorrect . As I said in another comment less than 100 years ago German was as dominant in the USA as English .

They were dixie . \\n\\nPolitical union did not follow the cultural union . More like they both helped eachother grow . And for the EU there already is a political union . But I dont understand why there is a necessity to create a European culture and nationality . You will still be British I will be Bulgarian . We will just have a federal government .

In Bulgaria when someone tries to correct history everybody starts raging because \ '' something something preserve our culture\ '' . Culture is culture , there is no need to divide ourselves just because there are some differences . As I said before issues only arise when you let people from 3rd world countries live the way they lived in the Middle East because its \ '' their culture\ '' .

Its just that people assume that women belonging to men , for example is part of the Middle East\\ 's culture . Just because it is so predominant in their societies it does not mean it defines their ethnicity . We had sexism in Europe too and we removed it .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Lets start with what Nationalism is . \\n\\n & gt ; Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together . \\n\\nNationalism was a well known concept before the form we are familiar with became quite popular with countries in the 19th century . Just because the \ '' nation-state\ '' in today\\ 's status did not exist back then , it doesnt mean it didnt exist . \\n\\n & gt ; The story of history is largely one group of people oppressing a weaker group of people.\\n\\nWhat were those groups made up from ? It was Jews versus Egyptians , Mongols vs Tatars , Romans vs Etruscans . Those group were made up on the basis of nationalism . Exceptions would be the Teutonic order for example , which were not a common thing . \\n\\n & gt ; The main political and governing organization up until a couple hundred years ago was multiethnic empires.\\n\\nUhm , not really , not most of then at least . You could say Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic empire but then no Slavs were ever given power in it . For a long time the empire was just called the Austrian Empire until the resurgence of ( you guessed it ) Hungarian nationalism . But it was 1 group of people from one nationality , ruling over a conquered number of peoples . \\nOttoman empire was also similar , although they were more split between religions , rather than ethnicity , but lets not kid ourselves , back then 99.9 % of an ethnicity would have the same religion so you could say that the separation of the ruling elite and commoners ( and christians as a second class citizen ) was ethnic . Small exception for the Janissaries who were conscripted from Christian societies , converted to Islam to serve the empire.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; A big reason why history has been a continual violent struggle of groups . \\n\\nGroups largely based on nationality/ethnicity , yep . Reasonably then you can make the point that if people didnt feel some sort of symbolical belonging to one group because they were born and raised in roughly the same geographical location as you there wouldnt be as many wars . **But** and this is a big but , there are many many many other reasons that war occured through history , we are talking a plethora of complicated reasons based on human nature , government types , technological levels , nationalism , etc , etc . \\n\\n & gt ; Youre comment is probably the most historically ignorant comment I\\ 've ever seen \\n\\nOh the irony . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that nations generally had self determination throughout history is ludicrous and false . \\n\\nNow this is somewhat complicated . Without efficient forms of communication , even nationalities were split up . The people that led them ( kings , emperors , etc . ) were able to then seek their own desires without caring about what the people wanted . ( Nobody knew what \ '' the people\ '' wanted , not even them ) . In the 19th century , though , when Nationalism resurged , it was much easier to develop a sort of national unity and a common goal , which in most cases was to achieve a state with a singular nationality in it being the ruling elite and lower classes . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that any significant portion of wars happened because \ '' I don\\'t like those other people\ '' is so sophomoric.\\n\\nOF course , there were many other reasons , but most of them arising from governmental and administrative regions developing from ethnic boundaries . The 100 years war wasnt started just because they hated each other . But the lower classes had no other ambition to kill the other rather than because of hate towards the other ethnic group . If a French person found themselves in an English hamlet , would he survive the night ? \\n\\n & gt ; The Austrian Hungarian empire didn\\'t start a war because they didn\\'t like Slavs . What was the spark of that war ? A member of a oppressed nation and group that lacked self determination killed the leader of the nation that was oppressing them.\\n\\nUhm yes they did . You just proved *my* point . Due to the nationalism of the Black Hand and Gavrilo Princip the spark was lit and resulted in a war , that was caused by frictions created from nationalism . If there was no Nationalism back then , the Austria-Hungarian empire would not be oppressing Slavs just because they are different ethnicity from them , the Black Hand woudnt be formed out of nationalistic necessities in the form of uniting all south Slavs , Russia wouldnt have attacked Austria-Hungary because they needed to protect their Slavic brothers , etc . The cause of the war was Nationalistic frictions in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . \\n\\nBut I am not disagreeing that Nationalism was a useful tool in the past . It was . Its just that I believe that it is not necessary anymore in the modern world and in some regions it is even being harmful . Whether or not nationalism was a thingof the past is unrelated to my main post and I dont know why I let you distract me from it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Bro f that . Your flair reminded me of the awesome gyro I ate last summer in Halkidiki . It was like ... you know how a bad burger is like a shitty bun a piece of dry meat and some ketchup ? Well that gyro had all its ingredients melted into one piece of delicious goodness . I dont know where the bread ended and where the meat began . I still salivate thinking about it . I cant even remember exactly what was in it . Maybe some god sauce ? Is that a thing ? If it is that gyro had god sauce in every crevice not filled with that amalgamation of flavors and scents . I sat in my car next to a beach and cried while the god sauce flowed down my chin unto my chest while I was slowly and carefully enjoying that savory goodness . I could not comprehend it . My mouth was orgasming and I was contemplating the meaning of flavors and food and in that moment of sensory overload it ended . The gyro was gone . And I knew I would never experience such delight and awe in my life again . \\n\\nI ended up experiencing that every morning for the next week .

I do not think the EU would be spiteful in such a case . The UK and Spain , yes ( though I do not agree with them ) , but I think the EU will be inclined to do whats best for both sides . Like they are doing now with Brexit , pressuring the UK to finally invoke article 50 in order to end this period of uncertainty which is mainly hurting them . \\n\\nBut yeah , this was a nice debate , I can see me re-thinking some of the things I said , hope I managed to do the same for you .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I think that if the people want a referendum they should get one . But I just disagree that Catalonia needs to leave .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Well yeah , but wouldnt the Catalan parliament vote in favour fo independence in order to become an actual parliament and gain power ? I dont know enough about the Catalan parliament and could be wrong but I dont think it objectively shows what the people want .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Yeah you could say so . I think the fairest thing to do is let everybody choose for themselves what language they want to speak . That does not require Independence though .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"& gt ; Yes there is - there is even a lot of talks about Scotland remaining in the UK should they declare independence before Brexit\\n\\nIm guessing you meant remaining in the EU not the UK . But the situation is different here . In their referendum they were also told that they would not be allowed back into the EU immediately . Especially with the UK\\ 's veto . It was made clear that independence meant that all relations with the EU would need to be made from scratch because you cant deal with the new sovereign state with the agreements you have made with another one . Even in this case , though , Scotland wont be allowed to just re-enter the EU immediately after a Scottish Independence . It is just impossible . As I said you cant have the agreements and deals made with the UK to be binding for another country which Scotland would then be . \\n\\n & gt ; That is irrelevant - people want independence despite the fact that it may not create a better future . I surely remember what the early 90s were like in Estonia . \\n\\nHow is it irrelevant ? I think its the most important part . Only if the UK were educated enough on what they were voting they would have remained instead of voting for Brexit in order to stop Muslim immigration . Ah but did leaving the Soviets bring a better future ? Now Estonia is ways ahead of Russia . And you did have examples of how capitalism was better than socialism so you could definitely make a rational argument for leaving then . \\n\\n & gt ; If they want to , then why should there be a problem . If they don\\'t want to , then it\\ 's not our business to stop them.\\n\\nBut nobody is stopping them ! ( except maybe Spain ) There is a process that every country that wants to become a member needs to follow in order to gain membership . There are guidelines that need to be reached . Its the process that makes the EU possible that would slow Catalonia or any other nation from joining , not spite or bitterness . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is why not cooperating with their entry is why I consider it a childish reaction.\\n\\nThere would be cooperation , but how long would it take for them to land a deal ? How long will Spain be childish ? It is uncertain but only one thing is known , and it is that it wont be instantaneous\\n\\n & gt ; No - having come from a subjected nation - the problem was not only political repression , but the fact itself that it wasn\\'t \ '' our nation\ '' .\\n\\nWell that is your opinion . I personally , as long as my vote count towards the leadership and the local governance cant be bothered with the symbolism of calling that leader and governance ours . I dont see how that would make me sleep better . \\n\\n & gt ; Yet are outvoted in issues that matter to them internally . Reminds me of these Russians , who claim there should have been an all-empire/all-union referendum on whether or not Estonia should have become independendent or not.\\n\\nEvery village is outvoted as well as every person . Its the flaw of democracy , not everybody can be happy . As long as they have their local governance though , it is fair . \\n\\n & gt ; Have you considered Catalonia wants to be treated as an equal among European nations , not as a regional subject of Spain ? \\n\\nFor me its much more important to identify whether leaving or not would be better for them . What they vote is their business . I just think the question of \ '' should we\ '' needs to be raised in stead of silencing it with stuff like \ '' they have the right to be independent\ '' , everybody does , it does not mean its the right thing to do , though .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"The EU has stated that leaving Spain would mean they would leave the EU . Not to mention the high possibility of Spain being spiteful and vetoing their entry for a long time . 10 years , I think is a reasonable amount of time . The government has to be formed with the whole administration , new foreign relations with the EU , then the EU needs to make sure that Catalonia answers to all requirements for joining , etc . Its a long process . \\n \\n & gt ; To be an independent country , duh\\n\\nNot independent , different . They already are independent . Nobody is discriminating against them , nobody has enslaved them , they have all the rights , can vote in elections can be elected to represent the people . Its not more independence than the UK \ '' gaining independence\ '' from leaving the EU . Its populist crap.\\n\\n & gt ; Necessity & gt ; complexity\\n\\nWhat necessity ? \\n\\n & gt ; Plus , the same empty argument could be said about every change on the world map.\\n\\nNot really .

2ntle,europe,"The comment on the end of the article drives the right point home that was not covered by the author : \\n\\n & gt ; From my personal experience and studies ( currently writing my thesis in Balkan history ) , this almost makes it out that those Serbs in Vukovar are totally innocent bystanders in the war and the current issue surrounding Cyrillic script . Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997 , two years after the war officially ended . Whilst in Serb hands , the Latin Script was banned . Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas . These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places . These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes . Under international pressure , Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape , murder , torture , theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated . Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims . This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society , thus we have a culture of separation ( cafes , shops , schools etc ) . Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County . For example , at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there . So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not . There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"Some parts from article . \\n\\n & gt ; This is more difficult to do than it sounds because the media\u2019s narrative about Le Pen\u2019s rise has been hysterical . The next two weeks will feature more of the same : articles decrying the potential end of Western civilization , the rise of fascism , and the potential unleashing of the horrors of Europe\u2019s past across the Continent once more . Many who never much cared about France will spontaneously generate opinions about how the West\u2019s hopes now rest on Macron\u2019s shoulders . If Le Pen wins , it will be the French Devolution . If she loses , complacency will set in , and Macron the empty suit will take up residence at the Palais de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e . He will continue status quo policies that in five years will bring us right back to where we started \u2013 or perhaps worse.\\n\\n & gt ; The key questions no one is asking are : Why did Le Pen oversee the expulsion of her father from the National Front , and why has she worked so hard to exorcise the party\u2019s most radical positions ? Stated differently , does Le Pen control her constituents , or do her constituents control her ? The answer to this question is important because it is the difference between the National Front being a reanimation of the worst of 20th century European history and a 21st century political party attempting to respond to economic , political and security challenges while still operating within the framework of liberal democratic norms . If the masses control Le Pen , we\u2019re back in the 20th century . If Le Pen controls the masses , we\u2019re still in our own century.\\n\\n & gt ; The second issue for these voters is immigration , and by extension , radical Islam . Three days before the election , on April 20 , a shooting happened on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that was claimed by the Islamic State . Paris and Nice suffered horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by radical Islamists in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . Le Pen\u2019s platform addresses this in two ways . First , she wants to strengthen the rule of law . She plans to do this by hiring more police , building more jails , and shutting down mosques with ties to radical Islam . Second , she wants to crack down on illegal immigration . This means curbing asylum requests and introducing more stringent naturalization requirements . Le Pen also plans to limit legal migration to 10,000 people per year . One may disagree with Le Pen\u2019s approach , but not with the fact that a problem exists and previous French governments have failed to address it.\\n\\n & gt ; Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man says , \u201cMen are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d Article 3 says , \u201cThe principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation.\u201d This is a contradiction . Article 1 is universalist ; it does not say \u201cFrench men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d It says all individuals enjoy these unalienable rights . But on the same page , Article 3 becomes pragmatic , attempting to ensure these rights are protected . Without enforcement , rights are abstractions . The individual may have rights , but we do not live in a world of individuals . We live in a world of political communities . The French nation is Le Pen\u2019s political community , and her policy is to defend it . For her detractors , Le Pen\u2019s great crime is that she does not consider it France\u2019s responsibility to ensure the unalienable rights of all men . For her supporters , she is the defender of the unalienable rights of French men , and to ask France to do more is to ask the impossible.\\n\\n & gt ; There is a dark side to France , as there is a dark side to all countries . But Le Pen is not a slave of the masses . She is a political pragmatist who is holding back something far worse , and she knows what the \u201csomething far worse\u201d is because she tried to exorcise it from her own party last year . This election is important because of what it indicates about the future of Europe . That future hangs on the nation-state\u2019s ability to respond to the concerns of individuals . We have seen what happens when it can\u2019t , and the result was far more disruptive than a French nationalist becoming the newest president of the Fifth Republic .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; First , there is the growing number of economically underperforming Muslim youths in Europe . This is traditionally a pool from which extremist groups recruit , and Hegghammer writes that this population looks set to continue to grow dramatically thanks to immigration and higher birth rates . Entrenched economic disadvantages will likely stop many young Muslims from gaining the full benefits of modern European societies.\\n\\n & gt ; The second , more important trend is the growing number of \u201cjihadi entrepreneurs\u201d \u2014 returned foreign fighters and other activists \u2014 who could inspire and recruit a new generation of European extremists . Hegghammer conservatively estimates there are now at least 2,000 radical Islamists in Europe with foreign fighter experience , time in prison , or both . While some may turn away from jihadism in the future , a small proportion will not.\\n\\n & gt ; The third and fourth factors relate not just to Europe , but to the broader world . Hegghammer suggests that persistent conflicts in the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia look \u201cset to supply European jihadis with both rallying causes and training opportunities for the foreseeable future , as it has in the past.\u201d Many experts believe that the conflict in Syria may still have a long way to go and that groups like the Islamic State will be very hard to fully defeat . The group could be training and blooding potential European attackers for years to come.\\n\\n & gt ; Compounding this problem is the final factor : the Internet . The Internet has considerable benefits for extremist groups , Hegghammer suggests , serving as a tool for \u201cpropaganda distribution , recruitment , fundraising , reconnaissance , and operational coordination.\u201d The rise of encrypted communications and social media have made it harder for authorities to keep up .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; Poland\u2019s history can easily be summed up as a continuous struggle against invasions and divisions . The country\u2019s geopolitical significance stems from its location between Russia and Germany . We have written about the challenges that both Russia and Germany will face in 2017 ; these challenges also pose unique problems for Poland , which is economically and militarily vulnerable . Recent developments have also helped Poland lay the groundwork for its eventual emergence as a regional power , as stated in our 2040 forecast.\\n\\n & gt ; Considering Poland\u2019s relatively small economy , which gives it more room to maneuver , the decline in German exports could become an opportunity for Poland to maintain and increase its export competitiveness . Technology transfers have accompanied Western investment in the country , and with continued support for national research and innovation and its relatively well educated and cheap workforce , Poland could remain competitive on the global market . One major challenge Poland faces in the medium to long term is its demographic situation , which limits its potential because the country has the second fastest aging population in Europe . But the success of socio-economic policies that drive competitiveness is dependent on political stability.\\n\\n & gt ; With Western Europe disinclined to prioritize any potential Russian threats , Poland is slowly acting as a small regional leader by working with countries to establish and support common initiatives such as defense against Russia . Within the EU , Poland will continue to be the leading voice of Eastern Europe , distancing itself from the EU\u2019s Western European members . Warsaw has been the main challenger of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project proposed by Russia , effectively blocking it when the country\u2019s anti-monopoly agency stopped the formation of the project\u2019s consortium . Seeing that Belarus wanted to improve relations with the EU to access European markets , and considering Belarus\u2019 dependence on Russia\u2019s slowing economy , Warsaw has worked to improve ties with Minsk . Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in October and said a new chapter in Polish-Belarusian relations had been opened . The two countries have economic incentives to develop closer ties , and Poland will likely take advantage.\\n\\n & gt ; Trapped between Russia and Germany , Poland is aware of Russia\u2019s increasing assertiveness and NATO\u2019s challenges , including its members\u2019 differing security interests . In the short term , Poland will likely feel the impact of Germany\u2019s economic slowdown . Adaptation to the new reality of a declining Western Europe will not be easy or fast . The current administration will continue to seek the right balance between extending control over the economy and political institutions , and making sure its public approval ratings remain high . Considering the country\u2019s defense imperatives , Warsaw will keep building strong ties with the U.S. and develop its regional leadership posture by working with Eastern Europeans on different levels.\\n\\n & gt ; Poland usually only makes mainstream news in the West when it has conflict with the EU over specific policies or when massive government protests erupt . The much more subtle and important thing to be aware of is how Poland is beginning to behave like a small regional leader . Warsaw will see increased tensions with Western Europe , and Germany in particular , partly due to economic problems , but mostly because of diverging views on security priorities . Increased Russian assertiveness will force Poland to invest in and make the most of regional alliances .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Pula was the main port for the navy and Rijeka was a port of utmost importance to Hungary ( which is why we had some not so nice things like \\'Rije\u010dka krpica\\ ' ) .

Ballander,europe,"Whew , you threw together a lot of bull.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadzic worked together and at the same time on standardization of grammar and alphabet for Croatian/Serbian languages waaaaaay before Yugoslavia . In mid XIX century . Why do you think both languages have 30 letters , same grammar and why Croatian Latin and Serbian Latin scripts are identical and why both are phonetic languages etc ? \\n\\nThis I already addressed in my original post and clarified it in my second . I think I was pretty clear.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Also Croatian language had two-three purges , especially around WWI and WWI and recently in the \\'90s.\\n\\nCroatian had a few \ '' purges\ '' , but not like you think . They were never about targetting \ '' Serbisms\ '' ( are there really any ? ) , but loanwords in general . It\\ 's a lot like French puritanism . I\\ 'll give you the WWII one , their agenda was pretty obvious and I would not put past them that their goal was to \ '' remove Serb\ '' in every sense . However , WWI was a load of crap , since it never happened . Indeed , there was a lot of new words introduced in that period ( say 1850s-1910s ) , but it was , again , just to remove loanwords from Standard in general , primarily **Hungarian** and **German** since there were loads of them . No one had Serbia in mind , but some had Yugoslavia - which goes back to political tampering with languages due to agenda . Some words caught on , some didn\\'t ( as always ) .\\n90\\ 's was about reintroducing the words that fell out of use due to Yugoslavia ( people had to adhere to the Standard set by Novosadski dogovor which was mentioned here already , and abberations were definitely not tolerated , hence I called it forced instead of voluntarily ) . Some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in a sense two languages were more similar before WWII.\\n\\nYes , and after . WWII-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical Croatian language.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; For example did you ever heard of Miroslav Krleza ? \\n\\nOf course.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The greatest Croatian writer who ever lived ? \\n\\nWhile he is no doubt a great writer , that\\ 's debatable . There\\ 's a slew of great Croatian writers and I\\ 'm glad I can\\'t pick one so easily . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe sounds familiar ? \\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Heard about his book \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' from 1932 ? Yeah \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' , not \\'\\'Tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt\\'\\'\\n\\nWhat\\ 's the point ? You\\ 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . That\\ 's massive reaching and does you a disservice.\\nYou also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards Yugoslavian unity . \\nI doubt you ever read any of his works , but I did and there\\ 's nothing too different from today\\ 's Croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . \\n\\nJust check his \ '' Balade Petrice Kerempuha\ '' and see if you still want to claim Croatian and Serbian are the same.\\n\\nBut since you were so eager to bring Krle\u017ea up , I have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ \ '' Declaration about the name and position of Croatian literaly language\ '' ] ( https : //hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo % C5 % BEaju_hrvatskog_knji % C5 % BEevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ Novosadski sporazum ] ( https : //sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosadski_dogovor ) . So , he would very much disagree with you.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' hiljadu\ '' would be considered \ '' Serbism\ '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in Croatia\\n\\nNo , you wouldn\\'t . I\\ 've known people who freely used \ '' hiljadu\ '' when talking to teachers of Croatian language.\\nBesides , \ '' hiljadu\ '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from Greek language ) , not a \ '' Serbism\ '' . Really , are there any Serbisms ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by Croatian linguists , just to be as different from Serbian as possible.\\n\\nAgain incorrect . A lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . Google Bogoslav \u0160ulek , Adolfo Veber Tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Learn yer history bruh.\\n\\n\ '' Bruh\ '' , I know my history just fine . I don\\'t want to comment on your knowledge of Serbian ( I don\\'t really care ) , but your knowledge about Croatian history is frankly atrocious and it\\ 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a Croatian.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; We use both \ '' hleb\ '' and \ '' kruh\ '' , both \ '' vazduh\ '' and \ '' zrak\ '' , both \ '' sargarepa\ '' and \ '' mrkva\ '' etc . Bosnian and Serbian went for language richness , while Croatian went for language purity.\\n\\nVazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in Croatia . Not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into Standard . On the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in conclusion , no , Yugoslavia didn\\'t forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . \\n\\nIt\\ 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , I feel , based on your wishes . The idea of Yugoslavia **and** Yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . There\\ 's no denying it .

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; Well , I replied to a comment in regards to why Bosnia and Croatia are two different countries while Slavonia and Dalmacia aren\\'t.\\n\\nBecause of historical reasons . When you look at the maps of former empires , you\\ 'll notice that borders between Bosnia and Croatia were almost the same , they were borders of Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\\n\\n & gt ; So why religion ? Well , let\\ 's be honest.. A lot of seemingly insane views of other people have been caused by religion . So I guess I\\ 'm just trying to figure out if that\\ 's where it comes from down there . I mean , religion caused the killings of \ '' witches\ '' , gays , women ( doing anything wrong . ) , other religious groups etc . so \\n\\nReligion is not the point here . While religion had some part in formation of some nations ( primarily Serbs and Bosniaks/Muslims , to some extent Croatians ) , the problems were more of cultural/national/historical rather than religious . \\nCroatians were never very exclusive religion-wise , as you also had protestant , orthodox , etc . Croats . Heck , one of the orthodox was a famous writer during the national spring.\\n\\nFurthermore , even Croatian nazis considered Muslims to be Croats and they didn\\'t persecute them per se . For example , they turned one of the galleries in Zagreb in a [ mosque ] ( http : //media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/11-zagreb2-450.jpg ) . Those nazis also organised Croatian Orthodox Church.\\n\\nLooking at the religion as a source of all problems is a lazy and ignorant view , but the simplest of them - which is why so many people are prone to it.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I suppose it might explain some of the tensions down there if everyone was like 110 % serious about their religions and believed every word of their holy books.. \\n\\nWhat year is it ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; To me it simply doesn\\'t make sense to think that someone living 10 miles away ( Across a border ) is so different\\n\\nI left out the second part because it\\ 's a stereotypical nonsense.\\n\\nThe thing is because of cultural influence . Bosnia and Herzovina/Serbia were dominated by Ottomans and it shows , whereas the Croatians coast was always under the Italian influence . Northern Croatia ( Northwest particulary ) was under heavy Austrian influence . So , this is from where a lot of cultural ( and linguistical if you\\ 'd be looking into the dialects ) differences emerge.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest , a northern Croatian is more likely to get beat in southern Croatia than a Serbian or some other nationality . Just a few days ago there were some news of players getting beaten . So , all these rambles about Serbians/whateverelses fearing for their lives because they\\ 're so special is nonsense , since Croatians may get the very same treatment . Why ? Because assholes . You got plently of them as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why do Croatians care if someone\\ 's wearing a Serbian tourist t-shirt in Croatia for example ? \\n\\nThey rather don\\'t , they got other things on their mind to worry about rather than who\\ 's wearing what.\\n\\n & gt ; We don\\'t beat up people wearing German , English , Swedish or whatever football jerseys here for example..\\n\\nWe don\\'t do it either , other than hooligans , but they are more of an international problem ( see Dutch hooligans destroying Italian works of art , etc . ) and it\\ 's no worse than in other European countries . And these hooligans won\\'t beat just the foreigners , but anyone else who\\ 's not of their liking . Your viewpoint is very distorted .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; My view isn\\'t distorted . I don\\'t have a view.\\n\\nSome of the things you said sounded like straight out of polandball , you\\ 're gon na have to forgive me , but there\\ 's more than enough people forming their opinion of Croatia based on some scarce stereotypes and having to go through them is rather annoying , which is why I may have sounded hostile.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The year of people wanting Sharia law in Europe , the year of ISIS , the year of Boko Haram , the year of people hanging gay people , the year of people preventing stem cell research , the year of people banning gay marriage because God says it\\ 's \ '' Ew ! \ '' etc.\\n\\nNone of which ( aside from maybe banning gay marriage ) is happening \ '' down there\ '' .\\n\\n & gt ; So the recent topic about a tourist getting attacked because he worse a ( non-Serbian ) eagle on his shirt is nonsense ? Or the fact that the police said it was his own fault for wearing it.. ? \\n\\nCould you link me this ? There\\ 's a difference between incidents ( and their frequency ) and general feeling . For example , one could say a lot about Norway if we\\ 're gon na only look at Breivik , but that would be utter bullshit , don\\'t you agree ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm not just blaming Croatia though.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t under impression that you were blaming Croatia . I\\ 'm discussing my homecountry , not Serbia . There\\ 's a certain difference between Croatia and Serbia , as far as tolerance is considered , for example : gays ( not that it\\ 's perfect in Croatia ) . \\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's the part I\\ 'm trying to figure out where comes from . It does not exist everywhere at all . Not even fucking close.\\n\\nYou\\ 're denying there are hooligans ? You left that part out.\\nI\\ 'm going to mention \\n\\n & gt ; I can\\'t imagine how you can hate civilians of any country to such a degree which is why I\\ 'm trying to understand where the crazies get it from.\\n\\nI think history gave us bunch of examples like that.\\nWar can be a great excuse for a saddist/psychopath.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why is it such a big deal when a Serbian boy and a Croatian girl are kissing ? Oh , and why was the Croatian girl asked by an old woman how she dared walking next to a Serbian boy ? \\n\\nI guess you\\ 're thinking of [ this ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/19wsy5/when_an_old_lady_asked_croatian_girl_how_she/ ) .\\nFirst , please , take notice this isn\\'t Croatia you\\ 're talking about , but Bosnia , where it can be rather tense because you have 3 nations crammed into mini-Yugoslavia , and we know how both of Yugoslavias ended.\\n\\nSecond , it\\ 's just a picture , there are no news.\\n\\nThird , why is it upvoted ? Because of circlejerking . Most of foreigners think there\\ 's an unimaginable hatred between Croats and Serbs ( for example , Bob Dylan compared Croats and Serbs to Nazis and Jews , which is just horrible , especially since he\\ 's a public person ) .\\nWhen they see it , they\\ 're probably thinking it\\ 's a first , wow such progress , etc . and it makes for a nice clickbait.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm trying to figure out where the crazies are coming from.. Where that hatred comes from.\\nWhy are you focusing on crazies ? This hatred among them is a lot like you can find between many other countries and races . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why doesn\\'t anyone even care about my brother dating a Swedish girl ? \\n\\n\\nThere\\ 's plently of Serbian-Croatian couples that don\\'t make the news ( or they do if they\\ 're celebrities , which is kinda expected ) , you\\ 're just using a circlejerk picture as an evidence that such things are so rare and frowned-upon in Croatia ( while the picture wasn\\'t even taken in Croatia ) .\\nHeck , one of the first civil unions in Croatia was that between a Croatian and a Serbian , but I didn\\'t see that making waves . Why ? Because it\\ 's not that important.\\nWhich again brings me to ... \\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t have a view.\\n\\nC\\'mon , you have some view . You obviously formed some opinions of Croatia based on a picture from reddit and few news stories covering incidents because it gets them clicks .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; I\\ 'm not saying I expect everyone in Croatia ( Or in Split ) to do things like that , but clearly some people really have some issues when it comes to anything ( Perceived as ) Serbian , which is what I don\\'t understand . I simply can not fathom how anyone can see a Serbian ( Which it wasn\\'t , but let\\ 's pretend it was.. ) shirt as something provocative in any way . \\n\\nSplit is a bit rough around the edges , and like I said , you can be a Croatian from Zagreb in order to get a beating there , if you run into hooligans . \\nWhy can they perceive it as provocative ? Because they were probably drunk/drugged , which lowers their ability of rational thinking even lower.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Hooligans in the football sense ? No , they exist . But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don\\'t tend to see in most other countries . Of course there are football rivalries here and sometimes a bunch of F.C . Copenhagen fans will get into a fight with Br\u00f8ndby IF fans or whatever . \\nLook up videos of Danish fans from Poland-Ukraine Euro etc . if you want to see what our fans are usually like . They\\ 're drinking , singing , partying and making a fool of themselves . There\\ 's a reason they\\ 're called \\'Roligans\\ ' and not hooligans . \\'Rolig\\ ' means calm in Danish . Not calm in the \ '' We\\ 're quiet\ '' sense , but in the peaceful sense . \\n\\n\ '' My part of the world\ '' ... You\\ 're free to try any extremist thing you think you can get away with in Croatia , I assure you you won\\'t have a nice time.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; they\\ 'll get banned from the stadiums , fined , potentially jailed and \ '' everyone\ '' will distance themselves from it . The club , the fanclub , the \ '' FA\ '' etc . It\\ 's not an accepted thing at all . Even if both sides essentially agree to fight.\\n\\nYou think it\\ 's accepted in Croatia ? Wow , I wonder what kool-aid they feed you with in Denmark.\\nReading between the lines , your perception of Croatia was as it\\ 's a religous , wildwest-like warzone . Wtf ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don\\'t tend to see in most other countries.\\n\\nWe don\\'t ? \\nWhat about the Dutch trashing Italian works of art ? \\nBooks have been written about the UK.\\nThis is just generalizing and sweeping your problems under the rug . The grass is not greener than in Croatia.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's not just the picture though . It\\ 's news , it\\ 's travel warnings , horrific pictures of someone of one nationality who\\ 's been beatedn ( or worse ) by people of another nationality , it\\ 's traveler stories , it\\ 's comment sections on various sites \\n\\nI don\\'t know where you\\ 're getting all this stuff from . Especially since most of it can be forged/faked ( you\\ 'd be surprised how often I can come across mental gymnastics ) .\\nTourists who come here usually thoroughly enjoy it and crime rates are rather low , Croatia is a very safe country.\\nLay off the youtube and site comments , in general . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Well yeah , but that\\ 's not where I saw it.\\nhttp : //www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/croatian-girl-kisses-serb_n_2839945.html\\n\\nLol , wow , I must admit I thought a tiny bit higher of Huffington Post , but this is just tabloid material at absolute worst . They base their story around a picture and reddit user , without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources . It\\ 's basically like you saw it on reddit.\\n\\n\\nThis is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they\\ 're going to only go by the words of reddit users . \\nIn this case , nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners.\\n\\n\\nI find english articles about Croatia generally of poor quality , and often scarce and misleading.\\n\\nFor example , when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban , which was fairly covered , a lot of these sites were saying that 65 % of Croatians voted for banning of gay marriage.\\n\\nHowever , 65 % of those who went to vote voted for banning , and only 38 % of voter base went voting . But of course this gets no mention.\\nThis can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65 % of Croatians are against gays/gay marriages , while in reality the referendum wouldn\\'t even pass if it weren\\'t for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the EU referendum.\\n\\nI also remember reading an Economist article on Croatian elections , where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates ( which were used by common people in Croatia ) , which is just a huge low for a media.\\n\\nAlso , a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts.\\n\\nCroatia doesn\\'t get reported on often , and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it , I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; No , I may have some media created assumptions , but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there ? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region ? \\n\\nDrop the \\'region\\ ' and replace with \\'Croatia\\ ' and I\\ 'll agree , but otherwise no . I always hated this collectivism regarding ex-Yugoslavia , since it simply can not be under the same denominator . There\\ 's a reason it didn\\'t work , the differences are there . Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ? Unfortunately , it happens too many times.\\n\\n\\nSomething you may not be aware of , and that contributed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor . Slovenia and Croatia had to give substantial money to the underdeveloped parts of Yugoslavia ( the rest of it ) during the times of both Yugoslavias and this is what annoyed most people.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; While I find the crazies.. Well , crazy.. It doesn\\'t mean understanding where they\\ 're coming from can\\'t be interesting.\\n\\n\\nThey can be coming from their personal problems and frustrations.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Even if it\\ 's in Bosnia it doesn\\'t really change anything though\\n\\nIt does , since I don\\'t want to deal with stereotypes about Bosnia .

Blind_Fire,europe,"The Czech Republic consists of 3 historical regions . \\n\\nBohemia , the western region . Moravia , the south-eastern part . And lastly , the Czech part of Silesia . Silesia as a region spreads also to Poland and Germany.\\n\\nSo simply calling it Bohemia invokes the Czech word *\u010cechy* , which is the Czech name , again , for only the western half of the country.\\n\\nCzechia is the agreed equivalent of the Czech word *\u010cesko* . The suffix *-sko* is a common suffix for country names . For example , Russia , your country , is simply called *Rusko* , the root *Rus* + *-sko* . *\u010cesko* is often used as a name for the whole region , it was also used in the name of Czechoslovakia , *\u010ceskoslovensko*.\\n\\nMany , myself included , accept Czechia because it is simple and natives often use its equivalent , *\u010cesko* , in normal speech . Although , many , myself again included , find it weird-sounding and hesitate to use it themselves.\\n\\nCzechlands is sometimes also used , although , the term is incorrect and has no basis in the native language . Its equivalent , *Zem\u011b \u010cesk\u00e9* , is used when speaking of the historic regions , often meaning literally Bohemia+Moravia+Silesia . It is very close to the term *Zem\u011b Koruny \u010cesk\u00e9* , The Lands of the Czech Crown , which is mostly used in connection with the old Kingdom of Bohemia , former part of the HRE.\\n\\nSome people , mainly natives with low English proficiency , use phrases like : \ '' Here in Czech , we ... .\ '' . This is outright wrong and should not be used . Phonetically it is ok but gramatically it is only a shortcut for people to get their message through . Some English-speaking people might accept it but it probably sounds weird.\\n\\nThe Czech Republic , the full name , probably sounds too complicated or exhausting to use over and over again , however , the equivalent *\u010cesk\u00e1 republika* is often used even in the native tongue . It is something that is correct in 99 % of the situations you might bump into .

As it is promoted mostly to stakeholders ( associations , political parties , unions , ... ) than regular public , because it can be costly and you dont want people that attend demonstrations to come there and talk shit , which doesnt really benefit anyone . Also not all events there are fully public . We dont have anything scheduled for TTIP or CETA right now as the negotiations for TTIP are frozen because of Trumps administration ( just like all negotiations involving USA ) and CETA right now is in parliament ( ratification process ) , there was a conference last week about it so I dont think we will see another one as there was nothing new , everyone who wants to know annything about it already does know .

I understand the idea behind it ( less corruption space ) but damn , you are going to destroy them.\\n\\nLast week , someone wanted all employees of our ministry with phone numbers and email adress and office numbers , because we are state employees and should serve public ( and quoted some paragraphs ) . If you want a specific employee for some reason , fine .

Burlaczech,europe,"I love how someone writes a book and then someone writes few sentences to disagree . This is pretty much current world politics . You get people that know about something and care enough to elaborate , and you get unexperienced person who tweets and wins elections.\\n\\nI welcome your last sentence and agree , but nobody ( I am not ) disproves that barbarians won in Poitiers 732BC and civilization lost ( I forgot who wrote that quote ) . arabs lost , christians won . if you want me to sum , why EU & gt ; ME based on that book in the last cca 500 years , it is because of cognitive intolerancy = you didnt allow religion , mysticism , shamanism , horoscope , whatever to be at same level as rationalism and natural sciences ( which was untrue untill that and still is untrue in various parts of the world ) . Fortune telling is just not the same as weather forecast . Jesus walking on the water is simply not the same as Ship of the Line . \\n\\nsecond point was that EU focused on effectivity . in order to move forward , you wouldnt put more people on it ( china ) , more slaves ( ME ) but you make each person more effective ( tools - science ) . \\n\\nanother point was that because of nature - hills , forests , easy to defend smaller countries ( as opposed to russia , china , chaliphates , ... ) - & gt ; you can have competition and not one empire . if something goes wrong in venice ( people ban books , tell you to burn ships ) you can move to france/genoa/rome and keep doing what you want to - & gt ; civilisation moves forward . thats why reforms of religion happened , thats why culture , weath and science flourished . because we were not dependent on one persons goodwill ( like in china , when one emperor ordered to burn all ships - that couldnt happen in EU , since merchants would just move to another country/city state ) . \\n\\n",Balto-Slavic,Czech
Burlaczech,europe,"If you are going to judge liberalism by todays standards in different countries ... you actually cant , because it has different meaning everywhere . You can find right winged green party as well as hardcore communist green party . You can be left wing socialist or even almost right wing ( previous PM of France ) . \\n\\nLiberalism is indeed about freedom of individuals , but which translates into economic freedom with emphasis on entrepreneurship and taking care of yourself . Unless you want me to recommend you a whole book , you will have to accept this simple definition and of course , one sentence or paragraph can not describe whole ideology with all its factions . Libertarians are extremists with anarchic tendencies , its like saying right wing conservatives = nazis . \\n\\nAs Ive mentioned before , you can have liberals in social democracies , which brings them more to centrists , because it is right wing ideology . Politicians in developer democracies are not edgy teens , and usually come up with compromises that include many ideas from different corners of political spectrum . Our liberal-conservative party which ruled the country like 12y ago increased social welfare spending 3 times , the biggest increase in modern history of the country . Does that make them liberal-conservative-socialists ? \\n\\nLiberals in todays EU either want to destroy EU , or understand its social principles and \ '' work within the borders\ '' of the EU legislative - which includes for example grants ( which would be unacceptable for liberals before ) . \\n\\nI am not really sure what do you mean by protecting life . Everyone wants to protect life ( ? ) , liberals would say that you should tak\u00e9 care of it yourself , conservatives would say that the family/your master/police should do it and socialists would say that there should be no guns among the population and only police should have some minimum ( best would be some tasers ) - thats very common in the north and western Europe today , which seems really crazy to me . And also extreme left ( greens , communists ) would say that we should destroy all weapons and focus on higher goals , such as global peace , environment , ... \\n\\nWhat you described about two people example , It seems like typical anarchic-communism ( final stage of socialism ) . Typical liberal would say \ '' your freedom ends where my begins\ '' - & gt ; dont touch my food , unless I give you a permission . But this could be very individual , as for example having opinion about squatters can vary between liberals , anarchists , communists , socialists , conservatives , ... Its a very complicated topic . \\n\\nWhether the liberal should or should not share food in that situation is not really liberal to me . Its socialism-conservatism debate . Socialist would share , conservative would not . Typical liberal would stick to a conservative narrative , but in todays EU , I believe that a liberal would stick with a socialist in this case . For example in the migrant crisis , liberals mostly support helping those people . But again , it varies a lot on individual organisations/parties/people , nobody is a pure liberal , everyone is a mix.\\n\\nEven as a right-wing liberal ( who would have guessed ) I dont see a reason for fencing a forest , so even if it is a private property , in this case I dont see why people should be denied access there . But I would have different rules for small parks that should give me an option to keep it private for me and people I want in . Or to demand an entry fee . But If I owned a forest , I could have different experience and outcome of my thoughts could be different as well.\\n\\nSo overal - we cant really classify parties or people as members of one ideology , we cant even judge certain policies as such , because all of them are mostly a mixture of multiple ideologies . Which is great and it keeps governments towards the centrism , which to me , is ideal , because it satisfies the majority . It is very easy to see that countries , which are edging towards one side more than the other , are not doing that well and a lot of people are really unhappy there , for real reasons ( as opposed to \ '' made up\ '' unhappiness here ) .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

It doesnt matter what you believe in , you live in a simulacrum . What people in power believe in matters , not the rest . ( sadly ) One of the weak points of democracy is the connection between plebs and elites and how easily ( quite obvious since 2012 when putin got elected , quite a coincidence ) they can be manipulated into believing in nonsense and taking it seriously ( migration crisis , greece crisis , terrorist crisis , muslim crisis - just to name a few issues in EU that are suddenly soooo important that everyone has opinion on it , when in reality , they barely matter . They are problems that are being solved , but far from crisis - & gt ; just shows the simulacrum people live in . and you can see the results in mentioned polls ( and sadly elections ) .\\n\\nto keep it short - pirates are the worst after communists , when it comes to involvement with the government , or I think administration is the better meaning of the word , since it is wider . whether you trust me or not is your call , you can either get into the structure and learn how it works and why ... \\n\\nor you can stay outside , read some paper/listen to a speaker and then hate on X ( insert TTIP , CETA , CTHH , I dont even know what else ) on every conference we have , get shut down with facts , leave sad , get motivated again with nonsense and repeat .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Burlaczech,europe,"if you wan na get technical , liberation means changing the regime for the better via an outside influence . you can get liberated from nazis by soviets and life gets worse for most of the people in the country ( eastern europe in 40s ) . \\n\\nIt is mostly done for the better ( which is relative ) , mostly in the name of giving more liberty to the population ( getting rid of dictator and installing a democratic institutions ) , but it doesnt have to be . Castro liberated Cuba from the outside from the indirect influence of the USA while installing a dictatorship . Latin america is full of these \ '' liberations\ '' by another country , guerillas , dictators , foreign powers , ... pretty much all of them were liberations . In Europe , it is similar . \\n\\nIn Middle east , they see it differently . They dont see it as giving more freedom to its people ( even just as rhetoric like in christian world , while reality can be different ) , but as a \ '' driving the infidels away\ '' . Infidels can be people from different sect of islam , nonbelievers , foreign power , you name it . What holds them together is not will for freedom or nationalism or independence . They just want the illusion of their great masters , traditions and religion and these values are sacred for them .

Because nazism was something new in foreign affairs ( just like communist ideology ) so their motives could be very different from every other war before , or after that . \\n\\nIn Mein Kampf , Hitler said that Slavs belong behind Ural and he will send them there so they can be happy , while Europe belongs to the Aryan race .

Burlaczech,europe,"while I agree with the first part , when left-right was found in France , with left being the progressive reformists while the right were monarchist conservatives . But thats origins , thats not 20 or 21st century , so I am talking about whats relevant for us right now . Liberalism in its core is right-wing orientation ( you should work hard and get big reward ) just like conservatism , as opposed to socialism ( everyone works and should have the same reward ) . Very simplified version . In todays context , lot of workers welfare ( labour laws , unemployment pay , maternity leave , benefits , ... ) are left-wing policies that originate in socialism . A liberal would say \ '' its their probl\u00e9m , I have my own , unlock my shackles and let me tak\u00e9 care of myself\ '' . thats a right-wing way of thinking.\\n\\nWhat reflects reality better , is the 4 way compass with + being libertarian , - totalitarian , X left-wing ( economy ) , Y right-wing ( economy ) . It reflects the complexity way better than just X and Y . Because Stalin and Hitler were both on the other side of axis Y and X , while both being totalitarians and governed the state in a very similar way , as opposed to western style of democracy . \\n\\nthe welfare state , as we know it today , was really not invented by Marx , but by a Bismarc , who was a hardcore capitalist supporter . But you can not have socialism without capitalism ( you will run out of money and everyone will become poor over time - look at central europe ) and you can not have capitalism without socialism ( look at europe in 18-19th century or china today - people will be unhappy and create labour unions , demand more welfare or even leave the country ( or even vote for people like Bernie Sanders ) , if another one will have better working conditions . Modern state needs both systems . Which ratio between the two is perfect ? That really depends on each country . But this will bring us to another subreddit .",Balto-Slavic,Czech
Burlaczech,europe,"in that case yes . I believe we all have a lot in common and its only up to us whether we want to see it or not . Marxism only talks about wealth and how social class is dependent on it , which is not true today in Europe . You can be anything you want comming from anywhere you want , its only up to you and your abilities . So what could be more relevant in 19th century is not ( very ) relevant in 21st . Just like some people want to live by hundred years old book . \\n\\nI am not saying that everything Marx or any socialist said is wrong . I say that their system is wrong . But that doesnt mean we cant listen to it and learn from it . Learning from something doesnt mean \ '' ok Ive read it , its bad , put it away and never think about it again\ '' . No , learning means that if he has a point ( and they do ) , you should take what you want from it and improve yourself , evolve . Just like from a bad relationship , you always learn something new . \\n\\nIf you want an example of what could we learn from socialism is that for example we should care about poverty where religion fails . What should we take from Marxism is that you can think about the common things certain groups share , that you would not think about before . Its up to you what you do with the information , its just a basic level of education here .

In Ukraine people are struggling of getting money for food . Those protesters in Ukraine are the most ordinary people there can ever be with the best intentions . I\\ 'd suggest to watch the videos , but you won\\'t understand the language . These protesters are cleaning the streets after their protests , have organized their own order watchers that look for drunk people and are calming down provocateurs that try to ignite violence versus riot police . In UK protesters loot , that\\ 's it . This is the difference you can\\'t comprehend . In UK you have nothing meaningful to be not happy about . Your minor frustrations about privacy are not legitimate reasons to go to streets compared to Ukraine . This is democracy because these acts are representing the will of the majority . Another thing against your \ '' violent hooligans\ '' is that very big part of the protesters are old people , 50y and older , men and women .

936535898,europe,"I\\ 'll copy the description of Polish parties from rationalwiki.org : \\n\\n & gt ; Political parties\\n\\n & gt ; These parties have MPs after the October 2015 election : \\n\\n & gt ; Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( PiS , Law and Justice ) : The Cancer . Far right , nationalistic party with xenophobic tendencies that includes many outright paranoiacs and Catholic fanatics . It can be best describes as a personality cult of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski . Controls a large propaganda system ( websites , newspapers , magazines , a TV channel and now also the entirety of public media , which were quickly purged of anyone even remotely critical of PiS ) . Combines extreme social conservatism matching Catholic doctrine and leftist economic policy of the wishful thinking variety . At one point , all of its MPs voted for a total ban on abortion and its proposal for an in-vitro fertilization bill included jail sentences for doctors . The bad news is that , with a majority in parliament , they will rule for 8 years and send Poles further back in time than Marty McFly . The good thing is that no one will believe their excuses if they fuck up ( and they most certainly will ) . Already ruled between 2005 and 2007 ; the term was cut short by a massive scandal related to misuse of a newly created anti-corruption unit as political police . Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski is a de facto supreme ruler of Poland , since the president , the prime minister , and all Law and Justice MPs are completely obedient to his orders . At the same time , he did not assume any public office , leaving him completely unaccountable to the public.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Platforma Obywatelska ( PO , Civic Platform ) : The Boring Moderates . A centrist party with moderate positions , pro-European and promoting a non-adversarial foreign policy . Ruled between 2007 and 2015 , during which time Poland was the fastest growing economy in Europe . Now the largest party in opposition . Its downfall can be traced back to several key members leaving to take roles in European institutions ; long-time leader Donald Tusk received the post of the President of the European Council , and left the party to Ewa Kopacz , an uncharismatic speaker that is obviously incapable of inspiring voters . The party is still socially conservative , however , but less so than PiS.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Kukiz\\'15 : The Madhouse . Self styled as a \ '' citizen\\ 's movement\ '' rather than a political party , this group won almost 9 % of the vote despite not having any political program . The leader , Pawe\u0142 Kukiz , is a former rockman with explosive temper and very inconsistent views . Because the party is highly disorganized , their electoral lineup was a true curiosity gallery and featured a gangsta rapper , anti-vax activists and open neo-Nazis . Nine of his elected MPs signed a \ '' National Contract\ '' requiring them to uphold the \ '' cultural and ethnic integrity\ '' and support \ '' militarization of the Nation\ '' . [ 31 ] \\n\\n\\n & gt ; .Nowoczesna ( .N , .Modern ) : The Robber Barons . Neoliberal party formed by Ryszard Petru , a prominent economist . Supports tax breaks for business , flat tax , privatization and abolishing the government subsidy for political parties . Also supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\n & gt ; Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe ( PSL , Polish People\\ 's Party ) : Power Thirsty Farmers . An agrarian party that represents Poland\\ 's small farmers . Unfortunately , it often does so to the detriment of large farmers , which produce a far larger share of the crops . They have a reputation for rampant nepotism and a lack of standards - they\\ 'll enter a coalition with pretty much anyone . Barely passed the electoral threshold in 2015 , to the dismay of practically everyone except PSL members . Remains much stronger in local elections . \\n\\n & gt ; Koalicja Odnowy Rzeczypospolitej Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Nadzieja ( KORWiN , Coalition for the Restoration of the Republic \u2013 Freedom and Hope ) : Crazy Fogey\\ 's One Man Show . Headed by Janusz Korwin-Mikke , who is very much like Poland\\ 's Ron Paul , including fanatical online supporters known as korwini\u015bci ( Korwinists ) or kuce ( ponies - yes , ponies ) and associations with fascists . Policy-wise , he is a radical conservative libertarian . The party is so much a one man show that it says so even in the name . Janusz can\\'t even describe his grocery shopping without mentioning Hitler ( he says \ '' Hitler\ '' more often than an average Pole says \ '' kurwa\ '' ) , rape , paedophilia , insulting the interviewer or doing something similarly controversial . He has a passionate hatred of communists and \\'leftists\\ ' , blaming \\'socialist ideology\\ ' for every crime ever committed . This includes the Holocaust , since he considers Hitler a socialist ( though at the same time he claims Hitler didn\\'t know about the Holocaust and that Poles had it better under Nazi German occupation than now ) . He is a fan of Ayn Rand , having called her \ '' the greatest American political writer\ '' . We could go on , but the guy is so crazy he merits a separate article.\\n\\n & gt ; Razem ( Together ) : A New Hope . Social democratic party in the style of Western Europe . Managed to win 3.9 % of the vote despite being formed just a few months before the election and having no wealthy sponsors ( unlike .Modern , which was formed in a similar time frame but was bankrolled by prominent businessmen ) . Its flagship postulates are the strengthening of labor law protections , support for a deeply progressive income tax with a top bracket of 75 % , government investment in housing for rent ( equivalent to council houses in the UK ) and social equality . Formally leaderless . Its support received a large last minute boost after its member decisively won a debate that included the representatives of all eight nationwide electoral committees . The mainstream accuses it of radicalism and driving the support for the SLD-TR-Greens coalition below the parliamentary threshold .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Oops.\\n\\nhttp : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Bible # Slavery_in_the_New_Testament\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe New Testament makes no condemnation of slavery and does no more than admonish slaves to be obedient and their masters not to be unfair . Paul , or whoever wrote the epistles , at no time suggested there was anything wrong with slavery . One could speculate that this might have been because he wanted to avoid upsetting the many slave owners in the early Christian congregations or to keep on good political terms with the Roman government . Or , more probably , he simply thought slavery was an acceptable fact of life as did practically everyone else at the time.\\n\\nEphesians 6:5-8 ( NASB ) : 5Slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to Christ ; 6not by way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . 7With good will render service , as to the Lord , and not to men , 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free.\\n\\nChristian slaves were told to obey their masters \ '' for the sake of the cause\ '' and be especially obedient to Christian masters : \\n\\n1 Timothy 6:1-2 ( NASB ) : 1All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against . 2Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but must serve them all the more , because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . Teach and preach these principles.\\n\\nThere are instructions for Christian slave owners to treat their slaves well.\\n\\nEphesians 6:9 ( NASB ) : 9And masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with Him.\\n\\nColossians 4:1 ( NASB ) 1Masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a Master in heaven . [ 6 ] \\n\\nOne passage often cited by apologists as supposed evidence for New Testament condemnation of slavery is 1 Timothy 1:10 . However , as the King James version accurately translates , this condemnation is of \ '' men stealers\ '' ( Greek : andrapodistais ) , [ 7 ] i.e . slave raiders who kidnapped and sold people as slaves , not slave traders or slave holders in general . So Paul only singled out slave raiders to be considered \ '' lawless and rebellious , \ '' and to be categorized with murderers , homosexuals , liars and oath breakers.\\n\\nThe rather bland admonishment to slave masters by Paul is more than balanced by the demands for absolute obedience made of slaves . It is also rather telling that the masters are likened to God and Jesus , while the masters are simply told that they have a higher lord . So much for Jesus as the embodiment of the underdog - Paul could have pointed to Jesus\\ ' imprisonment and death as a cautionary tale to slave masters that even humble ( d ) characters can be important . [ 8 ] \\n\\nBefore the apologist plays the \ '' but Jesus didn\\'t condone slavery\ '' -card , following all these Pauline examples , try reading Matthew 18:25 , where Jesus uses slaves in a parable and has no qualms about recommending that not only a slave but also his wife and family be sold , while in other parables Jesus recommends that disobedient slaves should be beaten ( Luke 12:47 ) or even killed ( Matthew 24:51 ) .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

AThousandD,europe,"Truth be told , in the past years I\\ 've been observing something genuinely puzzling to me here in Poland - a negative sentiment towards the elderly . \\n\\nThere\\ 's been a resentment towards older people for many years now , based on the association of old people with [ Radio Maryja ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Maryja ) , and PiS and their ( not infrequently dramatically ) conservative stances . During the 2007 pre-term elections called for due to the collapse of the PiS-LPR-Samoobrona coalition , there was this prank call to \ '' take away your grandma\\ 's ID\ '' [ \ '' zabierz babci dow\u00f3d\ '' ; thus making her ineligible to vote , due to being unable to prove her identity ] , a prank that became a - I dare say - popular call .

On the other hand , I still do see people give up their seats to elders , so there\\ 's that as well.\\n\\nIt\\ 's a far cry from outright euthanasia Soylent-Green-style , but I agree that the way our current economic model is set up it unnecessarily pits the young vs the old and I feel all they\\ 're doing is taking cue from the system .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

3dom,europe,"Here is how I see this situation , wall of text incoming : \\n\\nIt seems like Putin know what he is doing and act within his usual agenda ( to restore USSR ) - but apparently there is no hope to restore USSR already ( country is stagnating and state may start to fall apart during next financial crisis ) and Putin is simply trapped : most likely he accumulated billions ( unknown seller has sold US treasuries for $ 70B in February ) in illegally \ '' earned\ '' assets which were unexpectedly returned into the country due to risk of losing them to EU/US sanctions . He is extremely high value target right now - for his own environment in the first place . If situation will start to develop into wrong direction he will be dead and his billions will be shared . The only way for him to stay alive without losing money is to create dictatorship with military discipline while maintaining popularity among lower ranks of bureaucrats ( for protection from high-ranking bureaucrats ) . In the process he has to act \ '' brave\ '' - i.e . achieve all goals population expect from him - despite them being absolutely destructive for the country and the state itself . So as a result we see Mr. Putin is turning the country into bigger and much more dangerous version of North Korea ( North Korea at least has an ideology and can be controlled by China - unlike Russian Federation ) and sending troops into Ukraine openly ( loss of Ukraine may result in massive wave o separatism within RuFed and in Putin\\ 's funerals ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Either RuFed will remove Putin and its government from control ( and army from Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia ) or there is serious possibility for the \ '' empire\ '' to go belly up in couple years . \\n\\nI bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries , in fact [ there are already ready-to-use customs post structures *inside* RuFed ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gacjJL4WVsU ) + regions of RuFed already act as separate states , they have less integration than countries in EU and that is why Kremlin was so hysterical about Ukraine and Georgia signing association agreement with EU - because it\\ 's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within RuFed . Another example : when a citizen move between regions of RuFed she/he need passport and *visa on arrival* ( a.k.a . \ '' registracia\ '' ) which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like \ '' localized/temporary citizenship\ '' ( if you don\\'t own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have *registracia* indefinitely without consent of other tenants ) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire \ '' localized citizenship\ '' or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - I heard about case where 40,000 ( ! ) people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in Sochi ( by FSB itself , mind you ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

A_Nest_Of_Nope,europe,"As expected the argument of oil prices always comes up . Yeah tell that to the people that lived when Yeltsin was the president and when he sold the entire country to 20 people.\\n\\nAs for the reforms , what happened with **Yeltsin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia had undergone a radical transformation , moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally integrated market economy . Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected \ '' oligarchs\ '' , which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.\\n\\n & gt ; Yeltsin\\ 's program of radical , market-oriented reform came to be known as a \ '' shock therapy\ '' . It was based on the recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists , including Larry Summers . The result was disastrous , with real GDP falling by more than 40 % by 1999 , hyperinflation which wiped out personal savings , crime and destitution spreading rapidly.\\n\\n & gt ; The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and subsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth . For example , the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often become the owner of the same enterprise . Under the government\\ 's cover , outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group of individuals at key positions of business and government . Many of them promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad producing an enormous capital flight.\\n\\n & gt ; Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and a dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; In the 1990s Russia was \ '' the largest borrower\ '' from the International Monetary Fund with loans totaling $ 20 billion . The IMF was the subject of criticism for lending so much as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the money and a large part of these funds could have been \ '' diverted from their intended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country illegally\ '' .\\n\\nWhat happened with **Putin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed . Much of the reason for the recovery was devaluation of the ruble , which made domestic producers more competitive nationally and internationally.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2002 , there was a significant amount of pro-growth economic reforms including a comprehensive tax reform , which introduced a flat income tax of 13 % ; and a broad effort at deregulation which improved the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2008 , Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity prices . GDP grew on average 7 % per year.Disposable incomes more than doubled and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold.The volume of consumer credit between 2000\u20132006 increased 45 times , fuelling a boom in private consumption.The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2008.\\n\\n & gt ; Inflation remained a problem however , as the central bank aggressively expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble . Nevertheless , in 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved \ '' unprecedented macroeconomic stability\ '' .Until October 2007 , Russia maintained impressive fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000.\\n\\nPutin absolutely did nothing , it\\ 's all because oil !

Sometimes the sin is forgotten , eroded from your life , drowned in the eventfulness of the days ; but suddenly , perhaps in the middle of a beautiful enjoyable day , perhaps at night , it comes back upon you , to weigh down your soul , to pain and burn your conscience as though you have just committed it . Almost every other sin or bitter memory may be washed away with atonement and good thought , except this sin of injustice against someone whom you love . It becomes a black spot in your heart and there it remains.\\n\\nA man may perhaps try to lie to his soul.\u2014\ '' It wasn\\'t so bad as that . Your restlessness has created a black night out of mere shadows . It was but a trifle , an every-day occurrence.\ '' \u2014Such words are lies , and the man knows it .

Dominic and his counterparts agreed to invite Bulgaria and Albania to join their efforts to register migrants , as the two countries could become part of a new route for migrants coming from Greece on their way to Western Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; Austria said on Wednesday it would limit the number of migrants it lets in to 3,200 a day from Friday , turning an annual cap on asylum claims into a daily entry quota .

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"it would honestly be called \ '' huge American car\ '' but what it would legally be considered as depends on it\\ 's weight ( 3.5 tons , over or under ) , and of course it\\ 's classification in the registration papers.\\n\\nit would most probably fall under \ '' terenec\ '' which translates to \ '' SUV\ '' but usually means large off road vehicles ( think 4runner ) .\\n\\ntypical car engine displacement is , 1.2L ( subcompact ) , 1.4 ( econobox ) , 1.6L , 1.8L and 2.0L ( all sorts of vehicles , 1.8 , 1.9 and 2.0 usually being turbodiesels ) , with 2.0 and 2.2 turbodiesels being used in larger cars . older cars also have 3.0 engines when straight 6es were used in normal BMWs.\\n\\nOf course there are larger displacements of all sorts , but those are reserved for luxury vehicles ( mercs ) or sporty cars with egines with more than 4 cylinders . as far as the \ '' typical car\ '' is concerned , it\\ 's a 1.6L 4 cylinder hatch .

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"i mean , they only have the signifiers if you mean it that way . You can totally use black/white/yellow/red/whatever as a description . When you want to describe a black person , can\\'t you use the term \ '' black\ '' ? You can omit that information obviously , but what if it\\ 's somehow significant that they were black ? It\\ 's stupid to think that there are no races and that races shouldn\\'t be acknowledged , even in description . \\n\\nThat\\ 's exactly what mulato is to me . It is a word that describes a person with mixed race parents , so I don\\'t have to say \ '' person with mixed race parents\ '' if I want to say it for whatever reason . If I\\ 'm making a racist remark or whatever and it\\ 's obvious from the context , yeah it\\ 's offensive . But if I just use it as a descriptive term , it shouldn\\'t have any connotations , unlike for example \ '' nigger\ '' which is definitely a slur and has little other meaning .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
ExplosiveMachine,europe,"oh that\\ 's totally right . I\\ 'm talking about what gets upvoted . Go to a thread about some crime a refugee did and /u/kasingabimga\\ 's comment would be at -22 and top voted comment would be about how it\\ 's \ '' not worth trying to argue with the far left , every immigrant who comes here obviously contributes great academical knowledge and makes it their sole purpose in life to spread peace and prosperity\ '' or something like that .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"we don\\'t have your high school , but we do have the gymnasium ( not to be confused with the German one ) that teaches general knowledge at a higher level than \ '' trade schools\ '' of sorts which still teach general knowledge but also have classes directed at various trades . Gymnasium lasts for 4 years and trade schools from 3 to 4 , usually from when you\\ 're 14 to 18 ( if you are born before June ) .\\n\\n1 . we grade 1-5 with 5 being best and 1 meaning failure , IIRC 0 - 49 % = 1 , \\n50-62 % = 2 , \\n63-75 % = 3 , \\n76-89 % = 4 , \\n90-100 % = 5 and it varies between schools and teachers a bit anyway.. grades are given for tests and oral examination and then averaged into semester grades which then average into the overall grade for the year of the subject . At the end of gymnasium is the all-encompassing Matura exam that is separate and independent from the grades of all 4 years.\\n\\n2 . In average you\\ 'd have 6 or 7 class hours in a day , one class hour being 45 minutes . That doesn\\'t equal 6 to 7 subjects in a day since some took up two class hours at a time . There are many subjects ( classes ? ) . You don\\'t take all subjects in all years , or even all semesters . *DISCLAIMER : from here on only counts for the school I attended . * From my days in gymnasium , 1st year I remember : Maths , Slovene , English , German ( some classes had French or Spanish or Italian , depends on what you picked when you enrolled ) , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Music , Geography , Physical Education , Computer Science , History . But Music and CS would stop after year 1 , in 2nd year you\\ 'd get Sociology ( only 2nd year ) , and in 3rd year you\\ 'd get Psychology ( only 3rd year ) and in 4th Philosophy . You also have obligatory \ '' additional classes\ '' that you have to pick out , and \\n\\n3 . those were usually the extra levels you talk about , so you could take Advanced Maths as the extra class , or you\\ 'd take Psychology again ( with different curriculum of course ) and you\\ 'd pick one for one semester and one for the other . The extra classes are also necessary when you pick two of the subjects for the extra exams in the final Matura exam ( consisting of 5 subjects , Math , Slovene , foreign language ( English , German , French , etc ) and two mandatory extras you pick ) , so if you pick Chemistry and Biology the two of four extra classes in your 4th year are those two and the two extra \ '' higher level\ '' classes . Here i\\ 'd like to distinguish \ '' class\ '' and \ '' subject\ '' more because there are many classes in one school year , as in , groups of students , usually up to 30 and labeled with letters ( so 3.B would be B class of 3rd year ) and all classes are taught the same subjects separately , so you don\\'t really mix students from classes in the ordinary subjects , **except** in the extra *classes* because there students ARE mixed since there are many more to choose from so groups get diluted . As I understand in the US you don\\'t really have \ '' classes\ '' like we do , you are taught every subject in a different group ( being the class ) depending on what you pick . Terminology differences fail me a bit here.\\n\\n4 . integrated systems come and go . We have Math as one subject but Algebra , Geometry and Calculus are all covered separately within it . Physics , Chemistry , Biology , CS and Geography are split.\\n\\n5 . Anything can be arranged if students are interested , but those \ '' exterior classes\ '' won\\'t count towards your final year grade . I remember taking Russian for two years , since enough were interested the school organised a class for our year.\\n\\n6 . lol there definitely was homework . \\n\\n",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"yeah but the US is a federal republic . There are 50 states , sure , but US as a whole is one country governed by one government .
