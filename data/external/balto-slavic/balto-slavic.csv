20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Maybe I went overboard a bit . Possibly fueled by decades of being unable to speak with anybody on this matter in a rational manner . I think there is a big identity crisis in Bulgaria . We dont know if we are Slavic or Turkic ( proto-Bulgarians were , 500 years of Ottoman rule and as you said a lot of resettlement ) or Thracian , etc . because the truth is we are all of them . So no we have very little in common with the Proto-Bulgarians . At this point the only thing that is left is the name . Then I remember studying in school that the major population make-up of the Balkans when the Bulgars arrived were Slavic , this is incorrect . They were definitely present but there was another bigger group which were one of the oldest European population , which have stayed in South-East Europe for thousands of years . We see most of those people in countries like Croatia , Serbia and Bulgaria . If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million natives . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I am Bulgarian . Why am I Bulgarian ? 1300+ years ago some 30 000 steppe people showed up in the general area where Bulgaria is situated now . They were the Bulgars . What they found was a bunch of unorganised Slavs and Thracian descendants numbering about 2 million people . Quickly they incorporated them within the new Bulgarian state with the Bulgars forming the ruling and military elite . Wars ensued and little by little the proto-Bulgarians either mixed in with the native inhabitants or died off in these wars . I am very inclined to believe that all Bulgars had died off ( As they were semi-nomadic warriors they comprised the biggest chunk of the army , they did not deal with other things , so when an army was destroyed a massive chunk of the Bulgar population was destroyed as well ) or mixed with the local populace beyond recognition by the time the Byzantines conquered Bulgaria some 300 years after its creation . \\n\\nSo here I am . Its 2016 some 1000 years after I believe the Bulgars in this region were no longer an ethnicity . But still our country is called Bulgaria , I call myself Bulgarian but after what ? Some word that used to mean something 1000 years ago . Why do I not call myself Byzantine ? Or Turkish ? The Ottomans formed the longest lasting government that ruled these lands . I only care about my culture and traditions because they were inherited to me the same way another culture and traditions could have been inherited to me . \\n\\nSo I realised , nationality , religion , culture and traditions . All these things are random . They should **not** be the basis of my character . They should not define me , they should not define my inspirations about the future or my interpretation of history . I realised nationality is something , used in the past to drive the masses to do what the Kings and Dictators told them to . History was changed , culture and traditions adapted , so your kid would grow up and thoughtlessly drive himself towards the trench of the enemy for this made up symbolism and made up norms . \\n\\nHow silly it is , that we divide ourselves into nation-states because 300-800-1300 years ago someone thrust a sword in the ground and said that ethnicity and culture and traditions would not grow from now on at this particular place . \\n\\nWhen it comes to having a government , I dont care if its made up by only Bulgarians . What I care is that it has the same basic principles as I do , which are equality , human and civil rights and that everybody has the liberty to pursue happiness . The same way religion was separated from the state , so should nationality .

So we cant just suddenly stop \ '' evolving\ '' because most people like the traditional ways . This is humanity . Always improve , become better to enhance your life . \\n\\nThe nation should not promote nationalism and patriotism and it is actually pitiful that our state does so aggressively , as if they are afraid our established culture and traditions are going to shift . But that is what culture is . It changes , it adapts and it grows . We are so judgemental of the Muslims in the Middle-East for standing behind their societary and cultural beliefs even though they are sexist and sometimes barbaric , but when someone tells us to re-evaluate our societary boundaries we go super defensive because \ '' dont you insult our culture\ '' and \ '' We are proud to defend the values our ancestors fought for\ '' .

Trading going North mostly ends with Romania , there is some trade with Russia and Poland but 99 % of the Russian trade goes through the Black Sea and through , you guessed it Trakia . Varna and Burgas are very important for trade , not only for tourism , so the Trakia highway is very much necessary , I assume I do not have to explain why port cities are very important to trade . Plus the Turkey Highway ( Maritsa was it ? ) connects to Trakia at about 2/3 of its length , and you even didnt dispute the importance of that trade route .

Again I do not think the government has been perfect but I think they have done very well considering what the pre-EU governments did which is close to nothing.\\n \\nI believe the Veliko Turnovo-Ruse highway will be paid for by the end of the year . \\nAh so typical , complaining there is no funding to build highways and complain when the government increased the price for the *ridiculously* cheap vignette .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I also feel like a lot of people in the EU and especially reddit are getting confused between the TPP and TTIP . I know I was . At some point there was so much negative info on the TPP that when I heard about the TTIP I thought it was a deal that stemmed from the TPP . Are people just jumping on the \ '' fuck the TTIP\ '' bandwagon without thinking ? \\n\\nI mean we definitely should be sceptical but we ought to give it a good reasonable thought before simply discarding the deal .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I was actually defending the Bulgarian Muslims .

Maybe its less lying and more him saying dumb things and then taking them back but he has one of the worst truth-o-meter ratings in politics . \\n\\n & gt ; This is why I find these remarks that he isnt serious .Because the criticism he faces amounts to little more than disdain for how he expresses himself\\n\\nAt this point nobody is not taking him seriously .

He says BS suddenly when we call him out on it we are obstructing democracy . \\n\\n & gt ; Also banning people from entering until we can review our policy is a good idea . Your only objection can be moralistic . And it would be silly because prior to 1964 America didnt allow lots of people to immigrate . Muslims were essentially on that list\\n\\nIt is not . I do not see any issues with the current system . Also a reasonable person says \ '' we need to make sure our immigration system is working fine\ '' a xenophobe says \ '' ban all Muslims\ '' .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Well the stats in Wikipedia are a bit different but yeah Bulgaria was doing well compared to the other Eastern Bloc countries .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Nobody said countries should be forced into a federal government .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I hate the idea of a nation-state and would hate to live in a ethno-segregated world . What is Bulgaria anyway ? Because 1500 years ago 30 000 Bulgarians settled and mixed in with 2 million Slavs and other ethnicities and formed the military and ruling elite of the country everybody in it will be Bulgarian forever ? Who cares what the country is called , by now it is just a relic of some name that used to mean something a thousand years ago . What matters to me is that we secure a good and equal future . I do not mind if they wrote the signs in Turkish in the Turk predominant regions . They have as much right to live in Bulgaria as we do and as human beings they have the right to be treated equally and fairly . If they become a major nationality then fuck it lets rename the country , but it is unreasonable to do it now when they are only around 12 % . Treating them as equal citizens does not mean we need to go to the other extreme and become half Turks or something.\\n I have never fought for a segregated nation-state not that you have fought for anything either . But if we go with \ '' we\ '' and \ '' them\ '' they fought for this land too and Ottoman Bulgaria is the longest governmental state that has existed in these lands .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"That is incorrect . As I said in another comment less than 100 years ago German was as dominant in the USA as English .

They were dixie . \\n\\nPolitical union did not follow the cultural union . More like they both helped eachother grow . And for the EU there already is a political union . But I dont understand why there is a necessity to create a European culture and nationality . You will still be British I will be Bulgarian . We will just have a federal government .

In Bulgaria when someone tries to correct history everybody starts raging because \ '' something something preserve our culture\ '' . Culture is culture , there is no need to divide ourselves just because there are some differences . As I said before issues only arise when you let people from 3rd world countries live the way they lived in the Middle East because its \ '' their culture\ '' .

Its just that people assume that women belonging to men , for example is part of the Middle East\\ 's culture . Just because it is so predominant in their societies it does not mean it defines their ethnicity . We had sexism in Europe too and we removed it .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Lets start with what Nationalism is . \\n\\n & gt ; Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together . \\n\\nNationalism was a well known concept before the form we are familiar with became quite popular with countries in the 19th century . Just because the \ '' nation-state\ '' in today\\ 's status did not exist back then , it doesnt mean it didnt exist . \\n\\n & gt ; The story of history is largely one group of people oppressing a weaker group of people.\\n\\nWhat were those groups made up from ? It was Jews versus Egyptians , Mongols vs Tatars , Romans vs Etruscans . Those group were made up on the basis of nationalism . Exceptions would be the Teutonic order for example , which were not a common thing . \\n\\n & gt ; The main political and governing organization up until a couple hundred years ago was multiethnic empires.\\n\\nUhm , not really , not most of then at least . You could say Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic empire but then no Slavs were ever given power in it . For a long time the empire was just called the Austrian Empire until the resurgence of ( you guessed it ) Hungarian nationalism . But it was 1 group of people from one nationality , ruling over a conquered number of peoples . \\nOttoman empire was also similar , although they were more split between religions , rather than ethnicity , but lets not kid ourselves , back then 99.9 % of an ethnicity would have the same religion so you could say that the separation of the ruling elite and commoners ( and christians as a second class citizen ) was ethnic . Small exception for the Janissaries who were conscripted from Christian societies , converted to Islam to serve the empire.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; A big reason why history has been a continual violent struggle of groups . \\n\\nGroups largely based on nationality/ethnicity , yep . Reasonably then you can make the point that if people didnt feel some sort of symbolical belonging to one group because they were born and raised in roughly the same geographical location as you there wouldnt be as many wars . **But** and this is a big but , there are many many many other reasons that war occured through history , we are talking a plethora of complicated reasons based on human nature , government types , technological levels , nationalism , etc , etc . \\n\\n & gt ; Youre comment is probably the most historically ignorant comment I\\ 've ever seen \\n\\nOh the irony . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that nations generally had self determination throughout history is ludicrous and false . \\n\\nNow this is somewhat complicated . Without efficient forms of communication , even nationalities were split up . The people that led them ( kings , emperors , etc . ) were able to then seek their own desires without caring about what the people wanted . ( Nobody knew what \ '' the people\ '' wanted , not even them ) . In the 19th century , though , when Nationalism resurged , it was much easier to develop a sort of national unity and a common goal , which in most cases was to achieve a state with a singular nationality in it being the ruling elite and lower classes . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that any significant portion of wars happened because \ '' I don\\'t like those other people\ '' is so sophomoric.\\n\\nOF course , there were many other reasons , but most of them arising from governmental and administrative regions developing from ethnic boundaries . The 100 years war wasnt started just because they hated each other . But the lower classes had no other ambition to kill the other rather than because of hate towards the other ethnic group . If a French person found themselves in an English hamlet , would he survive the night ? \\n\\n & gt ; The Austrian Hungarian empire didn\\'t start a war because they didn\\'t like Slavs . What was the spark of that war ? A member of a oppressed nation and group that lacked self determination killed the leader of the nation that was oppressing them.\\n\\nUhm yes they did . You just proved *my* point . Due to the nationalism of the Black Hand and Gavrilo Princip the spark was lit and resulted in a war , that was caused by frictions created from nationalism . If there was no Nationalism back then , the Austria-Hungarian empire would not be oppressing Slavs just because they are different ethnicity from them , the Black Hand woudnt be formed out of nationalistic necessities in the form of uniting all south Slavs , Russia wouldnt have attacked Austria-Hungary because they needed to protect their Slavic brothers , etc . The cause of the war was Nationalistic frictions in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . \\n\\nBut I am not disagreeing that Nationalism was a useful tool in the past . It was . Its just that I believe that it is not necessary anymore in the modern world and in some regions it is even being harmful . Whether or not nationalism was a thingof the past is unrelated to my main post and I dont know why I let you distract me from it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Bro f that . Your flair reminded me of the awesome gyro I ate last summer in Halkidiki . It was like ... you know how a bad burger is like a shitty bun a piece of dry meat and some ketchup ? Well that gyro had all its ingredients melted into one piece of delicious goodness . I dont know where the bread ended and where the meat began . I still salivate thinking about it . I cant even remember exactly what was in it . Maybe some god sauce ? Is that a thing ? If it is that gyro had god sauce in every crevice not filled with that amalgamation of flavors and scents . I sat in my car next to a beach and cried while the god sauce flowed down my chin unto my chest while I was slowly and carefully enjoying that savory goodness . I could not comprehend it . My mouth was orgasming and I was contemplating the meaning of flavors and food and in that moment of sensory overload it ended . The gyro was gone . And I knew I would never experience such delight and awe in my life again . \\n\\nI ended up experiencing that every morning for the next week .

Like they are doing now with Brexit , pressuring the UK to finally invoke article 50 in order to end this period of uncertainty which is mainly hurting them . \\n\\nBut yeah , this was a nice debate , I can see me re-thinking some of the things I said , hope I managed to do the same for you .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I think that if the people want a referendum they should get one . But I just disagree that Catalonia needs to leave .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

I dont know enough about the Catalan parliament and could be wrong but I dont think it objectively shows what the people want .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Yeah you could say so . I think the fairest thing to do is let everybody choose for themselves what language they want to speak . That does not require Independence though .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"& gt ; Yes there is - there is even a lot of talks about Scotland remaining in the UK should they declare independence before Brexit\\n\\nIm guessing you meant remaining in the EU not the UK . But the situation is different here . In their referendum they were also told that they would not be allowed back into the EU immediately . Especially with the UK\\ 's veto . It was made clear that independence meant that all relations with the EU would need to be made from scratch because you cant deal with the new sovereign state with the agreements you have made with another one . Even in this case , though , Scotland wont be allowed to just re-enter the EU immediately after a Scottish Independence . It is just impossible . As I said you cant have the agreements and deals made with the UK to be binding for another country which Scotland would then be . \\n\\n & gt ; That is irrelevant - people want independence despite the fact that it may not create a better future . I surely remember what the early 90s were like in Estonia . \\n\\nHow is it irrelevant ? I think its the most important part . Only if the UK were educated enough on what they were voting they would have remained instead of voting for Brexit in order to stop Muslim immigration . Ah but did leaving the Soviets bring a better future ? Now Estonia is ways ahead of Russia . And you did have examples of how capitalism was better than socialism so you could definitely make a rational argument for leaving then . \\n\\n & gt ; If they want to , then why should there be a problem . If they don\\'t want to , then it\\ 's not our business to stop them.\\n\\nBut nobody is stopping them ! ( except maybe Spain ) There is a process that every country that wants to become a member needs to follow in order to gain membership . There are guidelines that need to be reached . Its the process that makes the EU possible that would slow Catalonia or any other nation from joining , not spite or bitterness . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is why not cooperating with their entry is why I consider it a childish reaction.\\n\\nThere would be cooperation , but how long would it take for them to land a deal ? How long will Spain be childish ? It is uncertain but only one thing is known , and it is that it wont be instantaneous\\n\\n & gt ; No - having come from a subjected nation - the problem was not only political repression , but the fact itself that it wasn\\'t \ '' our nation\ '' .\\n\\nWell that is your opinion . I personally , as long as my vote count towards the leadership and the local governance cant be bothered with the symbolism of calling that leader and governance ours . I dont see how that would make me sleep better . \\n\\n & gt ; Yet are outvoted in issues that matter to them internally . Reminds me of these Russians , who claim there should have been an all-empire/all-union referendum on whether or not Estonia should have become independendent or not.\\n\\nEvery village is outvoted as well as every person . Its the flaw of democracy , not everybody can be happy . As long as they have their local governance though , it is fair . \\n\\n & gt ; Have you considered Catalonia wants to be treated as an equal among European nations , not as a regional subject of Spain ? \\n\\nFor me its much more important to identify whether leaving or not would be better for them . What they vote is their business . I just think the question of \ '' should we\ '' needs to be raised in stead of silencing it with stuff like \ '' they have the right to be independent\ '' , everybody does , it does not mean its the right thing to do , though .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"To me if you need to force the people to speak a language in order to preserve it then you need to question whether or not it should exist . \\n\\nI cant speak for the middle two points because I dont know enough about them , but if Catalonia gains independence and loses EU membership the economic consequences will be overwhelming , destroying lives , businesses and industries .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"The EU has stated that leaving Spain would mean they would leave the EU . Not to mention the high possibility of Spain being spiteful and vetoing their entry for a long time . 10 years , I think is a reasonable amount of time . The government has to be formed with the whole administration , new foreign relations with the EU , then the EU needs to make sure that Catalonia answers to all requirements for joining , etc . Its a long process . \\n \\n & gt ; To be an independent country , duh\\n\\nNot independent , different . They already are independent . Nobody is discriminating against them , nobody has enslaved them , they have all the rights , can vote in elections can be elected to represent the people . Its not more independence than the UK \ '' gaining independence\ '' from leaving the EU . Its populist crap.\\n\\n & gt ; Necessity & gt ; complexity\\n\\nWhat necessity ? \\n\\n & gt ; Plus , the same empty argument could be said about every change on the world map.\\n\\nNot really .

I just dont understand why every time we talk about Crimea there needs to be someone who starts talking about the US invasion of Iraq that started 2004 . Nobody is criticising Russia for what they did in Chechnya in 1999 . \\n\\nAnother reason I am tired of hearing all these arguments against Russian criticism is because they are word for word with what Russia has been mind-washing its citizens through propaganda- \ '' The West are actually the bad guys , Russia is just the nice guy who is trapped in the corner and unfairly ganged up on by the evil euros.\ '' Every time we criticise Russia there isnt even an attempt to justify what Russia is doing it straight up goes to \ '' But what about Kosovo , Iraq , etc.\ '' \\n\\nWhat also never helps is that Russia seemingly doesn\\'t care for collateral damage .

A country that doesnt see peace as a priority and brain washes its citizens so they match Putin\\ 's foreign affair aspirations . \\n\\nAt this moment improving relations with Russia would mean requesting the EU remove sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea , ordering a new power plant from Russia when we already know that because of our small political power they will abuse us and price us to hell which is seen in the price of natural gas they offer- [ I think only Poland pays more than us in the EU compared to the UK which pays a fraction of the price and are much farther away than us ] ( http : //gdb.rferl.org/3DFD9930-33D5-4420-8805-7D9A0C7AE6ED_mw1024_mh1024_s.png ) . \\n\\nI am for having better relations with Russia but they need to do the first steps- Removing their soldiers from Crimea , Georgia , Eastern Ukraine .

Israel appeared out of thin air in such an illegal way that it still has unyielding enemies 70 years later and there is no end in sight to that hostility . \\n\\n2 .

2ntle,europe,"The comment on the end of the article drives the right point home that was not covered by the author : \\n\\n & gt ; From my personal experience and studies ( currently writing my thesis in Balkan history ) , this almost makes it out that those Serbs in Vukovar are totally innocent bystanders in the war and the current issue surrounding Cyrillic script . Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997 , two years after the war officially ended . Whilst in Serb hands , the Latin Script was banned . Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas . These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places . These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes . Under international pressure , Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape , murder , torture , theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated . Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims . This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society , thus we have a culture of separation ( cafes , shops , schools etc ) . Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County . For example , at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there . So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not . There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Azure_Dawn,europe,"Some parts from article . \\n\\n & gt ; This is more difficult to do than it sounds because the media\u2019s narrative about Le Pen\u2019s rise has been hysterical . The next two weeks will feature more of the same : articles decrying the potential end of Western civilization , the rise of fascism , and the potential unleashing of the horrors of Europe\u2019s past across the Continent once more . Many who never much cared about France will spontaneously generate opinions about how the West\u2019s hopes now rest on Macron\u2019s shoulders . If Le Pen wins , it will be the French Devolution . If she loses , complacency will set in , and Macron the empty suit will take up residence at the Palais de l\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e . He will continue status quo policies that in five years will bring us right back to where we started \u2013 or perhaps worse.\\n\\n & gt ; The key questions no one is asking are : Why did Le Pen oversee the expulsion of her father from the National Front , and why has she worked so hard to exorcise the party\u2019s most radical positions ? Stated differently , does Le Pen control her constituents , or do her constituents control her ? The answer to this question is important because it is the difference between the National Front being a reanimation of the worst of 20th century European history and a 21st century political party attempting to respond to economic , political and security challenges while still operating within the framework of liberal democratic norms . If the masses control Le Pen , we\u2019re back in the 20th century . If Le Pen controls the masses , we\u2019re still in our own century.\\n\\n & gt ; The second issue for these voters is immigration , and by extension , radical Islam . Three days before the election , on April 20 , a shooting happened on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that was claimed by the Islamic State . Paris and Nice suffered horrific terrorist attacks perpetrated by radical Islamists in 2015 and 2016 , respectively . Le Pen\u2019s platform addresses this in two ways . First , she wants to strengthen the rule of law . She plans to do this by hiring more police , building more jails , and shutting down mosques with ties to radical Islam . Second , she wants to crack down on illegal immigration . This means curbing asylum requests and introducing more stringent naturalization requirements . Le Pen also plans to limit legal migration to 10,000 people per year . One may disagree with Le Pen\u2019s approach , but not with the fact that a problem exists and previous French governments have failed to address it.\\n\\n & gt ; Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man says , \u201cMen are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d Article 3 says , \u201cThe principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation.\u201d This is a contradiction . Article 1 is universalist ; it does not say \u201cFrench men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\u201d It says all individuals enjoy these unalienable rights . But on the same page , Article 3 becomes pragmatic , attempting to ensure these rights are protected . Without enforcement , rights are abstractions . The individual may have rights , but we do not live in a world of individuals . We live in a world of political communities . The French nation is Le Pen\u2019s political community , and her policy is to defend it . For her detractors , Le Pen\u2019s great crime is that she does not consider it France\u2019s responsibility to ensure the unalienable rights of all men . For her supporters , she is the defender of the unalienable rights of French men , and to ask France to do more is to ask the impossible.\\n\\n & gt ; There is a dark side to France , as there is a dark side to all countries . But Le Pen is not a slave of the masses . She is a political pragmatist who is holding back something far worse , and she knows what the \u201csomething far worse\u201d is because she tried to exorcise it from her own party last year . This election is important because of what it indicates about the future of Europe . That future hangs on the nation-state\u2019s ability to respond to the concerns of individuals . We have seen what happens when it can\u2019t , and the result was far more disruptive than a French nationalist becoming the newest president of the Fifth Republic .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

While some may turn away from jihadism in the future , a small proportion will not.\\n\\n & gt ; The third and fourth factors relate not just to Europe , but to the broader world . Hegghammer suggests that persistent conflicts in the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia look \u201cset to supply European jihadis with both rallying causes and training opportunities for the foreseeable future , as it has in the past.\u201d Many experts believe that the conflict in Syria may still have a long way to go and that groups like the Islamic State will be very hard to fully defeat . The group could be training and blooding potential European attackers for years to come.\\n\\n & gt ; Compounding this problem is the final factor : the Internet .

Azure_Dawn,europe,"& gt ; Poland\u2019s history can easily be summed up as a continuous struggle against invasions and divisions . The country\u2019s geopolitical significance stems from its location between Russia and Germany . We have written about the challenges that both Russia and Germany will face in 2017 ; these challenges also pose unique problems for Poland , which is economically and militarily vulnerable . Recent developments have also helped Poland lay the groundwork for its eventual emergence as a regional power , as stated in our 2040 forecast.\\n\\n & gt ; Considering Poland\u2019s relatively small economy , which gives it more room to maneuver , the decline in German exports could become an opportunity for Poland to maintain and increase its export competitiveness . Technology transfers have accompanied Western investment in the country , and with continued support for national research and innovation and its relatively well educated and cheap workforce , Poland could remain competitive on the global market . One major challenge Poland faces in the medium to long term is its demographic situation , which limits its potential because the country has the second fastest aging population in Europe . But the success of socio-economic policies that drive competitiveness is dependent on political stability.\\n\\n & gt ; With Western Europe disinclined to prioritize any potential Russian threats , Poland is slowly acting as a small regional leader by working with countries to establish and support common initiatives such as defense against Russia . Within the EU , Poland will continue to be the leading voice of Eastern Europe , distancing itself from the EU\u2019s Western European members . Warsaw has been the main challenger of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project proposed by Russia , effectively blocking it when the country\u2019s anti-monopoly agency stopped the formation of the project\u2019s consortium . Seeing that Belarus wanted to improve relations with the EU to access European markets , and considering Belarus\u2019 dependence on Russia\u2019s slowing economy , Warsaw has worked to improve ties with Minsk . Polish Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in October and said a new chapter in Polish-Belarusian relations had been opened . The two countries have economic incentives to develop closer ties , and Poland will likely take advantage.\\n\\n & gt ; Trapped between Russia and Germany , Poland is aware of Russia\u2019s increasing assertiveness and NATO\u2019s challenges , including its members\u2019 differing security interests . In the short term , Poland will likely feel the impact of Germany\u2019s economic slowdown . Adaptation to the new reality of a declining Western Europe will not be easy or fast . The current administration will continue to seek the right balance between extending control over the economy and political institutions , and making sure its public approval ratings remain high . Considering the country\u2019s defense imperatives , Warsaw will keep building strong ties with the U.S. and develop its regional leadership posture by working with Eastern Europeans on different levels.\\n\\n & gt ; Poland usually only makes mainstream news in the West when it has conflict with the EU over specific policies or when massive government protests erupt . The much more subtle and important thing to be aware of is how Poland is beginning to behave like a small regional leader . Warsaw will see increased tensions with Western Europe , and Germany in particular , partly due to economic problems , but mostly because of diverging views on security priorities . Increased Russian assertiveness will force Poland to invest in and make the most of regional alliances .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in a sense two languages were more similar before WWII.\\n\\nYes , and after . WWII-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical Croatian language.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; For example did you ever heard of Miroslav Krleza ? \\n\\nOf course.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The greatest Croatian writer who ever lived ? \\n\\nWhile he is no doubt a great writer , that\\ 's debatable . There\\ 's a slew of great Croatian writers and I\\ 'm glad I can\\'t pick one so easily . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe sounds familiar ? \\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Heard about his book \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' from 1932 ? Yeah \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' , not \\'\\'Tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt\\'\\'\\n\\nWhat\\ 's the point ? You\\ 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . That\\ 's massive reaching and does you a disservice.\\nYou also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards Yugoslavian unity . \\nI doubt you ever read any of his works , but I did and there\\ 's nothing too different from today\\ 's Croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . \\n\\nJust check his \ '' Balade Petrice Kerempuha\ '' and see if you still want to claim Croatian and Serbian are the same.\\n\\nBut since you were so eager to bring Krle\u017ea up , I have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ \ '' Declaration about the name and position of Croatian literaly language\ '' ] ( https : //hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo % C5 % BEaju_hrvatskog_knji % C5 % BEevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ Novosadski sporazum ] ( https : //sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosadski_dogovor ) . So , he would very much disagree with you.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' hiljadu\ '' would be considered \ '' Serbism\ '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in Croatia\\n\\nNo , you wouldn\\'t . I\\ 've known people who freely used \ '' hiljadu\ '' when talking to teachers of Croatian language.\\nBesides , \ '' hiljadu\ '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from Greek language ) , not a \ '' Serbism\ '' . Really , are there any Serbisms ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by Croatian linguists , just to be as different from Serbian as possible.\\n\\nAgain incorrect . A lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . Google Bogoslav \u0160ulek , Adolfo Veber Tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Learn yer history bruh.\\n\\n\ '' Bruh\ '' , I know my history just fine . I don\\'t want to comment on your knowledge of Serbian ( I don\\'t really care ) , but your knowledge about Croatian history is frankly atrocious and it\\ 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a Croatian.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; We use both \ '' hleb\ '' and \ '' kruh\ '' , both \ '' vazduh\ '' and \ '' zrak\ '' , both \ '' sargarepa\ '' and \ '' mrkva\ '' etc . Bosnian and Serbian went for language richness , while Croatian went for language purity.\\n\\nVazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in Croatia . Not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into Standard . On the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in conclusion , no , Yugoslavia didn\\'t forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . \\n\\nIt\\ 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , I feel , based on your wishes . The idea of Yugoslavia **and** Yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . There\\ 's no denying it . You can check the texts from before the pan-southslavic movements.\\n",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; Well , I replied to a comment in regards to why Bosnia and Croatia are two different countries while Slavonia and Dalmacia aren\\'t.\\n\\nBecause of historical reasons . When you look at the maps of former empires , you\\ 'll notice that borders between Bosnia and Croatia were almost the same , they were borders of Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\\n\\n & gt ; So why religion ? Well , let\\ 's be honest.. A lot of seemingly insane views of other people have been caused by religion . So I guess I\\ 'm just trying to figure out if that\\ 's where it comes from down there . I mean , religion caused the killings of \ '' witches\ '' , gays , women ( doing anything wrong . ) , other religious groups etc . so \\n\\nReligion is not the point here . While religion had some part in formation of some nations ( primarily Serbs and Bosniaks/Muslims , to some extent Croatians ) , the problems were more of cultural/national/historical rather than religious . \\nCroatians were never very exclusive religion-wise , as you also had protestant , orthodox , etc . Croats . Heck , one of the orthodox was a famous writer during the national spring.\\n\\nFurthermore , even Croatian nazis considered Muslims to be Croats and they didn\\'t persecute them per se . For example , they turned one of the galleries in Zagreb in a [ mosque ] ( http : //media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/11-zagreb2-450.jpg ) . Those nazis also organised Croatian Orthodox Church.\\n\\nLooking at the religion as a source of all problems is a lazy and ignorant view , but the simplest of them - which is why so many people are prone to it.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I suppose it might explain some of the tensions down there if everyone was like 110 % serious about their religions and believed every word of their holy books.. \\n\\nWhat year is it ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; To me it simply doesn\\'t make sense to think that someone living 10 miles away ( Across a border ) is so different\\n\\nI left out the second part because it\\ 's a stereotypical nonsense.\\n\\nThe thing is because of cultural influence . Bosnia and Herzovina/Serbia were dominated by Ottomans and it shows , whereas the Croatians coast was always under the Italian influence . Northern Croatia ( Northwest particulary ) was under heavy Austrian influence . So , this is from where a lot of cultural ( and linguistical if you\\ 'd be looking into the dialects ) differences emerge.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest , a northern Croatian is more likely to get beat in southern Croatia than a Serbian or some other nationality . Just a few days ago there were some news of players getting beaten . So , all these rambles about Serbians/whateverelses fearing for their lives because they\\ 're so special is nonsense , since Croatians may get the very same treatment . Why ? Because assholes . You got plently of them as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why do Croatians care if someone\\ 's wearing a Serbian tourist t-shirt in Croatia for example ? \\n\\nThey rather don\\'t , they got other things on their mind to worry about rather than who\\ 's wearing what.\\n\\n & gt ; We don\\'t beat up people wearing German , English , Swedish or whatever football jerseys here for example..\\n\\nWe don\\'t do it either , other than hooligans , but they are more of an international problem ( see Dutch hooligans destroying Italian works of art , etc . ) and it\\ 's no worse than in other European countries .

Because of circlejerking .

Why ? Because it\\ 's not that important.\\nWhich again brings me to ... \\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t have a view.\\n\\nC\\'mon , you have some view .

Especially since most of it can be forged/faked ( you\\ 'd be surprised how often I can come across mental gymnastics ) .\\nTourists who come here usually thoroughly enjoy it and crime rates are rather low , Croatia is a very safe country.\\nLay off the youtube and site comments , in general . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Well yeah , but that\\ 's not where I saw it.\\nhttp : //www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/croatian-girl-kisses-serb_n_2839945.html\\n\\nLol , wow , I must admit I thought a tiny bit higher of Huffington Post , but this is just tabloid material at absolute worst . They base their story around a picture and reddit user , without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources . It\\ 's basically like you saw it on reddit.\\n\\n\\nThis is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they\\ 're going to only go by the words of reddit users . \\nIn this case , nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners.\\n\\n\\nI find english articles about Croatia generally of poor quality , and often scarce and misleading.\\n\\nFor example , when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban , which was fairly covered , a lot of these sites were saying that 65 % of Croatians voted for banning of gay marriage.\\n\\nHowever , 65 % of those who went to vote voted for banning , and only 38 % of voter base went voting . But of course this gets no mention.\\nThis can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65 % of Croatians are against gays/gay marriages , while in reality the referendum wouldn\\'t even pass if it weren\\'t for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the EU referendum.\\n\\nI also remember reading an Economist article on Croatian elections , where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates ( which were used by common people in Croatia ) , which is just a huge low for a media.\\n\\nAlso , a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts.\\n\\nCroatia doesn\\'t get reported on often , and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it , I don\\'t know what to say.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; No , I may have some media created assumptions , but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there ? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region ? \\n\\nDrop the \\'region\\ ' and replace with \\'Croatia\\ ' and I\\ 'll agree , but otherwise no . I always hated this collectivism regarding ex-Yugoslavia , since it simply can not be under the same denominator . There\\ 's a reason it didn\\'t work , the differences are there . Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ? Unfortunately , it happens too many times.\\n\\n\\nSomething you may not be aware of , and that contributed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor . Slovenia and Croatia had to give substantial money to the underdeveloped parts of Yugoslavia ( the rest of it ) during the times of both Yugoslavias and this is what annoyed most people.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; While I find the crazies..

Blind_Fire,europe,"The Czech Republic consists of 3 historical regions . \\n\\nBohemia , the western region . Moravia , the south-eastern part . And lastly , the Czech part of Silesia . Silesia as a region spreads also to Poland and Germany.\\n\\nSo simply calling it Bohemia invokes the Czech word *\u010cechy* , which is the Czech name , again , for only the western half of the country.\\n\\nCzechia is the agreed equivalent of the Czech word *\u010cesko* . The suffix *-sko* is a common suffix for country names . For example , Russia , your country , is simply called *Rusko* , the root *Rus* + *-sko* . *\u010cesko* is often used as a name for the whole region , it was also used in the name of Czechoslovakia , *\u010ceskoslovensko*.\\n\\nMany , myself included , accept Czechia because it is simple and natives often use its equivalent , *\u010cesko* , in normal speech . Although , many , myself again included , find it weird-sounding and hesitate to use it themselves.\\n\\nCzechlands is sometimes also used , although , the term is incorrect and has no basis in the native language . Its equivalent , *Zem\u011b \u010cesk\u00e9* , is used when speaking of the historic regions , often meaning literally Bohemia+Moravia+Silesia . It is very close to the term *Zem\u011b Koruny \u010cesk\u00e9* , The Lands of the Czech Crown , which is mostly used in connection with the old Kingdom of Bohemia , former part of the HRE.\\n\\nSome people , mainly natives with low English proficiency , use phrases like : \ '' Here in Czech , we ... .\ '' . This is outright wrong and should not be used . Phonetically it is ok but gramatically it is only a shortcut for people to get their message through . Some English-speaking people might accept it but it probably sounds weird.\\n\\nThe Czech Republic , the full name , probably sounds too complicated or exhausting to use over and over again , however , the equivalent *\u010cesk\u00e1 republika* is often used even in the native tongue . It is something that is correct in 99 % of the situations you might bump into .

As it is promoted mostly to stakeholders ( associations , political parties , unions , ... ) than regular public , because it can be costly and you dont want people that attend demonstrations to come there and talk shit , which doesnt really benefit anyone . Also not all events there are fully public . We dont have anything scheduled for TTIP or CETA right now as the negotiations for TTIP are frozen because of Trumps administration ( just like all negotiations involving USA ) and CETA right now is in parliament ( ratification process ) , there was a conference last week about it so I dont think we will see another one as there was nothing new , everyone who wants to know annything about it already does know .

I understand the idea behind it ( less corruption space ) but damn , you are going to destroy them.\\n\\nLast week , someone wanted all employees of our ministry with phone numbers and email adress and office numbers , because we are state employees and should serve public ( and quoted some paragraphs ) . If you want a specific employee for some reason , fine .

I usually give a vote to random & lt ; 5 % party so they will be happy and get some money from it . like in foreign policy , KDU , ANO and TOP could be the right calls , while internally I really can not pick , they are all pretty much conservative national leftists , no liberal pro-EU progressive party that cares about real issues and not made up populist bullshit . but it comes down to education of population , because government ( political parties ) reflect the population - our parties wouldnt be succesful in germany and vice versa.\\n\\nplebs = peasants , villagers , the \ '' less you know the more vocal you are\ '' type of people . people that shouldnt have voting rights , because they drag whole country down . not every person is a pleb . people that understand there are experts on certain issues , while others know more about other issues , are regular citizens to me . during the history , plebs were servants to their masters and not vice versa ( unlike populists ) , while people in cities were the 3rd class - people that worked on their own for their own living . that actually requires rational thinking . being a servant/peasant doesnt , you just need to work hard and adore your master . this mentality ( however it is denied ) still persists in 40-70 % of people - genetics ( nothing wrong or good about it , thats how it is , nature ) . it could vary in each country , but I dont think it is below 60 % in CZ , especially after the brain-drains in the past century.\\n\\nyes , politicans can manipulate facts so it fits their narrative , just like anyone who wants to appel on other people . there is nothing to be done about that , no way it can change . it definitely wont change if you elect someone else , even tho people still think so . you can not say everything you know , because it could hurt people/business/country interests . even I know a lot ( from my POV , I suppose most people here know way more ) which would be sensations for newspapers and could do a lot of damage to certain people , or even hurt our country on international area.\\n\\njust like you dont talk shit about your parents/kids to other people ( at least once you grow up ) . and if you do , it is nothing serious or personal . and if you do , then everyone knows that the person isnt alright and something is very very wrong .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Burlaczech,europe,"If you are going to judge liberalism by todays standards in different countries ... you actually cant , because it has different meaning everywhere . You can find right winged green party as well as hardcore communist green party . You can be left wing socialist or even almost right wing ( previous PM of France ) . \\n\\nLiberalism is indeed about freedom of individuals , but which translates into economic freedom with emphasis on entrepreneurship and taking care of yourself . Unless you want me to recommend you a whole book , you will have to accept this simple definition and of course , one sentence or paragraph can not describe whole ideology with all its factions . Libertarians are extremists with anarchic tendencies , its like saying right wing conservatives = nazis . \\n\\nAs Ive mentioned before , you can have liberals in social democracies , which brings them more to centrists , because it is right wing ideology . Politicians in developer democracies are not edgy teens , and usually come up with compromises that include many ideas from different corners of political spectrum . Our liberal-conservative party which ruled the country like 12y ago increased social welfare spending 3 times , the biggest increase in modern history of the country . Does that make them liberal-conservative-socialists ? \\n\\nLiberals in todays EU either want to destroy EU , or understand its social principles and \ '' work within the borders\ '' of the EU legislative - which includes for example grants ( which would be unacceptable for liberals before ) . \\n\\nI am not really sure what do you mean by protecting life . Everyone wants to protect life ( ? ) , liberals would say that you should tak\u00e9 care of it yourself , conservatives would say that the family/your master/police should do it and socialists would say that there should be no guns among the population and only police should have some minimum ( best would be some tasers ) - thats very common in the north and western Europe today , which seems really crazy to me . And also extreme left ( greens , communists ) would say that we should destroy all weapons and focus on higher goals , such as global peace , environment , ... \\n\\nWhat you described about two people example , It seems like typical anarchic-communism ( final stage of socialism ) . Typical liberal would say \ '' your freedom ends where my begins\ '' - & gt ; dont touch my food , unless I give you a permission . But this could be very individual , as for example having opinion about squatters can vary between liberals , anarchists , communists , socialists , conservatives , ... Its a very complicated topic . \\n\\nWhether the liberal should or should not share food in that situation is not really liberal to me . Its socialism-conservatism debate . Socialist would share , conservative would not . Typical liberal would stick to a conservative narrative , but in todays EU , I believe that a liberal would stick with a socialist in this case . For example in the migrant crisis , liberals mostly support helping those people . But again , it varies a lot on individual organisations/parties/people , nobody is a pure liberal , everyone is a mix.\\n\\nEven as a right-wing liberal ( who would have guessed ) I dont see a reason for fencing a forest , so even if it is a private property , in this case I dont see why people should be denied access there . But I would have different rules for small parks that should give me an option to keep it private for me and people I want in . Or to demand an entry fee . But If I owned a forest , I could have different experience and outcome of my thoughts could be different as well.\\n\\nSo overal - we cant really classify parties or people as members of one ideology , we cant even judge certain policies as such , because all of them are mostly a mixture of multiple ideologies . Which is great and it keeps governments towards the centrism , which to me , is ideal , because it satisfies the majority . It is very easy to see that countries , which are edging towards one side more than the other , are not doing that well and a lot of people are really unhappy there , for real reasons ( as opposed to \ '' made up\ '' unhappiness here ) .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

But thats origins , thats not 20 or 21st century , so I am talking about whats relevant for us right now . Liberalism in its core is right-wing orientation ( you should work hard and get big reward ) just like conservatism , as opposed to socialism ( everyone works and should have the same reward ) . Very simplified version . In todays context , lot of workers welfare ( labour laws , unemployment pay , maternity leave , benefits , ... ) are left-wing policies that originate in socialism . A liberal would say \ '' its their probl\u00e9m , I have my own , unlock my shackles and let me tak\u00e9 care of myself\ '' . thats a right-wing way of thinking.\\n\\nWhat reflects reality better , is the 4 way compass with + being libertarian , - totalitarian , X left-wing ( economy ) , Y right-wing ( economy ) . It reflects the complexity way better than just X and Y . Because Stalin and Hitler were both on the other side of axis Y and X , while both being totalitarians and governed the state in a very similar way , as opposed to western style of democracy . \\n\\nthe welfare state , as we know it today , was really not invented by Marx , but by a Bismarc , who was a hardcore capitalist supporter . But you can not have socialism without capitalism ( you will run out of money and everyone will become poor over time - look at central europe ) and you can not have capitalism without socialism ( look at europe in 18-19th century or china today - people will be unhappy and create labour unions , demand more welfare or even leave the country ( or even vote for people like Bernie Sanders ) , if another one will have better working conditions . Modern state needs both systems . Which ratio between the two is perfect ? That really depends on each country . But this will bring us to another subreddit .",Balto-Slavic,Czech
Burlaczech,europe,"in that case yes . I believe we all have a lot in common and its only up to us whether we want to see it or not . Marxism only talks about wealth and how social class is dependent on it , which is not true today in Europe . You can be anything you want comming from anywhere you want , its only up to you and your abilities . So what could be more relevant in 19th century is not ( very ) relevant in 21st . Just like some people want to live by hundred years old book . \\n\\nI am not saying that everything Marx or any socialist said is wrong . I say that their system is wrong .

No , learning means that if he has a point ( and they do ) , you should take what you want from it and improve yourself , evolve . Just like from a bad relationship , you always learn something new . \\n\\nIf you want an example of what could we learn from socialism is that for example we should care about poverty where religion fails . What should we take from Marxism is that you can think about the common things certain groups share , that you would not think about before . Its up to you what you do with the information , its just a basic level of education here .

DannyUfonek,europe,"The people who aren\\'t affected ( I understand you\\ 're referring to the post-communist countries ) are the most critical because they fear the consequences which they see ( and don\\'t see ) through the media . They don\\'t want to repeat the mistakes that refugee-friendly countries have done in the past few years . To name a few - no go ( Sweden , Germany ) and shariah ( UK & amp ; France ) zones , censorship of critics of islam , creeping islamisation of politics ( UK Labour ) . They want safeguards put in place that will prevent this . Instead , politicians and media , instead of solving the problem , are trying to tell them that they\\ 're all racists ( at least here in the Czech Republic ) . For example , our prime minister Sobotka completely ignored the 200,000 people who signed the petition against EU immigration quotas ( he provided no justification for why he will or won\\'t take it into account ) , likewise the media ignored the petition . If they were xenophobic , they wouldn\\'t have done so . His minister for internal affairs Chovanec is instead demanding money for a campaign to \ '' break the xenophobic resistance\ '' of the Czech people . In case where a ruling politician spits into the face of 75 % of his citizens ( from a study on accepting refugees - 75 % said they were against ) , one can\\'t be surprised that people are angry and are becoming \ '' radicalised\ '' .\\n\\nIf there was a great rise in xenophobia , the gypsies , the Vietnamese and the Ukrainians wouldn\\'t be spared . There is nobody except the stupid true xenophobes ( like this crazy Slovak ) who is suggesting any racist \\'arguments\\ ' . People are just genuinely worried . However , the government just ignores them . I will say what I said in another comment - **Suggesting that critics of islam and of immigration are xenophobic is as unjust as suggesting that all muslims want to kill us ! **\\n\\nAnd in regards to islam - islam ( like many other religions ) is bad and should be criticised . ( Just read the quuran and you will see - or look at the state of human rights in majority muslim societies ( specifically what they do to women , homosexuals , and atheists in the name of islam ) ) , but that is a different issue than the immigration itself . What is however spreading across Europe is the chilling effect of \ '' anti-xenophobia\ '' and PC ( most supported by wealthy muslims and idealistic or machiavellistic socialists ) , which leads to limiting free speech - people can\\'t draw Mohammad or criticise because some muslims ( and some antiracists in power ) see it as insulting ( and some even to the point that they go kill the cartoonists ) , so newspapers are self-censoring . Insults and criticism are the base of free speech , the pillar of our society . If something insults you , then you have three options : a ) ignore it , b ) respond to it and clear it c ) sue the perpetrator ( if it is repeated ) for harassment . You have no right to censor that person in a free society , especially if it\\ 's about some man from several centuries ago.\\n\\nPeople are just seeing that the immigration from muslim countries is unsustainable in the present form ( I\\ 'm all for different forms of integration than what is being done now ) , and right winged opinions aren\\'t the minority . I never implied that . They aren\\'t all over the media . It\\ 's just that the media aren\\'t so keen on reporting all the aspects of immigration . If crime rates are dropping in Norway , good for you . Perhaps you should teach us how to integrate these people better.\\n\\nAnd even if there truly was a \ '' neoconservative wave\ '' everywhere ( there isn\\'t one , lest we would see true xenophobia spread ( and saying that islam is bad isn\\'t xenophobic - it would be xenophobic to say muslims are bad because they\\ 're different ) ) , then so be it . If it is the will of the people and if the EU is democratic , it should reflect that . Trouble is , the politicians are on a paneuropean level ignoring the problem and pretending that all is okay . That is how the really xenophobic people are becoming relevant - the mainstream is ignoring the problem , so people have no choice but to support the extreme on this issue . And no , I don\\'t want people like this Slovakian in politics . I want the problem to be resolved on a rational basis , not a racial one . People are angry because the elites are ignoring the problem .

I don\\'t like the system in Czech Republic where supermarkets and restaurants can\\'t give unsold food to those in need because it is **banned** due to \ '' hygienic\ '' reasons , but forcing it on every supermarket is a bit too much . I know , food has to be bought regularly , the majority of people won\\'t wait to the end of the day , and a lot of the food is just thrown away , and I can see it working it many places ( mostly in cities where homeless live ) but I fear that forcing it on everyone might allow others to profit from it and resell the food , or just for consumers to delay buying food ( at least to some extent ) . And as the article says , the main food-throwawayers are the consumers , at 67 % of food binned . So I think the solution is to educate the masses and not to force legislation on the supermarkets .

The business behind \ '' integration\ '' is already spreading propaganda ( for ex . in the form of the \ '' Hate Free\ '' campaign - which involves the motto \ '' Hate doesn\\'t look good on me\ '' ) , which is stifling real discussion as standing on the critical side of the debate automatically amounts to racism and xenophobia . I think before we even think of allowing these people in we should put safeguards in place that will prevent Islam undermining our liberal culture and protect those criticising it . ( I don\\'t want to witness a killing of anti-Islam protestors/cartoonists , only for it to be downplayed and apologised as not being part of \ '' true Islam\ '' , because that is simply not true ) Unfortunately an education programme for the police is planned in which policemen will be taught how to deal with \ '' hate\ '' and \ '' xenophobia\ '' , and not one on protecting the critics that are in real risk of their lives .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

If we really want to help them , we should intervene and aim to solve the crisis in Syria ASAP ( people generally prefer to live close to where they were born , in their home country ) , or at least financially support camps in neighbouring countries - the same money that would rent you a flat in Sweden can save five lives in a camp in Turkey.\\n\\n & gt ; One major issue I see on this sub , though , is the expectation that people will abandon their culture\\n\\nIf the culture is backward ( in treatment of women , for example ) , why shouldn\\'t we encourage its abandonment for our and their sake ? \\n\\n & gt ; If I had to guess , the best way to deal with that isn\\'t by marginalizing the religious , but instead by using moderate religious teachers to reach out in those communities . \\n\\nI agree fully with you here . The problem with Islam today , however , is that there aren\\'t that many moderates ( they\\ 're a minority ) . Most powerful muslims support some version of fundamentalism ( salafism , for example ) , and the European politicians are having them let their way with it to not upset them , instead of banning it altogether ( like nazism ) or regulating it ( creating a European values-friendly islamic curriculum , subsidising islamic moderates , and banning funding from foreign organisations ) .\\n\\nThx for the \ '' taught\ '' , I was typing fast so I didn\\'t realise it.\\n\\nAnd as for racism - what the media and politicians are trying to push is that the biggest problem of Europe is racism and that terrorism etc . isn\\'t happening because the treatment of the integration of this group is bad and so the tendency for this group to radicalise can materialise , but because we , racist Europeans , aren\\'t nice enough .

Jews will also increasingly emigrate from Europe.\\n\\nClimate change will continue , and as a result , the North of Europe will become colder ( due slowing down of the Gulf Stream ) , and the South hotter , water shortages will become more commonplace , and violent storms succeeded by long periods of no rain will form the typical summer.\\n\\nThe US will continue to push its \ '' free-trade\ '' agenda on Europe and will continue to try to lock in its position through shady backdoor deals like TTIP . \\n\\nOn the positive side , for the first time since the early 20th century , we might see copyright terms shortened , leading to real copyright reform EU-wide and finally a rollback of copyright maximalists\\ ' lobbying efforts.\\n\\nCensorship will also increase , and it will not be just porn ( as in the UK ) , but copyright lobbyists will continue to push for censoring file-sharing sites , as has already happened in the case of The Pirate Bay . Other morality/scare groups will join in and will try to silence opposition and competition . If things go really bad , we might see \ '' Islamophobia\ '' outlawed , just like UK Labour\\ 's Ed Milliband promised.\\n\\nThe NSA spying will continue largely unobstructed , because the NSA is above the law ( spying continues despite the clear fact that it is unconstitutional ) , people don\\'t understand the problem enough to be able to care ( and that\\ 's on purpose ) , and NSA\\ 's power is too large for politicians to be able to stop it . We might see a few revelations here and there , but nothing will really change .

Solar panels\\ ' efficiency will increase and with that , also their market share . Many European economies will push to turn away from gas in order to reduce dependance on Russia.\\n\\nSocial security systems across Europe will near collapse under the pressure of the aging population and economically inactive migrants .

We might see the return of a big family ( the young work , the elderly take care of the children ) . \\n\\nSpeaking of families , the proportion of single people will continue to increase , but on the other hand , untraditional families ( for example , several unrelated people living together and sharing their kids ) will become more commonplace.\\n\\nThe falling of Christianity and increase of Atheism in Europe will be compensated by the growth of Islam , and we might in the long run see an increase in sexism.\\n\\nScientists will finalise the way for two lesbians to have a child , and the same thing for gays will follow , although they will still require a surrogate mother to bear it for them . Surrogate mothership and adoption of children by homosexual couples will become more accepted , slowed only by the growth of the muslim say on the issue.\\n\\nInternet speeds will continue to be stagnant across Europe thanks to existing monopolies .

Darkseh,europe,I think it is mainly due to strong presence of the villagers to town people . People from the town tend to often be the least radical and also more informed . Look at the geography of Balkans . Mountains everywhere . It makes some of the villages really isolated . This leads to extremely limited world view consisting of few nearby villages and maybe a major town in region . I heard that after second world war people would come to these isolated villages and they would be asked how is the king doing . This is also what made spreading of extremism and nationalism in Yugoslavia easy . Most of these villages either have never seen the ethnic that they hate or they make their view of the ethnic based on nearby village of that ethnic that they do not get along . \\n\\nOf course history itself is also at fault due to many empires trying to carve Balkans for themselves due to good position . Three damn religions are also the problem here of course . I do not see problem with people wearing scarfs over their heads . Even here in Czech Republic some old people do it .

There was no such balance of power here.\\n\\nLithuania was not a powerful state .

Besides , for some prison life is so good , that as soon as they are free to go they make some minor crime to come back at his friends . Nobody fears prison , it\\ 's often better and easier than to pay taxes and barely have money for food , which happens in some cases for some working people.\\n\\nBut how the cost of death penalty could be bigger ?

Your minor frustrations about privacy are not legitimate reasons to go to streets compared to Ukraine . This is democracy because these acts are representing the will of the majority .

Thankfully , the governments stepped in and put caps on those prices . How is that bad ? \\n\\n & gt ; Then what about their protests ? If they were powerless , why do all politicians cave in to their demands ? \\n\\nThey protest because that\\ 's the only way for them to be heard . They can\\'t go with lobbying as they can\\'t afford any of that . They have zero say in all those legislations and in politics . They block the roads because then the news cover them and they get some exposure.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's about reducing all subsidies , as if they\\ 're there , they\\ 're inevitably end up going for the wrong people\\n\\nSo should we stop ALL government payouts ?

Mind you , I\\ 'm not talking about farms where a family grows just enough food to feed themselves . I\\ 'm talking about farms where they only grow one type of stuff and then sell it . If we cut the subsidies , then it won\\'t be profitable anymore and they will stop selling stuff . \ '' In the long run\ '' doesn\\'t really mean anything here , people won\\'t just sit quietly without a job for a decade.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t know about it , if everybody is allowed to operate , then yes , it\\ 's a free market , only the most competitive businesses will thrive.\\n\\nIt is a free market and it\\ 's a horrible mess with insane prices and fees on everything . That\\ 's what happens when you let the businessmen do whatever they want . That\\ 's why it will never work . Someone has to control them.\\n\\n & gt ; What do you think is paying for those more expensive calls now ? \\n\\nNo one is paying for them . The prices were high because the companies were able to put whatever price they wanted . They could make it 1 euro/min and they did , even if the actual cost was one tenth of that . What are you going to do , sign a new mobile contract just for one week holiday abroad ? That\\ 's why the governments had to step in and say \ '' Sorry guys , but these prices are unreasonable . Cut them.\ '' \\n\\nThe opposite is going on in the agricultural world right now . The farmers are operating below the lowest limit . That\\ 's why they need subsidies . It simply wouldn\\'t be profitable for them to keep operating without them . \\n\\nNow you may say \ '' Oh that\\ 's not a problem , someone else will come along.\ '' Well sure , someone else will , and then you\\ 'll go back to paying 1 euro/min for your calls ? I don\\'t think it\\ 's a good solution.\\n\\n & gt ; And who are these angels and good samaritans who will organise society for us ? \\n\\nThat\\ 's why we have democracies and why we elect people to do stuff and enforce rules , to make everyone equal . It may not be a perfect system and there are glitches every now and then , but it\\ 's much better than no government at all . Look at Somalia if you want to see how a country without a government looks.\\n\\nI watched part of that video and I still don\\'t see how any of it is relevant to all of this . Those are the very basic concepts of trade , the first baby steps . They ignore the enormous amount of change that the current market underwent . \\n\\nLook at it this way : you have a limited amount of money to spend every month , right ? Now imagine if the prices of agricultural produce have doubled . Could you still feed yourself and your family ? What about those who were living paycheck to paycheck before the increase ? \\n\\nYou might say that the sellers will just import cheaper food from abroad , but then what will happen to your neighbour farmers ? If what you say happens then there won\\'t even be cheaper food from abroad , as almost all of it is from other EU countries . We don\\'t import milk or meat from China for obvious reasons .

936535898,europe,"I\\ 'll copy the description of Polish parties from rationalwiki.org : \\n\\n & gt ; Political parties\\n\\n & gt ; These parties have MPs after the October 2015 election : \\n\\n & gt ; Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ( PiS , Law and Justice ) : The Cancer . Far right , nationalistic party with xenophobic tendencies that includes many outright paranoiacs and Catholic fanatics . It can be best describes as a personality cult of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski . Controls a large propaganda system ( websites , newspapers , magazines , a TV channel and now also the entirety of public media , which were quickly purged of anyone even remotely critical of PiS ) . Combines extreme social conservatism matching Catholic doctrine and leftist economic policy of the wishful thinking variety . At one point , all of its MPs voted for a total ban on abortion and its proposal for an in-vitro fertilization bill included jail sentences for doctors . The bad news is that , with a majority in parliament , they will rule for 8 years and send Poles further back in time than Marty McFly . The good thing is that no one will believe their excuses if they fuck up ( and they most certainly will ) . Already ruled between 2005 and 2007 ; the term was cut short by a massive scandal related to misuse of a newly created anti-corruption unit as political police . Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski is a de facto supreme ruler of Poland , since the president , the prime minister , and all Law and Justice MPs are completely obedient to his orders . At the same time , he did not assume any public office , leaving him completely unaccountable to the public.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Platforma Obywatelska ( PO , Civic Platform ) : The Boring Moderates . A centrist party with moderate positions , pro-European and promoting a non-adversarial foreign policy . Ruled between 2007 and 2015 , during which time Poland was the fastest growing economy in Europe . Now the largest party in opposition . Its downfall can be traced back to several key members leaving to take roles in European institutions ; long-time leader Donald Tusk received the post of the President of the European Council , and left the party to Ewa Kopacz , an uncharismatic speaker that is obviously incapable of inspiring voters . The party is still socially conservative , however , but less so than PiS.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Kukiz\\'15 : The Madhouse . Self styled as a \ '' citizen\\ 's movement\ '' rather than a political party , this group won almost 9 % of the vote despite not having any political program . The leader , Pawe\u0142 Kukiz , is a former rockman with explosive temper and very inconsistent views . Because the party is highly disorganized , their electoral lineup was a true curiosity gallery and featured a gangsta rapper , anti-vax activists and open neo-Nazis . Nine of his elected MPs signed a \ '' National Contract\ '' requiring them to uphold the \ '' cultural and ethnic integrity\ '' and support \ '' militarization of the Nation\ '' . [ 31 ] \\n\\n\\n & gt ; .Nowoczesna ( .N , .Modern ) : The Robber Barons . Neoliberal party formed by Ryszard Petru , a prominent economist . Supports tax breaks for business , flat tax , privatization and abolishing the government subsidy for political parties . Also supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\n & gt ; Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe ( PSL , Polish People\\ 's Party ) : Power Thirsty Farmers . An agrarian party that represents Poland\\ 's small farmers . Unfortunately , it often does so to the detriment of large farmers , which produce a far larger share of the crops . They have a reputation for rampant nepotism and a lack of standards - they\\ 'll enter a coalition with pretty much anyone . Barely passed the electoral threshold in 2015 , to the dismay of practically everyone except PSL members . Remains much stronger in local elections . \\n\\n & gt ; Koalicja Odnowy Rzeczypospolitej Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Nadzieja ( KORWiN , Coalition for the Restoration of the Republic \u2013 Freedom and Hope ) : Crazy Fogey\\ 's One Man Show . Headed by Janusz Korwin-Mikke , who is very much like Poland\\ 's Ron Paul , including fanatical online supporters known as korwini\u015bci ( Korwinists ) or kuce ( ponies - yes , ponies ) and associations with fascists . Policy-wise , he is a radical conservative libertarian . The party is so much a one man show that it says so even in the name . Janusz can\\'t even describe his grocery shopping without mentioning Hitler ( he says \ '' Hitler\ '' more often than an average Pole says \ '' kurwa\ '' ) , rape , paedophilia , insulting the interviewer or doing something similarly controversial . He has a passionate hatred of communists and \\'leftists\\ ' , blaming \\'socialist ideology\\ ' for every crime ever committed . This includes the Holocaust , since he considers Hitler a socialist ( though at the same time he claims Hitler didn\\'t know about the Holocaust and that Poles had it better under Nazi German occupation than now ) . He is a fan of Ayn Rand , having called her \ '' the greatest American political writer\ '' . We could go on , but the guy is so crazy he merits a separate article.\\n\\n & gt ; Razem ( Together ) : A New Hope . Social democratic party in the style of Western Europe . Managed to win 3.9 % of the vote despite being formed just a few months before the election and having no wealthy sponsors ( unlike .Modern , which was formed in a similar time frame but was bankrolled by prominent businessmen ) . Its flagship postulates are the strengthening of labor law protections , support for a deeply progressive income tax with a top bracket of 75 % , government investment in housing for rent ( equivalent to council houses in the UK ) and social equality . Formally leaderless . Its support received a large last minute boost after its member decisively won a debate that included the representatives of all eight nationwide electoral committees . The mainstream accuses it of radicalism and driving the support for the SLD-TR-Greens coalition below the parliamentary threshold .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Oops.\\n\\nhttp : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Bible # Slavery_in_the_New_Testament\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe New Testament makes no condemnation of slavery and does no more than admonish slaves to be obedient and their masters not to be unfair . Paul , or whoever wrote the epistles , at no time suggested there was anything wrong with slavery . One could speculate that this might have been because he wanted to avoid upsetting the many slave owners in the early Christian congregations or to keep on good political terms with the Roman government . Or , more probably , he simply thought slavery was an acceptable fact of life as did practically everyone else at the time.\\n\\nEphesians 6:5-8 ( NASB ) : 5Slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to Christ ; 6not by way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . 7With good will render service , as to the Lord , and not to men , 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free.\\n\\nChristian slaves were told to obey their masters \ '' for the sake of the cause\ '' and be especially obedient to Christian masters : \\n\\n1 Timothy 6:1-2 ( NASB ) : 1All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against . 2Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but must serve them all the more , because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . Teach and preach these principles.\\n\\nThere are instructions for Christian slave owners to treat their slaves well.\\n\\nEphesians 6:9 ( NASB ) : 9And masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with Him.\\n\\nColossians 4:1 ( NASB ) 1Masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a Master in heaven . [ 6 ] \\n\\nOne passage often cited by apologists as supposed evidence for New Testament condemnation of slavery is 1 Timothy 1:10 . However , as the King James version accurately translates , this condemnation is of \ '' men stealers\ '' ( Greek : andrapodistais ) , [ 7 ] i.e . slave raiders who kidnapped and sold people as slaves , not slave traders or slave holders in general . So Paul only singled out slave raiders to be considered \ '' lawless and rebellious , \ '' and to be categorized with murderers , homosexuals , liars and oath breakers.\\n\\nThe rather bland admonishment to slave masters by Paul is more than balanced by the demands for absolute obedience made of slaves . It is also rather telling that the masters are likened to God and Jesus , while the masters are simply told that they have a higher lord . So much for Jesus as the embodiment of the underdog - Paul could have pointed to Jesus\\ ' imprisonment and death as a cautionary tale to slave masters that even humble ( d ) characters can be important . [ 8 ] \\n\\nBefore the apologist plays the \ '' but Jesus didn\\'t condone slavery\ '' -card , following all these Pauline examples , try reading Matthew 18:25 , where Jesus uses slaves in a parable and has no qualms about recommending that not only a slave but also his wife and family be sold , while in other parables Jesus recommends that disobedient slaves should be beaten ( Luke 12:47 ) or even killed ( Matthew 24:51 ) .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

AThousandD,europe,"Truth be told , in the past years I\\ 've been observing something genuinely puzzling to me here in Poland - a negative sentiment towards the elderly . \\n\\nThere\\ 's been a resentment towards older people for many years now , based on the association of old people with [ Radio Maryja ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Maryja ) , and PiS and their ( not infrequently dramatically ) conservative stances . During the 2007 pre-term elections called for due to the collapse of the PiS-LPR-Samoobrona coalition , there was this prank call to \ '' take away your grandma\\ 's ID\ '' [ \ '' zabierz babci dow\u00f3d\ '' ; thus making her ineligible to vote , due to being unable to prove her identity ] , a prank that became a - I dare say - popular call . From what I can gather , the author of the slogan later disavowed it when the prosecution took interest in him , but the way I remember it , it was definitely a common sentiment among young people.\\n\\nThen you have the traditional ( i.e . I\\ 've been hearing them in mid-90s , and I\\ 'm hearing them in mid-10s ) complaints from youngsters about old people taking up seats in public transport - complaining about the fact that old people even use public transport that much ( aged 70 and over it\\ 's free to them , with an ID as proof of age ) .\\n\\nIt\\ 's skirting the territory between a joke and genuine resentment and I don\\'t quite like that , how commonly I hear it and with what words of disrespect . On the other hand , I still do see people give up their seats to elders , so there\\ 's that as well.\\n\\nIt\\ 's a far cry from outright euthanasia Soylent-Green-style , but I agree that the way our current economic model is set up it unnecessarily pits the young vs the old and I feel all they\\ 're doing is taking cue from the system .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

To my mind , it\\ 's almost as if , as someone once put it , [ the only winning move is not to play ] ( https : //youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo ? t=3m34s ) . That , however , is not an option . \\n\\nStill , the whole refugee issue - and the migration that is piggy-backing along - it\\ 's so complex , that I fear no one - not even the experts - are able to grasp the whole complexity of the situation and formulate a holistic , well-developed response ( due to multiple factors , e.g . : time constraints and the need for urgent action , fiscal constraints , demographic constraints , public opinion constraints , etc. ) . Therefore , we make do with these ersatz solutions , born out of the need of the moment : Germany asks Hungary to let them pass , then starts giving signs that it\\ 's ready to do *realpolitik* and , as the *de facto* leading player of the EU , force the hands of those who have lesser bargaining positions.\\n\\nI would stay my hand for now , lest I cast a stone in anger - which I really don\\'t feel - against my ( German ) brother . \\n\\nOn a fundamental , human level - I can understand why Germany welcomed the refugees . I\\ 'm not sure if I\\ 'm qualified to mete out judgement , but I can imagine worse decisions could have been taken . At the same time , apart from the fundamental , human level , there is also the economic level and this is where politicians come in , because , it seems , they are the ones making shitty decisions , so things don\\'t get shittier . Or perhaps they will , but then it\\ 'll most likely be other politicians who\\ 'll be having to deal with that mess .

Again , you can hold it against me , but from where I\\ 'm sitting , the future is a very uncertain thing and that\\ 's not making me happy.\\n\\nLastly , apologies for this being rambling-ish ( I usually try to be comprehensive , but clear about what I write ) , but I like to understand things and the current refugee/migrant situation is something I can hardly make heads or tails of and it\\ 's obviously very upsetting .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

The American ethnicity ( can we call it that ? ) was from the grounds up a mixture of a range European nations that was subsequently being added to.\\n\\nPost-WWII , due to a combination of several factors ( i.e . : loss of the Jewish diaspora through the war and emmigration post-war , loss of eastern Polish-held territories in favour of the USSR , acquisition of Silesia , Pomerania and parts of Eastern Prussia and the subsequent deportation of the Germans settled there ) Poland became ( largely ) ethnically monolithic ( like several other neighbouring countries ) ; some people considered it one of the few benefits of the country having gone through war - considering the various ethnic tensions pre-war ( on the axes of Polish-Ukrainian , Polish-Byelarussian , Polish-Lithuanian , Polish-Czechoslovakian and Polish-Jewish relations ) , which became largely absent ( until , perhaps among other moments post-war , the 1968 anti-Jewish party-inspired sentiment which lead to the emigration of most of the remaining Jewish diaspora , I believe ) . Now that homogeneity is being put into question ; like I previously indicated , I believe there are good ways of going about de-homogenising this country , if such is the historic inevitability , and I am led to believe Poland , [ historically ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland ) , has had a pretty good record of co-existing ( mostly ) peacefully with ( at least some ) other ethnicities in the confines of one state.\\n\\nIt\\ 's just that I believe rushing the issue right now may be counter-effective .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Neither was Poland starving *en masse* prior to EU accession , nor were the sums that it benefited from sufficient to \ '' feed\ '' anyone effectively for a year.\\n\\nConsider : Poland is a relatively populous European country , the largest from the EU newcomers , with some 38 mln people - making it the 5th biggest country in the EU , were we to exclude the UK , which is now removing itself from the equation . Were we to divide the 2014 EU benefits value you\\ 've provided and used per capita , I come to a figure in the region of 452 Euros per year per capita ( 17,436.1 mln Eur / 38.53 mln people as per a 2013 World Bank estimate acquired from a search engine ; I\\ 'd appreciate it were you to check my maths , just to be on the safe side ) .

If that\\ 's \ '' feeding\ '' , then - pardon the indiscretion - I have to ask where you are from.\\n\\nLastly , you seem to be taking an issue with this whole structural funds thing .

3dom,europe,"Here is how I see this situation , wall of text incoming : \\n\\nIt seems like Putin know what he is doing and act within his usual agenda ( to restore USSR ) - but apparently there is no hope to restore USSR already ( country is stagnating and state may start to fall apart during next financial crisis ) and Putin is simply trapped : most likely he accumulated billions ( unknown seller has sold US treasuries for $ 70B in February ) in illegally \ '' earned\ '' assets which were unexpectedly returned into the country due to risk of losing them to EU/US sanctions . He is extremely high value target right now - for his own environment in the first place . If situation will start to develop into wrong direction he will be dead and his billions will be shared . The only way for him to stay alive without losing money is to create dictatorship with military discipline while maintaining popularity among lower ranks of bureaucrats ( for protection from high-ranking bureaucrats ) . In the process he has to act \ '' brave\ '' - i.e . achieve all goals population expect from him - despite them being absolutely destructive for the country and the state itself . So as a result we see Mr. Putin is turning the country into bigger and much more dangerous version of North Korea ( North Korea at least has an ideology and can be controlled by China - unlike Russian Federation ) and sending troops into Ukraine openly ( loss of Ukraine may result in massive wave o separatism within RuFed and in Putin\\ 's funerals ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Either RuFed will remove Putin and its government from control ( and army from Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia ) or there is serious possibility for the \ '' empire\ '' to go belly up in couple years . \\n\\nI bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries , in fact [ there are already ready-to-use customs post structures *inside* RuFed ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gacjJL4WVsU ) + regions of RuFed already act as separate states , they have less integration than countries in EU and that is why Kremlin was so hysterical about Ukraine and Georgia signing association agreement with EU - because it\\ 's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within RuFed . Another example : when a citizen move between regions of RuFed she/he need passport and *visa on arrival* ( a.k.a . \ '' registracia\ '' ) which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like \ '' localized/temporary citizenship\ '' ( if you don\\'t own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have *registracia* indefinitely without consent of other tenants ) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire \ '' localized citizenship\ '' or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - I heard about case where 40,000 ( ! ) people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in Sochi ( by FSB itself , mind you ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

A_Nest_Of_Nope,europe,"As expected the argument of oil prices always comes up . Yeah tell that to the people that lived when Yeltsin was the president and when he sold the entire country to 20 people.\\n\\nAs for the reforms , what happened with **Yeltsin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia had undergone a radical transformation , moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally integrated market economy . Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected \ '' oligarchs\ '' , which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.\\n\\n & gt ; Yeltsin\\ 's program of radical , market-oriented reform came to be known as a \ '' shock therapy\ '' . It was based on the recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists , including Larry Summers . The result was disastrous , with real GDP falling by more than 40 % by 1999 , hyperinflation which wiped out personal savings , crime and destitution spreading rapidly.\\n\\n & gt ; The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and subsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth . For example , the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often become the owner of the same enterprise . Under the government\\ 's cover , outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group of individuals at key positions of business and government . Many of them promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad producing an enormous capital flight.\\n\\n & gt ; Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and a dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; In the 1990s Russia was \ '' the largest borrower\ '' from the International Monetary Fund with loans totaling $ 20 billion . The IMF was the subject of criticism for lending so much as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the money and a large part of these funds could have been \ '' diverted from their intended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country illegally\ '' .\\n\\nWhat happened with **Putin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed . Much of the reason for the recovery was devaluation of the ruble , which made domestic producers more competitive nationally and internationally.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2002 , there was a significant amount of pro-growth economic reforms including a comprehensive tax reform , which introduced a flat income tax of 13 % ; and a broad effort at deregulation which improved the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2008 , Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity prices . GDP grew on average 7 % per year.Disposable incomes more than doubled and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold.The volume of consumer credit between 2000\u20132006 increased 45 times , fuelling a boom in private consumption.The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2008.\\n\\n & gt ; Inflation remained a problem however , as the central bank aggressively expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble . Nevertheless , in 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved \ '' unprecedented macroeconomic stability\ '' .Until October 2007 , Russia maintained impressive fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000.\\n\\nPutin absolutely did nothing , it\\ 's all because oil !

ExplosiveMachine,AskEurope,"we don\\'t have your high school , but we do have the gymnasium ( not to be confused with the German one ) that teaches general knowledge at a higher level than \ '' trade schools\ '' of sorts which still teach general knowledge but also have classes directed at various trades . Gymnasium lasts for 4 years and trade schools from 3 to 4 , usually from when you\\ 're 14 to 18 ( if you are born before June ) .\\n\\n1 . we grade 1-5 with 5 being best and 1 meaning failure , IIRC 0 - 49 % = 1 , \\n50-62 % = 2 , \\n63-75 % = 3 , \\n76-89 % = 4 , \\n90-100 % = 5 and it varies between schools and teachers a bit anyway.. grades are given for tests and oral examination and then averaged into semester grades which then average into the overall grade for the year of the subject . At the end of gymnasium is the all-encompassing Matura exam that is separate and independent from the grades of all 4 years.\\n\\n2 . In average you\\ 'd have 6 or 7 class hours in a day , one class hour being 45 minutes . That doesn\\'t equal 6 to 7 subjects in a day since some took up two class hours at a time . There are many subjects ( classes ? ) . You don\\'t take all subjects in all years , or even all semesters . *DISCLAIMER : from here on only counts for the school I attended . * From my days in gymnasium , 1st year I remember : Maths , Slovene , English , German ( some classes had French or Spanish or Italian , depends on what you picked when you enrolled ) , Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Music , Geography , Physical Education , Computer Science , History . But Music and CS would stop after year 1 , in 2nd year you\\ 'd get Sociology ( only 2nd year ) , and in 3rd year you\\ 'd get Psychology ( only 3rd year ) and in 4th Philosophy . You also have obligatory \ '' additional classes\ '' that you have to pick out , and \\n\\n3 . those were usually the extra levels you talk about , so you could take Advanced Maths as the extra class , or you\\ 'd take Psychology again ( with different curriculum of course ) and you\\ 'd pick one for one semester and one for the other . The extra classes are also necessary when you pick two of the subjects for the extra exams in the final Matura exam ( consisting of 5 subjects , Math , Slovene , foreign language ( English , German , French , etc ) and two mandatory extras you pick ) , so if you pick Chemistry and Biology the two of four extra classes in your 4th year are those two and the two extra \ '' higher level\ '' classes . Here i\\ 'd like to distinguish \ '' class\ '' and \ '' subject\ '' more because there are many classes in one school year , as in , groups of students , usually up to 30 and labeled with letters ( so 3.B would be B class of 3rd year ) and all classes are taught the same subjects separately , so you don\\'t really mix students from classes in the ordinary subjects , **except** in the extra *classes* because there students ARE mixed since there are many more to choose from so groups get diluted . As I understand in the US you don\\'t really have \ '' classes\ '' like we do , you are taught every subject in a different group ( being the class ) depending on what you pick . Terminology differences fail me a bit here.\\n\\n4 . integrated systems come and go . We have Math as one subject but Algebra , Geometry and Calculus are all covered separately within it . Physics , Chemistry , Biology , CS and Geography are split.\\n\\n5 . Anything can be arranged if students are interested , but those \ '' exterior classes\ '' won\\'t count towards your final year grade . I remember taking Russian for two years , since enough were interested the school organised a class for our year.\\n\\n6 . lol there definitely was homework . \\n\\n",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
