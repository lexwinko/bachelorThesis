100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough . But when an entire coal pit closes , and hundreds of people loose their main source of income all at once , the town wo n't recover for generations .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

How often do you see rioters paying for the damage they 've done ? & gt ; I do n't doubt they 're that stupid at all , but I do hope that now the police will enforce the law and sentence the lot of them for it instead of just standing idly by while a bunch of children smash up the place because they do n't like someone . Your desired outcome demands that certain conditions are true . For example it means that the police can stop riots effectively and quickly . Also that even if they could , they would want to get their hands dirty , in this particular case for the sake of someone who 's likely to be abhorred by most people . The existence of the phenomena of riots means that at least one of those statements is sometimes false .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Then Obama and the `` reset '' came but relations soured again . Now Trump has come in , and it would not be surprising , if things follow a similar pattern .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"It is difficult for me to imagine the interests of an abstract ideology like Communism , which is why I 'm asking about the interests of the working classes . In that case the argument goes like that : 1 . The working class in modern ROK lives much better than in modern DPRK , with North Korea being practically a byword for repression and misery . Not saying that South Korea is perfect , just that workers would rather live there than under the Kim dynasty . 2 . Those that sympathized with DPRK would have aided the North in its attempts to conquer the South . 3 . Their aid would have increased the chance of the South being ruled by those that now rule the North . 4 . Thus leaving those people alive would have substantially increased the risk that future generations of South Korean workers live under repression and misery . 5 . Thus killing those people secures the well being of the working class . They may have not done anything wrong , but given the stakes involved letting them live would be an unacceptable risk . Other options could have been explored but the invasion left the South 's regime with no other choice . So , the question is , do you see any problems with that line of reasoning ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Given that , would you agree that Liberal governments are , in their suppression of far left movements motivated by ( perhaps misguided ) concern for the well being of their people ( including their working class ) .

And even more importantly why are so many people here discussing it as if it was a serious possibility ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,The reason why the war there was ended as quickly as it did is largely because both sides there fought ( mostly ) competently . In the Syrian conflict on the other hand the most we armed side is absolutely unable to conduct even the most basic operations . If Syrian government was able to do something as fundamental as maintaining a tight siege the war would have been over by now . But as it stands now the Ghouta pocket seems quite well supplied . In that sense the experience and knowledge the Ukrainian army got from that war is probably more valuable than whatever the various Syrian paramilitaries got from the five years of civil war .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; There was no will to continue the fighting in any meaningful way . There was . The reason why the fighting reached stopped was because it became abundantly clear both sides were unable to achieve their aims . By the end of the summer of 2014 it had became clear that at the present moment the Russian government had no ability to create a Russian state in the Ukrainian south and east and if such state were to be created it would probably collapse in less than a year taking the Russian government with it . By the end of the autumn of that same year it became clear the Ukrainian government could n't retake the areas the separatists already controlled because the Russian military would deploy their full forces if they tried ( and of course the gain from retaking those regions has always been questionable ) . & gt ; There are tons of operations done successfully but I think you are minimizing the situation . You 're right . Sorry for exaggerating . & gt ; 1 they do n't have the man power because of the reasons I stated to hold a full seige for an effective amount of time and still tend to all their fronts while maintaining multiple offensives . IS is fighting more opponents than the Syrian government , yet they somehow maintain the siege on Deir ez-Zor . & gt ; The second issue is that there is just to much lucrutive black market deals going on in Ghouta I 'm sure it is looked the other way because of the amount of money involved , difficulities combating the black market , corruption , and the need not to piss off his local population further . Ghouta need only be contained for now . Also I fail to see how failing to deal with a pocket that undoubtedly ties in a non-trivial amount of troops helps one to deal with his manpower shortages . Well , here it is . The Syrian government is not capable of conducting a siege because of it 's own corruption and incompetence . And pissing off the local population is no excuse . If they wanted they could have blocked all supplies apart from basic necessities . The rebels there would have still surrendered because of lack of munitions . You see my point is that the length and intensity of a conflict is rarely proportional to the skill with which it has been fought . In modern wars rarely drag on for very long unless the major adversaries in it fight in a defective manner . And there is much more military skill to be gained from fighting against skilled opponent with good soldiers and officers as compared to fighting against poor soldiers led by poor officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As of the US envoy , the one who should effectively counter treats of military nature against him are the local Kurdish warlords . With some luck IS could probably assemble diversionary groups of 30-50 men in Kurdish territory without being caught . Thus Defending an envoy against anything the IS could organize in the area around Kobani would probably require no less than 50 men in any case . Unless you have actual military deployed there of course . But 50 soldiers from special operations just protecting a guy is simply a waste of those men 's capabilities .

Though I still maintain that the main reason why Germany went to war was it 's obligations to Australia . & gt ; Oh and the text of the alliance mentions other great powers as well : It says that the parties should maintain benevolent neutrality in case one of them was attacked by a country different from Russia .

From what I gather the computer game `` King of Dragon Pass '' where the peasants could n't marry without the approval of the clan 's government is a pretty accurate representation of bronze age society . On the other hand once capital starts to accumulate the inherent limitations of collectivist systems become intolerable as wealth increases . Living in submission to a higher goal and forcing others to do so is not something most people would do if they did n't think it was needed for the good of the family/nation/race/humanity .

We 'd take the word of a businessman with a grain of salt if he 's talking about psychology , politics , military logistics or sociology and those contain a lot more useful information related to the running of a company than economics . The most successful guy in finance is Warren Buffet who advises to ignore all economic factors . In this case Mr. Thiel has completely failed to consider that businesses compete for investor 's money . No bank , nor fund , nor a rational person , will ever buy a 5 % bond over a 7 % one ( assuming both issues are equally sound ) . Nobody in their right mind would buy a share with P/E of 20 over a 10 ( assuming similar growth prospects/soundness of business ) . Businesses that fail to provide adequate return on investment wo n't be able to raise the money needed to keep up with the competition and would eventually be given over to some corporate raider to liquidate if that continues . Competition for customers will be moderated by competition for capital . This guarantees that capital gets accumulated and companies ( as well as investors ) have the money to innovate and try new things . As for Mr. Thiel 's Google example , I 'd seriously doubt Google feels secure in it 's place . This website we 're reading right now is apparently a replacement of something called Digg which lost it 's user base to Reddit in a matter of months . The collapse of MySpace was similarly swift .

Of course that ca n't continue forever . And when the system collapses the capital base would already be exhausted and unable to maintain the same quality of life as in the good old days , at least for a good while , even under a new system that does n't suffer from the contradictions of the old one . Thus Khrushchev could claim that his workers lived under comparable quality of life as people in the United States . By end of Brezhnev 's reign such claims no longer seemed plausible and by the time Gorbachev came into power it was clear to everyone that communism could n't last much longer . On the other hand leaders who put the expansion of the capital base before worker 's quality of life like Stalin often had reductions of quality of life so severe that they qualified as crimes against humanity .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Many regimes have been criticized for engaging in campaigns of brutal suppression against communists and communist sympathizers . From as far right as Chilean dictator Pinochet to as far left as the German social democrats , many regimes have found it necessary to suppress and sometimes even cull their communists , under the pretext that if communists were to take power many more would die . Among the left of center commentariat , the cruel logic behind such actions is either roundly criticized or outright rejected as intellectually dishonest and self serving . ( This in stark contrast to left wing governments which do quite often consider communists a grave danger to the interests of the working class . ) Yet there is one such regime seems to be largely forgotten . South Korean ( semi- ) autocrat Syngman Rhee suppressed communists with extreme prejudice , first sending them to gulags and then killing them when DPRK forces were about to liberate those camps . Estimates of the death toll put it at 100000 to 200000 . But we all know what he was fighting against . Even conservative estimates of state killings in North Korea are usually above 200000 for a mere decade or less . No one can deny that the South Korean proletariat lives much better than the workers in the North . Given all that , the question arises , as to your opinions on the actions of President Rhee . The Northern state is , from what I 've heard , not considered socialist , but rather closer to fascism . Yet it is certain that the Southern communists would have aided this fascist regime in its numerous attempts to conquer the peninsula . Reunification was , after all , one of the goals of the South Korean Workers Party . So was their destruction justified or not ? Or were those agents of fascism that marched under the red banner somehow different than the ones that marched under the swastika ? Perhaps one could argue that the amount of people killed was too large or that mass killing as a method is counter productive , but would n't that be a tacit admission that slaying South Korea 's communists would have been ethically sound and in the interests of the proletariat , if it were an effective suppression measure ? And if you were to say that Rhee 's actions were justified , questions arise about all those other regimes in the history of the world . Was Pinochet wrong ? Should the Social Democrats have murdered Rosa Luxembourg ? Was the CIA justified in overthrowing what could very well have been another fascist regime hiding under the red flag ? The CIA is a spy agency after all , they should recognize a fascist tendency in a government even before it is known to the general public , should n't they ?

A side effect of the First Past the Post system that the UK has is that party leaders are largely controlled by their parliamentary groups rather than the other way around . Any claim the Labour leader might claim on the right to set party policy would come from his election by the party 's membership .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Well , can a system always produce exactly as much as needed ? The answer should obviously be a `` No '' , you ca n't determine the needs of society with a high degree of accuracy without exactly foreseeing the cultural , political , scientific and ecological developments of the future . Thus we can assume that an economic system can only be designed so that it 's levels of production follow some probability distribution . But if the expected value of production is the exact amount society needs , you 'd suffer from occasional bouts of underproduction . It would mean that every crop blight starves some people . Thus in order to ensure that people are supplied with necessities a system should produce more than it needs . Hence why , for example every year the EU collects and throws away mountains of tomatoes . An argument could be made that luxuries are different , but the distinction between necessities and luxuries is rather arbitrary . Motor vehicles are vital necessities in some parts of the world and luxuries in others . There were points in history where a diet with enough calories to sustain an adult would be considered a luxury . So there 's an argument to be made about treating everything as a necessity , since misidentifying a necessity as luxury would have dire consequences , whereas misidentifying a luxury as a necessity is overall harmless .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

This suggests that males were not diverting resources towards females with whom they could potentially copulate on a short-term , and were therefore not exchanging meat for sex . Although males in the Ngogo community did share more with estrous than anestrous females given their proportional representation in hunting parties [ 14 ] , these sharing episodes did not confer males with immediate mating advantages over males who did not share meat with females ( Ngogo : [ 14 ] , Gombe : [ 20 ] ) . One important limitation of the above studies is that they have focused on short-term exchanges of meat for sex ( i.e . within the estrous phase of the female ) . Given that in this species dyads form long-lasting bonds [ 21 ] , and exchange services on a long-term basis [ 22 ] , it is plausible that exchanges of meat for sex could occur over a longer period of time than the estrous phase of a female .

( In fact it would mean that joint stock companies would dominate all sectors of the economy where output can be improved by injecting capital . ) I 'm sorry if any part of that was unclear . Also are you under the impression I somehow believe in socialism ? Sure , the question is addressed to socialists , but most other people who answer are n't socialists . Their answers are also missing what I believe is the key issue with cooperatives , namely what I tried to point out , so I felt compelled to add mine to theirs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Because firing 10 % of the workforce every time the cooperative has to take a controversial decision is a recipe for success .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"So , the majority decides , the minority accepts it . It does n't matter that they own a piece of every asset of the cooperative , so long as their opinion is unpopular enough , they ca n't protect themselves from losses in any way . It 's not like disagreeing with decisions made by the owners of a company , I do n't own any part of the company I work for and if I did I could sell it . I have no legitimate reason to care for the company I work for . My inability to liquidate my share of a cooperative without changing jobs , which is never an easy process , gives me reasons to care for it . Can you imagine how bad it 's going to be if the minority turns out to be right ? The grumbling , the `` I told you so '' , the hatred towards coworkers that have squandered a not insignificant part of the group 's wealth . Imagine the hatred you now see towards supporters of the current American president , only a thousand times worse and directed towards people you have to interact with every day . Even if the minority was dissuaded from a strike , management would have to convert the cooperative into a company in order to get people to talk to each other . The complete lack of liquidity of parts of a cooperative presents a great problem for the rights of minorities . There are a thousand ways in which the problem would express itself , which particular one is irrelevant . Unless somebody has discovered a reasonable solution for it vast sectors of the economy would be inaccessible to cooperatively governed organizations . The only solution I see is conversion to a joint stock company .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"I do n't think you understand . In a joint stock company I can increase or decrease the my ownership of the company for some money but most importantly *at no personal cost to myself* . In a cooperative I have to change jobs , which is *a significant disturbance to my life* . Saying workers should quit their jobs because they disagree with business decisions is like saying Americans should move to Canada if they disagree with political decisions . It 's just silly .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; you can quit and relinquish your share in a company and divorce yourself from all potential risk of a decision with without having to get another job first . Can I work permanently for the cooperative without owning a share or is it like giving my employer a 2 week notice ? & gt ; alright , so you 're a worker now in a capitalist business . a decision has to be made . your boss has full control , and makes a decision you hate , and your only options are to bend over and take it , or quit and go work somewhere else you think will have a boss that will make decisions for you that are more to your liking . So long as the decision is not about my compensation or work conditions , I do n't have to care . He could waste company money on crack for all I know , yet for me it does n't matter . Company money are his money not mine . Sure , if his decisions are utterly horrible at some point he will bankrupt the company and I 'd be out of a job , but my savings , be they in deposits or in stocks would still be there . As opposed to a high capex co-op where I 'd not only be out of a job but my net worth will also take a significant hit . Were Daimler a cooperative it 's workers would each own a share amounting to half a million euros . At that point the loss of the share of the company is going to be a lot more painful than the loss of the job . Edit : Added the example at the end .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; no So my point still stands , does n't it . I can get rid of my share only by suffering a great disturbance to my life . & gt ; it is your money when your employment stability depends on his successful management of the company . I doubt many people would willingly work for a boss that blows all the company money on crack . If he pays well , why not ? My employer 's shitty decisions only affect me if they are extremely shitty and even then I 'd usually have enough time to prepare if I could see it in advance . Since I do n't own any part of the company I 'm not going to loose anything , am I ? & gt ; yes , that 's how it works . if the profits are more socialized , so are the losses ( again , to a percentage that you agree to ) . you stand to gain a higher wage in a co-op , but this is balanced out by greater risk . So let me get this straight . I 'm in for a lot . In a hypothetical car manufacturing cooperative my share would be worth a few hundreds of thousands of dollars/euros . Yet all those money are at the complete mercy of the annual general meeting . I ca n't get those hundreds of thousands back without changing jobs . Those hundreds of thousands can become more or less , but there 's nothing I can do to protect myself from a change in their value . Do you not see the problems with that ? Do you think most working class folks would be OK with letting the majority do as they please with hundreds of thousands of their money ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; I like how you complain about your employment disruption disturbing your life , and then in the same breath say you do n't care if you lose your job as long as you got paid in that time . There 's a difference . If the policies of the American government are bad enough to cause a civil war , most Americans are going to try to emigrate . On the other hand nobody 's going to be emigrating because Trump is a president . Most people would are just nasty to his supporters . Is it that hard to see how the observable realities of Democracy translate to the Democratic Workplace ? & gt ; if that 's all that concerns you , you can still work for a co-op , get paid well , and quit before it starts struggling . it 'd be the same thing .

100100145,investing,"The general error of Keynes ' theory is something called the Lucas critique . The crux of it is that while 2 variables may be correlated , an economic policy that uses the knowledge of that correlation may destroy it in its attempts to exploit it . To quote Calaghan on the correlation between inflation and unemployment which is quite important in Keynes ' economics : & gt ; `` We used to think you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by boosting government spending , I tell you , in all candour that that option no longer exists . And in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion… by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step… ” In general people are n't stupid and if they figure out the government will raise inflation they are going to demand higher wages , making the inflation raise ineffective at lowering unemployment . Likewise any economic theory that does n't base it 's sweeping observations on the study of small scale economic interactions ca n't survive prolonged contact with reality . It should be obvious how Lucas ' critique lead to more advocacy for more laissez-faire . As 30 years of economic theory were proven to be wrong , lots of people thought that we do n't have good enough understanding of an economy to conduct beneficial government interventions . Who knows what would people be saying in 30 years about current theories , after all ? In the 80 's a lot of people soured on macroeconomic interventions ( basically spending money for the sake of spending money ) in favor of mircoeconomic ones ( privatizations , the less popular nationalizations , altering regulations and other stuff that affects specific sectors rather than the whole economy ) .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Calaghan ( hardly a proponent of laissez-faire ) admitting that this theory no longer works , I can give you the American [ misery index ] ( https : //inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/ ) .

Nobody watches the Fed raising inflation targets then goes to their boss and argues for higher wages . This is n't how the economy works . Nobody watches them **now** . These days inflation targets are low and boring . Thus under current FED policy we have a Philips Curve . When inflation targets were higher and more interesting workers and more importantly union bosses would actually start looking at them and the Philips Curve will disappear . And even if workers were illiterate brutes who could n't read the inflation targets , they 'd have to notice that prices are rising considerably and they can no longer afford to live as well as they did before .

Yet once you become morbidly obese you do start modifying your weight depending on your eating habits ( or you die young , I guess ) . And regardless , whether the Lucas Critique is right or wrong should n't affect the validity of naive Keynesian modelling . The empirical fact is that by the 1970s there was a general agreement that a number of correlations between variables which were observed before WW2 no longer held .

I meant giving me a link to something or at the very least the naming someone who has successfully applied the theory . & gt ; Yes , but the accuracy of an economic theory is not the only criterion by which the government uses it in some way . There are obvious reasons why a government in a capitalist society would not use Marxian economics to fuel its understanding of what is going on and make policy based on those insights . Whether government 's are naturally inclined or disinclined to choosing to listen to surplus value believers is irrelevant to my argument . My point is entirely based on what happens once a capitalist country acquires a government that is inclined to listen to surplus value believers . If surplus value offers special insight into the market economy it is reasonable to assume that they 'd do better than governments that listen to orthodox economists . If the contrary is true that 's evidence against surplus value , is it not ? & gt ; I think you and I have different criteria what determines the usefulness of a theory . Your criteria is narrow and predisposed to promoting ignorance , because it prematurely tosses aside a lot of things that may be true and can be useful for human development , but not immediately applicable in people 's direct lives . So , let me get this straight . Surplus value may be true . On the other hand if I ever behave as if it were true I will not gain anything and would likely bring harm to me and those around me .

Thus they probably wo n't act against him until defeat is imminent . Furthermore both Russia and Iran are likely to obstruct a removal of the President rather facilitate it . You see , war devastated Syria is likely to need a lot of money to recover from the war . Thus a different Syrian leader might succumb to the temptations of the famously wealthy land of the House of Saud and the practically limitless wealth of the free world . As for the terrorists , if the object of their hatred was removed and the policies that caused it were to stop , I think there is hope . If nothing else it will stop the number of terrorists from growing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , the government controls by far the largest share of Syria 's population , yet it suffers from a well pronounced lack of reliable soldiers . This would imply that most of the population in government controlled areas is hostile or at least unsupportive to it . By contrast both the various rebel militias and the Islamic State control very little population , but do n't seem to lack men willing to risk and even sacrifice their lives in the name of the faction that they join . I do think that strongly suggests both the various rebel groups and IS are more popular than the government . As for the rebels being split into a multitude of separate groups , each with its own political designs , I 'm want to remind you that the Solidarity Citizen 's Committee was a quite disorganized political group , that consisted of people with many different ideologies , united only by their desire to see the communists gone . It still won elections by a landslide . EDIT : Clarified some things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,I do n't think that many support the government 's enemies . They just could n't care less about a government that could n't care less about them .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't know . Should n't government soldiers believe they are fighting for their lives and families ? At least when they are fighting something like the Islamic State ? That should be a good motivation . Furthermore the Nazi Volkssturm never had problems with making heroic last stands . The Red army never had problems fighting in far worse conditions and with far worse survival rate than the government 's troops now . And in the first world War nobody had problems recruiting pilots in spite of the ridiculously low life expectancy . I do believe people in general are quite willing to sacrifice their lives for their countries , it 's just that nobody would want to sacrifice himself on the altar of his superiors ' incompetence . Thus I strongly suspect if the commander in chief of the SAA was someone people believed in , the government 's manpower/soldier quality issues would go away . They control by far the largest share of the country 's population , surely they would be capable of finding enough decent soldiers . Edit : Fixed some unclear stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , as to the point about about islamism see my other reply to that other post . History is full of examples of men throwing away their lives for secular causes with the same lack of concern for themselves as suicide bombers . All that is needed is a cause soldiers would believe in and trust in their high command . Those things are , I think we can both agree , severely lacking in Syria , and nobody is going to really support a government he mistrusts . And if a government is going to allow corruption and nepotism to propagate in something as critical to its survival as the military , do n't you think the other spheres of government activity would be affected as well ? How do you think a corrupt and incompetent police , secret police , agricultural authority , industrial regulator , health services , regional authorities , etc . would affect civilian morale ? & gt ; EDIT : to be honest I had no idea what the solidarity citizens committee was , but a quick wikipedia read mentioned that the committee did n't even last a year ? That is precisely where I was going . Even if separate groups have different ideologies , they can be very popular together when they defend a common popular cause . I do n't think most people that support JaN would go home , if the group were destroyed . They would just join another one . Thus it is not meaningless to talk about support for the rebels , in spite of the fact that `` rebels '' is a category rather than a coherent group . Edit : I 'm bad at grammar .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It seems it is necessary to repeat myself . They `` fight '' for the government because they were forced to . SAA conscripts are directly forced into the armed forces .

If you live in a relatively safe area and join the NDF , you 'd be patrolling the streets , rather than dying on some distant front . I do n't think we have any reason to believe NDF members are more committed to fighting for the government than the SAA 's rank and file . As far as I can see , they get routed just as easily . And further while the rate of defections might have slowed , I do n't think the rate of desertion has slowed down significantly . Furthermore , seeing how the armed forces have recently suffered a rout on 2 separate fronts , I do n't really see any indication that the government 's soldiers , both SAA and NDF , are willing to fight and risk death in the name of the president .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"For one you could make sure that everybody hears about the intervention . That way when IS or JaN suffers a defeat , it could lead to terror attacks in Russia .

Interesting perspective and also probably correct to a significant degree , though I do think there is some evidence to suggest that it is not the main reason for the whole affair . For example Putin would have never used term Novorussia unless he was preparing for conquest . And Alexander Dugin 's infamous textbook for the Russian Geneal Staff Academy advocates the destruction of Ukraine trough splitting the country , as well as the style of warfare that is now often called `` hybrid '' .

Back then their commanders did show the same lack of regard for the lives of the men under their command that the SAA is known for . While I do n't doubt the Iranian armed forces are much better than the Syrian , I suspect it might not be because they lack the problems the SAA suffers from , but because they have them but to a far , far lesser degree .

100100145,syriancivilwar,Couter attacks are costly though . And as far as I remember the disaster in the southern Idlib region began as a counter offensive to recapture Idlib city .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Since the rebels have n't taken the road trough some kind of lighting offensive and since holding is probably preferable to retaking , I 'd guess if they were to take the road they would have to defeat the reserves in Aleppo either way . Apart from that both of Assad 's firefighters , Hassan and Zahreddine are currently busy , it 'll be a while till the road is recaptured . And if the rebels are smart enough the couter offensive could be extremely costly , when it finally comes . Edit : I really should n't write long posts from my phone .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , after going through quite a few pro-Iranian , pro-Syrian administrations the Lebanese state is now weak and corrupt , allowing for Hezbollah to flourish . After the al-Maliki 's administration , which was quite friendly to Iran , Iraq ended up with an army that ca n't fight . And lo and behold , Iran-backed shia militias are coming to the rescue . Do you see the pattern ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,V. Yankovic was democratically elected to be Ukrainian president it is not like Russia has chosen him to be the president there . Surely he must have represented his people 's interest not the Russian government 's .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I was n't thinking about the association agreements as much as the utterly outrageous way Yankovic treated his generals . And even in that regard your arguments do n't hold up . Yes sure , he wanted to save government finances . Which were in the state they were in because he , unlike the `` corrupt oligarch '' , had a mansion half the size of Malta .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , I doubt any government with Hezbollah in it will try to strengthen the LAF . And further considering how Hezbollah treats its political opponents , its only a matter of time before they start arming themselves , leading to a most unpleasant sequence of events . As for Iraq , I feel Maliki 's ousting had far more to do with his extreme military failure . Calls for his removal were first issued in Iraq and then echoed in Iran as it became obvious he could n't remain a prime minister . To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders , but then again Yankovic did n't follow Russian orders either . Instead his associates describe Moscow 's men making their way to his inner circle , driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him . Or it could be something even more innocent , like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him . Maybe he did n't even think about the way his presidency would affect Iraq , though I still think Iranian foreign policy strategist are n't that foolish .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,It 's not like Saddam 's army was that great either . And yes the Iraqi government was literally bankrolled and armed by the coalition . Then relations with the coalition broke down .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,If some foreign force appears to save the government are we sure this is going to be the conclusion rather than an interlude ? Iraqi militiamen probably wo n't stay in Syria for the years of counterinsurgency that are likely to follow .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"200,000 Syrians are in the army . How many of them fight and how many desert at the first opportunity is debatable . Furthermore , for the survival of the government , the reality is that numbers are going to mean far less than actual military effectiveness and many around here would cast doubt in government victory even if the government had not 200 000 , but 300 000 men at it 's command ( assuming foreign support were withdrawn ) . So , as you can see even those arguments , that you think are totally unreasonable , might be based on a reasonable line of logic . How correct that line of logic is , can usually be discovered trough an inquiry into it by a critical mind . So please , if you believe that somebody is making an incorrect argument , ask him about it . That way you can persuade not only yourself , but also a reader in his or her incorrectness and perhaps even learn something from him , regardless of whether he is correct or not . I assume you are n't here just to broadcast your beliefs , while failing to persuade anybody in them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , the question is , why would IS try prevent the army from reaching Palmyra ? The area around the city is mostly open desert , where they would be at a major disadvantage , against a conventional army with airplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war . If they are smart , they are going to fight only in the city itself . And unfortunately IS commanders do n't strike me as particularly inept .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , `` state terrorism '' exists as a term . Whether the government engages in it , if it does to what degree , and how important is it for the government are all open to debate . And I do n't think the view that state terror is critical for the survival of the government , or at least the government in its present form , is absolutely devoid of arguments in its favor . Again , it could be wrong , but it ca n't be just be dismissed , it has to be proven wrong . Furthermore , if someone makes an argument that seems to you weird , bizarre or totally wrong , ask him about it . If his position is totally without merit , this shall become self-evident . If it 's not at least you are n't going to look like a someone , so lacking confidence in his views , that he 'd rather not debate opposing ones .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"From what I 've seen , my impression is that IS never really tries to defend what they ca n't defend . Rather , to keep the narrative , when they loose something important , they quickly capture something else instead . For example their force in Tikrit did n't seem to me as one built to repel the Iraqi forces converging on the city , but rather as one built to delay them . Yet after they lost Tikrit they captured Ramadi and Palmyra , and thus the narrative was kept intact . Now I think they have some chance of defending the city , so they will try to defend it . Also one should keep in mind that though IS 's lack of concern about it 's soldiers ' lives makes it seem otherwise , the organization is quite flexible strategically , thus meaning a general rule about what they do ca n't be true all the time .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed it did n't . My point is not that the lack of defensible terrain around the city makes it easier to defend . After all common sense dictates rather the opposite is true . I instead claim that , because of the terrain any attacker would be capable of reaching the city , since the defender 's best strategy would be not to resist an offensive to a significant degree , until the city itself . So IS 's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself . This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed . Thus being 3.5 km away from the city does n't mean much . The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided . As I mentioned so far it proceeds as SAA planers would want ( and expect ) it to proceed , yet it probably proceeds as IS planners would expect it to , as well . Edit : Fixed the repetition in the last sentence .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , keep in mind that the strategy I described would have been adopted ( if indeed this is the actual strategy of the IS ) because coalition air power would mean IS would not be able to use large concentrations of troops in battle . Also as far as I remember the Ramadi attack was supported by an impressive number of VBIEDs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If it was a dune or a hill , would n't they be spotted by aerial reconnaissance ? EDIT : And further I 've always assumed such a large number of men would , when moving , scatter reconnaissance vehicles around , so as to avoid an ambush of the whole force . EDIT : a word .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , looking at the Donbass war , I feel like every Ukrainian or separatist brigade and artillery battery has like 10 drones with it , most of them bought by fundraisers , so they ca n't be that expensive . And even if aerial reconnaissance is out of the question , would n't ground based one work as well ? I assume a group large enough to capture tens of soldiers would be large enough to be visible .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see , you are right . I still do n't see why the SAA does n't use more drones , since they seem quite an artillery heavy military , though I suspect that this question belongs to a dumb question thread more than it belongs here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't see how a guy 's beliefs damage his credibility . Who is to say it 's not his experience in the air force that turned him against the government ? And Assad could n't have lasted so long if he did n't have the support of some parts of Syria 's population . Yet there would be no civil war , especially a civil war as brutal as this one , if he was n't utterly hated by another part . Almost by necessity those 2 parts of the population must have been treated in a vastly different manner . And need I mention , there have been very few Alawi rebels . Edit : And on the point of Assad lasting so long , I do n't have to remind you how long the apartheid regime lasted with practically no support from the black majority .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well my reasoning was that ATGMs would be a new threat that the SAA has never faced before , while an ambush is amongst the oldest tricks in the book . So assuming SAA commanders are inflexible embodiments of bureaucratic inertia , they would follow their tactical manuals , which would account for the possibility of ambush . And no , you did n't sound mean .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Thank you .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"But is n't the forcing a retreat ( or making the enemy unable to resist the offensive in some other way ) part the one that consumes the most time and effort ?

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Yeah there is . Counter-propaganda . All it would take is one tech-savvy guy with a laptop connecting to some wifi in Olgino and spamming a few hundreds/thousands searches for `` reddit '' . It would n't take too much of an effort really , seeing how Reddit is not terribly popular in Russia anyway - even /russia has only 16,497 followers . Generally , english language social websistes are incomparably less popular that domestic ( russian ) alternatives , such as vk.com to facebook Not really . Google does tend to notice attempts at manipulation does it not . It 's not like advertisers do n't try to manipulate google to make their products look more popular .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Those are two different things . You are probably thinking about manipulating adsense ads or something . You ca n't have it both ways - paid trolls operating from a office in Olgino boosting the ranking of a search term , and discounting the option of someone doing counter propaganda from the same area . All I 'm saying is that if google data was manipulated , it would probably require a greater level of sophistication than some guy with a laptop running some kind of script . It is reasonable to assume it would require the kind of internet service used by a medium sized or maybe large business for example . At this point you begin to wonder whether the whole effort do discredit Russia is n't too risky and too costly to be really worth it . & gt ; If paid trolls do exist , I would tend to argue that both sides cancel each other out . Not really , the ones with more resources at their disposal would be more noticeable , would n't they ? And considering that Russia is known to spend much more money on propaganda than Western countries ( There are no less than 20 national TV channels in Russia controlled by the government . ) , I 'd say Russian ones are quite likely to amongst the best funded out there , would n't you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Why not ? It 's supposedly an organisation that houses hundreds of people , is it not ? It 's not like someone would go to Olgino and hire hundreds of people in a plot to discredit Russia . & gt ; Nah . Search queries are not bandwidth intensive , on the contrary . Still , I assume you are going to need some amount other traffic in order to impersonate a lot of people . And the question remains , why has n't the Russian government or anyone in Russia uncovered this plot to discredit the country . You 'd expect they 'd someone in their security services to uncover such a needlessly complex and expensive plot to discredit their already unpopular country . & gt ; As I have shown , western trolling campaign is being conducted even by the official military units . Knowing the huge discrepancy between Russian and western military budgets it is the West that has the upper hand by a wide margin . Once again , even the Russian military puts much more importance on propaganda than western military . The Russian defence military has it 's own television channel . Neither the American nor British not French military have the same thing . It is reasonable to assume that those that put great importance on propaganda , will spend much more on it , compared to those that value it far less . & gt ; Also besides direct media ownership you should be counting in the the myriad of non-governmental organizations and projects funded by the West , as it is a form of propaganda as well . The propaganda value of an NGO is extremely questionable . The propaganda value of a TV channel is not .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I do n't think that impersonating an organisation with hundreds of people on its payroll is a simple task . It would require an effort large enough to be noticed . And it that is what had really happened , at least someone in Russia would have noticed . Since plotting to make it look like the Russian government hires internet trolls ( trough some company in St. Peter in that case ) is a plot to discredit Russia , regardless of what you say , someone in the Russian counter-intelligence would have done something about it . And once again , there is no reason why anyone in the west spend so much effort , and risk so much on a harebrained plot to discredit Russia . It 's already a highly unpopular country in most of the world . Most of the countries where Russia is popular are autocracies or oligarchies anyway , and popular opinion in those kinds of countries does n't really matter . And there is nothing you can say to convince me , or most reasonable people at that , that the country where the government controls 20 TV channels , including most of the major ones , spends less on propaganda than countries where most TV channels are private . The american military might have made a game , or hired a sports team , the Russian military , apart from maintaining the TV channel I mentioned , organises massive annual parades , and events like Tank Biathlons , designed to promote it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As far as I can remember , the Houthis have been loosing territory and cities , have they not ? & gt ; What is more likely to happen , even if KSA really starts shipping in heavy weapons , is that RuAF will simply have a more target rich environment . Because Russian airplanes are practically invincible to air defense , are they not ?

If NATO countries do nothing in a war between Russia and Turkey ( so long as the war escalates to the point where Russia counterattacks on Turkish soil ) , do n't you think that every headline of every newspaper in the western world would consist of nothing but sardonic puns on `` Peace of our time '' ? Let us be honest here , the only reason why we have n't seen a major western military engagement recently is because the Western world has so far been , strategically , on the offensive ( an extremely imprecise term , but unfortunately I can think of no better ) , in both Syria and Ukraine , with all of Russia 's recent actions being a reaction against pro-Russian governments collapsing or being at risk of collapse .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Here are the main problems with that . In order to achieve a lasting peace , the current Syrian government ( or any Syrian government that has come as the result of a `` reform '' of the present one ) would need large scale , persistent economic and military aid , provided over an exceedingly long period of time . Thus if FSA commanders have any reason to doubt that foreign support for the government will continue for the next say 10 years of conflict and recovery they are better of continuing their resistance . Throwing one 's lot with Bashar , a peacetime leader whose only major achievement is plunging his country in a civil war and a wartime leader under whose command the Army has required persistently larger foreign support , is just too risky . To put it simply , supporting the current Syrian government is to bet your and your family 's life on Iran , and now Russia being always there to help the Syrian army . As a corollary to that the Al-Nursa Front is far more valuable of an ally . While outside governments dislike that organization , it does n't depend on the fickle support of foreigners for its continued existence . Finally , there is no reason why the Coalition should support the Syrian government . The word terrorists does not make all the major rules of strategy and policy invalid . As of now Russia , Iran and Hezbollah are fighting those terrorists . Since the coalition governments consider Russia , Iran and Hezbollah enemies and in case of the last one terrorists , there is no reason why the coalition should try to end the fight between their major enemies . It is far better to let them fight each other and sap each other 's strength . And that 's ignoring that most coalition governments would be highly reluctant to have an ally as flawed as the Syrian Arab Republic .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

It 's strategic position just outside of the Iron curtain and non-affiliation with the USSR made Yugoslavia very interesting to the US which gave it billions in aid . Later on , when Yugoslavia eased up on it 's emigration policies , a lot of people emigrated to Western Europe ( mainly W.Germany and Switzerland ) , US/Canada and Australia/NZ . They sent money to their families back home which boosted 'domestic ' income and thus Yugoslavia 's GDP .

Popular among couples with children that just want to unwind and not do anything for a week . If you 're worried that you wo n't find a place to stay in Dubrovnik , Split or Zagreb , do n't be . Even if there 's no room in the hostels you can find a room or an apartment to rent ( you 'll see people on the bus terminal with 'apartments ' and 'rooms ' signs ) . Or you can check couchsurfing or airbnb options . But let 's consider the worst case scenario of even those failing ( and that 's very very unlikely ) I would suggest looking for places to stay just outside the cities ( Podstrana and Kaštela oustide Split , Mokošica outside Dubrovnik ; no need for Zagreb , it 's big and not as popular so chances of not finding a place to stay are practically nonexistent ) . That way you can just sleep and shower there and still spend your time in the cities .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Or you could look for something in Meje . That 's considered to be a 'fancy ' part of the town , located on the foot of the Marjan hill . Bačvice is a part of town that 's practically in the center and close to the beach so you might check that out as well . Anyway , [ here ] ( http : //www.gohome.hr/nekretnine.aspx ? q=najam % 20stana % 20u % 20splitu % 20do % 202000 % 20eura ) is an aggregate search of apartments in Split up to 2000€/mo .

2ntle,travel,"I 'm going to try to make an list of places that have all the stuff you mentioned that you enjoy . However , you might run into crowds , since there are a lot of people that enjoy those things as well : D Zagreb - in contrast to ancient history shared by many coastal towns , Zagreb 's is more medieval . It 's similar to Prague and Budapest in that regard . It 's not so crowded in the summer . Has lots of museums . Has a nice vista overlooking the city . Trogir - a small town near Split , really pretty and historic . Not really must-see but it 's near Split so it 's convenient . Plus , by being so underrated it 's not so crowded . It 's connected to island of Čiovo where you can find some nice beaches to unwind . Split - has an ancient Roman palace , museums and galleries . Nice vista from Marjan hill overlooking the city . The beaches in the city are okay , but the main ones are likely to be crowded . The nice , more secluded ones are usually known only to the locals . Split is a port to the ferry that will take you to Hvar - both town of Hvar and Stari Grad on island of Hvar are worth visiting . They have their bit of history ( Stari Grad is the oldest town in Croatia , dating back to ancient Greece ) , nature and good beaches . Dubrovnik - beautiful town with lots of ancient as well as recent history . Has a great view from the hill outside the town ( you can get up there by a cable car ) . Downside is that is probably the busiest town on the coast , especially if you have the 'luck ' of visiting on the same day as three cruise ships . Still worth the visit , though .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I believe that Split merits a visit , however , it does tend to get somewhat crowded since there are tourists that are there to see Split and others that are there to catch a ferry for the islands or a bus further down south .

If they could run a story on the charity and give some info to locals about orange hooded people on the roads you might have a easier time getting rides ( esp . seeing that there will be almost 400 of you here ) .

That would be the bus that does n't take the motorway but state roads instead . If you take a route that looks something like Zagreb - Plitvice Lakes - Zadar - Šibenik - Split you should cover the scenery and the other cities part . The trip back , from Split up north is practically the same , so you can split the stuff you want to see between coming and going . There are a couple of other national parks on the way like Krka and Brijuni so if nature floats your boat give them a go ( even if it does n't , you 'll be here for 2 weeks , you have to pass the time somehow ) . Other than that , the usual touristy stuff you 'll find in the cities and maybe some hiking , kayaking , whitewater rafting , biking , etc . Note that 15 days in Croatia , especially if Split is as far south as you 'll go , is plenty , so there are n't any must-see things 'cause you 'll see everything there is to see .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Your schedule is tight but not necessarily too tight . If you keep on track and stay organized you should n't have any problems . Try to make both Kotor and Mostar work if you can . Kotor for beautiful scenic drive and Mostar for history and culture . But , if you really ca n't , then scrap Kotor since it 's in the opposite direction . You can , however , skip Vis . It 's a long ferry ride from Split and it 's a more of a relaxing , tranquil kind of place with nothing really to see . Bring the car with you to Hvar . That way you 'll be able to easily see both Hvar and Stari Grad and check out lavender fields more inland on your own . Unless you 're Scandinavian and used to swimming in frozen lakes you 'll find the water too cold . Maybe if the weather is really warm that week give it a go in Rovinj . The water currents are weaker up north making the sea a bit warmer . Although Plitvice are becoming hugely popular , I do n't think you really need to spend the night there . Yes , there 'll probably be lots of tourists but nowhere near as in mid July so you 'll have no problem going around and seeing everything . It 's a 3 hour trip from Split so if you get up a bit earlier you can get there early enough . While Rovinj is said by many to be the most beautiful town on the coast it 's also , as Vis , more of a unwind type of place so I suggest you use it as a base for trips to other Istrian towns and maybe a trip to the wine country inland .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,travel,"I was going to say that 5 nights in Hvar is a bit too much , but I saw your explanation and that 's good enough for me . However , I really do n't know what do you plan on doing in Makarska for 2 nights , if you 're using Hvar for your chilling back and relaxation needs . Makarska is basically a place that attracts two types of tourists : a ) families with children that just want to unplug for a week and do nothing , and b ) day trippers from the surrounding area , mostly BiH . As for seeing or doing anything there really is n't anything there . So your options there are literally a ) go to the beach and b ) go to a different beach .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Hmm , the coastal part of the country between Split and Dubrovnik is filled with towns and villages similar to Makarska - lots of nice beaches and apartments and rooms for rent , but lacking in anything that would be considered an activity . There 's a catamaran connecting Hvar and Korčula ( I guess that 's how you 're planning on getting to Dubrovnik , there 's no ferry from Hvar to there ) . So maybe stop there on your way down . Korčula has more to offer than Makarska ( it 's allegedly the birthplace of Marco Polo ) but it 's not extremely popular so you wo n't be caught in a crowd like you 'll likely to be in Dubrovnik .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Yeah , that be a great idea , Plitvice Lakes definitely merit a visit . Zadar is a bit closer to them so you might want to squeeze them in in the beginning , before heading down to Split .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Korčula is somewhat less popular than Hvar so it 'll be emptier , but I 'm not sure will it be empty . Both islands have historical sights to check out . Hvar is more known for it 's lavander and nightlife . Korčula ( and the peninsula connecting it with land ) are know for their wine so choose accordingly . I 'd say that at least one of them merits a visit , but if your schedule is tight and you ca n't make it then I guess you 'll have to leave them for the next visit here : )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"You can take the state roads in one direction and the motorway in the other . That way you can enjoy the scenery the state road has to offer ( especially the Split-Dubrovnik part ) and save some money on tolls . It will take longer , however . I 'd say , and that 's being as unbiased as I can , that there 's as much to do and see in Split as there 's in Dubrovnik . People that say otherwise usually fall into one of these categories a ) have only been to one of the two or b ) have n't been to either one . But I wo n't press you on this one , you can do your own research . Dubrovnik is more popular with tourists because it 's more , well , touristy . Everything is laid out for you and all you have to do is to follow your tour guide . As opposed to Split where I had a tourist ask me 'where 's that palace ' while being inside it . If you do decide to stay in Split for more than a few hours make sure that the place you 'll be sleeping at provides a parking space . As velynasha said , parking in Split can get a bit tricky , especially downtown , so if your accommodations are n't in the center leave your car there and walk and/or use public transportation to go sightseeing . Come on you Gooners",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Dubrovnik is easy , as in there 's only so much you can do there so you probably wo n't miss anything . I do n't know when you 're coming or what are your interests so I 'll try to keep it as general as possible . Things to do in Dubrovnik : Wander around the old town . Get lost in the small alleys . Push through the crowds ( Dubrovnik is 1 ) the most popular tourist destination in Croatia and 2 ) a stop on almost all Mediterranean cruises so it tends to get really busy ) . Take a walk around on top of the old city walls . Take a GoT tour ( Although I do n't know if they 're worth the money . You should employ some Google Fu to find some reviews . ) Take the cable car ( or drive ) up the hill overlooking the town for a fantastic view . Explore museums , galleries , restaurants . Make sure you 've exchanged enough Kunas for souvenirs . That pretty much covers Dubrovnik . Things to do in Split : The ancient Roman palace is a great place to get lost exploring , even if you 're local . People still live in it so it does n't have that 'museum-y ' feel to it . You can basically be looking at a 1700 year old ruin , turn around a corner and find yourself in someones back yard . So that 's neat . Check out museums and galleries if that 's what you 're into . Check out the palace basements where one part of the Split Got filming took place . I 'm not sure if there are any organized Got tours in Split , but even if there are I do n't think they 're worth the money , you can check out everything on your own . Take a stroll up the Marjan hill for a great view of Split . Check out some of the restaurants ( there are a lot of great reviews online ) . Grab a drink in the evening in one of the numerous bars in the palace and mingle with the locals and other tourists . Drive up to Klis Fort where the other part of the GoT filming took place plus enjoy a really breathtaking view of Split , the islands and surrounding area . Take a day trip to Hvar if you can squeeze it in . If you 're coming here in the summer : Check out Bačvice beach which becomes a party zone in the evening . It gets crowded during the day with beach-goers . There are other okay beaches in Split , but for really good ones you need to go outside the city . Luckily you 'll have a car . I would recommend somewhere south of Omiš ( probably an hour drive in summer traffic ) . There are good beaches in small villages in that area , just follow the southbound road . You can go kayaking in Split and whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Omiš . Probably other similar activities are available that I do n't know about , Google should know better . About the border checkpoint between Croatia and B & amp ; H on the Split - Dubrovnik route , there really is n't much to it . The Bosnians often are n't even there . Usually it 's just a quick passport check , you wo n't even need to get out of the car .

Forget about the trains , they are less comfortable ( inter-city type ) and slower than buses and only go as south as Split . If you do decide to rent you 'll be able to make stop along the way in other towns and national parks so that has it 's pros . If you want to take the slower , scenic route do n't take the motorway . However , keep in mind that finding a parking space in the ( relative ) center of Dubrovnik and especially Split can be either expensive or a pain in the ass . In the end make a decision based on your budget . If you can afford to rent then , by all means , go for it .

2ntle,travel,"Some Croatia advice . The weather is usually nice in May but either way a week is enough to check out big ( ger ) cities and wonder a bit off the beaten path . Note that my suggestions could differ a bit from any other you may get here . That 's because May is still kinda 'off-season ' in Croatia so I took that into consideration . Seeing that you 're coming in from Italy and continuing on to Hungary , my suggested itinerary would look something like : * Istria ( Pula , Rovinj ) - cultural sightseeing . One day for both but if you 're stretched you can scrape Rovinj . It 's a nice quaint town but I found it as a unwind and relax kind of place , plus it could be dead in May so skip it if you do n't have the time . Pula is worth a visit , if only for the ancient Roman amphitheater . * Plitvice Lakes National Park - kick ass NP , basically the most universal suggestion ( besides Dubrovnik ) that anyone will give you about visiting Croatia * Zadar - a day or two . You might even come here before visiting Plitvice and using it as a base of sorts . Kornati NP is also nearby so check out if you find it worth visiting . Also Krka NP is en route when you continue down south so if that nature stuff floats your boat give it a shot . * Split - two to three days . Seeing that it 's May Split will be the liveliest city on the coast . Use the time for sightseeing and getting shitfaced . Split is also a bus and ferry hub for that part of the country so it 's convenient for island hopping and taking day trips to nearby places ( e.g . Trogir for culture/sightseeing or Omiš for whitewater rafting/rock climbing/paragliding ) . Island ( and town ) of Hvar is also advised . It 's famous for it 's nightlife but it could be dead in May . However it warrants at least a day visit . * Dubrovnik - two days . The most popular town on the coast . King 's Landing from GoT , yadda yadda , anyways you 'll want to visit . If you can squeeze it in ( ha ) go for a day trip to Mostar ( Bosnia ) . * Zagreb - two days .

There are other National Parks in the general vicinity ( that 's where Zadar as a base really kicks in ) . Google around for NPs : Krka , Paklenica and Kornati . Krka is the most similar to Plitvice , while Kornati is an archipelago of small islands . For scenery and old towns stick to the coast . Since you 're on a itinerary the bigger ones like Zadar , Šibenik , Split and Dubrovnik should do you just fine . Maybe throw Trogir into the mix if you find the time .

This is one of those things that 's not easily translatable and which you mostly pick up through immersion . Croatian uses `` na '' ( which would translate to `` on ( top ) '' in English ) when talking about sea , rivers , lakes , etc in similar instances . So , you would say `` Putujem na more '' ( I 'm travelling to the sea ) . `` Putujem na moru '' is still awkward as `` putujem '' would n't be used in this case but `` plovim '' ( sailing ) would . So `` Plovim na moru '' would be I 'm sailing on the sea . Commonly used is also `` Plovim po moru '' which would be more like `` I 'm sailing across the sea '' but not literally across . I 'd say that `` Plovim na moru '' gives emphasis to the sea while `` plovim po moru '' gives emphasis to the sailing . Hope this helps ! Feel free to ask anything else ! P.S . there are instances where you would use `` u more '' , but just not with `` travel '' . The most common one is `` Idem u more !

2ntle,soccer,"[ First Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=da_sLKLV97M ) [ Second Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ZjufkPw2wTE ) 1414 days have passed since the last Hajduk 's win over Dinamo on their own pitch . The tradition was broken by a unlikely hero - the 18 year old midfielder Mario Pašalić scored twice to bring Hajduk just 1 point behind Dinamo and keep the battle for the top going . The Croatian Derby welcomed two very different teams . Dinamo , reigning and 8 times consecutive champion with a healthy budget and new foreign players brought to qualify for yet another CL . They were knocked out in the playoff by Austria Vienna which cost the coach Krunoslav Jurčić his job . The new/old coach became Branko Ivanković , hoping his third run with Dinamo would be the charm . Hajduk , on the other hand , is on the verge of bankruptcy . The city of Split , their main shareholder , ca n't financially support the club anymore and are actively looking for buyers to take over . Accordingly , Hajduk 's squad is filled with youngsters , most of them with hardly any first league experience . The coach is Igor Tudor , former Juventus and Croatia NT CB , whose only prior experience was coaching Hajduk 's U19 team , where he got to know most of the players he 's managing now . The match was a classic Hajduk - Dinamo clash , with aggression , pace and hard challenges . The more experienced and individually better Dinamo side dominated the first half , bringing the ball in the final third with ease but lacked any creativity in front of the goal . Hajduk 's defense was under constant pressure , trying to close down Dinamo 's pacey wingers El Soudani and Fernandes . The half time score was 0-0 , but Hajduk 's game did n't give their fans much hope for the second half . However , the Split side came out of the locker rooms more energetic and filled with vigor . Although inferior to Dinamo , they seemed to want the win more than their counterparts from Zagreb . Their attitude was awarded in the 49th minute when the 18 year old youngster Mario Pašalić craftily converted a corner swung in by debutant Haris Bukva . The goal did n't seem to wake up Dinamo and their pale approach was punished after another corner in 69th minute . Same assistant , same scorer . The remainder of the match offered nothing of note . Dinamo still looked like they do n't really want to be there while Hajduk neatly defended and waited out the clock . The win brought Hajduk to 1 point behind Dinamo and keeps the dreams of bringing home the title alive in Split , although the young and inexperienced side will face many challenges throughout the season . [ I shoud point out ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3RluzYlZUBs ) the great atmosphere [ during the match ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h3C9bZPiUhY ) . The 25,000 strong crowd carried the youngsters during the whole 90 minutes and rewarding them for the hard-fought and well deserved win .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

What I 'm wondering **is minimum wage livable on ? ** And I mean livable , not survivable . So , to take the most expensive example , if were to live in a small apartment in Dublin by myself , would min . wage cover rent , food , utilities and transportation while leaving me with a *reasonable* discretionary fund for gym , clothes , entertainment , etc. ? 2 . This one is a bit more subjective . I have a masters degree in finance with no related work experience . **How likely am I to find a job in that field ? ** And it does n't even have to be strictly in finance , any business/econ type jobs work as well .

Another difference is that with soft tips you do n't have to worry about the angle of the dart in the board ( wondering will the one under the T20 cover the bed with the flight ) as soft tips stick perpendicular to the board . As far as the gameplay goes , some dislike the 'plastic ' sound instead of the cork 'thud ' , melodies and flashy lights .

People that do n't have any major sports team near by will support their local school teams 'cause they 're accessible and can more easily identify with them on a local/state/regional basis . When you add the factor that school teams are basically the only options for kids to train a given sport ( as far as I understand , there are no off-school football , soccer , etc . teams where a kid could just show up and sign up ) , these teams are practically mini academies for those kids where they pick up necessary skills to develop their talent . In the end , I do n't think that MLS will ever get the status among the fans in as the other leagues have around the world . People there do n't have a long tradition playing/watching soccer and more importantly , they have choices . Like a lot of them . So I think it will always be a 'niche ' sport , which does n't have to be that bad , 'cause a niche in such a big country can still be pretty huge . US soccer is rapidly moving forward , but it will be more noticeable via their NT and players in Europe than by MLS .

They accept and I keep it as a part of my demesne or give it to some of my kin ( the end result tends to be the same ) . I go for the next Muslim county , rinse and repeat . Then I see that my reputation is all of the sudden 'tarnished ' , but I do n't think of it that much because my vassals are still loyal . Then , let 's say , a new vassal ruler really does n't like me for my traits and he 's my rival . His loyalty has a negative trend . I 'm like 'Meh , if he revolts I 'll just send the army in , take the title back and give it to some one else ' . It happens exactly like that . Now I have a 'bad ' reputation . I conquer some more heathens . My reputation is now 'very bad ' . When I hover over the loyalty percentage over any vassal I see that the negative impact of my reputation is growing . Many more vassals are starting to revolt , and to emphasize since that 's the point of my question , practically only because of my bad reputation , and I have no idea how it got that bad ( I mean I know it 's from taking all those titles , but I have n't usurped them , I gained them through war/vassalization ) . So for example , a vassal is my son ( positive loyalty from family ties and succession order ) , is my friend ( another plus something % ) , likes my traits , scrutage , etc. , but ALL of that is n't enough to balance out the negative impact of my reputation ( it got to -10 % loyalty at one point ) . Same goes for my courtiers , my stewards have been know to get so disloyal that they robbed me blind and my martials fled from battle . That 's pretty much it . I do n't know am I going the wrong way obtaining these lands ( I thought that usurping them would be the shady thing to do , and I really do n't do I 'cause there has n't been a need for it yet ) , or is there something other messing with my reputation . I ca n't see what could it be , seeing how it does n't drop when I just stay put and do n't conquer heathens or when I let vassals go when they rebel . Appreciate the help ! P.S . Ca n't tell if my English is leaving something suspended in translation , I 'll try to explain it better if it 's the case",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Parts of the body mostly targeted in football are basically the most vulnerable ones : lower legs , ankles and feet . And while they 're not so graphic , they are serious and very painful - ruptured muscles , sprains and torn ligaments . Plus , you have to take into consideration that rugby players are much more physically fit to compensate for the 'contact-ness ' of the sport , but you ca n't buff out your feet and ankles .

Although I do n't have specific info you 're looking for , like the Plitvice camp one , I can give you some general transportation info : * If you do n't have/qualify for some kind of discount , avoid using the train . It 's slow , uncomfortable ( except for the overnight one ) and overall not very cost-effective . Seeing how you ca n't get to Dubrovnik with it ( the southernmost stop is Split ) , the bus is your best bet . It 'll cost you roughly the same as the train , it will be more comfortable and faster and you 'll have a great view from Split to Dubrovnik ( make sure you sit on the right side going to Dubrovnik or left coming back ) * As far as accommodation goes , the cheapest way is sleeping in hostels . For the best deal look into reserving them early . Google it up for best deals you can find . If you 're going to stick to your itinerary , you should reserve 3 nights in Split ( as it 's a hub for Dubrovnik and Hvar ) and 2 nights in Šibenik ( it 's closer to Plitvice lakes ) * Since you have n't told us where you 're arriving from , I 'll take a shot in the dark assuming you 'll be coming in from the north ( Zagreb ) , so correct me if I 'm wrong and I 'll update you : Bus from Zagreb to Šibenik is around 150 HRK ( ~20€ ) ; from Šibenik to Split 60 HRK ( ~8€ ) ; from Split to Dubrovnik 100 HRK ( ~13€ ) .

It looks like we could see the same scenario this transfer window again , but as Tottenham wo n't play in the UCL next season and could use the money , they 'll probably let him go .

2ntle,soccer,"sorry , no links , but as someone who 's been involved in football for all of my life , here goes : there 's no termination fee in a standard contract . so , in your exapmle , the club could keep him til the end of the contract . but that 's , as I said , in a standard contract . the better/more famous player is , he and his agent can negotiate better terms . some players have 'transfer clauses ' , for example , if the clause is 5 mil € then the club has to let the player negotiate a transfer with any club that offers a minimum 5 mil € ( Hulk had such clause at Porto for 100 mil € , but that was just a 'hands off ' signal for other clubs , they let him go to Chelsea for far less then that ) . some players have relegation clauses , saying that they 're free to leave the club if they 're relegated to a lower division ( this one is much more widespread ) . basically , it 's up to the player and his agent to negotiate as good of a deal as they can . in your expamle , the club can hold the player to the end of the contract , but clubs rarely keep disgruntled players on the squad and pay their salary just to have them mope around , so they usually agree to put them on a transfer list . however , if the club is n't respecting the terms of the contract ( usually regarding salary ) then the player can sue the club to the FA or FIFA and will usually get such contract terminated ( meaning he becomes a free player ) and the club still has to pay him what they owe . you wo n't find many links about this stuff as it 's a matter of a private contract and they do n't really let them go public . hope this helps a bit",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

As far as coaching goes , here in Europe national football associations have coaching academies ( and you need to have a degree to coach a higher division club ) so if the USSF has it 's own academy ( or wherever you 're from ) you should really look into it . As far as experience goes , your best bet is to go to your local clubs and asking youth coaches to let you assist ( you 'll be doing this for free and just to gain some experience , noone is going to pay you at this point ) . From there on it 's only up to how much do you want it . Your lack of a professional playing career is certainly a drawback , but you can definitely overcome it with hard work .

2ntle,Darts,"I 'll try to give you some answers , other redditors will surely chip in to fill the gaps I leave : 1 . My favorite practicing game is Split score . It 's somewhat easier to play on soft tip boards since they automatically count score , but it 's not any more difficult to count as any other game on a steel tip board . Here 's how it goes : Each player starts with 40 points . Each round you shoot a different number , in order : 13 , 14 , 15 , any double , 15 , 16 , 17 , any triple , 18 , 19 , 20 , bull ( 25 and 50 both count ) . Only darts in the designated number count , e.g . in second round if you hit two darts in 14 and one in 11 you only get 28 points . The twist is if you miss all three darts your overall score is halved ( you round up for odd numbers ) . The game is fun and can be pretty even matched even if the players are n't on a similar playing level since halving your score makes it easier for a weaker player to catch up to you . Also , you practice cricket numbers ( which is good since you 're playing in a cricket league ) plus doubles and triples . Other popular games are Around the world , Shanghai , etc . which other redditors can give you more info on . 2 . General consensus is that you should stick with whatever works for you . That , however , does n't mean there are n't any steps to improve your game . Check out /r/flightschool ( althought it 's a bit dead ) or google Flight School and join up . Its creator George Silberzahn provides some great tips and practicing routines . Other , more general advice is the usual - keep your body steady and move only your arm , follow through , focus on your target , etc . 3 . Yeah , substantial pointing in cricket is considered poor sportsmanship . Now , what 's the threshold ? Well , that 's kinda subjective and different people may give you different opinions on it . My rule of thumb is that if my opponent ca n't catch up to me with 3 darts , any additional scoring is unnecessary . In friendly bar games where nothing is on the line , I usually score just enough to have more points than my opponent ; sometimes not even that .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

If you have a little extra money , paying a tutor for weekly lessons might help with motivation too ( partially because the financial commitment tends to be a good motivator ) , but it is n't strictly necessary .

It seems morally repugnant to help such a person - why should the taxpayer pay a probable criminal for their inconvenience ? However , there are a some obvious corollary cases that you do n't mention . What about a case where reasonable suspicion is established at arrest , but in trial innocence is determined beyond a reasonable doubt ? If you assert that an individual is undeserving of compensation because , although there was n't enough evidence for a conviction , it can be rationally believed that guilt is very likely , then what of the certainly innocent ? What about the probably innocent ? Why is it also acceptable to inconvenience them ? If you frame the problem not by individual cases , but statistically over many cases , could facts from this perspective sway your opinion one way or the other ? If the statistics showed that 9000 out of 10000 people acquitted were determined to be more likely innocent than not , would that be enough that you 'd be comfortable awarding them all compensation ? 9500 ? 7000 ? 2000 ? Another angle . You are given four proposals : that the state provide 1 ) no compensation in the case of reasonable suspicion at time of arrest ; 2 ) compensation equivalent the pay given jurors ; 3 ) a flat compensation per day tied to the minimum living wage that year , regardless of income ; and 4 ) a tax rebate as compensation . Would you consider only the first of these fair ? Would you suggest a fifth alternative ? Yet another consideration : suppose a person is either actually innocent or actually guilty of a concrete crime . You only know how likely a person is to fall into one of these categories . Do you feel comfortable inconveniencing a person , perhaps significantly , when your certainty is n't very high because it 's cheaper to do so ? What about discrepancies in who bears the burden of accusation ? It 's easy to demonstrate that some races bear much more of the burden than others , for example , as do certain socio-economic classes . Given that the burden is significantly unevenly borne by some , is fulfilling a social contract for order really a good enough justification ?

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"I ’ d been talking with people I didn ’ t know In the park the other day , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove . The sky was solid gray , And we were talking about all the ways The world could be better . One woman said , “ It gets complicated , “ Taking value at its face . “ You ’ d think value was something obvious , ” Her hands were all over the place . She gestured left , then right , then left , And with frustration in her face , She sighed , “ The obvious “ Is the source of all confusion. ” Later that day , I was walking around By the pen where they keep the Bison And struck up with a rough looking man Built like Mike Tyson With a scar right down his neck , But a disarming grin . “ If you take all the little things that pile up around , “ Each little things weighs nothing at all , ” Like grains of sand ? “ Yeah , but take “ Every grain of sand on the beach in your hand , “ And you ’ ve got a problem. ” We shot shit for a good long while , Until that gray turned into graphite , And we said goodbye and walked away Into the almost night . I shivered . Left my coat somewhere , But damn , I couldn ’ t remember . Then I ran into this dude who smelled Like a broken sewer main . He offered his coat and asked for a buck , I said no , but all the same We got to talking , and for a while It felt like eternity went by . But before I escaped something happened , And his visage grew profound , Like his dirty hair was glowing From the inner peace he ’ d found , and then I remembered something dumb I had done Just a couple hours back , And in the darkening night , Not feeling quite right , I tried to stumble back To the place that I ’ d come from , But I couldn ’ t remember . I swear then I saw a pippala tree With a man lying down beneath , Who exuded grace and rainbows In his final dying breath , As he said , “ Every gear in this grand design “ Will fail and be replaced . “ Be the masters of your own machines , “ And find your special place. ” That ’ s the last thing I remember Before waking in my bed . Still don ’ t know how I got back here Or what else that prophet said . I know that trip was worth it , But the message isn ’ t clear . Good thing at least some images Didn ’ t disappear . I ’ ll talk with people I don ’ t know In the park today , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove , The sky a solid gray , And we will talk about all the ways The world could be better .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"The poem like all other art 's a thing unclassifiable Except , of course , to classifiers . That 's just undeniable . And I 'm a classifier , and a critic , and scientist - That 's why I ’ ve put in verse a mostly rhyming taxonomic list Of all the different ways in which a poem can be terrible , And as I share these ways with you I hope it will be bearable Because , in making such a list , I may have inadvertently Created an example of a terrible soliloquy . Now , to the strictest pedant , all the ways there are are very few , Since they would say that anything is bad if you believe that ’ s true . But if we all can just agree that mode of thought ’ s erroneous We can be less postmodern and considerably less onerous . The first flaw that I can ’ t abide is formal inconsistency , Which demonstrates no forethought , or no technical ability . Sure , poems can be good and have a Leaves-of-Grass-like laxity But usually it ’ s laziness , and not poetic strategy . Now , meter - that ’ s another thing about which I ’ m a strident prude . To mix an iamb with a trochee strikes me as extremely rude ! When poets flub the rhythm like a junior high school marching band I think they should be shot , or sent a sternly worded reprimand . And why is so much poetry so bland and unoriginal ? These heartfelt bleeding notes are often trite , clichéd and pitiful . Why must there be so many little replicas of Kanye West ? Such badly phrased confessionals would better be left unconfessed . But worst of all is poetry that rests itself on cleverness Without anything meaningful to say .

3w4v,linguistics,"Lojban is not what you imagine . The language is alien in the sense that it 's grammar is n't based on that of existing languages , but the grammar is both regular ( no exceptions ) and simple ( not many rules ) . The vocabulary is drawn from `` Mandarin , English , Russian , Hindi , Spanish , and Arabic , weighted according to the numbers of speakers , and using a phoneme-matching algorithm to assign words with the highest figures of merit relative to the six languages. '' [ [ source ] ] ( https : //mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi ) . This has the effect of making speakers of those languages , Mandarin and English especially , recognize many of the words once they get a hang of the phonetic rules . It 's also not too hard to pronounce by design . Lojban has 6 vowels and 17 consonants , picked to be distinct and allowing for some phonemic variation so people coming from different primary languages wo n't have a hard time pronouncing the words . Lojban has many interesting features that are n't very robotic . Emotion particles come to mind - simple words you can add to a sentence to let people know how you feel or how you feel about something . Another is evidential indicators , which let you concisely explain how you know something ; this lets you easily distinguish between knowing something from personal experience , vaguely remembering something , knowing something second-hand , or knowing something without evidence but with conviction .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alternative , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ?

3w4v,haskell,"I 'm a little surprised no one has mentioned Go . At OSCON this year I heard about quite a few companies that were happy with Go for large projects . Praise included the relatively small language size , ease in training new hires , good community , and excellent selection of libraries . I think it would meet all of your requirements . I 'll second Rust , but it 's a new and immature language - the community is great , but libraries are n't comprehensive yet , and idioms in the language are likely to change significantly over the next few years . It also does n't have as much industry use yet . Python is another solid , pragmatic choice , and it may serve you particularly well depending on your interests . Look at popular Python libraries and see if any of them catch your eye . It also has the best language learning resources of the three , so that 's a major plus . **EDIT : ** To keep things to the point , my number one recommendation for the original poster is Python based on their interests , professional utility , and availability of learning resources . But since there was such an ambivalent reaction to Go here ( with respect to voting - the comments have been more \*ahem\* _uniform_ ) I think a few things need to be said . Firstly , all of the criticisms made here are valid _on the level at which they criticize the language_ . But the comments , in my opinion , largely miss the point on other levels . Go might be good language to learn for a person who has only been seriously programming for nine months _and_ only deeply exposed to Haskell for several reasons . It 's important to understand that the Haskell community is an echo chamber for certain - correct , according to us - points of view . As an aspiring programmer , it 's worthwhile to be exposed to communities with different points of view and different priorities , and we should put at least some trust in the ability of a student to eventually , with experience , form their own informed opinions . Another pedagogical point : our concerns as more experienced programmers are not all the same as those of someone who has only really been programming for less than a year . Comments like `` There 's nothing you would learn from Go '' lack perspective ; the familiar ideas Go contains are the best ideas from several generations of languages , and for a new learner some of those ideas are still unfamiliar . And the specification of the language is short , which is another big win for a learner . Then there 's the straightforward tooling and a set of solid open source projects to look to for for architectural guidance . Remember , this is the _second_ language OP might be learning , not the last . You can move from Go to C easily , or with Go and Haskell you can pick up Python as the third language , or C # , or C++ ... as a student , half a year of Go programming might lead to a better jumping-off point career-wise and intellectually than many of you are acknowledging .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,skeptic,"There are a few words in in this conversation that are confusing readers . To understand why I 'd reject what you say , we need to be clear about what you 're claiming and what I reject , so let 's work from those confusing words . & amp ; nbsp ; The first confusing word is _science_ , which is confusing because it 's polysemous . _Science_ in the current context may reasonably refer to : 1 . The _scientific method_ - A set of iterative , observation-based techniques for acquiring and updating beliefs ; 2 . _Scientific practice_ - The activities scientists actually engage in to arrive at beliefs , usually ( but not always ) by application of the scientific method ; 3 . _Scientific knowledge_ - The body of beliefs generally accepted by the scientific community , usually ( but not always ) arrived at by scientific practice . Scientific knowledge _is_ a set of beliefs . But , to pin the conversation down , we seem to be talking about the scientific method . & amp ; nbsp ; The second confusion occurs between a pair of similar verbs , _to believe_ and _to believe in_ . The verbs _to believe_ and _to believe in_ are used to convey different meanings . Commonly ( unfortunately , not consistently ) : - _To believe_ refers to a truth value judgement ( _I believe the mailman 's name is Frank_ ) . - _To believe in_ may refer to a higher-order belief , that is , a belief about a belief . This `` believing in '' can get complicated and often conceals some vagueness when you think about it more carefully . ( _I believe in the power of love , _ but usually not _I believe in the mailman , Frank._ ) There are people that _believe in_ the scientific method in the same nebulous sense that people _believe in_ karma or a higher purpose or the power of love . However , it is sufficient to believe that the scientific method satisfies certain information gathering properties ( properties that , not coincidentally , are falsifiable ) for a rational person to continue using and propagating the scientific method . No `` believing in '' is necessary at this level , except insofar as it is implied by believing that the scientific method has certain well specified properties . There are beliefs that are so fundamental as to be axiomatic ( `` I exist '' , `` there exists a fundamental reality '' , `` I have some information-preserving relationship with that fundamental reality '' , `` fundamental reality has non-random structure '' ) . There is no logical basis for truth-value determination of these `` reality axioms . '' There 's no way to test them , even in principle . Arguably , metaphysical naturalists _believe in_ these axioms as well as believing them . But these beliefs are lower-level than science in any of its senses . & amp ; nbsp ; The last confusion is around the phrase _a matter of faith_ . The classification _a matter of faith_ is being used to establish an equivalence between beliefs which I do n't think is justified , or perhaps is too vaguely specified . Stepping back to low-level beliefs , I 'd argue that accepting the reality axioms is n't a matter of faith - at least , not in the same sense that accepting divine revelation is a matter of faith ( I assume belief in divine revelation is a belief that mental forces , not reducible to natural forces and elementary particles , exist and do communicate with people to inform their beliefs about reality , and that this information is reliable in some sense ) . When I accept the reality axioms , there are different processes going on than what go on when I accept divine revelation . Defining _a matter of faith_ to include both not only stretches common usage , it also leaves a big bag of interesting processes that contribute to the acceptance of esoteric and religious beliefs either undescribed , or implies those processes are happening where they are n't . And that brings us back to the scientific method : the information-gathering efficacy of the scientific method is a consequence of these more fundamental reality axioms holding . So it 's not a matter of faith either , or even a consequence of faith . It follows from the derivability of the scientific method from the reality axioms that coherent rejections of the scientific method necessarily either involve rejecting some of those reality axioms , which can get weird , or adding new axioms , which is problematic for a slew of reasons . I 'm glossing over these arguments , but I think you get the picture . & amp ; nbsp ; I have n't presented a full argument , but I think this makes it clear what an argument against classifying the trustworthiness of the scientific method and the trustworthiness of divine revelation as both being matters of faith looks like . Ultimately , the conditions under which they both are matters of faith requires making `` faith '' mean something other than what `` faith '' is generally understood to mean or usefully defined as . There is something going on in accepting the axioms of reality , but it needs to be described separately . It is n't the same class of phenomenon .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

That said , here 's how I would approach your issue if it were me : **TL ; DR** You should n't feel bad because you are asking for help with a problem . That 's normal and fine and okay ! Keeping your problem , your desired outcome , and proposed solution separate in your discussion will probably make things clearer to you . By involving your partner in the discussion , you 'll feel less guilt because you wo n't be prescribing a course of action but collaborating on the health of you and your relationship . Describe your problem and desired outcome first , and let your partner suggest a solution before you suggest yours in order to get a less pre-filtered opinion and gauge his feelings . Decide what to do after that . But definitely do n't feel guilty for asking him to participate . **Long Version** You have a problem , a causal hypothesis , and a proposed solution . You also have an implied desired outcome . The thing you seem to feel guilty about is the solution part . Some or all of this analysis may seem obvious . If so , great . & gt ; I 've been really struggling with my fear and anxiety about being left behind or abandoned [ ... ] Your problem is that you are experiencing abandonment anxiety , or , to be specific , the symptoms you are bundling under this label . This is the first thing you should discuss with your partner and his wife , if you have n't already . You also have a desired outcome , which you stated as `` build [ ing ] our foundation stronger '' , but that 's more of a solution . Your real desired outcome is to experience less anxiety . & gt ; [ ... ] which is connected to an anxiety problem and a recent dip in mental health . You attribute that anxiety to two factors . The first is a change in your underlying mental health , which implies that you have experienced/are experiencing other symptoms that suggest this is the case . Your intuition about this is probably right . I 'm assuming that you are taking steps to work on this issue on your own . The second is a change in the relationship dynamic . It 's a safe bet that your abandonment issues are linked to this . However , it may be worth exploring exactly what changes have happened - is it just that he 's dating , or have other habits changed as well ? You also believe this change is a problem _because of_ the first issue . Although this seems like a reasonable assumption , it 's not the only possibility . How true this is may influence how effective a given solution is for you . In any case , you should always be sceptical of your assumptions about hidden causes , and focus more on observed effects . When evaluating solutions , a solution that will work _without assuming a cause_ is more robust . & gt ; I wanted to ask him to for a month , at most , to not pursue any new romantic relationships [ ... ] so I can examine what is bothering me and work on healthy techniques for being both a good girlfriend and a good participant in a poly relationship . This is your proposed solution ( I 'm sure you have a lot of details here you 're leaving out ) . You probably feel guilty because your solution involves a restriction on your partner , and you might be forcing or manipulating your partner into doing something he is n't comfortable with . I think you can feel less guilty by viewing this not as a final and inflexible prescription , but as a possible solution you thought up that might help you . You do n't have to feel guilty about trying to solve your problem ! You also should keep in mind that you have to trust in your partner 's agency . As long as your request is a request and not an ultimatum , your partner deserves to be able to choose to help you in this way . However , it is problematic that you are framing the conversation as the acceptance or rejection of a fully-formed proposal . Although your solution seems reasonable , the sort of solution you might come to after a discussion with your partner , it is n't the only solution . You need feedback from your partner before you can know what parameters to flex , or even if it your proposal makes sense . Maybe allow your partner ( maybe his wife too ) to propose solutions himself before you prime him with your own . Maybe his proposal will be similar to yours . Maybe it 'll be something you had n't considered . In any case , it will help you take his feelings into account . Notice the assumptions your proposal makes , though , and weigh this idea against other options that are slightly or very different . If you think you 've already done this , do it again anyway - cognitive researchers have documented that subjects almost always attach themselves to the first solution they come up with and justify its merits after the fact , so you have to spend at least some effort in trying to correct for that tendency . What are you asking him to stop doing _exactly_ ? Date , or date without your involvement ? Is there some other behavior change on his or your part that would also help ? Why a month at most ? Is it because you 're making some assumptions about his needs and feelings ? Do you already know what steps you 'll take to work on yourself and think that 's the amount of time you need ? Have you explored options that might feel uncomfortable , like breaking up and being on your own for a while ( remember , you do n't actually have to _do_ things just because you think about them ) ? Also take time to explore different rough outcomes of that month ( or whatever time period ) - your problem improves a lot , it improves a little , it stays the same , it gets worse - and what that would mean your next steps would be . It may lead you to change your strategy . Maybe `` that thing I 'd do next '' is what you should start with in the first place .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

I see the big hype fizzling in less than a decade before its life as usual , with the exception of better funding for astronomy programs . Major religions would adopt official stances on alien intelligence , many opting for flat denial , and otherwise remain unchanged except for a few new cults . Suppose the data could be interpreted as something intriguing , however - images or sound files showing aliens and their culture . Everything is much more unstable in such a case , but in some ways it would look similar . Religious opinions could be much more divisive , since denial would be a more radical and visible stance .

Next time you go and film an event , try and put some more effort into the interviews . Prepare questions before hand and ask questions as they come to mind . Interview each other and interview strangers both before and after the event . You can even do audio only interviews with a digital audio recorder and use that material over the footage . On that note , the audio of the event itself is probably more interesting than the music you picked . The in-camera mic is n't that great , especially in windy conditions , but even an inexpensive audio recorder with a sock will give you usable audio . Speaking of the music , you do n't need to be such a slave to the music in your editing . The footage is what 's interesting . Maybe pick shorter clips of music , mixed in with the original audio , so that you do n't feel the film has to be the same length as the track , or ditch the music entirely .

It has been complained about and there have been problems with this before , usually by experts , but reform has n't ever gotten public momentum . The NSA should change its policy for several reasons . One of them mentioned in the petition ( which by the way had an 800 character limit ) is that the release of these theorems and algorithms benefits academia and industry . Another argument is that broad classification is *bad* for national security . Those for which an application has not been found are especially ripe for exploration in the open sphere - and the argument that they should all be automatically labelled dangerous until proven harmless is itself dangerous . Duplicate discoveries by the agencies of other governments , also kept secret , may put our government and industry at risk for cryptographic attack . Transparency on cryptographic vulnerabilities ultimately leads to higher security . Another argument is that the NSA is losing some potential talent because there is no guarantee of recognition outside the agency . That 's not everything , and there are compelling arguments from the other side . But it is my ultimate belief that some moderate change in policy is good for national security , industry , and the scientific endeavour , and that it currently is n't on the agenda because the public does n't think about these issues very much and math does n't tend to capture the public imagination often more than anything else .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Talk about the philosophy of science , talk about humanist ethics , and do n't be afraid to admit that some people who believe in god ( s ) or consider themselves religious may in fact agree with most of these points and can be potential allies . Be open and accepting of members with different beliefs . We had a girl who said she was a conservative Christian but came to our meetings for several months , respected our rules , and asked questions when she was confused . Another member identified as a pagan for the first year she attended the group but later said that after thinking about it a lot she could n't believe in the supernatural anymore . We did n't compromise on our principles , but we spent very little time religion bashing , and that the environment was positive enough that these people felt comfortable enough with being there I think was an indication of some success on our part . That said , you should be clear that Freethought is a way of thinking about the world , and certain types of arguments should n't be taking place in your club . After a couple of visits which were very unproductive from pastors and religious zealots , our club implemented a blanket rule against Theological arguments or arguments from scriptural authority . It helped , especially when we explained why we had such a rule ( we have n't accepted the premises that would make such arguments valid yet ) . **EDIT** Our group also became part of the Secular Student Alliance .

The reporting is disrespectful to atheists , but for a subtle reason . It 's silly to claim his views of religion were completely unrelated to the incident and should be totally left out . That he was an atheist is linked to the fact that he was an anti-theist and a part of what led to the conflict . What the reporting failed to do was provide appropriate context for that fact . We 're probably pissed because the article is written in a way that , for a person with anti-atheist sentiments , it can easily be interpreted to confirm and solidify their preexisting biases without even having reading the article ; that his atheism is mentioned in the subtitle and the first sentence is inappropriate emphasis .

3w4v,FutureWhatIf,"Things would have to change drastically for that to happen , so let 's play out a scenario that causes it . Another economic crisis catapults a radicalized Svoboda and a new ultra-right party from the industrial , Russian speaking East to take over from Party of Regions dominance and create a new dichotomous party system . Svoboda pushes for a 'purely Ukrainian Ukraine ' policy that more aggressively targets the Ukrainian central dialects ( Surzhik ) for extinction and tries to place anti-Russian language laws on the books throughout the country . Russian language books are burned in some places . The attacks are clearly on not only the Russian language but also Russian ethnicity . The new right party moves for Eastern succession . Let the West rot in Europe - Crimea and the East will become their own state , possibly vying for annexation by the Russian Federation . In the East Ukrainian language textbooks are thrown out of school windows in retaliation . Meanwhile the economic crisis worsens , and as each side blames the other secession by the East and South becomes a serious political platform . At the same time pro-EU sentiments grow and lead to an election cycle dominated by right-wing Western politicians . In retaliation to the election , Crimea holds it 's own internal election and votes to secede , declaring Crimea a fully autonomous republic allied with Russia . Eastern attempts at secession are more mixed , and lead to skirmishes and conflicts . Local terrorism targets Ukranian law enforcement being ported form the West to `` keep the peace '' in the Eastern oblasts . With Crimea no longer voting , the votes swing to the West . The violence in the East mostly calms , but Ukrainian national identity is deeply wounded . Unlikely scenario , but I reached to make it happen .

3Fyr,skyrim,"[ Video1 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=btOb2XqnNTw ) We ’ re starting the new year with a all-new Skyrim modding interview . This time around we ’ re talking to Will Willson , part of the Dark Creations team . A post-grad student in the UK , Will is an integral part of DC ’ s ambitious project known as “ Beyond Skyrim ” . What ’ s the mod all about ? Find out below… **Can you give a general overview of Beyond Skyrim and where the mod project currently stands ? ** Beyond Skyrim is a series of interlinking mods which will ultimately allow players to visit other areas of Tamriel within the Skyrim engine . Assets for each new region are being painstakingly created from scratch , including architecture , creatures , weapons , landscapes , textures and objects created by our artists and modelers . We pride ourselves on our fidelity to Elder Scrolls lore , and our ultimate aim is to create a player experience which will fit together seamlessly with Skyrim itself , allowing players to continue their existing character ’ s adventures in other lands , or perhaps even sidestep Skyrim ’ s story entirely and experience what the rest of Tamriel has to offer . [ Image1 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uVzSmEa.jpg ) We have made three years of progress towards this goal , though of course there remain many challenges ahead . When we started back in 2011 , we had little more than ideas and determination . While similar mods had been conceptualized and even released for previous Elder Scrolls games , we ’ re in uncharted territory for Skyrim . As we move into 2015 , we have built up a well-developed and cohesive community dedicated to our goals , in which our veteran members can actively train newcomers and continue to grow the project . Both our technical and artistic foundations are now firm and we are working hard to implement the quests , characters and stories that will bring this expanding world to life . **The project seems pretty ambitious… how much time is being put into the project ? ** It ’ s difficult to give a precise estimate , since our community depends entirely on volunteers working in their free time , which is of course a variable commodity . As a result of this a degree of membership “ cycling ” is necessary , as different individuals become able to contribute more or less , depending on their other commitments . At the last count , Beyond Skyrim had more than 50 active members , although the amount of hours each of those can contribute will continuously change based on their personal circumstances . Some members can work only a few hours a week , while others put in almost as much time as a job . At a minimum , thousands of hours have collectively been put into the project so far . We ’ ve become increasingly adept at managing and coordinating a highly flexible membership base . It ’ s necessary to break down some tasks like landscaping regions into smaller units , which can be worked on by individuals as they become available . We ’ ve found that taking many very small steps produces the most consistent rate of progress overall . **On your FAQ , you mention the project includes several modding teams – care to give any shoutouts ? ** The two largest groups within Beyond Skyrim are currently the teams working on Cyrodiil and High Rock . They are the oldest and most developed of the projects , and the closest to producing release-quality content . Cyrodiil in particular has gained a reputation for attracting high-caliber 3D artists eager to create their own interpretations of classic locations from Oblivion , some of which will be centre stage in what is likely to be the first Beyond Skyrim release : the region containing the Cyrodiilic city of Bruma . [ Image2 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Hrfeq1v.png ) Although much remains to be done on the asset front for High Rock , it has made great strides in landscaping , and is within sight of completing our first pass for the entire landmass of the Province . I think that it ’ s safe to say that many of the hardest challenges for both these projects have now been passed ( which of course isn ’ t to say there aren ’ t more still ahead ) . We also have teams working on Hammerfell , Morrowind and various other smaller projects , although they are currently at a less advanced stage of development . But progress has accelerated recently and we can expect to hear much more from them in the coming months . [ Image3 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/6CrDLFP.jpg ) As for individual members , there are too many , contributing in too many ways , to mention them all . But there are a few I would like to single out , not simply for their own work , but for their dedication to raising the bar of quality of Beyond Skyrim as a whole . In the field of 3D art , I should draw attention to Markus Liberty , who has constantly set new standards for himself in making architectural models , and inspired others to produce assets to match this quality . [ Image4 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/cYaHaek.jpg ) Among landscapers , we are greatly indebted to Wellpapp , not only for his phenomenal output but also for his generosity in sharing his hard-won expertise with multiple projects . [ Image5 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ZNRW8u8.jpg ) And on the soundtrack front , mention must be made of Xae and Guin , our two Lead Composers , who have forever raised our expectations for the original soundtracks that will accompany our project .

3Fyr,skyrim,"**With The Elder Scrolls Online having a more sweeping look at all of Tamriel , have you been taking any inspiration from the game for the modding project ? ** ESO has of course been a big inspiration to our project , since it filled in a lot of gaps which had previously existed in the lore . However , much of this has taken the form of backstory and helping inform the history of the regions we are making . After all , there is a gap of more than a millennium between the events of ESO and Skyrim , and cultures rarely stay static for long . There ’ s also the fact that ESO uses a different map scale to Skyrim , so we ’ ve had to be selective about what we can include . Many of our locations will take a look at the after-effects of the stories within ESO rather than directly reproducing them as they appeared in ESO . [ Image6 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/2lvKSQ9.jpg ) We ’ ve been having a lot of fun imagining ways in which the stories and characters of ESO have faded into legend with the passage of time . How biased local historians have converted the complex 2nd Era politics into fables about good and evil . Or how quests performed in ESO have cast long shadows over the intervening years that the player never intended . Skyrim players won ’ t need to have played ESO ( or Oblivion or Daggerfall for that matter ) to understand the events of Beyond Skyrim , but there will be plenty of nods and references which veterans of those games will recognize . **What other modding projects have you worked on ? ** I first caught the Elder Scrolls modding bug when contributing as a writer to Tamriel Rebuilt in 2008 . After that , I became involved in the still-ongoing Black Marsh project for Elder Scrolls 4 , where I soon found that my main talents lay more in administration . Since the Dark Creations website was founded in 2011 I ’ ve been involved in the running of the site and helping a great variety of Skyrim modding projects organize their hosting and forums . **What ’ s been your biggest challenge to date with the project ? ** Beyond Skyrim ’ s biggest challenge was , hands down , the creation of our Tamriel topographical map . This has formed the basis for the height maps on which all of our projects are built . Nothing else would have been possible without it , and it ’ s the hardest thing we ’ ve ever had to do . Although there were plenty of sources to draw on , even before the release of ESO , such as the in-game maps from Elder Scrolls II-IV — these were produced to fit wildly different scales and graphics . And of course , we wanted the end product to look as realistic as possible , which meant all the LOD at the borders joining up seamlessly . [ Image7 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/SmMHSZX.jpg ) Integrating all that information from different sources , and trying to deduce what all the rest of Tamriel would “ really ” look like at Skyrim ’ s scale , was both a technical and artistic mountain to climb . It meant figuring out ways to circumvent the hardcoded limits to the distances the game engine could render , and spending hours poring over the most obscure of Elder Scrolls lore references for clues about the landscape . On both of these fronts , we ’ re deeply indebted to a man known to us only by his username of Morcroft Darkes , who was responsible for many of the technical breakthroughs ( as well as the hard slog ) that made the final map possible . **Anything else you ’ d like to share ? New screenshots , trailers , etc ? ** Our most recent trailer ( shown at the top ) was created as a celebration of our third anniversary since the founding of Beyond Skyrim . It shows a selection of our landscapes and locations from across Tamriel , from the moors and citadels of High Rock , to the swamps of the Nibenay Valley in Cyrodiil , as well as glimpses of more exotic locations such as the Alik ’ r Desert in Hammerfell and the far eastern island nation of Roscrea . It also features footage of some of the new creatures that were custom made for Beyond Skyrim in action . A second trailer which we have also released recently , takes a more in-depth look at Country Bruma , the northernmost region of Cyrodiil , which is our current priority candidate for the first Beyond Skyrim release : [ Video2 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c2XsmMeCS9g ) And last but not least , here are a selection of screenshots from our cutting edge work on new regions : [ Album ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/oVHhH # 0 ) **Thanks for the interview ! **",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"If I can add anything about the song - this is n't a - so to say - 'killer ' song , or single , but maybe it should n't be ? It feels to me as this is the song that describes a moment when The Robot With Human Hair was born . The series always focused on problems - Robot always had it hard fitting with people due to his various problems . In part 2 he does n't gratuate high school . In par 2 1/2 he discovers and becomes addicted to sex . In parts 3-4 he struggles with drugs . This song , in my opinion shows how young and naive young people can be , thinking they do n't want the boring life , they want to have it all and wo n't miss anything . He 's talking how he is some kind of leader , as if he found the better way to live and he 's on the 'outside ' when they are on the 'inside ' - he is living the life of pleasures while they 're living boring , normal lives and he 's sure that his way is the better one and others will follow him . The song starts with the main protagonist reassuring himself that he should n't feel bad because it was in a way 'destined ' for him to live this life . The second Tilian verse feels like he 's breaking ties with those who would advise him to not do the things he wants to do . ( Like parents ) About the Mess first verse : Brain = Robot wang , he makes choices and thinks with his craving , no rational thinking involved . The onther line says that the protagonist wants to just fulfill his craving for sex . About I-8764 - when searched online , I-8764 will give you photos of particular wedding dress model , but it may be completely wrong . But these line mean that the protagonist does n't look at his girl/girls as a life companion , just rather as a person he has sex with and does n't have any feelings for her . Tilian 's second verse talks about how he devalues love as not something that the protagonist shares with one particular person , because he looks `` pathetic '' this way . Instead , he just feels addicted to feeling love , through sex f.e . The protagonist starts `` drinking the love '' , getting it no matter from whom or how . He feels like a savage , going from girl to girl and obtaining their 'love ' from them . He 's addicted , he wants all these thing and the WILL have these things . Jon Mess ' lyrics end it all with showing that protagonist knows how people think about him , how they say that his life is hedonistic , and he just does n't care about that and wants to corrupt those people instead by `` making them kiss their sistas '' . All in all , I think it 's a song about young people who get the wrong take on life and fall into their vices , thinking that that 's the way the life should be experienced . In whole , I think this song should n't be treated as some radio single , but rather as a fan-service for the fans that explains a little bit , gives context to the whole series of the songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"My thoughts exactly , I was pumped for the rest of the episode because I totally was n't expecting that ( I support Gen X'rs , dunno , I think they are underdogs so maybe that 's why ) and definitely made the episode better for me . Then I thought that the slide in fact was n't a red herring , because in the scene the pic was reffering to Chris was talking about who 's porbably will be voted out next , so in a way he was prepering for the next tribal council , the whole caption was just a stretch . Intentional or not , it felt great to think that you have been spoiled some information only to find out it was a total misdirection",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"What if in a situation when the whole tribe plays their idols the votes begin a new cicle where the idols stay used but votes proceed as normal . It would be either way the biggest idol flush or a hectic strategy of who out of the alliance stays vulnerable , who trusts that he is n't going home , who may be tricked into not playing idol and getting blindsided .

Jeff is n't an old man - he just knows his market and wants to bank it on this season which will bring both young and old back into the show . He may know that he sounds stupid but he has a much bigger crowd to cater to their likings than some hardcore fans on the internet . tl ; dr Jeff pushes the theme hard because he knows the Gen X will love it , and like it or not ratings are way more importent for him than some super fans being annoyed for a while .

1Sopel6,survivor,The difference is that Yul played the game in a style that I think was n't recreated - like a politician . Also he used his idol better then Tony ( manipulator Penner to flip just on the basis of having an idol ),Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Probably the big factor in the whole excitement of Legacy Advantage ( or lack of ) comes from the way the whole fact of possesion is played . I think that the production wanted for someone to spill the beans about the advantage with hopes of paranoia to ensue - `` what is it ? Is it dangerous ? Will it screw my game ? Will it help my game ? Can I manipulate the votes / the person to will this to me ? '' But the Legacy Advantage was only in possesion of two players who were nowhere near spilling any beans . On the other hand - I understand them , if I would have something like this I would n't talk about it at all , just wait till day 36 . Maybe that 's the advantage 's flaw ( from TV interest standpoint ) - it was n't advantageous to even mention the advantage . But also - imagine if the advantage was in the hands of someone other than not targeted Ken , someone who needed an unexpected safety gained from making bonds . Thinking of this now it would be great for a loosing alliance . tl ; dr Legacy Advantage could be really fun if it was used by an underdog alliance , or if it would change it 's owner a few more times",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Douglas was his compan , although always being on the right side of the vote he was always just a number in Colton 's plans . Colton went to the Final Tribal with the other two with thought that his leadership game style will give him a win , only to be crushed by a more under the radar , immunity winning and relationship based gameplay . Kind of a situation similiar to the Samoa FTC , but imo more understandable . EDIT : Also , I think if it was n't for the Immunity , Anne-Marie could have gone at F4 . Colton was left with two goats - Douglas and Joyce and decided to vote out Joyce in fear of her getting the Zhan Hu votes . I liked Colton , he seemed to me as a villain-ish type of player , that could have succeded with the right scenario",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"As for returnees , I can give you some insight on the returnees Nana , being an underdog and just missing the FTC on both of her seasons has pretty much guaranteed herself a spot in the Heroes tribe On the other hand , Michelle might be on the Villains tribe if there wo n't be better candidates for the spot I will hold Adam for Phillipines I 'm not so sure about Michael 's future , I 'll see if he would fit somewhere in the future Beth was rather an on-off thing for being Borneo 's FF and I think we have seen everything she had to give Pasquale has played for three seasons now and I think this may have been the end of his Survivor career as I do n't want a four time player before 20 seasons I thank you for checking out the season and hope you will like the next one ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I percieve Nana 's flip as her move going forward , but what I see as a heroic move was her loyalty to Zoey and even after being backstabbed by her at the very end she still gave her credit for outplaying her and voted for her .

That 's why I was happy she 's gone because it lefts even the Edgic fans quite blindsided . With Ken I think it will be another blindside for Edgic community , when he 'll be booted around F5 and imo he 's getting a `` too perfect to win '' edit . ( and I suspect a heartbreaking betrayal from David ) Frankly , I do n't understand why I get downvoted here for stating that I like to be blindsided by the editors and unable to predict who goes next or to know who the winner is based on some confessional from episode 2 .

Have n't they noticed that they 're specific and they sometimes are n't even subtle ( like asking Jason if he 's confident about the council while stressing the `` if everyone sticks to the plan '' part ) I know that editing gives us a much shorter look at everything that happens on the TC but do n't they know that Jeff is like an `` always watching big brother '' of the game and if he asks you about something , there needs to be something behind it ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"On the other note ( disclaimer : it 's a pure speculation ) do you think `` Happiness II '' would be possible ? I like all of the singers and all of the eras of DGD but lately I 've came to the conclusion that sooner or later Tilian is going to leave DGD , imo he seems to feel and be doing better as a solo artist rather than a DGD singer . Also , his solo career seems to be doing well . Now that Kurt has left ALLB he 's a free agent ( I 'd be really surprised if he decided to continue as a solo artists with so many connections and musicians ready to collaborate with him ) and added the fact that through the anniversary tour he got closer to DGD once again ( you can see on the videos that he enjoyed playing his songs , on the first dates he wanted to sing the biggest part of `` Uneasy Hearts ...

1Sopel6,dancegavindance,"Sadly , no . Will confirmed that the names and parts are based only on the fact that the song sounds like a continuity or has a similiar vibe as the other song , no real story to it . The most consistend are the first two parts of of Strawberry Swisher songs as both are talking about girls/relationships ( so it kinda fits ? ) The Robot series I would say are loosely tight only by the interpretation by the fans as they usually focus on varying topics and only `` share '' the main protagonist , if you even can find a one in those songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Angus may have deserved the win , at the F5 he was in alliance with everyone and was in a safe position so his win can be justified . I like Rodgers immunity path to the final . Gisele looked like Angus ' coat-rider to me so I 'm surprised she got two jury votes . Jeremy was the most strategic and if not for the tie breaker challange could have won the whole thing , so he 's one of the people who should come back in the future . I also like Dion 's game and I think he should get another chance in the future .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I also was very pleased with how the whole season played out , especially with the fact that how Jack could ride his game until the end even with him coming from the minor tribe ! Maurice and Ami were one of my favorites this season and chances are high that we may see them in the future . Also , check out [ Alternative Survivor : Australia ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/4nsv2p/s_alternative_survivor_the_australian_outback/ ) , it has just been uploaded !",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Thanks for the kind words ! Also , I support giving Dave and Dylan a come back in the future but could you explain why Simone ? I 'll be glad to know why do you think she should come back for All Star : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"To be honest , Tracy was set up as a cool , very friendly guy , a social butterfly that also could excel in the challenges . I can say that I expected to him to go a little bit deeper than he did and I think his story has n't been completed yet so he 's one of my favorites to get a chance another time . Also , I loved how at the merge the tribe immediately got rid of two great competitors - Tracy and Kevin . I was also shocked how easily Thomas had made bonds with outher like how you he made bonds with Tracy as you pointed out . I 'm glad you liked the season and I 'm happy that the castaways I create show some personality just from their looks , that 's the aspect I spend the most time on , because I want my series to present good quality .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,You meant Elias or Ellie ? : P,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , what an ending ! The last vote out was a great strategic move and , definitely one of the greatest possible ways the Borneo season could have turned out ! I like your season much more then mine : D I liked Samantha , Jason and Tom , they are greatly suited for and All-Stars season . IMO for second chancers , only Mercy ( and maybe Joseph ) could use a second shot at the game . Nice first season , first few seasons are a bit simple and thus boring but keep going , I like it !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yes , I was surprised how well she has been doing , and with a little bit more luck she could achieve something fantastic . How would you rate this season ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"That 's what I 'm planning on doing ; ) Dave had a nice game but I think that tribal council would be his last anyways . He simply found himself on the wrong team , otherwise he would have a shot . Add to this his medevac and you get a great cast for some future returnees/evacs seasons : )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Ha ! My favorite won the season . The merge was great , especailly that double idol play . I 'm only surprised that second runner up got no votes and got less votes than the first runner up who was pretty much a goat .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I do n't know why you think that it is a awful winner . If you look at the statistic you notice that the winner was one of the most strategic players , had most immunity wins and was only one vote on the finale away from a perfect game . He also was in the alliance that run the game and if not for the idols - would be a final three . A pretty decent winner , imo",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"In the pre-merge I thought she would be one of the top contenders , she was good , she could definitely achieve more",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Jeff Probst and Santa Claus,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yeah , I think my set alliances a little screwed the way how the simulator was creating alliances in the starting tribes , which made Hana the odd man out , without any allies so her game was a little bit bland . I have regrets because of this but on the other hand , this worked in a way I would like it to work - a group from Borneo was voted out early to ensure that they wo n't have power once they come together ( at least I believe it was meant this way lol ) Cynthia played a really good game but at the same time it painted a gigantic target at her back and once the tribe got the chance to take her out , they took it . What 's your opinion on the winner ? I liked the fact that it was somebody I was betting to not even make the pre-merge .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Tracy & amp ; Adam need to be in HvV , their hot-and-cold relationship was the best thing this season , I imagine Tracy as a Villain with her mutiny , convincing her new tribe to vote out it 's members , idoling and purple rocking people out , throwing them under the bus . She 's a villian . Adam on the other hand was a hero , being so many times on the exile but yet not switching tribes , even when they were loosing , founding an idol which he never played and being loyal to his alliances . I was rooting for one of them to win , I liked the winner but I 'd rather see him as the runner-up . Tristan and Bruce were interesting characters , poor Jordan L did n't even get a chance to play : (",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The Dear Hunter ' song has now been changed from `` Wait '' to `` Whisper '' La Dispute 's song has been changed from `` King Park '' to `` St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues '' Many times I chose the most popular or the most played tracks , when in doubt I compared them . Also , I wanted to keep this as post-hardcore as I could so I did n't include more popular songs of bands that later on changed their style , hence `` Devil In Jersey City '' by C & amp ; C is on the playlist . With Underoath , you may be reffering to the fact that their later albums stray from this sound and are often considered to be metalcore . But `` A Boy Brushed ... '' is a good representation of the sound from this album so it fits imo . `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' is a staple of this sound of post-hc spectrum so it fits . Also , Glassjaw 's sound on their albums can change pretty often so it 's not easy to pin-point the best representative . Letlive 's `` Muther '' is the song they 're most known for , and `` The Blackest Beautiful '' production is polarizing even Letlive 's so I did n't want to include a song from this album . Sadly , `` What Is It To Burn '' by Finch is n't available where I am , I 'll think on some solution to that",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,I 'm glad you like it !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"All of them have been added to the playlist , thank you for posting !",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh man , Solidarity and The Jester",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'd recommend `` Constant Push '' and `` Dark Souls '' . ( Dark Souls would be definitely the best song if not for the chorus ) `` Discovery '' is also a worthy contender . Songs 9 - 14 are from theirs previous material `` If Only I Could Focus '' released in 2013 and from these songs I would recommend `` She 's Broke not Broken '' This band is unusual , because it has many influances but is executed in a style that is rather not seen in the scene . The record flows with mellow guitars tones and drumming only to transition to loud , noisy sounds in a minute . Also , the vocals at places remind me of Chino Moreno of Deftones , the vocalist wails , whispers , shouts , screams and sings lightly . I would say this is how Chino Moreno fronted post-hc band would sound like .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I guess this album will be better then `` In the Unlikely Event '' and eventually be slightly better then Manipulator , and that 's fine to me for me , I 'm just happy that they 're playing shows and making music again",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BeMeApp,"From my experience the bemes are the best when I hold the phone next to my forehead or chin because it captures your POV and in 99 % of times it 's angled in a way you imagined it to be .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Well , there is no place for singing on DG tracks , I imagined it in a way that Tilian would sing in the mumbled verses and Jon would do screaming/rapping ( Secret Band style ) on choruses and the last verse of the song .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'm glad you like it : ) I only wanted to note that on your playlist there is `` Imagine Violet As A Farmer '' by The Personalized Kid Music Band , supposedly in the place were `` ... As Children '' by Violet should be ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few borderline bands that can be loosely associated with post-hardcore genre so I decided to include them f.e . Foxing 's first album is mainly emo but could pull riffs and shouts in vain of DGD or Circa Survive BMTH 's `` Sempiternal '' is taken as post-hc release , similarly to Underoath 's `` They 're Only Chasing Safety '' even though they 're a metalcore band . Also , songs from `` Sempiternal '' are n't forbidden to post here , so there 's that . I do n't listen to blessthefall but only saw an opinion on the internet and last.fm that they 're a post-hardcore band but , I 'll give it a closer look Sadly , there is no Ling Tosite Sigure on Spotify , trust me If they were there I would be included . But I can recommend you Sokokinaru , they are on the playlist and you may like them ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh this is not how it works Network Ten is paying Endemol to create the show for them , so acquiring Ten by CBS may result in things like AUS being available in All Access , but they did not acquire the creative force , sadly . Also , I think that the US version would benefit sooo much only from extending it for another 20 minutes . I ca n't just understand why it 's the shortest of any Survivor version . When the series are starting ( Australia , recently one in Poland ) they always make the episodes long ( Australian is around one hour , polish one is an hour and a half ) so they can pay off . But US Survivor , the biggest of them all , with dedicated fanbase is the shortest and as of late needs to cut corners ( f.e . staying in Fiji , reusing challenges every season to save on creating new props ) while just by making episodes longer would give benefits to nearly everybody .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Their message is here , the guitars might have been more prominent but it 's ok and I think it will be better when we get the context of it on the album . `` Live Outside '' was a single but also a satire , this is bouncy with more power to it .

1Sopel6,survivor,There are dozens of us ! Dozens !,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,I do n't think there was anything portraing her as a real threat or an mastermind that the edit did n't show - Annelise for the whole season did n't stick strong to anyone so she was kind of there . tbh if she did n't stumble upon that immunity idol or did n't give an iformation about having it she would be riding the wave like Tara is doing right now . On an island where 9 people are fighting with fists she was on of those who found a knife . She was a threat that needed to be simply disarmed .,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"For the whole episode I was looking forward a move and it never came , I do n't know if my logic if flawed but ... Why not blindside Ziggy at this point ? The plan literally was just writing itself - they knew for sure that Ana is using her idol , you somehow get Ziggy to play her Super Idol . So you 're getting rid of two idols in one go . But here 's the plan - you know right then the 3 votes are going for Locky , one is going fo Annaliese . You take the remaining 7 and Ziggy gets clipped . And that would have worked even if Ziggy did n't screw Annaliese ! In one swoop you get rid of : two hidden immunity idols , one super idol , one flipper , original Samatau member and a challenge beast . Yeah , the Samatu are sitting together as a 3 , not as a 2 , and you 're exposing yourself by getting rid of one of your shields . But who 's going to win the challenges anyway . As we saw it 's really left between Jericho , Locky and Henry at this point . I just do n't know , this was so obvious to me , but is there something I 'm missing out that ? I know we see an end-product , but even Henry and Locky had all the info that I 've pointed out .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh , after my practices in hospital he has a typical mentality of an seasoned doctor - both weird and cringy in jokes / interests and with a feeling of superiority . I do n't think that he will last for long , especially with people who usually work under people like him . I have nothing against the guy but I can bet that he will be a flame out , I only hope this will be a hilarious one",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"What I love about the cast is that it 's a very diverse bunch , almost to the point when it looks like some fanmade fanfiction . Just look at the bunch that is left in the game I mean , you have whacky Luke , a sweet cookie-monster Jericho , an silent and seemingly always scared Peter , an hilarious alpha male Locky to the point that he looks like a caraicature of an archetype , an elusive shadow that is Sarah , a complete gossip girl and chatterbox that is Michelle , the underdog scrappy fighter Tessa , the smarter-than-he-thinks but still lovable dude that is Henry , the kickass chellange beast Ziggy and the one everyone loves to hate - Tara . And the best part is that all of them have that fire to fight for the immunity or to scramble and be strategic , and everyobody does it in their own style - Michelle can create a drama out of the tiniest information , Locky with his subtle as a punch strategies , Henry 's constant running and gunning , etc . Not to mention some good characters that we had in the pre-merge were also good .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Australian one proved that Survivor US got too meta , too full of itself . Sadly , US one probably wo n't learn a thing from that as it 's not threatening for their market .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes ! I also think that the boot order is ideal . The only ones I miss from pre-merge is Mark W ( I would have him in the place of Annelise anyday ) and as I understand that AK may have been getting on some people 's nerves I think his eventual downfall in the merge would be more satisfying then a pre-merge boot because of the swap . Other then that - yeah , everyone else left in the ideal place , just enough to show their characters , or would n't deliver anything exciting and were gone fast ( Kate , Aimee )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh sweet summerchild Welcome to the world of messism . In overall , Craig 's lyrics are mostly constant blabbing about girls , Travis ' are about relationships and are the ones that are filled most with emotions , Pearson 's are overly sexual . But Jon Mess ? That 's a whole other bag . He has a style in which he is both very blunt about the delivery but also very very cryptic about the meaning . If you want some insane lyrics from him check out `` Need Money '' . As to connections to video games , on `` Jesus H. Macy '' the lyrics '' Set it up , cover the plans , record everyone , make demands Positional strategy , split was disastrous , flanking the siege '' is in fact about Starcraft . I do n't think there 's more in terms of video games , but these lyrics are a total treat .

1Sopel6,survivor,"Tell that to all the UTR winners ; ) Calling the shots in benefitial for your game when the plan follows as you intend them but when the pyramid gets flipped upside down - you 're the first head of the chopping block . Just look at AK - went from bottom to top and I smell that he can be in another turmoil caused by Locky and Henry . Why is that ? Because from being the target of the majority he rose up and now is the target of the minority . And the thing in Survivor is - you never know when that minority becomes a majority . Revolution eats their own children . That 's what riding the middle is - playing enough to not be the last in the alliances pecking order but not playing too much to be the one calling the shots . And yes , I 'll agree that it 's result based as it will determine if we will remember it as a great move or as a stupid move . But Henry made his choices , gambled and the payoff may be massive . But well , if you 're getting `` JT flashbacks '' you probably are one of the crowd that disregard the whole idea of the move and only repeat the same opinion - in this case `` JT was a dumbass , he should n't give that idol to Russel '' . BUT , if the JT 's perception of Russell / what is going on in Villains tribe proved to be right , this gifted idol would be praised as the most brilliant thing in the whole series . It 's the gamble . JT gambled , Henry is gambling right now . As for Henry - guy saw an opportunity , took it , he has some connections back at his old tribe , he knows he will be valuable at his new tribe . Again - big gamble , big payoff . Thinking about that - yeah , JT and Henry seem to be the same kind of a player . I 'd like to call them `` the experimentator '' , they do crazy things if that little stroke of brilliance . Sometimes they play the perfect game , sometimes they come down in history as `` the stupidiest move in the history , hurr hurr '' . But still , JT is in the realm of legends , and Henry is 9 episodes in , a major character od this season ( at least for now ) I think that 's the way of percieving of good players . I would argue who 's thinking is really flawed here .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

She may use it but everyone knows she 's dangerous with it * it has been 25 out of 55 days out there , it 's nearly the middle of season for them , so a good motivation for another half is a good idea . Besides , in US version they get the letters around the same day . It also helped to give some background to the characters , sympathise with them while fillin the filler . * well , it 's pretty naive to think that production would let that happen ... * also , a good timing given that the majorities on both tribes are getting to comfortable with their powers",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Same for me , `` Caught Up In a Lie '' is a decent track , not ground breaking , but decent . But `` Broke '' did n't grip me in any way : / What 's worse , the lyrical content is really good , and would be good if the instrumentation was n't that loud , the vocals drown in them . Also , I think that it could be a little bit less stripped out , bit quieter . Something in the liking of the passage in `` Tetra Hydro Cannonball '' from their EP ( [ this ] ( https : //youtu.be/6KYc9HwB_9g ? t=95 ) ) , I just think it lacks a bit of intimacy . I still have hope for this album , it 's their debut after all . I just hope that they wo n't make the same mistakes that their label mates Oranges made on their album , that songs were definitely `` swancore '' but lacked their own dashes of identity As to `` Galaxy God '' - this will be a re-recorded version so it 's not completely the same thing",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"No , it has been there in previous episodes - although not so over-the-top like in this one ( it 's also present in Luke 's confessionals ) . This is also not so uncommon in the US version - it was quite noticeable in S33 , especially in Zeke 's confessionals . Possibly it 's a matter of lightning , lense like Ben 's wild hair and their color may not look so good on the background with morning sunlight , hence they need to create a contrast . Also , if he was to be inserted in post-production his crazy noodly hair would be a dead giveaway if the greenscreen was used ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"IMO twists are fine at this point , still better then Advantage Fest that was GC . And I 'm glad that the `` dumb stuff the American version has n't seen '' is there , because it makes the series unique , not another carbon copy of the format . 24 people was overbearing at the start , and the edit of some early boots left something to desire , but given the people who went out first - they were n't that interesting anyway , and them going home was always against our [ ed/lo ] gic and we were truly blindsided that way . I 'm not really that mad that I have n't known Kate or Aimee very much . That time was spent on some people that are main characters of the season ( atm ) And I think that at this point I can say at least something about the characters , everybody left got at least a little of their personality shown , but some are given to us in a more subtle way ( like Peter ) . ALSO , I do n't think the alliances are that hard to follow , especially since in both tribes people split into two groups and paired up in them , which imo makes things only easier to follow ( like you know that Jericho is always with Luke , AK with Tessa , Locky with Tara , Henry with Jacqui and later her with Kent , etc . ) and every voteout is based on the fight of the two opposing forces for the people who are more or less in the middle , and they are presented to us so we know who is the deciding force .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

I would also really love to know what ( and how many ) teams are playing in Tonga Major League as of lately . These informations will be used in the process of creating a modification that would add Tongan football league into the game Football Manager 2017 . The creator of the mod said that there is too little information to be gathered about Tongan football to create a good mod for it .

1Sopel6,CK2GameOfthrones,"Situation is - Arya has been rescued from Harrenhall , I 'm Robb , King InDaNorf . I 've invited over a certain Harry from the Vale to my court , which I 've later gave Moat Cailin . I 've betrohed him to Arya and the time has come - Arya 's 14 , she can marry the Harry . A `` regular '' marriage is an option but I wanted to push a matrilineal marriage but there 's a problem - Harry does n't want it only because Arya is `` unlikely to have children '' . That was a bit confusing for me so I checked her out with charinfo - she has a `` fertility '' of -99950 % ! We 're for sure not getting any babies from that ! What 's worse , Bran and Rickon suffer from the same deal . What should I do ? Wait 2 years more until Arya is 16 , her portrait updates and maybe something refreshes ? I 've searched around the web , I 've come to this that the fertility is to assure she wo n't be having children too fast ( same goes f.e . for Asha Greyjoy ) But seeing that it affects the `` missing '' Stark children ( Sansa i a-ok ) I 'm wondering if everything is alright with this situation . Also , I 've checked Arya 's fertility before , after finding her when she was around 10 - it has n't changed / updated since then .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"wow , nice way to be a douche It 's a decent tune but defenitely not belonging in post-hardcore , as the whole genre is veeery broad this song does n't really have any elements typical to post-hardcore , not even the core structure . It 's probably inspired by some older post-hardcore acts , but the end product rather fits the progressive , post-rock , ambient and noise characteristics - but not post-hardcore ones .

I have won the league and now I am at the start of Ligue 1 and I ca n't loan players like this ! My wage budget is very tight so I ca n't pay high wages . Before I could n't loan players like Joel Campbell because `` my league was n't a challange for him '' or something along these lines . Fair .

I was looking forward to loaning out some players to help me stay in the league but it seems that i could only get somewhat decent reserves for my first team . Why clubs do n't want to loan me some players so they can play in a good league but when I 'm playing in the lower league - they loan me them without trouble and do n't even want me to pay any percent of their wages ( even when they 're transfer listed and are unwanted in the club , and earn 500k a year )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , that was a really fascinating season ! I really liked how you could see the storylines forming . Also , very strangely I could see some parallels to real life Survivor Fiji players ! Kendra being first out to weaken the alliance of younger ones , Gigi voted out because of being annoying just after her , I especially liked how the younger alliance at the first tribal voted Gigi as a obvious vote out to strenghten the team and were basically blindsided . Hunter got very unlucky , but the fact that he was n't very promient to the story really fits well with that Armando was really robbed of playing the game , Sylvia Kwan style I liked how Izumi was voted out because of her feud with Manuel who was more valuable at the time Ferris voted out because of his Rocky-like character Whitney being the one to strat picking the new tribe at the twist and essentailly chhosing her poison by being voted 5-1 Lee got a little BrantSteelle logic - fucked because he should reconnect with his old tribemates or the opposing ones but sadly there are some flaws in the simulation Manuel was a fun pre-merge villain , not a great player but if there was some drama he was always included Meili is the ideal boot for the merge , as she did n't do anything to that point , and was booted at the right time for the story , leaving us with a very interesting group Monty Dickinson was a real dick and I loved every little moment of it , he gave me some Randy vibes , would like to see him again maybe ? Libby was a good player , sadly go picked off because she was quite savvy Autumn was a typical `` the leader won immunity so vote out his ally '' Chris was a great character , great villain and quite a challenge beast , would like to see him return Joshua was an ally of Ji-Tae and Ashley , he seemed to trust them but got blindsided when Ji-Tae started to build his resume . Being a comedian I suppose he could be a social threat Ashley would probably be another victim of Ji-Tae 's flip . But on the bright side - you have a great candidate for a team captain when you get to the Phillipines ! Leah was such a drama queen , kind of like Abi Maria , most votes received yet still dragged to the end as a total goat , just like Cassandra in Fiji Ji-Tae was a great character and my pick going into this season , I liked how he stuck with the older alliance at the start , survived at Ravu with Joshua and Ashley , later jumping into Moto camp . He had a good plan going forward but I feel people may have felt betrayed at the end . He seemed to me to be a good strategist but lacking in skill to pull that all off . Regardless , I still loved him , would definitely be a pick for a Second Chance season - because his storyline needs a second chance And last but not least - Von . Member of the younger alliance at Ravu . Started off as a villain but later evolved into a more mature person . He survived everything that fate tossed him and somewhat fought till the end and without a single vote casted for him ! He had strategy , he had immunity wins and he had respect of the jury for what he achieved . Truly a fantastic winner , he reminded me of Jay from MvGX as he would be probably regarded in the same way if he won his season . Overall , fantastic season , this lengthy comment and the fact that I could remember thing about every single contestant just proves that this is a quality rarely achieved on this subreddit .

1Sopel6,survivor,"In the first episode , when they 're stranded on the beach for a day you see the castaways splitting up - one half ( the younger one ) went exploring the island and the second half ( the older one ) stayed behind and started building the shelter . What we were n't shown is that those two groups formed alliances , because no one had a clue what 's this seasons theme , etc . Also , it happend naturally as older ones were scared that if they do n't stick together the younger ones will boot them . The same went for the younger group . This is how two , big alliances of ~10 were formed - Explorers and Builders . Later , when the crew finally decided how to continue the season with 19 castaways , one person would divide the tribes and would join the losing one . That person was Sylvia - a member of the builders . Calculating her chances she decided to split the two alliances as evenly as she could so she would n't end up in a position with no allies , regardless of which tribe went to the Tribal Council . After that we have pretty much seen what happened next , although it 's quite a crucial plot point that was left out of the final edit , that would explain why some people bonded so easily ( like younger guys on new Ravu )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm not an english native speaker but I find the music behind the conversations much much more bearable than in the american one . I 'll give you that the splicing is quite obvious , with additional one second scenes that do n't really add any much power to the words or anything , but only show us the contestant in different place , setting , wearing different clothes which adds another level to this . I think that by not revealing the AK 's idol the episode only got better . With that reveal we would n't have gotten the Chicken Idol scene . Also , plot wise - without the reveal we kind of understood the situation of the rest of the tribe - `` does AK have an idol ? I guess he has . Or maybe Adam is playing us ? '' . Lastly , after all - the idol itself did n't amount to anything , it did n't negate any votes . The format includes many people , their thoughts and stories , all at the same time , but I 'm not worrying that much about it , I 'm sure we will get into those characters when they will start to matter . This is n't quite te American standard , where the winner is hamfisted and forshadeowed since the first episode . Hell , the previous winner of AUS Survivor for the most part was for the most part a supporting character , people did n't see her chances even after the merge hit . So I would n't worry that much about it all - afterall , what do you even want to hear from someone who is in the middle of the pecking order in the main alliance and is n't targeted ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes , someone went and rewatched the scene when Adam finds it , it was non-transferable",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Hmm , so aligning with Sasha saves you from the boot at F5 ? In that case I have a new theory , spend every round talking once to the person that is going to be eliminated and once to Sasha . It seems that an alliance with him is crucial to the game but does n't bring anything new after the alliance is formed . I only know that talking to Margo is pointless because she 's just depressed and you ca n't help her ( unless you can somehow save her through the conversations ) -- wait , is Margo voting too if the vote is 7-1 ? Also , what would happen if you allied with Vinni ? We know Sasha guarantees us F3 and finale with an idol . But what if Vinni 's `` storyline '' gives us something else . tbh I 've never talked to her Also , this is less a `` game '' and rather a digital art form for an expo . I bet this is n't about being on the right side etc because you ca n't be on the first run , only with outside knowledge . Also , every character is pretty one-dimensional - Karo is a superfan , Jo works hard , Sasha is nice but naive , Margo is a depressed pile of mess and so on . There is - some - massage there , not quite sure what , I 've watched a short interview with the creator ( and host ) of the game . It was n't very explaining but the basis is that like in game of Survivor you need to interact , think and in overall move forward in the dog eat dog world . Or so I think that was the intent . So there is no our - the real-life Survivor fans - way of winning as you do n't talk strategy and ca n't possibly be in control . You 're never in the control of the game . But through trial and error you can solve what path the game wants you to take . Also , I 'm curious if there is some theme of going against the rules , like if you would have stick to the path all of the players take you would have never found the HII . I wonder if there is something else hidden somewhere , mainly in the lodge by the entrence ( I purely base it on the fact that HII are n't just hidden in regular rooms , but like the library in some specific ones ) . Also , waht I 've noticed is the second dialog with Jo is always written as if you were talking to her after her second immunity win , as if we were meant to talk to her in an order ( but that may be just an oversight from the developer 's part ) . Also , the last thing is the 4th wall breaking host that in The Stanley Parable 's comments on you dicking around the place , I wonder how far can you push her limits . Ok , main takeaways * it 's possible that the way to win is allying with Sasha to not get booted at F5 and talking everyday to the contestant that is going to be elliminated to maybe get their sympathy and get votes from them * Maybe there is a way to save Margo ( after all , the host points out that you did n't do anything after her death , maybe it has some role , like keeping Margo in game changes the outcome ? ) * there may be some room to screw around with the came with the big space that is the museum and with the narrator that breaks the 4th wall . There may be something left to uncover , because as the narrator says - there is no way for us to win the game , no scenario like that . But on the other hand - by the game logic we were n't supposed to be in the game after F5 . So this game might be about outsmarting the game . * it 's unknown what happens when you ally with the finalist - Vinni",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"I found a hidden immunity idol , on the 5th floor , instead of going through the stairs go to the library , somewhere after that there should be stairs leading you to a piece like this from `` fire making '' challange Pick it up , continue , put it in the pedestal in the voting room . The vote should be Jo . I do n't know if this is the solution , first time I played it I also got voted out at F5 , later by running around I found the HI , played it , and Jo went out in a 5-1 vote out Then I continued , Nikola has been voted out , I 've got left with Vinni and Sasha , the only person I talked to for the whole game . I do n't know how to continue past that , Vinni wins immunity so it 's me or Sasha and Vinni votes me . I do n't know what should be done , I have a few ideas * talk to Sasha till you make an alliance with him , later switch to Vinni * talk to Sasha and when asked , advise him to quit * I 've noticed that after the tribal I 've found the HII the floor that I 've found it on - 5th - started to burn down . Later , on the day that I 've been voted out the 4th floor started to burn down . I do n't know if a HII is hidden there ? When I tried to look for it the host said she 's tired of it and reused the `` break the wall '' challange , but it was impossible to beat * Normally it seems that you go out if you do not play the idol after the fourth challange , but when I played no votes were cancelled and Jo went 5-1 . Probably it 's how it 's supposed to be but maybe you can keep the idol and play it on the FTC and single handedly vote out Sasha I 'm probably somewhere close to beating this game but I do n't think I want to go through the creepiness of it If someone is interested in the `` boot list '' , here it is ( it 's always the same thing but maybe it 's helpful to be on the good side of the votes ) Ellis Asla Dana Margo Karo ( pick up the HII ) Jo Nikola My tactic was to stick with Sasha and Jo , but she is n't the late gamer . Talk to Sasha from the start , when he talks about Solidarity do n't tell him that the ship is sinking , on the next convo he will become your ally . Two or three conversations later he will consider quitting . I do n't know , anymore , game is very creepy and artsy-fartsy but on the other end , it definitely creates some interest and being against the game itself is also interesting . ( the game outright tells you after the vote out you are normally meant to be going but you played your idol that you was n't going to get that far and there is nothing left for you ) Whew , that became a longer post then I intended but if someone wants to try and solve this game I 'd be more than happy to know how it ends .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Thanks for your insights but : 1 . I think in a normal Survivor enviroment the villains would rather break the main alliances ( pecking order etc ) and reorganize with them and getting the additional votes from the last heroes who would n't have any other better option - this is how blindsides are made 2 . The quotes would make it more obvious but there are limitations .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yay , my favorite actually won ! I guess those who say that he played a weak game do n't really get into these simualtions as I do Pre-merge was kind of fun , Fang was a diseaster unfolding , happily the more interesting people from Fang got into the first swap ca n't say much about three first boots other then they were kind of typical I 'm happy Cody went so early , I hated him Naomi and Kelli greatly integrated with the other Kota alliance who while counting the number , eliminated those who were opposing them pre-swap - Grace and Jack . Funny situation how they were swap-fucked when on paper they should be safe among their own Later on , on double elimination , Kelli and Naomi greatly baited the rest of Kotas and blindsided Rico , who was on of the physical pawns of Alice , good move on their part On Fang Scott just could n't escape - he was a quite fun , grumpy pre-merge villain imo , could get a shot at SC down the line , maybe ? After the next vote Fang alliances could n't work together and the tribe imploded , with Kelli once again surviving Nadia being the merge boot seems kinda fitting , she seamed to me to be a strong competitor and a scrappy player , could be dangerous Alice was such a diva , wrapping guys around her finger , while using them as pawns and eventually wanting to get rid off one of her meat shields , but Vincent turned on her and Colby went rogue , leaving her behind Vince 's blindside more significatn for the btrayal of Anne-Marie , she sensed the danger and protected herself from the boot The next episode was about rallying the troops between Anne Marie and Eric , two big characters thus far Anne Marie was a big breakout character , one to return , thats for sure - she was a great villainous schemer at the same time , very rootable , she caused some drama , manouvered strategically . The finale 5 was a quite enjoyable bunch - Colby , thus far a pawn in other 's games , Sarah , an old kickass lady , Naomi and Kelli , a duo with trust issues and Eric , ( for me at least ) a Todd-like player Colby was booted , quite unceremoniously , I think that was done to not ruin the alliances that were going on - Eric with Naomi both keeping Sarah and Kelli on their sides , I think that everyone thought they had a plan and this just was n't the time to make the final move , as Colby was basically a free agent At Final 4 , Naomi finally woke up and wanted to make the last move that counts , recruited by Sarah she saw Kelli as an underdog story that could win the jury . On the other end Eric and Kelli , while being more strategic knew that it was going to be either of them so they teamed up and voted for a big jury threat - old Sarah . At this point I think only Naomi was out of the running for the title . Kelli got beaten in the firemaking and surprisingly that was the best outcome for Eric As to the votes at FTC - i loved the bitter throwaway Anne Marie 's vote for Naomi , because she was bittter to both of their blindsiders xD Roy has voted for Sarah as she was his tribemate ( also , I do n't think he was very inept in the game so I 'd guess that would be a good explanation ) Vincent was a close ally of Sarah , so it 's no wonder taht he stayed loyal and voted for her And , as to the winner - Eric . He had put on the jury Alice , who liked him more than other ( no wonder as for the whole season , she was sticking with the guys , it 's also a funny characteristic for her character ) Kelli admired Eric because he was the best strategist , after her . He also smooth talked his way to the win at the jury questions and swayed two lone guns - Nadia and Colby - to his side . I enjoyed that win , it was a very Todd-like As for returnee posibilities FvF - Alice and Scott Second Chances - Kelli , Sarah HvV - Anne Marie , Eric ( both villains , but Eric is more like an anti-hero - Todd , Sandra and Natalie A style )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , well , here 's a legend to your series ; ) I 'm dissapointed with the winner , at least Edmund was looking quite reasonable and was a character ( Kristen , Tanesha and Blake voted for him and they were the best jurors ) but oh well , you can say he was blindsided at the finale ! ( I think that he got too comfortable , looked upon himself as the leader of such successful tribe , but probably lost Sofia 's vote , as she thought he would n't ever betray her ) Kristen was a good villain with epic blindside , maybe you can fix her a spot somewhere Tanesha is simply a villain legend , I understand that as a creator you were rooting for her to win it all , just as Probst was rooting for Stephenie but her boot was inevitable Doreen is in fact a good SC candidate , but I do n't know what rules do you follow but she may be `` too old '' for SC - maybe a spot on Heroes tribe ? She had a very strange story I liked Edmund , maybe a little too confident but maybe he could return as a Favorite ?

1Sopel6,survivor,"I think it works because it references to overall people 's traits so the theme is n't forces on the players as they practically do n't change their playstyle or personality - Kyle Jason , Scott Pollard and Cliff Robinson would always play like jocks , Spencer Garrett and David would always play like smartasses , etc . Also , characteristics like these make people on the tribes really gel together . WA is n't exactly the same . It 's similiar in the way but BvBvB theme bases on the overall characteristics - from personalities ( Alecia is feisty hence is a Brawn , Tai has amazing positivness and joy of life hence is a ( n inner ) Beauty ) to their jobs ( Sarah is a cop and brawn is the characteristic of the job , Peter is a doctor so he clearly must be an intelectual ) ending with simply their looks ( Anna , Lindsey , Aubry ) WA takes only one characteristic into consideration - the job . It 's just one link to the other format but it gives slightly different group HvHvH seems to be taking into consideration the personality and life motivation but I do n't know if it is n't too wide of a characteristic to create groups that would gel together . IMO they should try again with the collar themes to see if with better cast it can produce a better season . The cast of HvHvH would be pretty much set to the theme , maybe with a few changes in the cast",Balto-Slavic,Polish

But post-hc bands like Enter Shikari , Dance Gavin Dance , A Day To Remember , Bring Me The Horizon or Chiodos have some ( bigger or smaller ) recognition around here . And everyone is learning english because it is world 's most communicative language right now . Just as in past , in Europe it was latin or french .

Other great story involved a player that I got mid season that got really butthurt about a player that was loaned a season before and later sold . He was 21 yo defender , so okay , you may say that i sold a youngster , I 'll take that , but the player who was angry about it ( and nearly turned the whole team against me ) have n't even spend a day in the same club with the sold player , they did n't even know eachother and were n't even from the same continent ! This whole morale and players interaction is a cool idea but it needs some touches , I do n't want do get sacked because some youngster wants first team football that he would recive anyway in the future .

May 9 is a great choice , since the weather is guaranteed to be great thanks to some aviation magic and you get to see one of the world 's biggest military parades , although there 's going to be a lot of people and you may not get to see it in its full glory . Plus in May ( and summer as a whole ) , everyone is really friendly and you can actually see people smiling . Christmas or winter time in general is a whole other story . For me , Moscow in winter and in summer are two completely different places . In winter , people are generally less happy and the environment around you can get depressing . The general exception is the several weeks before New Year and the New Year itself since Moscow will get decorated in really beautiful lights , Christmas trees all over place , there are public events and New Year markets and the city itself is covered in a beautiful layer of snow which can be amazing unless you live in a similar snowy country . I 'd suggest May for the first trip and late December for the second one .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

1010x,hoi4,"I just saw last week 's developer 's stream of Kaiserreich where they are playing Russia and was disappointed on how uneventful it was . When I chose Russia during my first game of Kaiserreich , I decided to restore a rightful monarchy and made all the according choices , however , I got really screwed mid-way . Obviously , I had a 'Disaster ' stability and almost zero national unity , as well as huge shortage of infantry equipment . First , Soviet Union spawned in the western part of Russia . A Civil War , great ! I was completely unprepared for that so I had to consolidate all my troops throughout the territory and wait for them to unite along the front which took a lot of time and cost me in a lot of territories . My unarmed infantry was practically useless in offensive so I just held the line and hoped for the best , waiting for the planning bonuses and more infantry equipment . After a few months , I started an offensive and it was going great , Soviets were losing and I felt victorious . However , that did not last long as I got a telegram from Siberia , stating that they are seceding , permanently . I could not allow more divided Russia , so I had to declare war on them . I could n't actually start conquering Siberia right away , so I took 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive and put them in Ural mountains , hoping that they would hold until they can get reinforcements from the west after I 've dealt with Soviets . Soviets were still losing , but not as fast as I wanted them to , so the offensive was going really slowly but fortunately , the Siberian AI was indecisive and did n't push into my undermanned border which they could easily do . I slowly moved into Soviet territories , the victory was not near but it was almost assured , but then I got a telegram from the south : Don - Kuban union declared a war on me , damned cossacks wanted more land to pillage ! I had to take another 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive just to protect the Southern borders from the barbarians . Same as in Siberia , I also could n't launch a direct assault , so they just had to hold the line until I dealt with the Red Menace . My Soviet Offensive was becoming more and more undermanned , but it was still going strong : after all , people believed in their tsar and his Divine Authority . Russian armies were fighting on three fronts , severely underpowered and underarmed , so it could n't get much worse , could it ? Well , it could and it did . Right as I was pushing into Petrograd 's territories , the Tsar received another telegram : the King of Finland was asking for their `` rightful '' territories : pretty much all the land East of Finland . ( i.e . majority of Novgorod territories in EU4 ) . Obviously , I could not bow to these Finnish pretenders ; I politely refused and got a war declared on me . Now I have a war in the north with Finland , a war in the west with Soviet Union , a war in the south with Don - Kubans and a war in the east with Siberia and it 's not even 1937 . My armies are overstretched , hungry and out of supply , but it ca n't get any worse , right ? The submission got pretty long , tell me if you want me to continue . I just wanted to tell on how crazy Russian games in Kaiserreich can get and why I was kinda underwhelmed by what events ( or lack of them ) developers got during their stream . I mean , good for them for playing it right , but my completely screwed up game turned out to be far more interesting than a 'perfect ' playthrough : )",Balto-Slavic,Russian

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"Mein Kampf did not introduce any new ideas to the stage of Europe . MANY people were anti-Semitic in those days , which is one of the reasons why the book was n't shunned off in the first place , many North Americans also read the book and agreed with its ideas . ( If an idea is n't popular , then it would of never grown ) The Holocaust was not derived from Mein Kampf ; as it was stated by Hitler during the declaration of war to America , and the Holocaust was set up by Reinhard Heydrich and Himmler ( The two worst Nazis to have ever lived ) I have read the book for educational purposes and do not recall the Holocaust that Europe experienced being in the book . You can not blame the Wehrmacht for ignorance for what they fought for ( knowing and not knowing ) , as in the end : Humans are evil . EVERY nation has committed atrocities ( my heritage of Russia committing some of the worst ) and remember- History is written by the victors . D-DAY should remember all the fighters in the war , the allied forces also contributed terrible things in the war such as , Civilian Air Raids ( the bombing of Berlin was proposed by Churchill , and Hitler used this to bolster his support for the bombing of London ) the Dachau Massacre , the rape of Berlin , and the nuclear bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima )",Balto-Slavic,Russian

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"A number is still a number , both sides committed equal horrible acts in various ways . There is many more acts that I did not include for the allied side . ( I 'm sure the Axis have a very long list also ) Both of the sides did terrible things , the only difference is number BUT not morality . If the Allied forces are remembered for what they did , why not the Germans for what they did ?

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"Number is not a factor of what was committed during WW2 , it is the morality , and both sides did terrible things . The soldiers who fought for the war were put into those positions , many soldiers did not fight for what Hitler represented ( those were the SS and Waffen SS ) , many of the soldiers who fought in WW2 were already in the army and put into the war , and many of them were conscripted . ( The Nazis went far enough to put old men and children during the end of the war onto the battlefront ) We were not born in that era and we have no right to state why the Germans did what they did , but they were bullied around immensely after WW1 , as they were publicly humiliate for a war they did not start ( Austria started it ) and were bullied and harassed by the french before WW2 begun .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

13lack_Baron,worldnews,"All good points , and I have no strong thesis to argue about the causes they fought for . I 'm sure many were anti-Semitic , and many had their own reasons . ( As Anti-Semitic views were very popular in those days ) Although , this has really not changed at all in Europe . It has changed from anti-Semitic to anti-immigrants . ( Pretty much black & amp ; anyone who is n't white , since they are the most easy to be visibly see ) Many countries such as France , Italy , Russia ( of course ) , Germany , and more have become prone to more and more right-wing parties against immigration . How does this make you feel ?

As i later found out , it was bunch of Pakistanis and Afghans fighting over some shit . During the time we waited there was the Croat lady that checks tickets ( i think ) few seats behind me . She was talking to some guy telling him how she 's sick from all those migrants in the last few days , saying how in the begging she felt sorry but is now getting increasingly frustrated with them and the media for not showing the true picture . She said how they processed around 3000something of them yesterday and how there was less that 200 women and children among them . Those women and children where the first ones to be put onto the train , but as soon as the men got in , they started hitting the women that were sitting down and kicking them out into the hallway . She also said that they threw all the clothes and food out of the windows and even had some of them say how they do n't need our old clothes , the things they threw away were picked up by the locals and the gypsies . She also mentioned that they had some 50 year old guy that got heart attack , and that when the medics came and took his shirt off , they found thousands of euros tapped onto his body . In conclusion she noted that the only normal ones that behave like humans were Syrians , which ironically are the ones they encounter the least . She also said that Afghans smell like shit for some reason .

I think that bothered him in the end more than anything because he still brings it up and asks me to consider having my own kids . Anyway , my sister went for a job interview in a neighboring country , took her kids ( 7,8 ) and fell in love with a guy working for the company , they plan on getting married . My dad was so shocked . My other sister is dating a guy 10 years younger and he 's all tattooed up and in piercings . So he goes to me 'you know my friend Brian ? He got divorced , found himself a young girl and got two kids now he 's running around after them . He looks 10 years younger , says he has a purpose for life now , something to fight for . Maybe I should find myself a young girl and get a little kiddo ' ( although my parents are married , their marriage is really weird and strained and they almost divorced a dozen times but ended up just not doing it , they do n't really do anything together much anymore except family meals and him occasionally visiting to see how she is or staying at the house , but in a different bedroom . They both claim the other snores too much ) That hurt , on such a huge level . You were n't there for me , but want a kid to be there for and fight for ? It honestly was n't the first thing that popped into my head since dad told me that my sister 's getting married and I Was like , what ? Since when ? and to whom ? And then I was like , well , you 're 70 , so if that kids in high school when you die , what then ? or the age factor , you 're 70 'well at least he had a dad that loved him , that 'll always stay with him , kids love their parents no matter who they are or how old they are , I probably ca n't have kids , but if I did , I 'm sure it would n't judge me for my age ' . And then I felt shit because he was n't there for me and said that but I kept quiet cause he was like 'well if your sister gets to get married on a whim , the other one dates a guy 10 years younger with tattoos , and you do n't want kids , just to adopt and might marry a girl , then I think it 's fair I can want to have kids of my own , it 's been 10 years since I had any sexual relations ( note the viagra I spotted on his bedside table in a bag full of meds , possibly telling me otherwise , did he find someone already ? and just wants approval ? ) and it would be nice if I could have someone ... How unfair would that be on mom who 's sick and suffering ? Every time she knows he 's coming over , she insists on some blue ring he got her and does little things she normally would n't . To me it 's clear she still cares and wants something . I do n't think he does . Also , my oldest sister might be a half-sister . Wow . Interesting news from my middle sister , who says that 's why dads so panicked about neither of us wanting kids of our own cause those might not be his real grandkids .

Anyway , she started yelling I 'm an idiot , over and over and I just lost it . I asked was I an idiot for trying to help her get back into shape ? Yes , apparently . Then I said I should just kill myself since I 'm that much of an idiot . she agreed and I said I was heading to the balcony and did , and when she said 'go for it ' I just lost it and almost jumped . Sorry for dumping this here but I had nowhere to put all this and I 've had the worst past 2 years of my life and all this shit piling on just makes it so hard to keep going . After not being able to do it , I sat and cried on the balcony and she came 10 minutes later crying herself , asking for an apology . Saying I do n't know how hard it is for her . A year ago I had a car wreck and spinal fusion . I could n't move my arms even an inch in any direction at first . Could n't move my head . It was painful and all the physiotherapy was a nightmare .

12084182,synthesizers,Awesome . I like the idea of having actual hardware and using analog stuff . I was taught on analog consoles and far prefer them to the digital ones we were taught .

12084182,synthesizers,"See , I did n't realize that there were two different things . Glad I asked here for advice , I realized how clueless I was about this whole thing . Our university classroom had some really fancy synths and they were definitely polyphonic and had some awesome functions in them and we had to 'compose ' something for our final project , basically just fit it within some criteria and I really had fun and realized that I missed playing piano and I could compose stuff like scores and when I looked up the synth , it was a couple grand so definitely out of my range , but these looked attainable .

None of the stores seemed to have used stuff like Guitar Center does . I have Pro Tools , if I got some good enough plug-ins , would I essentially be able to emulate what the BSII offers ?

12084182,AskReddit,"That post itself might very well not be real ( as most things on the internet are n't , and we should all be cautious ) . But things like that do exist out there . You 'd be amazed at what is real and people think it 's just there to be gore for us . That movie , where the girls go on a trip and take a random ride in a bus to their hotel thinking it 's an airport bus and one of them ends up on a shipping container with a cat litter box and stuff . That movie is actually pretty spot on with what happens . When I was younger I was approached by someone late at night ( I was like 14 coming home from a night out ) and I later found out that they were a convicted sex trafficker trying to get me to go with them . It fueled my anger towards how little is done to help sex trafficking victims . As a college student I did a research paper on sex-trafficking and slaves because it bothered me so much how little people knew about it and I wanted to shock my class with the facts . Girls as young as under 10 get kidnapped . They are promised jobs like working in a carpet factory . Family agrees because they do n't have money or is n't aware it 's happening as the children just walk off with strangers claiming to know their family . Sometimes girls just get kidnapped as I almost did ( guy tried to bribe me with his private plane and mansion , I did n't buy it , he then tried proposing to me and telling me he loved me ) and are sent off . Girls are forced to have sex ( in some cases ) with at least 30 men a day . Does n't matter if you 're on your period , do n't feel well , are in too much pain from the last client or anything for that matter , you do it . If you do n't have sex with at least 30 men you get punished . All girls are drugged so they are numb and keep needing more drugs so they do what they are told and are too fucked up to try and escape . You want to escape ? You get punished if you get found out . One girl had her teeth knocked out . another got pregnant at 12 and when she managed to escape and get home , her family ostracized her and did n't believe her and said she put it on herself , then her 'uncle ' said he 'd offer her a better life and a job and ended up sending her right back into the sex industry she just barely got out of . If you 've been in there long enough , and are not useful to them anymore Stockholm syndrome kinda happens . They offer you money and all the latest fashion and a nice car and place , in exchange you recruit new girls ( and yes , girls do this , it 's either getting a new life with nice things or fucking 30 guys a day , so of course you 'd rather recruit new girls . You 're so numb and drugged at this point that you do n't care , anything that takes you away from the day in day out of fucking is better ) . So these women , go out there , act as role models for girls from shitty countries in Eastern Europe or some Asian place or anywhere this is rampant and these girls think 'ooh , I could be like her , I can get a job and have nice things and look how confident she is , she 's happy with her life , I can get away from this shitty life where my family sucks and is poor ' . Then they get sold off to the highest bidder . You could end up in someone 's basement as a slave , or go work in a brothel . Making friends with a brothel worker ? Nope , boss does n't like that , he 's selling you off to another brothel . He does n't want to see you possibly happy or making friends with a worker . New boss finds out that you were being sneaky at last brothel and insists your new sex limit is at least 50 guys a day or punishment . Why do people encourage this ? It 's cheap . Taxi workers can take an hour off of work and not lose much because it 's so cheap to get sex . Some people like that they get young girls , too young to get anywhere else . Others like the fact that they might not speak their language . Or that they can do what they please because they have the money . Or because it 's risky and illegal . It 's disgusting is what that is and I really hope that something gets done about it . I 'm apparently from ( well , grew up in ) the country with one of the highest sex trafficking rates in Europe . It disgusts me how this is capable of happening . And my class was flabbergasted when I brought up the statistics and directly quoted our country as one with a high problem . People turn a blind eye too easily to problems around us and refuse to believe that things are real and happening .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,photography,"Ah crap . It was a present from an ex , and I do n't even know if it has warranty or not ( I know he got it at a Walmart but it 's been like 2 years now so probably not ) .

Then take my phone 's SD card and mount it on the camera and see if that works though it 's not a brand that was suggested for optimal GoPro use but should still work though . I had a car wreck a year ago and it completely flipped and got boxed in , and the GoPro was just sitting in an open box with accessories .

12084182,AskReddit,"Not the OP but just some points of view to consider . My parents are pretty controlling , they constantly badger us about everything . Even when I still lived with them and my older sisters would come visit , mom would be like 'where are you going ? Who with ? When will you be home ? ' Apparently they were a lot worse before I was born . My oldest sister wanted to be a makeup artist , she got accepted into a top make-up school in England , and dad wanted her to live her dream , and she wrote to them I guess because she was away from home , in a new environment and was n't used to this lifestyle and confided in them that some students were using drugs like cocaine and she was n't sure how to handle it . Instead of just telling her to avoid that crowd and stick to her guns , they freaked out , pulled her out and killed her dream . She went into I hate you mode and started doing things to piss them off ( I think she even got into heavy drugs after that ) because they were n't being the support she needed but just ruining things . I was raised partly like an only child as my sisters are both well over 10 years my senior . My middle sister did spend some time around me , but not a whole lot as she lived abroad for most of it . They raised me like an audiobook on repeat , I was an annoying parrot around people 'you should n't smoke ' 'you should n't swear ' you should n't this or that , I criticized my older sister all the time for smoking pot and pretty much gave her an ultimatum at one point because I thought she did n't care for me if she chose drugs over what we had . Yeah ... .. I started hanging around a different crowd , who pretty much made me realize that I need to be more open minded , more accepting , less of a bigot and I also started not believing in religion as much as I did before . I was never overly religious but I was raised with a God and suddenly started seeing things differently . I also hated how strict my mom was . I 'd have to be in bed by a certain hour , the computer got moved downstairs so I ca n't be on it when it 's 'bed ' time . I couldnt ' stay out late , no matter how late my friends parents let them stay out , moms rules were different and I had to abide by them . I started resenting them . I could never tell them anything without worrying they would freak out . I rebelled the way I did ( although not to the extreme of OP 's child ) because I could , because I was angry . Because I hated being caged . And because curiosity . I realized I wanted to try everything and anything even if it did n't seem like I 'd like it , just to know what it 's like and how I feel about it . I know several people who had strict parents who tried to smother them and were over protective and did n't want to lose their kid , so they 'd monitor everything they did and the kids hated it and would act out because of that . And some people just go off for no reason . Knew a girl that was really bright and a really nice , quiet , good girl . Started doing modeling . Started dating a guy , started doing drugs to keep her body right or whatever . She was best friends with a friend of mine and I had met her on a few occasions . One day my friend told me that she got an ultimatum from her that she could n't hang with her unless she was n't a virgin anymore , and offered a friend of her boyfriends to have sex with her . What the fuck ? It was so unlike her , she had changed and turned into this whole other person and if you were n't into sex and drugs , you were n't welcome . So just someone else 's perspective from what I 've seen , or experienced . I 'd like to see myself ( if I ever have kids ) as an open parent . Growing up I 've seen parents that were very open with their kids and the kids treated them like best friends . I want to have that with my kid . Even if it means he 'll do things I might not agree with , at least I 'll know what they 're doing and where so I can act accordingly if something goes wrong and know how to help them out , and if there are parents that are strict or kids feel they ca n't reach out to them , I can be the parent they can talk to and then I wont feel like they are suffering or I can help talk to their parents if they feel they ca n't do it themselves . Although I 'm not sure if going in the exact opposite direction of my parents will be the solution to not having these problems .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,TrueAskReddit,"I never said it was a source , just that it was discussed . I also , in another comment , stated that the proper term is Antisocial Personality Disorder and that it has been shown that some people become anti-social because they are born that way or suffer a trauma event that instantly causes brain damage while others are raised in an environment that affects their traits and changes them to be that way . So although the two words do n't necessarily have a legitimate scientific meaning behind them , there are two distinct forms of being anti-social even if your 'symptoms ' or 'traits ' are the same . I had an anti-social friend growing up , he took his life a few years back but he was one of the people that had an event happen in his life that turned him into that and I 've seen how he 's been affected by it . I 've also met some of the people he was surrounded by which were possibly anti-social too ( judging by their behavior and as they attract like magnets ) , and I 've seen in his last moments the possibility of the empathy switch that is spoken about and felt that although the two terms are n't used by psychologists , I do feel that two distinct characteristics exist , being born that way and raised that way .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Although I do think Cyprus is relatively safe compared to other countries , I do n't see why it 's 3rd on the list , it just made me wonder how unsafe must the other countries be ? Or maybe I 'm just too optimistic and assume that there 's places with almost no crime .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,sociopath,"1 . None of that , just people that are either fucked emotionally or some other way damaged and drugs help them get by or abuse them for the fun they bring . 2 . ASPD is characterized by lack of empathy , whereas killing for drugs , does n't mean you lack empathy , it just means the hold the drugs have on you is so strong you 'd consider going to extreme measures . These people before the drugs were otherwise normal people for the most part , whereas the drug changed them into completely different people . Not everyone can change with sobriety but some people do . 3 . They become substance abusers because it 's a change from the norm , it 's fun , it 's a way to kill the boredom which we suffer . 4 . Boredom , living on the edge , all of that basically describes me . I do n't know if I 'd be immune , I do feel the addiction and I feel the withdrawal symptoms but I 'm fairly strong willed and I just tolerate it . Like if I do some h and then start to feel the nauseous , and get the shivers or whatever , I just plow through if I do n't feel like doing more or do n't have any . I do n't necessarily do one drug over another , it all depends on my mood and I tend to abuse whatever I can get a hold of . New Year 's for example , hung out with some people , we did coke , ritalin oxy , dilaudid , various benzos , DMT and weed . Just went at it all night , alternating lines or whatever and ended the night ( or rather morning ) with DMT at sunrise and tripped out .

12084182,sociopath,"Ritalin , various bezons ( xanax , valium , etc . ) , had dilaudid and oxy for a while . Ritalin is pretty simple , as with any other ADD medication . Benzos , just need a good trauma story and stress . One way to do it is fake social anxiety , make it extreme , like you ca n't even order pizza on the phone without panicking , and then add on a trauma that amplifies the need for meds like that . Example , death in family , discovering long lost relatives , etc , have to deal with people because of it , and you ca n't deal with people . Oxy/dilaudid , had an actual injury and surgery , but after that just maintained how painful it all was , and convinced them to prescribe more . Also helps if you have a good family doctor that knows you , and then out of the blue , without abusing them and going to them for only legitimate reasons , you show up , they recognize you , and then trust you to prescribe something with minimal backstory because they know you and you do n't come off as the abusive type . Also easy if for example , you fake an injury , ( buy plaster of paris online and make a fake cast or any other injury item such as neck brace ) , and then tell them that the pain is bad and you owe the hospital lots of money ( if you do n't have insurance ) and that they would n't see you because of that and need meds . Or that they are your family doctor and you 'd rather see them from thereon out , you trusted the surgeon to do the important stuff when it happened but would now rather see your doctor , etc .

That stabbing happened while I was out in the area , and suddenly there 's police everywhere and they 're questioning everyone . My parents house got robbed 5 years ago , and another time a neighbor intercepted some people trying to scope our house . My dog ( who was calm and usually scared of guests ) attacked them and when neighbor apologized for his sudden change in temperament , a car emerged from bushes and the guy ran off so she knew something was up . And in Nicosia where I lived , a gang decided to take over our neighborhood and every night you 'd hear their motorbikes loudly and if you walked where they were hanging out , they 'd be all weird , and it was n't pleasant walking around there . These are just a few examples of what I 've experienced here .

Then as the site grows and they gain advertisers interested in the site , instead of taking all revenue for themselves , they share it with you depending on how active you were . Also you get paid for recruiting people to join Tsu . For example , say user 1 invites user 2 to join tsu . If user 2 decides to join , user 1 gets paid . Then , if users 2 decides to stay and invites user 3 to check out tsu , both user 2 and user 1 get paid—and so on . As I said before , users are also encouraged to share photo , video and text content that garners pageviews from their social media audience—all typical behavior for social networks . What makes tsu different from other social media networks like Facebook is that the network only takes 10 percent of ad revenue generated by advertisements placed on the users ’ pages . and from what I 've researched , the other 90 percent is divided among the content creator , who gets 45 % , and the other 45 % is distributed among that user ’ s “ family tree ” —essentially operating on a multi-level marketing model .

Most foreigners like myself who went to high school here , tend to leave for college elsewhere after as it 's a small place and the only good schools are private schools . They also usually do n't come back . The friends I do have here are in a different city as I went to college there . And it 's 2 hours away , and even some of those left for masters abroad . My best friend and our mutual best friend who 's family friends with Rick , who were in the city I studied in , suggested I hang with him for lack of things to do since he 's from my city so that 's how I ended up hanging with him . I decided before coming home this summer after studying abroad that I would eliminate all the people I know here as they are n't really good friends , just people to kill time with , and I hang with them for lack of options . I thought , better having no friends than friends that do n't help you grow as a person . ( I also have social phobia due to depression and just cling to whoever I can because I do n't have skills to meet new people or do something about my life ) So I ended up hanging with Rick and was not expecting that to happen . He 's arrogant but at least we do fun things and I can usually look past it . So without him , I do n't have a lot of people to hang with . I like some of his friends , they 're actually nice for a change , but I do n't want to make it weird if I ask them to hang out but then not include him . I think they 're tired of him too , like Dave who hangs with us , I can tell he 's always irritated with his arrogance . Case in point , the other night we were at this tabletop/board game bar , and we hung out there , played some new game , and as it was nearing the end Rick was n't bothered to put effort since clearly he was losing , and started playing a guitar laying around . Then when the game ended , and we were gon na tally up who won , he just got up and started picking out what game we should play next . He always acts like he 's in charge and it pisses me off . We all got annoyed and I called him out on it and said how we are here as a team and to have fun , not to compete and get pissy if we lose . And that he should sit and find out who won . Finally he sat down grudgingly and his other friend at one point said he was glad that for once he was n't the only one calling him out on his actions . I straight up tell him how I feel , just being honest . Even though I 've only hung out with Dave 5-6 times , I 'm thinking of messaging him since he stood up for me , or rather my point of view , and saw Rick being an asshole , and tell him that I 'm considering cutting ties with Rick or giving it some time and waiting for an apology . I feel he 'd understand ( in case he wonders why I 'm not coming out anymore ) and that maybe he 'd offer to hang without Rick . But even though I know he 's tired of him too , they go to the gym together with another friend and hang often so maybe he 'd feel weird about it . I think he 's a cool person , but I do n't want to make things weird between Rick and him since they 've been friends for years vs. me just meeting him . I hate being depressed and having social anxiety . Makes having friends so much harder . I cling to people even if they 're bad for me because I have no one else . Tried changing that and found out the one friend I did have turned out to be an ass . So now I 'm stuck with either repairing that or being friendless until I figure out a way to make new friends .

Went to a local college that accepted me , did n't even bother trying to go anywhere decent or away from the comforts of my home . I hated it there , but at least I was able to go to classes and come home without much hassle . I met a girl there , she befriended me , and sad to say I pretty much used her as a crutch , I mean she was a good friend , but half the time I just had her around to make awkward situations easier . Like if I had to talk to someone in an office , I dreaded that , so I 'd have her go with me to make it easier . I ended up switching degrees a year later , and although I never finished that one , I got closer to doing something I liked . I met some awesome people and they made socializing a lot easier and the anxieties started to fade . A year before graduation , I transferred yet again , but to a different country and a better university , and I can safely say most of my anxiety is gone .

I 'm weak and he made me feel bad and I did n't know how to face him . I know that 's my fault , no one else ' .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"Close to the start . We were hanging out every day , and it was cool and I had fun , and then it started being weird . I 'd go to hang with my friends and he 'd seem like it 's weird that I do n't include him . I did some of the time , but like if it 's a study group right after class , then we 're just gon na chill , go over homework and test work and I do n't see why he needs to be there . He got all weird that day , but my friends hinted at liking him so I called him to come and bring us pizza , and he was over in a flash , despite being with his friends . Ever since it 's like I never had any time to myself , he 'd just feel weird why I need time to myself , why I need to browse the internet without him behind me watching . It 's not that I need to or have something to hide it 's just that it felt weird , he felt possessive with all of that . He wanted to get me a car not even two months in , like maybe not even a month in , my sister came down to visit for a day , and I spent it with her , get home to my apartment to find a gift on the bed , a watch he knew I had wanted . Okay , it 's cool , you got me something I wanted and paid attention to me . But wanting to get me a car that 's like 4-5k and then have me move in with you so fast is weird . I was going home to the summer and looking forward to spending it with my friends , then one night my friend drunkenly messages me for a threesome and he flips out . The next day he wanted to leave and never come back , leave his whole life behind , house and education included . I prove to him through my previous conversations with said friend that there 's no history between us , nothing . And the message was something out of the blue too , like 'oh btw , do you mind if a girl joins us in our whatever ' so it was hinting to something already arranged . He did n't trust me going home and surprised me with a ticket to see me and I had planned on breaking up with him when I was gone as I thought it would be easier . Him wasting more money on me made it harder . I had to tell my parents that I had a boyfriend and he was coming over , huge shock . I kept trying to make it work , to want it to work but it was just hard with everything he was doing . I lost my friend cause he would n't hear of him , even when the guy added him and sent him a message and said 'sorry man , it was my honest mistake , we 're good friends I do n't want to loser her , I 'm glad she 's found someone finally and I 'd like to get t know you and we can all be friends ' That just angered him more and he threatened to be violent if he saw him . We went to spend Christmas with his family and unbeknownst to me he planned on proposing to me in front of his family but for once he thought about how that would make me feel and realized that I would n't be into that . He only told me after the break-up when he had a breakdown and hoped that knowing that would make me change my mind about the situation . I 'm not the kind of person to get married 6 months into the relationship . Or move in 5 months later . It was all too rushed and stuff . We did n't have much in common either , he was happy to do anything I wanted to but I knew he would n't be into it entirely , he 'd just be doing it because he 'll do anything to make me happy . I do n't want that , I want to meet someone that actually has stuff in common with me and enjoys it in full . I liked all the same things he did , but as I 'm a diverse person whereas he 's narrow minded with interests , that became a problem over time .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll definitely do that . Once I move out I 'll stop answering to his parents or anyone , I 've been on his computer , removed my facebook messages or history so he ca n't link to my account , and will block him once I move out ( right now have his sister added so do n't want to stir something up by blocking him early ) then hope he does n't ask her for my link though I will block her too . and then not talk to them and his parents . they 'll hate me but hopefully understand over time . I have to do this once I 'm out already so that they do n't come looking for me . I 'll definitely write out the amount and stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Not going to talk to his parents , his mom is just like him and is trying to get me to stick around and be with him . Though she says that if I 'm doing it just to make him happy , I should n't , she hints that she could use help with the payments and it would be cheap and that maybe one day things will be different when we both take some time away and we 'll be back together in no time . I 'll just put it in an envelope under his door .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll pay him back somehow . I know that if I request him to not talk to me again , he 'd ( grudgingly ) do it because it 's what I want .

Then I got a car and went to college and that kinda changed . Had less time for it , but when I moved to Orlando , without a car I got into biking again .

12084182,sociopath,"First rule of the sub : No asking if you are a socio-path , psychopath , or have ASPD . It takes a detailed patient history , psych evaluation , evidence , and in the end , you do n't truly want this despite popular culture . With that being said , I have to kinda agree with other posters , you might have some ASPD traits , but you 're not necessarily a sociopath . and there might be a bit of narcissism in there too , but I do n't think that 's the main issue at hand .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"I assume that with me it was trauma , although I ca n't be sure . My mom has bi-polar and narcissism . Two really annoying traits . Supposedly she also used to steal regularly , like a kleptomaniac , but I do n't think she 's a sociopath so I would n't say it 's inherited . When I was a kid , my parents were never around much , I had a lot of other people taking care of me . Kids always picked on me for being different and I guess that 's why I take pleasure now in seeing people suffer , it 's like payback , now I have the power they had over me . I hate my parents with a passion sometimes , I remember being the last kid to be picked up in school cause mom was at work still , and later on I had someone else pick me up every day . My parents raised me to be self sufficient , from age 10 I flew by myself on most flights if I knew where I was going ( to meet up with my parents ) . I lived with my cousins for a year once when I was 7 . Yeah , they were n't really there much ... I was alone a lot . They were also fairly materialistic , and possibly treating everything like an object is something I 've taken from them . And I think all this hate for all of that made me who I am today . My mom tells stories of me as a kid which to her are 'cute ' but to me sound creepy now knowing what I am . 'what will you do if I die ? ' ( who asks their kid that anyway ? ) 'I 'll just go travel the world with daddy ... or the maid will take care of me ' nonchalantly like I wont be bothered that my moms gon na die . Yeah , I never cared much . Supposedly I never cried as a kid until I saw my cousins getting all the attention in the world when they cried so I did it too for the attention . I also was never too fond of physical affection , like where my family 's from , it 's very common to greet someone and cheek kiss them or hug them , and I was always kinda cold in that regard ( why is that necessary ? ) and I remember my dad asking my mom if something was wrong with me cause I do n't like being around people that much ... . Meh ... I feel like the signs were there when I was really little but nothing concrete materialized until later . I remember when I was picked on , I was so tired of it that one day I told my sister that this girl that picks on me picked up a desk and tried to throw it at me . Boy did she get into trouble cause no one believed her when she said she did n't do that . I was like 6 then .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"Define stealing though . If you think about it , I can go into a store , say Walmart , grab a gaming keyboard , say a 250 $ deathstalker , switch the price tag , or print a custom bar code for a 10 $ keyboard , stick it on it , go to self check-out or an older cashier that probably does n't know a thing about that , not at the electronics isle . Since it weighs about the same , it wont register that something 's wrong . Walmart just got robbed of 240 $ . That 's 1/4 of 1k and they never said bag .

Lady decides to bring two cats in a cat carrier ( not something you 're supposed to be able to do ) . So mid-flight she decided that the cats needed to be checked up on , they were stressed and she 'd open the door and take a peek . Cat freaks out at a chance at freedom and darts out and starts running around the plane . People are freaking out , getting up and smoking ( at the time that airline had a smokers section , but people were wandering at this point ) . My mom having asthma attacks had to have an air tank given to her . The cat was freaking out , and the lady decides the best course of action was to open the cage and have the other cat call out to her . Worst idea ever . Other cat freaks out and rushes out . We 're telling the stewardess to not open the cockpit so there 's no risk of the cats getting in there . She stupidly decides to let the captain know about what 's going on and as she opens the door , the cat runs into the cockpit , and right under the captains feet . He 's scared of cats .

12084182,ipod,"I 've always had a Zune , I do n't know why but they always worked for me . Recently my Zune died and I figured since I want more space anyway and somehow possibly iPod 's are better ( and the Zune was discontinued ) I 'm better off with an iPod . I 'm getting pretty frustrated with it . For starters , Zune knows how to organize a library , it can detect the same artists from similar files whereas the iPod ca n't . For example , The Band and The Band , are according to the iPod a different band , even though they have the same name . Or The Band vs The band or the band or just band . It ca n't seem to tell that it 's the same thing . Also , Zune categorizes things by album artist , so if there 's a song The Band Feat . The The , it knows that the main artist due to the album artist field is The Band and sorts it accordingly , that way I do n't have a ton of compilation songs all under separate names . Another thing , I recently added a lot of random music from an old HDD , now the iPod sorted it into the library but gives me no option of seeing what was recently added . With the Zune however , I can see recently added artists and add them accordingly . With iTunes , I have to go through all my files to find the new ones and add them ( and I have over 200GB of music ) . I decided to double check all the name fields so it sorts it under one , make all mixed files sorted by genre so I do n't have to look for a ton of files at once but add by genre , but iTunes did not decide to update all this ( I did it externally ) and even when I reloaded it , it refused to update the files . What can I do ? EDIT : My library is not set to auto sync as I have two computers and originally used one to add music , but then found songs on the other one and added them manually , and that 's where this problem comes in . I ca n't sync automatically on this computer without erasing all music .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,askcarsales,"Florida . Nissan Dealership . Financing the car . Went to a dealership the other day with my boyfriend ( I got a thing in the mail saying I won something if I go to their `` new '' location . ) I won a gift card and the salesperson started to talk about cars . I am in need of a car as I am moving in with my boyfriend to save costs , and we decided to see what they would offer ( never thinking I 'd end up with a new car ) . The place was offering LIFETIME WARRANTY ! ! ! Can you believe that ? As long as they 're in business and I have a problem with my car , they will fix it . Amazing ! ( Heh ... ) The sales person gave us some really great deals on a truck ( 400 $ /mo . with 3,000/dn we really wanted and we decided to go for it . Lifetime warranty ! ! ! Once that sale was done , he offered to give us a trade-in value of my boyfriends car , and told him that if he traded it in , his current car would be paid off ( a 2012 model ) and that , that would increase his credit score , and help me ( with no credit score since I 'll be on his card , making payments ) , and that he would be paying about the same each month as he is now . The facts added up and it was a really good deal , he 'd get a car he likes for no down payment and it would help us out . We were thinking hard cause we really did n't want to spend more money , it 's already tough with the way it is , we 'd just have enough for basic spending . His car is alright , but this one was amazing and I guess in the heat of the moment ... Oh and to mention that when you buy a car , you get to spin a wheel for a prize , the first time we spun it , we got 50 $ and he said the second time , we would n't spin , but they 'd give us a cruise trip off the bat . We go to pay with the finance manager for the second car , and it turns out to be more than we expected , about 100 $ more , and we were quite irritated . We even picked the minimum for the protection plan . We go home and he starts to calculate everything , we need to come up with 2,000 in a week . We paid 1,000 , but were told we can pay the 2,000 in no later than a week . That 's what started to screw us over . We then call his parents who currently pay for his insurance , and who are in South Carolina , they say that they ca n't pay anymore , it 's too much now with 2 more cars to be added , and complicates things . We ca n't find insurance under 300 $ per month , that 's too much for us . We go back to the dealership the next day , tell them we ca n't afford the insurance , and we got screwed over by a 100 $ ( not to mention that I spent 7+ hours at the dealership the previous day ) and they say they 'll work something out for us . We said we 'd like to return the one car , cause we really ca n't afford to struggle with the payments . They give us some papers to sign for insurance , and stupidly we did n't read them through , just assumed they were paying for us , but nope , they got us insurance for a few days . The catch : We never expected his credit score to be high enough to even get the car , neither did the salesperson . My boyfriend makes car and house payments each month ( owns a house and car ) and other things . And they never asked to see proof of income , they mentioned needing it , but I guess his credit score covered it since he mentioned paying for those things . They asked what he does ( freelance work , sells stuff in his own time , not employed , full time student , as am I ) and that 's where they 're flawed , oh and not to mention that they let us out of there without us having insurance based in Florida . They said our only other option since they do n't have a return policy is to trade the car in as soon as the other payment gets cleared and get a cheaper car .

I have what is known as glue ear , the hammer , anvil and stirrup in my ear are glued together and therefore ca n't produce any vibrations which make sound . I went for surgery about 3 years ago when I was 19 , it was horrible , I had bad doctors , and turns out they did n't do anything . They were supposed to find out what kind of brace I need put in , but then they said they still did n't know and needed to do another surgery for that and then the final one . I told my parents I did n't want to do that again . They also just were unprofessional overall , being unprepared . Now we 're gon na see different doctors , I 'm actually gon na travel out of the country to get the surgery done . I do n't trust doctors here . So I 've got some questions . What 's it like being able to hear normally ? I 've got this fear that everything will sound so loud and it 'll be scary hahaha . Also I am really into music , like I 'm gon na go study audio production hopefully , but now I ca n't cause of my ears , I need to be able to hear perfectly . So I 'm waiting to sort that first . But I 'm wondering how it 's gon na affect things . Is it weird when you hear music and hear it differently than before ? Like does it sound weird ? I know that I have to have my headphones in the right way round , otherwise music sounds weird and I hate it , cause I was used to hearing it one way . And my biggest question is about balance , since my ear has no fluids going , I have terrible balance . And I hate it , cause I love sports , but I 'm always limited . Like snowboarding . Do you think it just becomes normal , because I suddenly have fluid or it takes time to adjust and I have to work on it ? Also I get car sick cause of balance , does that go away as well ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"I made a status on Facebook and this guy commented and at first I thought he was pissed at me , but then I went to his profile and well he pretty much does all the things he complained about in his comment . So now I 'm confused . This was my status , a quote from somewhere : We live in the matrix . A chaotic reality which we try to understand and master so as to be able to control it , as well as ourselves . It is a hard job , but each and every one of us has to do it . We live in and live out the pattern that is laid down before us . Comment : We live in facebook . a social networking site where we try to understand what people are talking about when they post dumbass shit . its a hard job ignorin all these idiots that are on here especially when you cant control what they post , but to live in a world where we want to keep in touch with our loved ones we have to wade throught the sea of farmvillers , taggers and idiots that post t hings they think we care about . We do n't . you think you live in the Matrix , but the Matrix was full of robots and cool cyborg people . This is Facebook . Umm he plays games on there , tags people , and makes comments . I do n't play games , yeah I 've been doing a little too much Facebook lately , but it 's summer and I 'm bored staying over with cousins so I put statues up and song links . This was going to be my response , but I do n't want to make an enemy out of it , what do you think ? On your homepage you can remove who you see updates from . So you do n't have to see crap from me again ! : P And well when I post stuff , usually people comment on it , or like it or something so I get the impression people are interested in reading my shit . If they did n't do that then I 'd be stupid for adding more shit that no one likes or is interested in . Btw , from your profile , I can tell you 're worse than me , you tag people , same way I do , make status updates , and you play Facebook games that ( I do n't play ) that probably forces people to join something , or do something to help you out . Those personally annoy me , so I do n't do it . I do n't mind the status updates . So why complain on me when you 're no better ? Btw , if you 're bothered to go back a bit on my Facebook , you 'll see I barely use it , just now I 'm on much more cause it 's summer and I 'm bored at my cousins place and so this is where I end up at . - I hate Facebook ! I actually deleted my account a few times how annoyed and bored I got of it . But then I realized I had a few people I had no other way of staying in touch with , as sad as it is . But this really annoyed me . Why be so hypocritical ? -- -- I replied saying how he 's not any better , and asked what he meant by it , and he said he did n't direct it at me , that he was just making it as a remark in general , and we sorted things out . `` wasnt directed at u love , i liked it but i was makin a point that the world is run thru social network sites now , its sad really . just a joke tho : D an like i sed wasnt aimed at u x ''",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Paranormal,"I wanted to get some advice on this , I feel kinda weird about it but a couple of situations happened where beforehand I felt like something would happen . A premonition if you will . First time this happened was last summer , I was with my boyfriend at the time in some botanical garden , he saw a flower just randomly on it 's own by some mound and decided to go photograph it cause it was unique , anw , the point is that as he got on the soil ( which is not a firm surface and it was downhill ) I thought of offering him my hand back up as he might fall , I just pictured him slipping and falling . But then I thought , I know he wont take my hand , would I his in that situation ? He lost his grip and slipped . I was kinda shocked but did n't say a thing . About a month later , I was at a gas station pumping some air into my tires and suddenly it felt so weird like something bad was gon na happen , something felt so wrong and I pumped the tires just fine and thought , hmm , nothing wrong . Well just as I left the gas station , suddenly I hear a bang and my car broke down , some metal pipe that 's between the front tires broke . : O Again it was weird but I did n't think much about it and maybe a few weeks later I was driving down a road and noticed an odd taxi next to me and somehow I just pictured it looking through the side mirror and not seeing me due to the blind spot and just trying to switch to my lane and low and behold it happened , the driver tried to go to my lane and then suddenly saw me there and swerved back . That 's when I told people how odd it was that I felt something each time that happened . I forgot about that , and about a week ago I was up late chatting with my friend and at one point the light flickered , nothing out of the ordinary , lights do flicker right ? And it happened again later and I heard the a/c go off for a split second and thought to myself , tomorrow there will be no electricity , I bet it 's gon na run out . a little later my net went off completely , and it happened to my friend a bit earlier and I told him , somethings off , I 'm sure of it . I slept around 4am I think and I woke up to the lack of electricity , my room was boiling hot . But what I did n't know was how severe the issue was . I live in an island in Europe , and at a army base , well a naval base , some idiot decided that it 's ok to put containers full of ammunition in the sun , and those containers blew up from the pressure , and he just told army boys to spray them with water so they cool down . Of course they did n't and they were situated right next to a power generator which when they blew up , blew up as well . And now because of the lack of power , half the island ( it 's kinda small ) has only a few hours of electricity a day ( including me ) Anw , that really freaked me out and I reminded my friend of last years incidents and he thought it was a bit odd too cause I told him , there 's gon na be no electricity tomorrow . Anw , is this odd or just chance ? I just feel like I need to get in touch with a part of me that will help me channel what I 'm seeing/feeling and work on it . I first thought , well ok , I saw a taxi , I could have easily thought he might not see me cause it is possible , and it 's possible that my ex would fall cause he 's on unstable ground , and the light flickered , so maybe it 's a sign , but all the same I feel like there was a reason I felt something so strong . It just stood out . Anw , I 'm not sure if I believe in premonitions , since I 've watched far too much Charmed and I think that kinda got to me and I 'm just combining things in my environment , but I 'm open to things . I do believe in a lot of paranormal things , I 'm just not sure if I 'm really seeing things or it 's my mind putting two and two together . TLDR ; I predicted a couple of things to happen and am wondering what people think about it . Did I really have a premonition or is my mind just putting information from my surroundings together to form a vision .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AdviceAnimals,"Yeah . Another issue I see is on the opposite end of the spectrum . I had a professor who studied in the States in a top university , even worked at one and had great experience/resume . She then had family reasons to move back home and wanted a job locally . She did n't care if it paid well or was an exact fit of her previous job , she just wanted to keep teaching and be able to be near her family . Our university originally turned her down because she was 'overqualified ' . They could n't hire someone like that even if she was content with the low salary because it would look bad on their part why they would pay so little for someone who is that good at what they do . She ended up modifying her resume , cutting half of her qualifying traits out , and applying to another branch of it in a different city . They accepted her and she asked for a transfer . And finally got the job . Oddly enough she taught a class on how to write a CV/Resume/Cover letter and apply for jobs successfully .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

But also if you think about it , sometimes you try to accomplish something for hours with no luck and then take a break and within 5 minutes you managed to figure out what you were stuck with . I used to work as a lyricist for a label briefly , and I found that when I put effort and wrote songs I thought would be big , never got far - the ones that caught my managers eye were the ones that I threw together last minute . Sometimes I had unfinished lyrics where I was n't sure how to fill in some blanks so last second I threw in random words/phrases where I was lacking and did n't feel they made sense , but to him the songs sounded magical !

They ended up crowdfunding an album since the label dropped them and have a [ website ] ( http : //music.sinch.net/album/clearing-the-channel ) where you can hear all their music since YouTube for the most part wo n't let their stuff stay up . Shame though , as they had quite a few tours with big nu-metal among other bands and could have had much bigger success but they did n't want to give into labels demands and put themselves into a formula or box , which although great , means they lost the potential for a bigger fan base without the traditional means of promotion . /endofrant",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,Shoestring,"The concept is pretty simple : The traveler performs a service for a host in exchange for free accommodation . The service can be anything the two people agree on : from cooking lessons or massage to website design or house repairs . Likewise , the length of stay can be accordingly negotiated . Sometimes a service will require host ’ s presence ( in case of , lets say , personal coaching ) . Other times , the service can be delivered independently , such as website design . In such instances , it ’ s possible that the host will let you use his summerhouse for a week or two or maybe even their home without them actually being there . Whatever you two agree upon should be honored . We are here to provide a platform that will help you find a great opportunity and enable you to make a connection with your match , be it a host or a service provider . We are still in the early stages of project development , but are working hard to make it come to life . One of our main goals is to make this platform free for everyone . If that turns out to be impossible , and we are cornered into charging some kind of fee to cover our operating expenses , we will aim to make access fee as low as possible . We are determined , however , to grant our early adopters Premium Free Membership for life regardless of how much we may later decide to charge regular users . It 's for people that would love to travel and see new places but ca n't really afford to get a room . So you 'd just offer your skill set to a potential host and they 'd let you stay at theirs for free in exchange for helping them out with what you can offer . For example : I need someone to help me with this programming course I 've started . I ca n't seem to get a hang of it . You come along and I offer you to stay at mine in exchange for help with programming . You 've got a place to stay , food , and outings if we arrange it . It 's up to the host if they want to offer more than a place to stay and food/necessities . Discuss with them and find a suitable arrangement . Sure , you can teach programming online and get yourself a room in a hotel as you travel and work , but why not meet people along the way ? We think this is the best way to integrate into a local culture , be with locals !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

He said , 'you do love the dick more though right ? ' trying to make a statement that I would n't be with a girl , because his dick is good enough . He said it was probably an experimental phase , I was trying things out when I was with a girl ( we did n't date , but we went all out ) and he thinks I was just feeling adventurous or whatever , but I like guys better . He said I 'm straight , cause I 'm with him , right ? So that must make me straight . I said that the same way he might look at a girl in passing and find her attractive , maybe not sexually cause he 's with me , but he will know if she 's hot or not . Well the same way I 'll see a girl in public and think , she 's hot . He said that 's weird . I guess he does n't understand . My best friend is currently gay ( he 's dated girls before too so I guess he 's bi overall ) and he 's met him and his boyfriend , we spent 2 weeks together traveling last summer . So he 's okay with the LGBT community , I just do n't get why I 'm being bothered by the fact that he does n't seem to understand what I 'm like . He says it 's a choice , that I chose to do that , that other people chose to just like the same sex . I said I 've liked girls since forever , I do n't remember feeling different about them since I 've liked guys . And my best friend has liked guys since he was little , like 10 even . I 'm sure if you like someone at such a young age , it was an attraction . Not a 'oh I 'm gon na like guys now because I want to be gay ' I do n't think he even knew what that was .

I do n't chose to like girls , I just see one and think 'she 's hot , and if I were a guy , I 'd probably have a boner' How do I get him to understand ?

12084182,ElectricalEngineering,"I have some old Sony stereo speakers that I got and ended up in my car a few years back and have stayed there since . Now I want to use them to power my birthday party . A friend who dj 's suggested he 'd play music if we can figure out a sound setup and throw a party in the middle of the woods . So we have the speakers from my car which are n't too bad ( in terms of loudness ) , but they just have wires at the end , like the cable sticks out of the speaker , and at the end it splits off into two separate wires ( I 'm guessing power and ground ) and then they turn into left and right when they connect to the main power of the car that the door speakers connect to . But how can I turn that wire into something more useful ? And would a generator help ? I might have an amp of sorts at home , but I 'm not sure if it works , it 's just been laying around collecting dust , some Pioneer amp that 's been in this house since my parents got it . Let me know if that 's of use and I 'll find a way to see if it works . But the amp needs powering as well , so maybe it 's not necessary if I can just plug the speakers straight to a generator without needing one . Also how much noise would a generator cause ? The speakers are n't bad but if a generator makes noise that will be problematic since they 're not party speakers per se . I just figured woods would make everything louder , but with a generator ... But if it can be kept at a distance , like really long cables away from the speakers then it should n't be a problem . And if this is not the right sub , let me know , I had no idea where to post this . tl ; dr : Have some regular stereo system speakers I would like to power in the woods .

12084182,careerguidance,"Well there 's nothing really bad about the employers themselves . The office is wow in a weird way . It 's a call center based out of a house . Right now we 're by ourselves at the night shift . But the one guy that trained us , he was here for the first week and then left to train people in another office ( different country ) but he 's super chill , like jokes around on the phone with clients , smokes weed at work , I think ( more like know as another employee that has been there longer hinted at ) he does coke as well . Tells us to swim in the house pool any time we like as well . So it 's a very weird atmosphere . We fuck around a lot , like the guy that 's been there a while , he recently got back from being at their other office in the other country and said they fuck around a lot too and barely do any work , the company is a mess and when I told him how we signed contracts the other day , he was surprised saying until recently there were n't any contracts . Another guy worked for 6 months without a contract , cash payments only but left for personal reasons . We 're basically 800+5 % . But the contract I signed says after the 3 months 'probation ' which is basically training and us being 'outsourced ' workers , we go permanent , just the 5 % and we were told it 's because of the amount of people that do n't like call center work and quit . Which did happen , out of 10 of us , only 5 of us are on the team now . Thing is after the 3 months , contract states it 's just 5 % and I do n't like that , it 's going to take me longer than 3 months to get a solid client from cold calling and getting money out of him a while longer before he decides to invest bigger money . ( We do sports betting/handicapping ) For now I 'm sticking around for the salary . Now the guy that 's been there longer said that he 's not sticking around either if he has to sign on permanently , we 're slowly piecing together how much of a scam our company is ( product wise ) and the shit they pull for evasion of things and I just do n't like it that much . It took them 2 weeks to get our contracts , we got paid for the 2 weeks , then the guy said to not date the contracts so the lawyer can date them when she gets back from holiday . We feel she might not exist and it 's a contract for us to think there 's one so we ca n't do anything but they do n't have it signed so it 's not legal in case we do try to do anything . What do I tell a new employer ? Why would I be leaving such a job ? I like the people I work with , I like the chill atmosphere , we can dress however , do whatever , I just do n't think I can handle living off just the 5 % and if something happens to them as a company because of weird practices , it 's not good for me .

Is that legal ? I had one co-worker tell me they worked for another place and were only paid 5 % so if this is standard practice , then I assume it 's legal , but I do know we have a minimum wage depending on industry and I ca n't imagine commission falling into that because what if you get no commission that month ? I understand why they do the first type of contract as I 've only been here 2 weeks and had 3 people quit within the second week ( first was training ) and so they do n't want to waste their time , but how can they not give us a salary after that ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I moved back in with my parents but mom has Parkinson 's and is institutionalized and dad is struggling to help her out and sister is trying to help dad sell the house and stuff so she 's moved back in as well and I do n't want him to keep having to support me and her and so on . I had an interview a while back for customer service type role that everyone told me to avoid like the plague because of what you have to deal with , but I figured anything is better than nothing . The thing is , the other week I scored a volunteer position in my field . Basically a group of people passionate about our work organize events and they do n't get paid , they just do it for the love of it , but it 's once a week at most I guess . But it 's Friday 's and Saturday 's usually . I do get to be in my field , unpaid . Which my family is okay with since I 'm getting experience .

12084182,careeradvice,"So , my resume might make me out to be a bit flaky . I started one degree , a year in , transferred to another university ( the degree was really crappy , and the university too ) . The other one was better , but 3 years in I got accepted to a really good university in the States and moved there . I graduated . All 3 degrees were somewhat arts related , so nothing businesslike . The first one had a focus on advertising , but I never got to that , as the first year was very traditional arts based . I 've come to the conclusion ( long story , involving family , and me being fed up with my current situation , 26- jobless and stuck with family problems ) , that I 'd like to move out and just get any job . So I 'm trying to get into the forex/binary options/trading industry , whatever you call it . It 's huge in my country , so there 's constantly jobs available . Even though I possess a skill they always want : Languages ( I speak more than 3 fluently ) , I 'm not their ideal candidate . My social skills are not that great , and even though they hire just about anyone , ( you do n't need any skills for entry-level positions because they offer training ) , they want to see extroversion in a person . The last interview I went to , the lady asked some general questions , and even though I answered them the way she wanted , she was a bit stuck on how I have 3 artsy degrees and nothing on my resume related to their industry or business in general or customer service . I said I was looking for a long term job , but it did n't seem to help . I have a job listed on my CV , working in promotions , where I used to hand out product samples and interact with people , but I do n't think she cared for that . She pointed out how I worked as a lyricist for about 2 years , but when asked if I still do that , I said no . I regret not expounding on the interview . For lyricist I could have said that I did n't like the contract , which was true . My manager got 20 % of all profits and if I had any kind of job during that contract ( other than it ) , he got 20 % of my profits , even if the job continued when the contract expired ( what kind of bs is that ? who does that ? ) If she had known I quit not because I got bored and do that all the time , but because I was being treated unfairly , it would have been different , no ? Another thing I wish I had mentioned , though I 'm hoping you can tell me if my logic is sound , I have epilepsy that has only recently been discovered though I 've had it all my life ( a type that is n't easily noticeable ) and I might not be able to work in my field anyway if the doctors conclude that lights and sounds affect my health . So I wish when she had asked me 'what was your first job choice upon graduation , or what would you rather chose right now if given the chance ... ' that I had said I had epilepsy and could n't work in my field either way because of that , and am thus seeking work elsewhere without having to obtain another degree . Would that have helped reassure her I was n't a fight risk ? I 'm not sure how to land a job like that , since I do n't look like someone that would last long , but I really just want a job so I can move out and be on my own and not be surrounded by my toxic family . They are really starting to get on my nerves and I just want a place of my own , a stable job whatever it might be and time for myself to de-stress .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I downloaded Windows to do a fresh install as that one had windows configured for the other laptop . Before I got to that though , the laptop suggested I do a free upgrade to Windows 10 . I accepted it and did n't realize that it had 32-bit architecture and that it would follow on to the Windows 10 installation without prompting me if I 'd like 64-bit instead . So I got 10 at 32-bit and it was sluggish so I downloaded the ISO for Windows 10 64-bit . Used some Microsoft tool for creating a bootable USB . Formatted the drive to install Windows on a blank drive without previous Windows on it . Now every time it preps Windows to install , it restarts and it gets stuck on the boot screen that says 'press esc to enter setup menu ' or whatever . If I do n't click esc right away the screen freezes and I ca n't click any button to get a response . I have no idea what to do at this point . In the installation menu for Windows it asks if I have a product key . I tried typing what came with the 32-bit windows ( going from what the properties of My Computer had displayed ) but I was missing 4 digits . So I chose 'I do n't have a product key ' thinking it 'd just know that I had Windows 10 and it was a free upgrade and register it for me . Should I find a key for it ? Would that make a difference ?

I work a night shift and until recently tried getting my day sleep as my night sleep - 8 hours but found it hard to get a good nights sleep even after more than 8 hours sometimes . I found myself these past few days sleeping in two shifts . I come home , sleep for a few hours ( waking up naturally without an alarm clock ) , and then resume right before work for another few hours and just get up and go to work . But I do still wake up a little groggy in the afternoon and tired right before work but I manage to stay awake during my shift once I wake up and do n't feel sleepy , so I 'm taking this as a good thing , I get a few hours of wake time during the day where I can get stuff done .

12084182,relationships,"So our mom has been sick for some time now . Its gotten to the point that she 's in hospice care ( refuses a nursing home ) , and she pretty much does n't move from the bed . She gets up to eat and use the bathroom ( a porta chair/toilet next to her bed ) and that 's about it . No one knows how to talk to my one sister . She blames everyone for everything and is always angry and is on drugs as she claims it 's the only thing keeping her same . She until recently took care of anything mom related , paid the hospice women , organized doctors visits and anything else needed . I 've since taken over this role as dad has deemed her unstable and he thinks it 's brought her down too much . Anyway , mom has been given another 5 years to live and she will most likely not die from the Parkinson 's but from everything else , not moving and whatever else could happen as her brain is fine . But she does have at least 5 years in her and she 's a fighter . I recently planned a trip and my sister sees my status on facebook and messages me to hold off on buying tickets as our aunt is coming on the 12th ( september , I was planning on leaving 10th but with my aunt coming I planned on 13th so I get to see her but my sister wanted me to delay it further ) Then she drops the bomb that she 's planning a family reunion as a farewell for mom . What the fuck ? A farewell ? I told my other sister who is furious as to why we are having a farewell for mom when although she 's in a bad state , she 's far from dying . I ca n't wrap my head around this . My trip was perfectly planned to fit with a break in work , going back to the country I grew up in , need to get all new documents as my bag was stolen a while back so I 'm without passport , drivers license , etc . And I have a wedding to attend . I was willing to move the departure date a few days when aunt told me she was coming but I wo n't move it a week just so I can attend a farewell for mom . I think having a farewell is absurd . I 'm gon na call dad later and let him know what she 's planning and see how he feels about it . But I do n't know what to tell her . I feel like she 'll blow it way out of proportion and act like I do n't care for mom when I moved here 6 months ago to be close to her while she 's in care . But I do n't agree in a farewell so I need to find a way to approach the situation and explain how wrong I think it is . Tl ; Dr : mom has been given at least 5 years to live but sister is planning a farewell mid September for the family to get together . I think it 's absurd . How do I approach her about it ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"Maybe I 'm overreacting but sometimes her attitude really grinds my gears and we 've had issues in the past over it , but I 'm trying to deal with it so we do n't have problems . I 've known her since high school . She 's always thought of herself highly and thought everyone likes her and so on . She 's also easily hurt and I 've made her cry in the past ( and I do n't think I 've ever made anyone else cry before ... ) She never really had any friends . I was her only friend in high school bar from one guy at her school ( we went to different schools ) Then we went our separate ways for college and just saw each other over holidays . But now we 're both living in the same city . She 's been here for 2 years , and does n't really have any friends , and I moved here 6 months ago . I found a group through Facebook that get together on a bi-weekly basis to play a board game I like . I invited her the first time because I did n't want to go alone as I do n't know anyone . We met 4-5 people that day and played some board games . The next few times I went alone as she was on holidays and more people came and it turns out it 's usually a bigger group , just that day it was a few people . I met the group and we all got to know each other . It 's been more than a month since she 's been and she was in town last time so I reminded her I was going ( so she does n't get hurt I did n't invite her if she realizes I went because that 's what would usually happen and she 'd start having self destructive thoughts ) . We walk in ( it 's a small neighborhood bar , really small , and just a place for regulars to chill and have a beer ) and her first reaction is `` HEY EVERYONE , REMEMBER ME ? '' I feel kinda awkward because we walked in to part of the bar and I know for a fact that she did n't know anyone there , and they looked at her like , no , who are you ? Then 2 people she knew came over and we did some introductions with the others . And decided to play games . We played cards against humanity because there were a lot of people and everyone knows the game . At some point people were engaging in discussion about something she does n't know anything about , and she was getting frustrated that a ) she ca n't participate in discussion because it 's a foreign topic to her , and she does n't like being silent , she has the need to always be talking or center of attention and b ) the game was n't being played . But we 're not there to just play games , we 're there to socialize and if we play games , great , if not , still great , we 're enjoying ourselves . She would be like 'ahem , so yeah , let 's continue with the game , we are playing are n't we ? ' Especially if it was her turn , she 'd be like 'so yeah , it 's my turn , and I 'm gon na read my cards now ... ' And one turn I pointed out how someone went for beer and we should wait for them to get back and she 's like 'OH , someone went for beer , so I ca n't read my cards , but when they get back , it 's my turn , so I 'll read my cards , and we 'll continue with the game ' really loudly . It just felt unnatural , and she left early and made it a point to say bye to everyone and loudly point out she was leaving more than once so everyone knew and make sure they remember her . So we 're texting when she left , and I said how I think the one guy liked her ( there were two were sitting together and talking most of the night , but the other guy definitely looked like he had it in for her ) , and she 's like 'yeah , I think they both liked me , they were into me ' She 's insecure so I tell her things like how someone might have liked her . I also compliment her without reason just because she 's like 'aww , thanks , really ? You think so ? ' to help her with her self-esteem . But then with things like this she gets this attitude ... All the guys liked me , I 'm sure of it ... I 'm so amazing and pretty , they ca n't help themselves . and I just hate that attitude that she just assumes everyone is into her and all that ... Maybe they are , hey , that 's not a bad thing ... but when people talk like that and say those things ... I hate that `` all attention to me everyone ! '' It 's fine and well that it 's her thing , I do n't want to change her , but when it affects the whole situation and gives her a lack of social awareness , then I have an issue because I 'm not enjoying myself anymore . Like if we 're all enjoying a discussion and having fun , laughing , whatever , you should n't just be like 'ahem , let 's play the game please . ' We 're all clearly in the mood to talk about something for a bit before continuing . It made her look weird cause she was n't fitting in with what was going on in the moment . I do n't really know anyone in this city and she 's pretty much my only friend , so I do n't exactly want to ditch her because she 's fine when we hang 1on1 or do something else , but it 's situations like these that make it weird . I like these people and would like to become friends outside of our bi-weekly game nights so I have more people in my friend pool . But I feel like she might make the game nights weird . If I do n't invite her to game night , she 's going to get hurt , but if I do , I 'm gon na get frustrated because she ca n't be in a social space where all the attention is not on her . It 's fine if you like attention , but save it for a club or some other environment . But if we 're all having a fine time and just talking , do n't ruin it by making everyone stare at you every second ... So I do n't know . Am I overreacting ? I feel like I should just ignore it and let it play itself out and hopefully she comes to her own conclusions but all the same , I feel awkward bringing her along if she 's gon na act like that and make things flow not as seamlessly as they would otherwise . Ideas ? -- - **tl ; dr** : So , in my opinion , I feel like my friend is really awkward in public and I feel like she does n't understand social cues . If I do n't invite her out , she 'll get hurt . If I do , she 'll make things weird for everyone ( or maybe it 's in my head ) .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,badroommates,"/x/post from /r/relationships since they thought it was more suited here . So I met my ex roommate Claire while she was in a tight spot and needed a place to crash fast . At the time I lived with my ex who was away for the summer teaching a camp and I was planning on moving out . I offered her a place to stay until she finds a place . Let the adventures begin . I had another girl staying with me who was to be my roommate once I moved out of my ex 's . In the meantime I end up in a car accident whiplashed and in a neck brace unable to even lift a glass of water . My to-be roommate decided it was too much for her and bailed . Claire seemed more than willing to help me with groceries , changing , and anything else because after the accident my hands could n't even go past my hips without it being too hard and painful . I was doped up 24/7 to kill the pain . We move in and I find out that Claire is one of the most disgusting people ever . Ex . Dishes never washed , to the point of mouldy food . Shower and shave and leave hairs in bathtub because she does n't know how to get rid of them . Her room was so gross with everything all over the floor ( and in general in the apartment ) . I 'd try and clean when I was a bit better but she 'd yell that I moved such and such item and lost it and now she does n't know where it is . Anyway , she was also BPD and would not stop leaving me alone . She 'd wake up and be like 'Hey , you awake ? ' I am now ... 'Great ! I 'm making breakfast ' 'Oh , where ya headed ? Can I come with ? What are you doing ? Can I join ? Oh I do n't mind that you 're just painting , I like to watch . Oh you want to read ... Oh , we can go to a park and read together ... Oh , I 'll watch that TV show with you even though it 's linear and I do n't know the history of the show or characters ... ' We were college students and my family was in Europe while I was an international student in the States so having family help out was complicated especially since they barely saved up to get me into this college , it 's good but affording rent too and all the other stuff post-accident was really complicated . So yeah . Also , Claire is bad with money . Ca n't make money for this or that . I 'm stuck . I ca n't be rude and have her starve , I 'm human , of course I care . But I also do n't have a backbone . So I bought food for the both of us . She got a job at Macy 's temporarily . Before she got fired she bought stuff like a TV for the apartment , which we did n't need . Among other things , like a GoPro for herself and some personal items for hobbies . Then she lost the job and could n't seem to land another one . We went to food banks all the time and she 'd get angry if I did n't have time to help her with her problems , like what kind of a friend am I ? What if I have my own life to live ? Like she broke her smartphone so she could n't have a phone with Uber . I was out with a friend . She calls me asking for an Uber since she got up late to get to work ( always woke up late and was bad with time management ) and got angry when I said I was busy ( it was a date , I thought it might be urgent ) , and could n't help her . Or she 'd bang on my door when she had a morning shift ( 1 hour ride to work , so up at 6-7 or something ) and she 'd bang on my door for the Uber when she was late and be like 'Do you not want me to make rent ? ' when I say I 'm still sleeping . Stop manipulating me . I could n't get her to move out as it was a joint lease and she 'd have to sign she 's leaving . Great . I tried everything , but where would she go anyway ? Be homeless ? She was also full of suicidal threats and transgender so on hormone therapy which made her mood swings insane , I tried to deal with it because you ca n't help who you are but some days I just could n't . Anyway , at some point I count up all the money she owes me for bills . 380 $ or something like that . I 'm broke at this point too because we let this couple crash on our living room for money and found out they are known for doing that and robbing the people they stay with so they took 1k out of her student loan and 600 $ that I got paid for something . I tell her at the end that I ca n't make last months internet bill , or rather 3 bills back that I did n't pay . About 300 , and instead of her paying me the 380 that she owes for what I did pay , she can just pay that off when she gets her tax returns and I 'll forgo the rest , so I 'm not stuck trying to find 300 in a hurry . She does n't do that . I think I hit her up about it once but she said she called and they made a fuss about it being in my name or something . I was outside of the states by then and back with family as my mom is sick and I just wanted to get away from there . I notice today on my credit report that the Brighthouse internet bill has showed up ( 3 years later ? ) and it 's sitting there , and I 'm not liking it . I already have some of the medical stuff on there that I have n't paid off yet , I made arrangements for most of it but I 'm not made of money so it 's stuck . But I 'm also not liking seeing her Facebook statuses that involve her crashing from couch to couch and being kicked out for bad habits of being a roommate and having no money for food , and how no-one will hire her . What do I do at this point ? I want to bring it up somehow , let her know I understand she 's broke but she needs to understand the consequences of her actions and that she needs to work on herself . I see her making posts about how maybe this is the life she 's destined for , she 's accepted that she 'll always be couch surfing and broke and jobless or some shit I want to write a positive email to her explaining how she can change if she puts the effort and she can make better habits and inspire her , because it 's no way to live . She 's also resorted to being an activist as of late and all her posts are protesting things and Trump . So I do n't know if it 'll be worth it , but she should know that she 's affected people . She 'd message me from time to time to ask how I 'm doing and if I know anyone that can help with her activism ... and I 'm like , err ... you screwed up big-time ... I do n't know how to talk to you . Sorry for the vent , I know a lot of it is unrelated but I went through quite a bit and felt that I was driving my friends away by venting about her on a daily basis so I just bottled it in instead and shut up about it and now it 's all out here but I do n't know what to do . I do n't want her to just get away with it , but at the same time she 's struggling so much that I do n't know if I should put more pressure on her . tl ; dr : Long-ass post about roommate that was more than one can handle but I had a car accident and no-one would help me out but her , and she owes me money and I want to let her know she did n't do her part of the deal we had .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Was originally 341 $ . ) [ Roland A-500 Pro ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/A500Pro ) ( 280 Euros .

Not sure how to describe this as I do n't know mushroom terminology , but basically the center of the mushroom and what you can see in some photos laying on the ground , is what was originally on the tree for a while . Just a lump of mushroom . And one day I kicked it just to see what would happen and it fell off ( to note , the tree has broken apart about a year ago , it just snapped , and I 'm wondering if it 's the mushroom ? ) Anyway , for a while it was just that centerpiece until I kicked it off , and then within like 3-4 days of kicking it off it somehow managed to not only grow back , but grow that extra puffy bit surrounding the center ball .

12084182,techsupport,"So there 's a situation at work . My boss and supervisor are both tech stupid and I 'm the 'smart ' one when it comes to computers and internet so they always ask for my help . But I have no clue how to figure this out . Now there was another guy who came during another shift and he did some stuff , like get the email reports I mentioned above . The guy has done some weird stuff with the company so they are planning on letting him go , but for now they are slowly limiting his access to stuff . So they changed the godaddy password to the web/email they use . He came in and asked for it since he was locked out , and they said they did n't want him to have it , just them two . So then he goes 'well at least let me know what emails are being sent out each day so I can send you guys reports ' Now I work at a call center , and we ask people for emails to tell them about our company . So sometimes we get the email wrong , and I can see that in the mailbox , but I do n't have access to the other report that he supposedly has access to . Where we can see how often they 've looked at our email and if they 've clicked on our link ? He asked for a list of emails sent each day so he can send us a detailed report of each one . How can he still have access to something like that if he does n't have access to the inbox ? How can we see something like that ? I only see 'delivery status notification ' in the inbox , just saying the email has bounced back . Nothing more than that . We want to stop him from having any kind of access but would also like to have access to those reports ourselves . I do n't see anything of the sorts in the godaddy email page . Nothing in settings , anywhere . Nothing suggesting he 's getting something forwarded to him . In the old emails we used to send ( ones made by him ) I can assume he had an image in there that he would track how often it was loaded , but I 've made a new email for the company since because the old one kind of sucked and they liked mine better . The link I also added in the email is direct to site , not a tracking link . I did n't know how to do either of those so I just left it , since I figured he could find out if they checked the emails somehow .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,callcenter,"So I got this job 2 months ago . I 'm a pretty quiet person so I was surprised I got it , but I needed something until I get something in my field . Anyway , we are outbound and try and convince people to sign up with our company ( sports betting sorta ) . We trade on their behalf . Anyway , first database we had , it was full of people that were previously in that industry and was really bad as most people would just be like 'fuck off , you 're all scammers ' , or 'I do n't bet anymore ' or some shit . Really hard to find clients to give emails as they 've had bad experiences in the past . Second database we got the other day was of general people , and most do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . With the first database I could write extensive scripts and change my approach every time because I knew the client knew what I was on about and their tone of voice and word choices would give them away if they were really interested or trying to get rid of me . New database , I say simple things because most people are just like 'I do n't do that , I do n't know what that is , I do n't have time for that , or money etc . ' So I just briefly state that we 're an investor company and we have a free email for them if they are interested . Anyway , manager that listens to all the calls and monitors us came in today to do our monthly meeting and give paychecks and told me that our boss who watches the cameras and stuff has seen me slack off quite a bit and be lazy . And I have two weeks to improve . BUT that he personally , from listening to my calls , says that I have the potential to be better than anyone of the others in my team and that I have a knack for knowing when the client is interested and when they 're just wanting me to fuck off which is hard to do and I know how to write great scripts and rebuttals ( using the customers words against them ) . He also said that he 's heard my prank calls ( at the end of the shift everyone gives me their 'bad ' customers and I prank them from a private line that they 've won something or another and everyone makes me do it cause they think I 'm the best at it ) and he 's confused how my prank calls are so brilliant and perfect and yet my regular calls are lacking enthusiasm and I sound 'docile ' as he put it . He said I 'm really intelligent , he can see that in me but he does n't know how to motivate me . Any other employee , he can tell them exactly what to do to improve but I 'm an enigma to him and he knows I 've got tremendous potential but he ca n't figure out how to get me to pull it out of me . Honestly , it 's a really boring job , we 're doing things manually as they do n't have computers set up yet . So I have a paper sheet in front of me , dial numbers on the phone and then write feedback on the paper and it 's just so tedious . I get distracted easily and do something else other than calls . I want to push myself but I do n't know how . I lack motivation because I never saw myself doing this , I have 2 degrees and ca n't find a job in either field . Maybe because I see this as temporary it 's hard to take it more seriously . But if I can get good commission by getting a client on board and earn good money , then it 's worth it to find out how I can tap into that part of myself that 's good at this .

12084182,AndroidQuestions,"So I have an aux cable for my car and it 's making phone 's do weird things .

It was really annoying but that night they stopped and nothing happened all night so I forgot about it . Next day I had like 2-3 charges throughout the day . Since then it 's been between 1-3 charges a day . I went to my provider ( MTN in Europe ) and ask the guy at the counter what 's wrong . I know I do n't leave my data on , plus it would take more than 1c if I left it on by accident . He told me that Android phones have this issue sometimes where the data will turn on for a split second , I wo n't see it happen because it 's so short and I 'll only get charged a cent . He said the only way to get rid of this issue is to completely disable 4G from being an option . I do use it here and there to look something up so I did n't disable it just yet but if I ca n't figure out a solution I might just have to . What could be causing this ?

12084182,rapecounseling,"Do n't really need rape counseling with this post but since relationships might not want to deal with my post , here it is . Also to state , the rape in question happened when I was 11 , I 'm 26 now . Here 's the original post I had : Why do some people think that because rape is n't so bad compared to something else , it therefore is n't so bad at all ... ? This concept just baffles me . Last night I ( 26 ) was out with some friends I 've been hanging with lately . Rick ( 19 ) , a friend of a friend that I 've known for some time , have hung out a few times lately and sometimes with his friends . I moved back home 2 months ago and did n't really have anyone to hang with so my friend suggested I hang with him since he has nothing to do either . Anna ( Rick 's gf ) is a really quiet girl , she comes out and just tags along with whatever we do . And then there 's Dave who 's also Rick 's friend . So last night we went to some exhibition , checked it out and then at 9 there was a movie and discussion thing at another place that we go to once a week and we had time to kill so we just sat somewhere and talked . Me and Rick really started disagreeing about a lot of things , but whatever , it happens , everyone 's got their opinion , until he started talking about rape . First he said how rape is n't so bad . Me and Dave lost it , 'what do you mean rape is n't so bad ? ' Anna being quiet and just absorbing everything . Rick says 'Well , compared to getting your vagina sewed shut , rape is n't so bad ' Well duhh if I had to chose between rape and my vagina sewed shut , I 'd chose rape , but in the grand scheme of things , rape is fucked up and wrong . And it should n't be said that it 's not bad . So Dave says how Rick does n't know what he 's talking about since he 's never experienced it and Rick says how he 'd rather have a rape experience , which he said was 'temporary physical trauma ' than his finger chopped off . Me and Dave said how there 's emotional trauma too , and his response was 'emotional trauma is far from physical trauma ' At this point I just lost it , and started yelling and grabbed him really hard ( he was sitting in front of me , a step below me ) and I was crying/wailing . When I finally managed to compose myself , I explained how I 'd rather have my finger chopped off than 10 years of emotional torture that I suffered , and then cried more and kept apologizing , I guess because I was embarrassed of making a scene in front of them all . Dave kept saying how I should n't be sorry , why am I sorry ? It was just so overwhelming , I thought back to all that I went through , and explained how I could n't even let someone close to me hug me for the longest time , even that was impossible for me and then we had this awkward silence for a while . No one said anything . I wanted to break the silence and say that everything was fine , but it was n't and I did n't know how . So after some time Rick asks if we should go , and we 're like , alright . He gets up , asks if I 'm okay and before I could say anything more than 'yeah ' he starts talking about something like nothing happened . I hated it . The rest of the night was fine , as usual , and I tried to act like nothing happened but driving Rick and Anna home there was this silence , and the only thing Rick said was thanks for the ride and see ya or something to that effect , I did n't really pay attention , nor did I care to . Told my best friend today who 's sorta friends with him ( well , our other best friend is close to him as a family friend so that 's how we know him ) , and he got so upset when I said I had a breakdown because of him . I did n't really tell him what happened right away just that I was angry at him and that I was over it , but when he got angry and said he was going to kill him ( figuratively ) , and I explained what happened since he asked , I realized I was n't over it and it was all coming back and I felt so uncomfortable and thought , how could someone even think something like that ? He said that he would n't know if he could be friends with him after something like that if it were him . I honestly do n't know either . I want to explain why he 's wrong , and how that affected me so he can see things differently , but I do n't know if it 's going to affect him or if I should even bother . I feel like the only way I can keep being friends is if I explain why I reacted the way I did and why I think that he 's wrong in thinking that emotional and physical trauma are separate and they are not correlated . I get that he 's entitled to his opinion , and if he 'd want to be raped over his finger chopped off , that 's fine . But to state that rape is nothing and there 's no emotional trauma involved and that it 's not correlated to physical trauma just bothers the fuck out of me . and I get that as a guy , he 's taught to repress any physical stuff and not let it get emotional and that emotional stuff might not be real , but that does n't mean he should state that it 's true for everyone . Ahh . Any advice ? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way ? My best friend agrees with me but I know that he 's also experienced rape as a kid and that he might just feel this way because he 's thinking back to his own experiences and he does n't have that whole 'you need to suppress emotions ' thing that most guys have . So I want to know if his reaction was justified , but so far Dave and my best friend think he was out of line , but somehow I feel like maybe I 'm just overreacting .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Starts itself in Artist mode , not album mode . I want to listen to a specific band , not album . Maybe the majority is the opposite , but not me . ( not too important but nice to have ) 2 . When loading said band/artist , do n't force me to pick a specific album or chose all songs . Have them all there , categorized under album , so I can just pick a song without having to make another touch to get to all the songs . 3 . When past 5-10 seconds of a song and I click the skip back button , I want to restart the song , not go to the previous one . First five seconds , fine , I 'll go to the previous one and play it again . ( this would be really handy , so used to windows programs that do that ) 4 . On the lock screen , I do n't need an extra screen with song info , only to exit that one and get to my regular lock screen and then finally get to my device , so if it has this option , I 'd like to be able to disable it so I only have one lock screen to go through . ( sometimes I need to get to my device fast ) 5 . When I pause a song and want to skip through to find another song , do n't auto play each song . I paused for a reason so I would n't hear 2 seconds of each song as passing through . Keep it paused until I press play when I reach the song of choice . ( definitely a plus )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"We dated for about 6 months , I moved in with him and then we broke up but stayed roommates for about another 6 months ( his abuse made it hard to leave ) . He 's in jail now which is why I 'm able to leave without feeling bad for hurting his feelings and ditching him when he 's all alone and depressed and you get it ... Here 's the thing , while we were dating I had a tooth problem . I was waiting on my dad to send money so I could go to the dentist ( around 3-4k for all treatments ) , but in the meantime my tooth hurt so bad one day that it was impossible to do anything from the pain . I ended up at an emergency 24 dentist and you guessed it , he charged like almost the same amount just for one tooth that was aching ( whereas I was going to get multiple teeth done for that amount at a regular dentist ) . My ex pays and says I 'll just pay him when I get the money . Then when I got the money he said it was more important to get my teeth fixed and just give him what 's left over and pay him back later since he 's okay with money and I need my teeth fixed . Note that around this time my mom had a surgery and my dad had to shell out roughly around 10k for that , so money was tight for him ( he 's also paying for my education in full which is n't too cheap ) . My ex had no problem waiting . I went away for the summer to see my family ( right after he got jailed ) and now that I 'm back , I went to see him . He knew that I had some plan of moving out but I guess he did n't realize the extent of it . First he was saying how I should stay and that he 'll tell his mom to not charge me for staying in his house ( he owns it , and I was paying him rent ) , and that I can save up to move out properly , etc ... and even saying I do n't have to pay him back since I brought up how I still owe him and I 'll do what I can to get it to him . Since then he 's called twice to talk ( threeway call with his parents ) and has I suppose noticed my stern tone and me avoiding certain topics like coming to see him and moving out . I told him that it is happening for certain and most likely middle of the month and how it 's a lot cheaper ( so I have another reason for moving out ) . Then he goes , well do n't forget to save up so you can pay me back . Ahhh ... I have no issue paying him back , I just hate how first he tries to keep me around by letting me know I do n't have to pay him and not rent , but then wants the money cause he knows when I move out I can just lose all contact with him and now I 'm forced to contact him to give the money , and he 'll want to know where I am , and I plan on changing my number which is n't going to help . What can I do ? Our relationship was pretty much him being controlling ( from my/our finances , to outings/shopping decisions ) , and possessive ( if I 'm out with friends , he 's at home sulking and wondering what I 'm up to , and why I 'm having fun while he 's depressed ) , to him saying 'I did this and that for you ( which I never asked for and even told him not to ) and you do what for me ? ' -- - **tl ; dr** : If I stay in my ex 's house , I apparently do n't have to pay rent or pay him back , but if I leave , I have to pay him back since my rent is significantly cheaper than what I was paying him . I do n't want to deal with him and his psychological ways of keeping me around .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,travel,"So my friend was looking for flights to Miami , and he did n't want to search for flights from his origin ( Georgia , Europe ) but from any other big city in Europe that would have cheap flights to Miami . We tried everything , but the most we could get was a website that let you search nearby airports and had the option from a distance of 2,000 miles . It was able to show me that flights existed but failed to load them or tell me which airport it was leaving from .

I want you to come over and let me take pictures of you . It wo n't be anything weird like having you strip or anything - merely you going around my apartment doing normal things . It 's for my benefit only - it wo n't be posted on the Internet or anything of that sort . I know this may seem really weird to you and you have every reason to think that and back out if you wish . But I can assure you that it wo n't be anything outside of your comfort zone and believe me when I say it 's even weirder for me to be letting someone in on this . But like I said , I trust you enough to not go and spread the word . Please let me know if you 're willing to do this huge favor for me , and if you are , then we can arrange for you to swing by . I 'm free tomorrow ( tuesday ) ; it would be best to meet when the sun is still up , so anywhere from 12 noon to 4pm works . If you are not willing to do this , then please keep this all to yourself . Thanks in advance !

You want Kathy to come over ? haha his : You had posted this and commented on it : ( an article I posted about why people have the urge to squeeze/hug and get aggressive when seeing cute animals in pictures - an article I posted like 3-4 months back so he clearly thought about it for a while ) Pffft hahaha no , not Kathy , just you . ( Kathy was my roommate she was obese , in case he was into that stuff , I mentioned her ) me : Ohhh that thing hahaha Ca n't your gf do it ? haha ( he 's had a girlfriend ever since I 've known him - about 2 years ago ) him : She does n't even know about it . I plan to tell her , just not now . Right now , all that concerns you is whether or not you 're willing to do it . ( Why me ? Is he attracted to me ? Why could n't he tell his girlfriend about it ? ) me : Right now , I 'm wondering if you 're being serious or not . haha ( seriously , I was so confused with his message ) him : I would n't have revealed something so personal in jest . ( That means I 'm being serious ) But I leave it up to you to decide whether or not you want to do this . It wo n't offend me if you decline , so long as you promise to tell no one . If you accept , however , I would be eternally grateful . Me : Why me ? And you just want to take pictures of my feet or what ? him : Well I have to start doing this with SOMEbody , it might as well be with someone I trust . You seemed pretty lax about the whole fetish thing ( what does that article I posted have to do with fetishes ? Maybe I do n't remember commenting on it ) , and you 're trustworthy , so why not ? And it would n't be just feet , it would kind of be you just going about my apt . I 'd say mainly feet and face . It 'll make sense as we go along ( I hope : P ) -- -- -- -- - I am so confused right now . How do I proceed ? I feel it 's inappropriate as he has a girlfriend , and I do n't know . It 's weird as hell that he wants pictures of me , my feet and face . What ? I 'm not giant by the way , I 'm normal . 5'6 '' 180 pounds . He 's around my height . I have no clue how to react to this . We 're good friends , but we do n't hang out as often as we used to ( last I saw him was around 3 weeks ago ) cause we have different classes now and things conflict , but we used to hang often with a group of friends , rarely alone . tl ; dr : Friend admits he has a foot/giant fetish and wants to take pictures of me .

12084182,legaladvice,"My bf decided a while back that we did n't need two cars , and can manage to get to school and stuff with just one in order to save money - he lost is job so we did n't really have an option . We decided to find someone to pay off my truck for me and then keep it . We found someone , wrote up a contract on paper , took photos of his and our ID 's and that was that . 500 $ a month . First month , late payment . Second month , late again . Third month , no payment as of yet , ( should have been on the 25th of last month ) . ( I 'm guessing using late payments as a means of buying time ) Ahhh ... Cops wont do anything , cop came over one day and we filed a complaint , said he needs to deal with the matter otherwise in 10 days it becomes theft . Then we got a call that because it was a civil matter , they ca n't do anything . But we do n't know where he is , if we did , it would be fine , but we do n't , so it 's not really a civil matter . The whole contract thing screwed us up and therefore the police wont do anything about it . We started going to all known addresses , everyone is clearly covering for him . Looked up addresses online , hired an investigator to look him up , either he does n't live at an address or no one knows where he is , or even has his number . He 's deleted his number , his dad 's deleted his number , there 's just nothing there . We ca n't reach them anymore . We received a toll a while back , showing that he was in Miami and failed to pay a toll . Investigator found us some address in Miami to check out . We ended up calling a repo service and they said they would search Miami for us so we do n't have to go down ( It 's a 4 hour drive ) The other day we noticed there was an old ad of his on craigslist that he 's selling a bed ( had his old number on it ) and I started messaging him from my email as he does n't know who I am , and from google voice , I set up a number , so he 's texting me , and setting up a meeting . During our conversations I mentioned I was moving from Miami and that I did n't have a car . and then he goes 'I work at a dealership , I can hook you up with a car ' which now makes me think he 's sold the car and that 's why he could n't have delivered it because he does n't drive a truck . We 've considered telling the repo man to say we already got the car back and he stole it again , and at that point be able to report him for theft . But I 'm sure he wont and if we get caught out , we 'll be screwed so that 's not really an option . My bf is getting really impatient , we 're trying a ping service today so they can tell us his exact location , but if that does n't work out he 's gon na just tell the cops that we got it back ourselves and he stole it . I really do n't want to get into a giant mess of lies , what can we do ?

Nonetheless I 'm here because she 's always been there for me and helped me out when I needed it and I 'm forever greatful to her for that . I do n't know how to knock some sense into her , so I 'm hoping you guys could help me . She was seeing an intructor at our university , who happens to be teaching me currently . He said he loved her , that whole thing , they saw each other all the time , she fell for him . Kicker ? He has a gf of 12 years who he 's engaged to . Promises to leave her , he 's not up for it , she 's forcing him etc ... I told her to stay away , it 's bad news , he 's not gon na change . She might be pregnant , he purposefully did it and even told her and she showed me conversations where he explicitly states he wants a baby and a new life with her . I got another friend to message him and hit on him , and he took bait and talked dirty to her . I showed my friend who got super pissed and got angry at him , he 's a liar . Example , when my friend messaged him , he right away stated he was in love with someone not on his friends list ( her ) but then decided to hit on her and showed my friend only the first portion of the conversation where he explains he 's in love with her . What a sneaky bastard . Of course I showed her everything , and ended up with my other friend messaging his girlfriend when he was at work and letting her know what happened and he 's a cheat . No response , but she saw the message . She was very pissed and was not going to talk to him and possibly ruin his reputation and everything , but today she says they 're talking again and that she loves him and that she does n't want her baby to grow up without a daddy like she did . I said would you rather a psycho daddy ( he has some anger management issues ) or no daddy . She said she 'd make him change , she refuses to believe that he 's not the man she met . To describe him in a nutshell ( from my experience with such a relationship , and she agreed he 's like this ! ! ! ! ) , he 's the type of person that acts all nice to get you , then shows his true colors and does n't give a shit , then when you threaten to leave , he promises things will change and sweet talks all over again . Then you find out certain things or confront him , he gets pissed and says you 're at fault and gets angry at you for not trying hard enough or not aknowledging his efforts for the relationship , but then when you try to leave again , oh there he is , the nice man you fell for , he 's there after all .

12084182,ADHD,"I have no idea how to go about doing this . I used to take meds back home years ago . I 've tried a few different kinds and found that Ritalin worked the best . That was in Europe . I got off the meds and did n't do anything for a while and it was more or less okay , my symptoms are not extreme , but they do affect daily activities . I 'm currently studying here in the U.S. , specifically in Florida , and I 'm considering going back on my meds as I feel I 'm getting progressively worse . Also , my boyfriend is getting more and more frustrated , well observant of my situation . He always brings it up when I 'm distracted or forget to do something ( which is 90 % of the time ) since he 's the exact opposite of me , he is naturally 110 % focused and alert about everything . I frequently forget to do things he tells me to do or mess them up . Example , I often forget to put the sponge in the sink , a huge pet peeve of his as everything has to be clean and orderly , and I 'm not like that . I forget important things such as going somewhere and forgetting to bring something I needed to bring for that task such as a document . Or even simpler , putting laundry in the machine and forgetting to put detergent and washing a load without it . I 'm not focusing well in classes as well , even if they are really interesting . I also tend to be distracted so I mishear things often or do n't hear them at all when he 's speaking to me and he ends up just saying 'it 's not important ' and then does n't tell me and it gets annoying . I have no idea how to go about getting meds though cause I really do n't want to pay someone to prescribe them to me as it might be expensive , I 've seen cheap medication online but from what I 've understood , it 's illegal to order medication from online pharmacies .

12084182,ADHD,"My roommate and I both have ADD . I 've had mine since I can remember and I used to take medication for it but have since stopped . When I first got off the meds , my symptoms were really bad , like I 'd forget car keys in the car door and then spend an hour looking for them only to find they 're in the door . Leave the house without half my stuff , forget that I 've done stuff so I 'd do it again or not at all thinking I have . But with time I got better at it and spoke to psychologists and learned techniques and can now more or less do most of those things fairly well . My roommate on the other hand takes some seizure meds that supposedly give her ADD according to her doctor . She is so forgetful it 's almost frustrating , I 've learned to make habits of things , like turning off the lights in the bathroom when I 'm done . She however ca n't . Every time I bring up a pet peeve like how the bathroom floor is soaked after she showers , she says that she just wont remember to clean up or dry in the bath so it does n't happen and it 's just how she is . She forgot her house keys on several occasions and was locked out . She left the stove on a few times , once I came home to the house in smoke , and she burnt my pot , which had her coffee in it . She says that there 's nothing she can do , no technique will work because her meds force her brain to act that way , it 's not a natural state therefore there 's nothing she can do to change that . I think she 's just not wanting to even try . I 'd get it if she actually tried , and then said , sorry , it 's just too hard , fine , I 'd understand , I was as bad once , and it took a lot of effort to get to where I am now , but she 's not even trying to be mindful . Do you feel there 's a difference between the two , is her state the same as mine or is it different because there 's a different cause ? She said her doctor does n't recommend meds because she already takes different types of seizure meds and is on progesterone and some other stuff and it would n't go well .

12084182,Epilepsy,"So I was reading [ this article ] ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923147/ ) today about out of body experiences and epilepsy and it struck me as odd . A few years back , let 's say 4-5 years ago , I had a period where I 'd dream that I 'm awake and doing my morning routine , I 'd get up , take a shower , do whatever in the bathroom then get back into bed , nap a little more and then go to classes or whatever . One day by chance my friend and I discussed something and he said there 's no way I was showering at 10am as he was late to work and was up at 10am still at home . And I came to a conclusion as he mentioned that lately I had not been up at all until a certain point ( other roommate pointed it out ) that I had dreamt it all . I thought it was odd . It did n't last long though and stopped completely until recently . Now I 've graduated college 2 months ago and moved in with my mom and sister , who 's also come home to help with her as she 's old and needs care . I got her this squeaky dog toy so if she needs me from another room I can hear her ( she 's gotten real quiet and sometimes I want to watch something or she 's watching something ) and suddenly it became a trigger in my sleep . I 'd hear the squeak and know it 's her and realize I 'm dreaming but wake up and help her only to realize that I never woke up , she 'd squeak again and I 'd realize I 'm sleeping and wake up for real . Once I dreamt that she squaked , I got up , and realized she had fallen while wanting to go to the bathroom and I got her back up and went back to bed . The next day I asked her how she felt after the fall , and she goes 'what fall ? ' She never fell in the night . And now sometimes I just dream that I 'm up , helping her out , getting her breakfast and her meds ready only to have her wake me up and tell me she wants her breakfast . So I 'm wondering if it has any relation to my epilepsy or it 's random . Has anyone else had experiences like this ? I did n't even know it could relate to epilepsy until I randomly stumbled upon that article today . I have absence seizures and currently take 1000mgs of Keppra .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Dentistry,"So about a year ago I had some major stuff done to my teeth . I went to a dentist at my moms village that was cheap and he said I had more to be done but since I was only visiting for a week he said he did the major stuff and next year I can get the rest done and he thinks it 'll be fine for a year . Now I 'm back home for the summer but in the city ( my parents have an apartment in the city and my mom has her parents summer house in a village ) . I went to a dentist my sister goes to , she says he 's great , blah blah . He looked at scans of my teeth I did before the visit , said he really liked the work the previous dentist did , and all I needed were my fillings replaced as they were reaching their expiry date and falling apart . Alright , cool . First time just bottom right side . Second time bottom left . ( two teeth each time ) . Second visit he says for the top it 's easy , he can do both sides at once with anesthetic , unlike the bottom which has to be done separately for whatever reason so I 'll only have one more visit and he 'll also give me a nightguard for my bruxism . Great ! Next visit though he only does top right . I find that odd , but maybe he was just making a remark how the top does n't need to be done separately and never intended to do both sides . Gets the imprint for my guard thing and fixes my filling a bit ( from previous visit ) as I felt my bite was a bit weird . When he did my bottom and top right side , I had no problems , even after the visit , after the anesthetic wore off , no pain . Left side though , one tooth , as he was drilling , just kept being sensitive , he said it 's probably under too much stress . So I figured , okay , that must be it . Then after the visit , it kept hurting a few nights in a row , oddly enough right as I want to sleep , so I 'd take an ibuprofen and then finally it went away but the cold issue came in . Cold water makes my left side feel weird . Sometimes it 's the bottom part , my jaw area , sometimes it 's even the top part where he did n't even do anything to my teeth . My sister schedules a visit for general cleaning and so I can ask him stuff . He cleans my teeth , massages my gums or whatever . My sister made an off comment to him how I have breath issues and maybe something 's still up , and he said the spacing between my teeth is really tight , and that 's was what caused breath because I do n't floss enough and remove the food that 's stuck there . But when we got in the car , I said how he forgot to tell me why my gums are sensitive to cold , and she said it was the teeth spacing but then I told her it only started after he worked on my bottom tooth and now I do n't know why I 'm still sensitive to it . Do I have a problem ? Or is it normal to take a bit longer for some teeth to recover from all the drilling ? I do n't get my upper gums feel sensitive too at times even though he never touched my upper teeth at all . tl ; dr : Went for change of fillings , one tooth was more sensitive than the others during filling change . Since then ( a month ago ) my whole left side has become sensitive to cold and it took a while for the pain in my tooth to subside while other teeth that had fillings had no pain afterward .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I want to remove the unwanted tones but also want to help my hair get stronger so I can bleach it a second time in two weeks so I can add color . Can I use both ?

I said how it 's 3 a day but it 's a smaller dosage , resulting in a smaller overall amount of the medicine despite the increase in frequency . She got very frustrated with me , despite showing her the doctors orders , and said that I was reading it wrong but finally gave in and accepted what I said . She was on the verge of crying out of frustration because she could n't understand the situation and what I was saying was too confusing for her to comprehend . On the upside , she 's also on Prozac which makes her laugh at everything , even when I 'm telling her off for repeating things she should n't . It 's very frustrating to deal with this situation , I 'd like to help her with her hand , and my sister who was with her until I got here , said she 's trying to get her to go to physical therapy again . Any advice ? How do I stop myself from getting too frustrated , I 'm not a very patient person .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,CasualConversation,"This was the third university I attended . First one did n't even last a year , realized it totally was n't what I wanted . Second university lasted 3 years , pretty much so close to graduation but it felt so generalized and useless . I liked the content but it was just basics of a dozen different things . I did n't learn anything I could apply towards a specific job , I 'd need to go for a masters . Finally found my calling and attended a hybrid degree , where I graduate in under 4 years in exchange for new classes every month , it was intense but it paid off and I 'm finally graduating from something . Was supposed to graduate in 2.5 years ( if you do n't take breaks , the school is year round ) , but considering my parents wanted me home every summer ( different country ) I graduated in 3 . I 'm glad my parents finally get to see me do something with my life . I felt like I was n't going to go anywhere ( I 'm 25 now ) or find something that sticks .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,CasualConversation,"So , met this dude at this place I was volunteering at a while back , briefly talked , though he seemed really friendly . Girl from said place adds me on Facebook , turns out she added a lot of people , including him . Thought he was cute so added him , had an excuse to . Profile did n't seem like he was in a relationship currently , no info , but it did show that he was with this girl for years from what I gathered , but any recent activity , past month or so made him seem like he was single or broken up . About a month ago he messaged me , seemed like he wanted to have fun . So we met up , and then he never called again like he said he would to meet up , and I figured , asshole , whatever . Was n't looking for anything serious anyway cause I just got out of a 5 year relationship . Then yesterday I randomly think of him and go check his profile , and his profile pic is with his gf , the one I saw pics of before but assumed they 'd broken up . In the comments , his buddy is like , why do n't we hang anymore ? he says he 's annoyed with him for not being able to keep his mouth shut like telling gf about the hooker on his bike . Then she 's like , well it 's okay now , we were having a rough patch , I said I was fine with it . I 'm pretty sure that was me he referenced . So I wanted to post this here and ended up busy all day yesterday , and guess who happened to message me this morning ? asking if I 'm down for some fun and to chill . Not cool dude ... Also , my last message to him was kinda irritated cause we were supposed to hang the next day and he never even contacted me to at least say he was n't interested , and I blew up on him . And he had the audacity to message me again , all the while having her as his profile pic . I 'm not some desperate whore , it just gets lonely after living with someone for so long and then being all alone , and with graduation right around the corner , do n't have time for a relationship .

I do n't remember much because , I was really little when I saw this but I 'd like to find out what it is . To the best of my knowledge I remember there was a sleepover and the girls got into a fight , one girl storms out of her friends house and runs down the street . Mom comes over , find out she 's run off and starts going after her . I think it 's a 90s movie or earlier . Could be wrong . She 's running to try and find the girl , down the street , and I recall her ending up at some dude 's house , and she finds him in the basement , I think she knows him , and he 's a killer , and he 's digging soil in his basement , and she 's bugging him if he 's seen her little girl . I do n't know if there was anything between them and that 's why she knows him , I really ca n't remember much .

12084182,Epilepsy,"Just looking for other people 's stories . Started last night . Took one dose , first three days I 'll be taking just one dose to adapt and then 2 doses a day . Woke up with swollen eyes and was too tired to get up , could n't even change my alarm , which is what I usually do if I 'm tired , set it for 5 mins later ( rare though , if I have to be up for something specific , I 'm up ) . ( had ~7 hours of sleep , not unusual but prefer 8 ) Woke up 35 mins later and got up . Went to the bathroom , stumbled a bit by the door . Maybe I 'm just so tired , maybe it 's the meds . Felt like farting later . Everyone farts , but this felt really strong , and it was ! Did n't eat anything out of the usual . Rest of the day would occasionally get knots in my stomach and feel like I might need the bathroom . Thankfully nothing happened there . Maybe it 's the meds , maybe something else . Only thing I could n't find under symptoms , I found stomach upset , but no farting . Maybe that counts . Came home , passed out , slept for a good 4 or so hours . Woke up , found my left eye to be swollen a bit . I guess I 'm a bit drowsy , but not a whole lot , just tiredness I guess . Took my next dose like 2 hours ago . I hope tomorrow 's better . Might be worse , oh well . Really do n't like this tiredness thing , my line of work requires not a lot of sleep and energy . Tomorrow night is my last night of a single dose . From then on I start morning doses too . I 'm on 500mg for starters , then it 'll keep going up until I reach my needed dose . I have staring spells , which is why I 'm taking this . At least I do n't have anger outbursts , that was my biggest worry as I irritate easily . Apparently the side effects subside within 4 weeks , get weaker so I 'm hoping that 's the case . Edit : Second day , right eye is n't swollen or even hurting to touch anymore , but left eye is swollen some more and hurts . Also itchy . Slight sore throat . Had a mild headache/earache this morning . Or , more like pressure on the head . No other symptoms , farted a bit ago , so I know that 's still ongoing , but less than before . Stomach still twists on occasion . Second Edit : So , turns out the whole eye thing was a completely separate thing . I got a [ stye ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye ) in my eye , literally right as I started taking Keppra so I assumed it was a side effect , but turns out a pore on my eyelid got blocked so that happened . And my stomach being upset was just my period happening , and I guess I did n't realize it cause I was too focused on the meds and trying to see what side effects I was getting . They probably affected how I felt too so I did n't recognize the usual symptoms .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"So I 've got this downstairs neighbor in a wheelchair . One day me and my roommate were throwing a get-together , and not being sure how many people would show up , we decided to tell our downstairs neighbors we were having a party and if there 's any issues with noise to let us know . Both neighbors were fine , but the one in question asked for a beer . Sure , no problem . Brought him a beer and piece of cake . Another day , I 'm heading up and he calls out to me and requests my roommate , she comes down and it turns out he was hoping she knew where to get weed or wanted to split some good stuff with him . She called me over in case I knew and we ended up talking to him a bit . He used to be in a band , but had a stroke so now he 's just bedridden in his apartment . He added us on Facebook and took her number . And then the calls started . One day we went downstairs to hang , brought some drinks , talked to him , he 's cool but clearly very bored and lonely . Takes him 10 mins to get ready and up from his bed to open the door . He 's limited . Some dude comes to check up on him regularly and takes him outside in the parking lot for some air . Anyway , to cut things short , he 's called the other day to see if we could grab him some groceries when we head out . Never headed out . My roommate got annoyed that he only had her number , and bugged me to give him mine too so she 's not the only one harassed . So yesterday he called for us to get him something that he dropped . And this morning at 6:30 bright and early he called . Really ? To note , he did work in our industry , we 're both students and he has good connections , especially for me . He even knows someone that works at my university in the career development department , and wants to introduce me to them . So I feel like he 's using that as leverage to get what he needs . Sure , it 'd be nice to know someone that could get me a job , but I do n't know if I want to be woken up at 6:30am for something .

Anyway , she wants me to deal with them as just the other day she went to complain how they locked the laundry room with her clothes still in it and did n't open it all weekend , and she got really mad , and thinks they wont want to do anything for her ( they do keep a sign that it closes after 5 and is n't open on weekends ) . As well as the fact that it 's the 3rd time this is happening . So I have to go and sign it . She claims it 'll only take a few seconds , but I know it 'll feel like years . It 's been ages since I 've had a proper panic attack . I went from getting them from ordering pizza , even if I had all possible conversation outcomes written out on paper , to dealing with most situations somewhat comfortably . But I still do n't like dealing with awkward situations like this which is why I try and avoid them as much as possible . I have a full schedule at school this week , which was supposed to work in my favor , but she got mad and said that if I do n't do it , they will evict us and probably wont let her sign shit .

She was silent as ever .

It 's like talking to a wall but you know it can hear you , and he liked that . But then he realized that there 's more to a relationship than that , and figured he should break it off since he was n't even sure what they were to begin with . When he said that , I was like , what ? Did you not even discuss if you were in a relationship or not ? Everyone thought that , and they always came out with us and were like a couple ... It was just a given , but I guess they never officially discussed it . Anyway , he starts to suspect that this other dude she was hanging with that he knew sorta , might have a thing for her and decided he 'd rather not know and just break it off . He was planning to go to the mountains one day , see snow , and he asked her if she wanted to come . She said she had plans .

Remind yourself to do something for your future self so you have something to be thankful and look forward to . Think of your future self as your best friend . Your past you is your best friend too , he 's done favors for you . Remember to forgive yourself if you did not manage to do something . You tried hard , but you still did n't do it .

Second year of show pro is amazing , you get to do all the lighting stuff , live sound , and video , and bands come in all the time and you help set up actual concerts weekly . You can even volunteer before then , but generally to get a specific position you need to have passed a class for that , so until second year you 're basically a stagehand .

Then I found another place that had 2 more tires but different sizes and they said they were compatible with my car . 2 weeks later I got my dad to go with me to take my car for a check up ( thought a problem I had was the suspension as the car feels every bump and pothole on the road , but no , they said it 's fine , nothing I should worry about ) and he asked them if we should change my tires ( different place to any other that I 've been to when I got my tires ) and they said although the tires are n't of a good brand , they 're in ok shape for now so they would n't change them .

How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them .

I just hope I don ’ t get sucked in to being stuck with no progress because I end up living paycheck to paycheck . I can freelance , but that 's very unpredictable . I have three other attempted degrees , so maybe I can try and finish one of those ( saves time , instead of spending another 4 in a university , since I 'm 26 and already kind of old to not have held a job in a field of study ) but that 's also time wasting . I ’ m currently back under my parents roof and daily think about how homelessness would be better than this ( we do n't get along ) and that I should just move out and figure things out . But I have nowhere to go , can ’ t drive for a while until my medical tests come back as safe to drive . So can ’ t take a car either . I think about ending it all but then I remember the things I have to look forward to . My best friend of 10 years now , is finally seeing his life looking up and it ’ s because of me among other people/things . It ’ s something that gives me hope every day , knowing I ’ m the reason he ’ s still alive and here for me . I also think about this kid I took in , who was homeless , and had nowhere to go . I saw something in him , I wanted to help him somehow . Knowing what it felt like to have nowhere to go and feel worthless was something I didn ’ t want anyone to have to experience . I gave him a place to stay for a bit , and told him to apply for jobs daily and make something of himself . Find a way to finish high school and do something more . I wonder how he is , if he ’ s okay . We lost touch but he could n't have been more grateful that I came along and gave him something , hope , a home , something to look forward to . I ’ m jealous in a way that even though he was homeless and on the street , he managed to get away from his parents and get away from the abuse and didn ’ t give in to the manipulation . I also think about how I can find someone that 'll stay with me as both a best friend and partner . I ’ ve had some odd life choices and it makes it hard to open up to people because I fear they ’ ll reject my past . I also have issues with emotional abuse , I ’ ve been dealing with it my whole life with my mom and it ’ s affected all my relationships too , I always end up with those types , and I just end up giving in to their tactics and am too nice to do anything about it . I ’ ve learned my lesson though and am not letting it get to me , but for a while I was stuck in this pattern where people would manipulate me to stay in the relationship . I don ’ t care if we lack a social life because we ’ re both struggling to make something of ourselves , I just want us to have each other and be happy . My last ex tried to kill himself because of our break-up ( manipulation tactic , not really wanting to die… ) and I still can ’ t get over that . It was so hard because I still cared about him as a person . I was supposed to fly out to visit my sister , which he knew would result in me just leaving ( he was going away for a while , and figured I ’ d move out while he ’ s gone ) . So me missing my flight to be in the hospital with him was a sign of hope that I still cared and wanted to be with him . He changed himself for the relationship , he turned into someone he wasn ’ t just to get me to like him more but that made me like him even less . And I have this constant paranoia of ending up in a relationship where the person keeps doing that . Just be yourself . I ’ m tired of people suddenly being like me because they fear I ’ ll leave them because there ’ s nothing there . Do n't suddenly read books because you think I 'll like you more for reading them . I know you hate reading them so do n't torture yourself so I can stay . It 's weird . You might try and turn into all the things I want from a partner , but it ’ ll never be real . I ’ ll always want someone who ’ s just themselves around me and I ’ m myself and we never have to hide or be fake to feel like the other person will stay . I ’ m not changing for you , and I don ’ t expect you to change for me . If you change , change for the better , make better habits , be a better person for YOU . Not for me . So I think about that . Also friendships . I ’ m so busy all the time and the friends I ’ ve had have mostly left or are busy themselves , have gone their own ways and are doing other things with their closer friends . The few friends I do have that want to hang all the time aren ’ t as intellectually stimulating as I ’ d like or are n't doing anything worthwhile . They just sit around high all day and do nothing worthwhile for the most part . I have friends I can have a good conversation with , but now that they 're working and busy , they 're always tired and weekends involve sitting in a coffee shop chatting instead of activities like camping/picnics or going out like we used to . I want to make new friends but because I get busy at times and am not sure when I ’ m free it makes it harder because I don ’ t want people to get the wrong idea that I ’ m not interested . Also I don ’ t know if I ’ m staying here for now or leaving ( I want to leave as soon as possible but I know I need a job first to save up money and get medical stuff in order , I live in a small island in the middle of nowhere and it makes it hard to do anything here , small population and all ) but if I make friends , and then have to move , it ’ ll just be so much harder . I guess I hope I find people that are as busy as me or understanding of my situation so when we do hang out , it ’ s worthwhile and we understand if one of us can ’ t . So yeah , those are some of the things I think about .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"I miss my dog too though he passed away last year . I was in a different country due to studies and I was always down about not being able to see him . I could n't take him with as he had health issues and was old , and probably would n't want to be in an unfamiliar environment . He was in a place for old dogs in the end because of the medical issues as my parents could n't devote the time to his health every day , kind of like an old people 's home for dogs . But his health got to the point that we had to put him down . I still remember my dads phone call to me ( who had never really been an animal person his whole life , and only got close to the dog as an effort to get close to me and fix our relationship which is nonexistent ) , telling me that he went to see him one last time and could n't do it as he thought Whiskey ( my dog ) would have hope that he was coming home . ; ( Hearing that coming from my dad of all people that I have no relationship with made it all the much harder .

12084182,AskReddit,"Also , do n't forget to be grateful to the three you 's : there 's the past you , the present you , and the future you . Be grateful to the past you for the positive things you 've done . And do favors for the future you like you would for your best friend . Not feeling so good today ? Stop a second , think of a good decision you made yesterday . Thank you younger me . Second part of the 3 me 's is you have to do your future self a favor , just like you would for your best friend ( Remember : You have got two . its future and past you ) . Tired and ca n't get yourself to stop wasting time ? Do it for your future self , I 'm going to exercise X for 17 minutes . I 'm doing this one for future me . Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfortable ? I do n't care about my present self , this one 's for my best friend , the future self . I 'm up and going for that run I kept telling myself I 'd do . Don ’ t forget to thank your old self for doing good at the end of every , single , thing . That makes your life better . The cycle of doing something for someone else ( future you ) and thanking someone for the good in your life ( past you ) is key to building gratitude and productivity . Remember to forgive yourself if you did not succeed in something . You tried hard , but you still did n't do it . Now you 're giving yourself a hard time for not doing what you need to , to be who you want to . You might give yourself a hard time for not doing something you had planned to do . Heads up Sibur , being disappointed in yourself causes you to be less productive . Tried your best to have a day where you at least got one thing done and it failed ? So what ? I forgive you previous self . I forgive you . But today ? Today is a day where I get as much done as possible to the best of my ability for future self . This one 's for you future friend . Forgiveness , use it . I forgive you . Say it out loud if you need to . It helps reinforce things . Look at yourself in the mirror , look at you as a person , and admire that reflection . Appreciate it . Phew , I wrote a lot haha . It would n't even let me post because of how much I wrote ... Just went rambling ... So this ended up as a second comment .

12084182,AskReddit,"Depression is always a bitch , but you have to try and not let it get to you . We can let it swallow us up , or get up and fight it . It 's not easy , I struggle with that same fight every day , but do n't let it get to you and give in . You broke it off so clearly you had some reasons as to why you did n't see it working out , but do n't focus on the negative , focus on the positives that you 've learned from it . Maybe it took time to realize how it was affecting you and how negative the situation really was , but whatever the reasons , do n't let them get to you . Focus on the good things you 've got going on . Instead of wallowing of what could have been , think about what can be . Right now you probably have no intention of a new relationship , but it 's good to think about what you 've learned from it . If you broke up for reasons other than infidelity , there 's something to take from it , a reason why you could n't see marriage in the future anymore . Take that and focus on what you want out of the next relationship , so you when it comes along , you realize it 's what you 've been waiting for and it does n't pass you by . Do n't let the depression swallow you so you miss out on something , but also focus on other things that are important to you right now and get them done so you can stop thinking about how badly the relationship affected you . My last relationship ended with me realizing how it just was n't meant to be in the long term , and I now know what to expect of my next one . It 's painful , but you need to find a way to let go of the pain . Avoiding pain would n't be a problem if we did it once or twice a year . But for most of us , it 's a habit we 've embedded deeply into ourselves . We barricade ourselves behind an invisible wall and do n't venture out because beyond the wall is pain . I do this all the time . But you and I both need to get the strength to move on and find the motivation to get those things done that we think about . Instead of 'I should ... ' you need to say 'I will ... ' it reinforces the thought in your head that you will get it done . You might be avoiding anything that can make you feel exposed ... Avoiding facing responsibility , you hide in your comfort zone . Most people have a faulty way of motivating themselves . They ’ re motivated to get whatever they want , because they feel they don ’ t have enough already . This feeling of lacking is powerful as a motivator , but you pay a huge price for it . That price is the ongoing feeling that there ’ s always something missing . Even if you get something you ’ ve wanted , you quickly become dissatisfied with it , which then motivates you to get something else . You can never be happy on this treadmill . Eventually , it sucks the meaning and energy out of your life . So try instead of thinking that you lack something , think of what you 've got , use that to motivate you that you 've gotten so much out of life already , and there 's so much more yet to come . Pick something you hate doing . In your case it might be any of the things you mentioned , painting your walls , washing the dog . Or maybe a phone call/email you 've been delaying or running an errand you 've been asked of . Imagine that pattern is a place you hide in . That 's your comfort zone . What does it feel like ? You probably felt you were in a safe and familiar place . Free of the pain the world brings with it . This almost completely re-creates your comfort zone , but it leaves out the final ingredient . Strange as it might seem , merely escaping pain is n't enough for us . We insist the pain be replaced with pleasure . We do this with an endless array of addictive activities : internet surfing , alcohol , drugs , the aptly named `` comfort food '' . You order out , which is more likely less healthy than cooking , you might smoke , I did and it was n't all that good for me , but for those few moments , you get relaxed and feel stress free . All these behaviors are widespread - we 're an entire culture looking for it 's comfort zone . You weave those activities into your daily routine . Some get high every evening with their friends eating pizza and might feel like they 're in an alternate universe . I will never get that , but for them it works , they take one hit and the rest of the world disappears . This alternate world , which for you is different , as is for most people , feels like a soothing , pleasurable , warm bath , as if , for a moment , you 've found your way back to the womb . These `` warm-bath '' activities just cripple us further . The more you hide in the warm bath , the less willing you become to deal with the cold shower of reality . Ask yourself what your warm bath activities are . The more frequently you indulge in them , the more likely it is that you 're using them to create a comfort zone . Here 's another exercise I 'd like for you to try : Feel yourself indulging in one or more of these behaviors . Imagine the pleasure you feel lifts you into a womb-like world . How does this world affect your sense of purpose ? Think about these things . Try and change your thought process regarding them and make yourself more productive . It takes 21 days to make a habit apparently , so take one task at a time , something you are avoiding , and get into the habit of facing it daily and forcing yourself to do it . The same way you might wake up for work or class or whatever it is that you 're doing with life , you have to face other tasks . There are days we might not want to wake up at all , and just sing 'I 'm never waking up ... ' but the reality is , we have to , reality awaits and we have to face it otherwise our problems pile up and the stack of things we have to do gets bigger and bigger and we struggle harder and harder because it seems ever more daunting . The more we put things off , the harder they become to face . Think about someone you might admire . In my example it would be Elon Musk . He 's like a modern day Tesla . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla - electric car company - was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . So no ordering out , being lazy on the couch ... ( Which makes me feel like a hypocrite as I 'm writing this , as I 'm being lazy , eating delivery from this place called Burger Lab and not doing anything productive ... aha . ) But moving on , because Elon avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . He 's like an [ Ubermensch ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ % C3 % 9Cbermensch ) in a way . Always in the news with some new crazy project , and yet finding the time to have a family . The avoider , which would be you and me in this example , only care for immediate gratification ; we take no responsibility for the future . But we need to try our hardest to find a way to . The future being the things we need to get done that we 're lazy to do . That 's why you might have regrets about your past , I know I do . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . The moment you do this , you activate a force more powerful than the force to avoid pain . ( and I 'm not talking some high above force , just something within all of us , but see it as you find fitting ) Now as an avoider , like most people , we choose avoidance instead . As a result , you don ’ t live up to your potential , never becoming fully yourself . ( Just my statements , you might feel differently about this , not meant as negative criticism , just being constructive ) Like for example , my mom was always making negative remarks to me , and I tried hard to get past them and prove her wrong , but I started to feel I did n't want to be vulnerable anymore . That turned me into a limited version of who I wanted to be . I set up walls and did n't let anyone past them , and it took a long time to get over that , and I 'm still not , but I 'm trying , and I think everyone in a similar situation should do too . Just try and tap into yourself , find a center in you , and think of what you are avoiding doing , but then start to focus on how that feels , not the action itself , but how it makes you feel , and make yourself desire that pain or whatever it might be . Try and make yourself desire the feeling that what you 're avoiding is creating . You ’ ve now taken your normal desire to avoid pain and reversed it into a desire to face it . Doing this regularly will reveal the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . That ’ s why desire is a crucial part of this . It keeps you moving toward pain . You ’ re not desiring pain because you ’ re masochistic ; you ’ re desiring pain so you can shrink it . When you become confident you can do this every time , you ’ ve mastered your fear of pain . I do n't always remember to do this , but when I do , it helps me get over a task quickly and I feel satisfied knowing I 've managed to do something I 've been slacking off about . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the endless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and fuelled your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . You had one goal and nothing was stopping you from reaching it . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . Because he avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . Always in the news with some new insane project , and yet finding the time to have a family . Most of us are avoiders , we only care for immediate gratification ; and take no responsibility for the future . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . Elon has mastered the impossible , he does n't feel pain most of us do . Pain can be in the form of rejection of projects , loss of finances , etc . It manifests itself in many ways . Most of us , despite such setbacks , try to get past them , but there comes a point where we do n't want to be vulnerable anymore . And that decision makes us a limited version of who we are meant to be . Elon on the other hand has mastered facing and desiring pain . It 's not that he 's desiring having no money or his business failing , he 's facing the pain the situation creates itself . Doing this reveals the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . To quote Elon : '' when I was a little kid I was really scared of the dark . But then I came to understand , dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength-400 to 700 nanometers . Then I thought , well it 's really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons . Then I was n't afraid of the dark anymore after that . '' Desire is a crucial part of learning to conquer pain . It keeps one moving toward pain . He 's not desiring pain because he 's masochistic ; he 's desiring pain so he can shrink it . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the countless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and pursued your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of . Most of us become aware of pain and start to build up walls and comfort zones . But to be truly Elon , you need to eliminate all of that fear , and just do it ! Whatever it is , face it , and work on it , no matter what others think or say or what comes your way .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past .

But they were constantly interrupted by people asking the doctor for advice about their medical issues , surgeries , etc . After about an hour of this , the exasperated doctor asked the lawyer what he does to stop people asking him for legal advice when he 's not in his office . The lawyer responded casually `` Oh , I give it to them , and then I send them a big fat bill '' The doctor was surprised , but he thought it it seemed practical so he considered giving it a try . The next day the doctor , still feeling a bit guilty , and undecided about the advice he got , opened his mail only to find a bill from the lawyer .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# The Carnivorous Hare ’ s-tail Cottongrass * *What is plant 's name , etymology , season for bloom ? * Ok , so… on the first glance you would call this cottongrass…but I have named it Eirophorum Dangerousus because when no one else is around these specific blades of cottongrass in front of my door get wildly unpredictable and grow sharp venomous teeth . I have not been able to show this trait to anyone yet because they seem to only do it when I ’ m on my own but I think this is my chance to show the world that this exists and needs to be taken seriously . In all respects except this one , the Eirophorum Dangerousus is equal to the hare ’ s-tail cottongrass ( Eriphorum vaginatum ) . They are native to bogs and other wetlands and grow to be about 30-60cm . The hare ’ s-tail cottongrass is a tussock-forming plant and the fruit is an achene . * *Where does it grow ? What does it look like ? Feel free to include an image ! * As far as I can tell , these plants only grow right outside my house but my hypothesis is that they exist in all appropriate climates but usually kill anyone that comes near them . * *What history does the plant have ? Who discovered it ? * This plant has probably been around for millennia because it will eat or poison anything that comes to close to it . Everyone that discovered it before me probably died from the poison . I noticed something was wrong because I kept finding corpses of rabbits and birds next to the plants but I originally thought there must be a den of some carnivorous animal close by . I was never a big fan of plants ( sorry Madam Pomfrey ) so I didn ’ t usually come too close to this particular bunch of cottongrass until one day when I was retrieving the newspaper and one of the bunch lashed out at me . Luckily , I was wearing full-body armor after a whole night of working in my laboratory . At first , I thought this was just a side effect of the chemicals I was experimenting with , but later inspections of the armor revealed significant traces of poison and I have since retrieved several samples to confirm my findings . * *What are its uses ? How were these discovered ? How does this plant help Madam Pomfrey care for her patients ? * This plant needs to be handled with extreme caution ! A steel armor needs to be worn at all times when handling this plant . However , there are uses to the plant that will be helpful in treating patients . When extracted and applied to a patient , this poison will eliminate any other poison and overpower it . With an equation I developed , the exact amount of poison can be calculated so that it overpowers most known poisons but only leaves the person with symptoms similar to the common flu for a week , which can obviously be very convenient .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species ? Hagrid used all his favorite , completely harmless animal friends , now presented in one compact species : the acromantula , the norwegian ridgeback and the three-headed dog . **Yes , you 're reading this right folks , all your favorite cuddlies at once ! ** * What is its name ? What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem . These magical researchers report back to Hagrid on a daily basis and send him monthly paintings to keep him up to date on what these cuddlies are up to . This author would not recommend keeping norwegian acrowoofs as pets unless your dwellings are inflammable but whatever floats your boat .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,relationships,"I do n't really know what this falls under . Background : I 'm 19 , living with my mom , stepdad and their son in a European country where it 's customary to live with your family until you get a job . My parents got divorced when I was 2 , but I saw my dad at least once a week and I was always much closer to him than I was to my mom . I never got along with my stepdad , especially since him and my mom got a child , because he uses everything I do as a reason to mock me ( for example , if I decide not to eat dinner with them I 'm ''on a diet again '' if I do I 'm ''finally deciding to get out of my room '' if I 'm taking too long to pick what I want to eat I 'm ''picky '' if I get a good grade in school I ''have no life '' ) . He also says those things to my brother when he thinks I 'm not listening . My dad died three years ago and because I was underage , I was justified to what is basically his pension money , 800€ a month until I finish college ( so that 's about 7 years of getting it which is 67,200€ ) . This money was only mine . Because I was only 16 and very upset and did n't even want to think about anything relating to his death , I asked my mom to take care of it . We decided the money would be going to her account and be put away every month , possibly to eventually buy an apartment for when I decided to move out . After a couple of months of her getting the money , I checked in with her and she said she had n't been able to put it aside because of something urgent . After another few months , the same thing . So we decided we would buy an apartment and rent it out ( I mostly decided on it because I saw she was n't going to save the money ) . I did n't do anything then because an apartment would be more money than I was going to get in the long-term and I was grateful she decided to buy it for me . Nothing happened with the purchase of the apartment even though I repeatedly asked about it and whenever I pushed too hard , she would call me ungrateful and unloving for even thinking about doubting that she 'll do it . Meanwhile , she has used this money to remodel the kitchen and bathroom while she keeps telling me we do n't have enough money to put any of mine on the side . Fast forward to this year when I started college . Because I have to eat out due to my schedule and receive no money beside what she decides to give me , her and I decided together that 200€ a month would be enough for me to buy myself food , pay for my bus rides and be able to save a bit on the side . A month after we made that deal , I went to the ATM to withdraw my lunch money and found out it was n't there . When I confronted her about it , she said she did n't have the time to do it yet ( the whole month ) . She promised she 'd take care of it that week and also give me what she owed me from the month before . She went last Friday , decided to give me 160€ a month instead of 200€ without even checking with me , saying that if I need anything more I can just tell her every time I want to buy something , and she also did n't give me any money for last month . I have begged her to let me move out and she wo n't . She says it 's proof that I hate my family and want to destroy it like the ungrateful daughter I am . She also said that she will divorce her husband before letting me move out ( and I think she will do it ) and when I brought up the fact that she ca n't use up more than 300€ a month for me she agreed but said that after 19 years of taking care of me , she deserves to get something for her effort . I could make the money go into my account without her permission , but it would naturally make her scream at me and cry because of how much I hate her . If I moved out without her permission , I am certain that she would follow me around , wait for me at college etc and do everything she could to make me come back . There 's also the issue of her parents which already think she 's a bad mother and as she says ( and I agree with her to some extent ) would make her life miserable if I moved out . The only solution I see right now is to move to America with my long-term boyfriend . That way my family would n't be able to force me to move back with them and I would n't have to listen to them anymore . His parents that know about this situation have also offered me to stay with them until I can figure things out . Basically the only thing that 's stopping me is that I 'm currently in med school and ca n't transfer because here medicine is a study like every other , not a post-graduate study , and I do n't have a degree in anything else . As such , I would have to find a way to transfer to something else or quit school and also stop receiving my father 's pension money , which would make moving a lot more challenging . I 've also told my mom already that since I am planning on moving to America eventually , I wo n't be needing that apartment , but she 's still intent on buying it with my money . I 'm sure there 's something vital to the story I 've forgotten since this has been going on for years and years . Thank you for listening . **tl ; dr** : My dad died and my mom 's taking all the money I should be getting while also not letting me move out . I want to run away from all of my family 's bulshit and move in with my boyfriend who lives across the world .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Her skin seems permanently smudged from climbing trees and her eyes appear unusually big in comparison with her thin face , like two drops of green paint on a face made brown by spending so much time outdoors . **Personality** Leena is a bit shy and slow to trust at first , but once she gets to know you she 's very warm and fiercely loyal . Her laughter is loud and natural , always to be heard among her friends . She 's rather mischievous , not above setting up small pranks ( though always careful not to actually hurt anyone ) , but can also be patient and hardworking if it 's for something she finds important . Above all , she loves spending time with her friends and being there for them . Her world is full of excitement and laughter and she ca n't wait to make new friends at Hogwarts . **Hobbies** Anything involving the outside ( she does n't mind getting dirty ) , spending time with her friends , maybe just lying and chatting on their beds after a day of excitement . **Wand** Cedar with unicorn tail hair , 12 '' , pleasantly springy . **Backstory** Both of her parents being writers ( muggles ) , Leena was often left to entertain herself on her own . She quickly made friends with the rest of the neighborhood children and together they formed bands of pirates and aliens , battling each other in the woods surrounding her town .

Now , A is asexual/aromantic and I guess you could argue asexuals and aromantics are queer because their sexual preferences do n't fit the norm , but it 's still a little different from what most people consider queer . Intersex , on the other hand , is not a sexual preference , it 's closer to trans in that your body/mind does n't match with your label in society . A lot more goes into making your biological sex than most people think ( hormones , outside sexual organs , inside sexual organs ) and sometimes those do n't all match up , though doctors at birth will usually mark you as whatever your outside organ is , or sometimes not even that - maybe you were born with both .

Our team of travel experts will then sit down with you and discuss your wishes then arrange the perfect experience – without telling you about it ! On the day of your trip , you just have to show up and hold onto the pre-prepared portkey ! Per request , one of our employees will travel to the location with you to make sure you settle in nicely ( not available for the survivalist package ) . Your accommodation will be included in the package , as will all food and drinks unless you specify otherwise . We offer a variety of customizable packages , help us choose the best fit for you ! * The standard package : Includes a week/two-week vacation for one to two people at one location put together by a team of travel experts . * The family package : Includes a family-friendly adventure that takes into account non-magic-performing travelers . * The adventure hop : Our most popular choice is a multi-destination experience that lasts between two weeks and a full month . You will be sent off to your primary destination and regularly supplied with new portkeys that will take you to another destination . The frequency of environment swaps is your choice and will determine the price of this package . * The survivalist : Our challenge is to challenge you ! This one-week experience will test your skills of survival and is only intended for the bravest of wizards and witches . Your environment will be changed multiple times by portkeys in disguise . Obviously , you could disapparate at any time but this is intended as a challenge to yourself . You will be observed to insure nothing goes wrong . Wizards and witches that make it through the week will be rewarded . *A testimony by Gilderoy Lockhart : Being the fearless adventurer I am , I of course went with the survivalist option . I requested an emphasis of monsters to see what their ‘ ’ adventure ’ ’ were really made of and test myself against them . I was faced in rapid succession with a colony of acromantulas , a horde of manticores and a hive of tarantula hawk wasps . Being as skilled as I am , I readily dispatched them . Then they threw a basilisk at me . I averted my eyes and quickly retrieved a mirror from my pocket ( I always carry a mirror ) , instantly turning the basilisk to stone with its own gaze , and returned home for my reward .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # By Thy Sparkling Brew The Triwizard contestants are always very talented witches and wizards , able to cast a variety of powerful spells , but do they have the versatility a true champion needs ? Many witches and wizards neglect one of the most useful and potent facets of magic : **Potionmaking . ** We propose to challenge the contestants with a series of four rooms , each with its own unique mini challenges designed to test more than raw power . The contestants will be allowed a 12 hour period in a private chamber stocked with potion-making ingredients and equipment to prepare ( as well as supplied with a potion bandoleer with which to carry vials ) and will be relieved of their wands immediately following their potion-making . In the process of completing the previous challenge , contestants will find themselves in possession of a piece of parchment , blank but for a picture of a potion . Upon holding this piece of parchment above a cauldron with a brewing potion , [ four additional images ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fjff1bo.jpg ) will be revealed on the parchment , each image providing a hint for one of the four rooms . The judges will be instructed to score the contestants based not on their speed of completion , but more the finesse and subtlety used in passing each obstacle . Therefore , a less straightforward path will be worth more than a more obvious one ; phasing through a wall would garner more points than knocking it over . Points will be reduced for injuries received from the various obstacles . Bonus points will be awarded for skill , imagination , and care in handling the challenges faced . & amp ; nbsp ; *The four rooms are as follows : * The **first room** consists of two chambers completely devoid of light . The antechamber is separated from the rest of the room by light-proof curtains , and has the following riddle carved on the ceiling : & amp ; nbsp ; *Go boldly forth unto the night* *Fearing not your fate ahead* *Step quickly , bravely , without fright* *If you wish to end up dead ! * *Move slowly , quietly , without noise* For sleep disturbed will cause your doom* *Should you tread with utmost poise* *You may survive to the next room . * & amp ; nbsp ; In the main chamber sleeps a mountain troll , sensitive to noise and light . Scattered across the floor are the skeletal remains of the troll 's previous meals , sure to wake him if kicked or stepped upon . Contestants objectives are to read the instructions in the antechamber , and move past the troll in the second chamber . & amp ; nbsp ; The **second room** consists of a rickety , swaying bridge over a moat of blast-ended skrewts . An enchanted wind ensures the bridge 's constant movement . Upon entry , contestants pass through a spell that completely paralyzes their legs . Upon exit , they pass through a counterspell that undoes any remaining leg paralysis . Inscribed on the wall is the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *A simple walk from door to door* *Without your legs is made a struggle . * *Will you crawl across the floor ? * *Can you do better than a muggle ? * & amp ; nbsp ; The bridge shall not at any point degrade or fall further apart except at two predetermined planks , which will immediately fall should any weight be put on them . We can not guarantee that the bridge will not at any point swing to the point of being upside down , especially given the variable intelligence of contestants . Contestants objectives are to pass from one side of the room to the other , preferably without falling into the moat . & amp ; nbsp ; The **third room** consists of a goblet on a pedestal , clearly marked with a symbol for deadly poison . It should be noted here that the supply room in which the potions are made is conspicuously absent of bezoars . Upon the wall is inscribed the following mockery : & amp ; nbsp ; *This room is easy , without malice ... * *no nasty creatures seek your death . * *Just down the contents of this chalice , * *take a step , and your last breath . * & amp ; nbsp ; The door at the other end of the room shall unlock when the final drop of the poison has been consumed , however , without some method of mitigating the poison , the contestant shall not make it more than two steps . Contestants objectives are to drink the poison , and to not die . & amp ; nbsp ; The **fourth room** consists of a gauntlet of mini-mini-challenges . The contestants must get through a relatively simple and straightforward obstacle course , with the addition of a spout of flame , continuously falling shards of razor sharp ice , and a dense cluster of Venemous Tentaculae , each of which completely obstructs a portion of the path ahead . Upon the wall is inscribed the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *Good work surviving , you may yet live ! * *You 've made it through the easy part . * *Three challenges this room will give . * *And not one for the weak of heart . * *Try not to burn within the heat* *If you truly be must told . * *Do n't supply a plant with meat* *And avoid bitter shards of cold . * & amp ; nbsp ; The obstacle course on its own is of a level than can be easily completed with minor to moderate athletic skill , but the specific obstacles should be expected to add some substantial difficulty . & amp ; nbsp ; EDIT : @ * # $ reddit formatting",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # Conservation - The pudgiemudgies & amp ; nbsp ; **Description** The pudgiemudgies are small forest creatures , not much bigger than an ant but incredibly cute . They look similar to a [ puffskein ] ( http : //www.deviantart.com/art/Puffskein-261178762 ) and are their distant relatives . However , pudgiemudgies live in groups up to 500 individuals and stay close to each other at all times . Consequentially , pudgiemudgie clans will look like a curious colorful moss patch to an uneducated witch or wizard but upon further observation it will become obvious that the ‘ ’ moss patch ’ ’ is pulsing and moving as pudgiemudgies communicate by dancing . Pudgiemudgies vary in color but one clan will always only consist of one color and all the babies born to that clan will be of that color . Scholars assume that the colors are based on their environment . Once a year , all pudgiemudgie clans of an area will congregate for a meeting and a ball . This event is known as a *kaleidoball* in scholarly circles due to the mesmerizing mixtures of different clans and their colors . & amp ; nbsp ; **Endangerment** The pudgiemudgies are pretty much defenseless and rely on their small size to evade any predators . Recently however , there has been an increase in the illegal trade of pudgiemudgies as decoration and even potion ingredients . Furthermore , due to the changes in global climate , some colors of pudgiemudgie clans are beginning to die out , most notable cobalt blue and electric orange . These two clan variations were found in colder climates and need a period of snow to continue producing offspring with their colors . When offspring of the wrong color are born in a clan , they have to find a clan with their colors , which can be a treacherous journey for a young pudgiemudgie . & amp ; nbsp ; **Protection** There have been a couple of plans made to protect this vulnerable species , including bringing up the fines for trade and possession of pudgiemudgies , and efforts to restore and protect the natural environment of the clans endangered by climate change . The most interesting of conservation plans , however , is to selectively breed pudgiemudgies in order for them to develop defensive abilities that would make them less desirable as decoration and harder to hunt , such as breathing fire and manipulating their environment . Your average wizard would be much less likely to scatter them over his Yuletide tree when doing so when doing so is likely to set that tree on fire .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

How many students do you want in your class ? ** The wizarding world is amazing and awe-inspiring but let ’ s be honest : the delay in technology can sometimes be inconvenient . There are ways in which muggles have definitely overtaken us . That ’ s why I want to not only teach young witches and wizards about the ways technology and magic can intertwine but also work with them to create new ways to improve the magical world . The new subject I am proposing will be called Wiztech and will incorporate muggle technology with magical ways or repurposing and improving it . **How long will you be a guest instructor for ? Are your classes consecutive or will you be doing various courses over the year ? Is your course a one-time exclusive ? ** I will teach students for a full year ( or maybe more if this class is successful ) . My classes will occur every week in groups of 10 to 15 witches and wizards . **What is your teaching like ? Can you share a lesson plan with us ? ** My classes will begin with a series of lectures introducing students that haven ’ t had experience with muggle technology before to the ways in which it works and ways in which it can be improved with magic . Afterwards we will begin workshops in which I will show the students how to incorporate magic and technology . The last part of our year will be spent on students working on their own projects in smaller groups . These projects will be represent the majority of the final grade in my class . **What sort of homework assignments do you plan to give our students ? ** Students will spend the first two thirds of our year together researching muggle technology and ways magic can be incorporated into it , and will be required to write essays on their findings . Homework will not be given in the last part of the year when students are working on their own project . Students can obviously spend time outside of classrooms figuring out ways to improve their project , however , students will not be permitted to work on the actual project without supervision . **Describe how you would like to begin your first class , or tell us about a previous teaching experience you are proud of . ** This will be my first time teaching a class at a school but I have taken on several young assistants in my many years of invention .

AgentSmax,funny,"If we are going into specifics then you are only partially right here . From wikipedia : & gt ; Fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 , basing it on three reference points of temperature . In his initial scale ( which is not the final Fahrenheit scale ) , the zero point is determined by placing the thermometer in brine : he used a mixture of ice , water , and ammonium chloride , a salt , at a 1:1:1 ratio . This is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically : that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F ( −17.78 °C ) . The second point , at 32 degrees , was a mixture of ice and water without the ammonium chloride at a 1:1 ratio . The third point , 96 degrees , was approximately the human body temperature , then called `` blood-heat '' . Only 0°F was using salt water out of the three points .

AgentSmax,Tribes,"So I 've been having issues with Tribes Ascend for a while now ( last 1 or 2 patches ) . I usually have over 60fps consistently , but then I started having framedrops in intervals ( 10-20fps for about 10 seconds in 15-30 second intervals ) . It was very consistent - especially on full servers . I have tried many solutions - closing programs that could affect the performance , trying different drivers ... Nothing worked particularly well . Since it clearly was n't the graphics card lagging ( fps drop remained if I looked at the floor or at the sky ) the only possible fault is the CPU . One day I was monitoring the CPU with the task manager and came on the idea of changing the CPU core affinity . Turns out it works for me on no more or less than 4 cores . If Tribes runs on any other amount than 4 cores it starts either being jerky or has framedrop intervals . Computer specs : The laptop is an MSI GT780DXR CPU - Intel Core i7 - 2670QM Graphics card - Nvidia GTX 570m Ram - 8GB DDR3 **TL ; DR** - Tribes only likes exactly 4 cores on my pc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting games is n't `` talking over a game you play '' . I find people cast sc2 because they genuinely love the game and would like to try their hand at casting . From what I see in cod , there were actually vlogs with gameplay in the background . That is not casting . There is also a difference between `` need '' and `` want to '' . And you do n't know it 's going to be bad . If people do n't try we may not get good casters . You ca n't just say you will cast it in a new way if you do n't know you can pull it off . Casting style develops with experience .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting I would think is not talking random non-game related bullshit . Casting ( to me ) is play-by-play and analysis . Talking random shit is talking random shit . The thing is , cod community is n't really the same as SC community . From what I have seen , except for a troll here or there , the SC community is much more mature than any mainstream FPS community . The thing is , it 's always nice to see fresh talent . And if no one wants to someone who says `` uhm '' every two words , I would think they would want to improve their casting , which could only benefit the community . This may sound a bit optimistic , but I think people recognize quality .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

I 'm not quite sure about the comments but I have found nothing wrong with it yet . The topics that are bad usually disappear pretty fast . Concerning the 100 people as good as Husky , It 's your problem who you would want to watch . It 's not like you 're forced to watch them . Nobody can be exactly the same as another caster .

AgentSmax,arma,"Though I wish it was better I would n't say it 's terrible . I find the sound assets miles better than ArmA 2 . Weapons sound like they have actual power behind them . Walking sounds are great though it seems some sounds for different materials are still missing . Helicopters could use a bit more `` punch '' if you know what I mean , but otherwise they sound great . Sounds that bother me are explosions and miniguns . Explosions sound similar to arma 2 so they might as well be placeholders . Miniguns just sound weak . And I 'd like to hear some good echo . Although I wish something like [ this ] ( http : //youtu.be/MQt1jtDBNK4 ) would be picked up by game developers already . Sound technology generally seems to be lacking in games . EDIT : Seems like I should have researched the engine problems more . Yeah , they should definitely fix those things .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I also did n't quite understand it before posting my comment due to my mistake of not checking OP 's link .

The question then is : Is it more efficient to create high pressure gas by explosions or by boiling water ? Turns out , boiling is better . Mainly because the boiler of a power station can be very finely tuned to produce steam at a constant rate 24/7 , while gasoline engines have to be able to adapt to various operating conditions , like cold/hot weather , slow/fast speeds , low or high load ( towing ) ...

When transmogrification was introduced in Cataclysm , Blizz needed to add some extra inventory space to every character in the game to store all their transmog items . They did this by reworking the key ring , which was the only container without a set upper limit ( because there used to be hundreds of different keys in the game ) .

Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation .

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

This can make for exceptionally maneuverable aircraft . Rockets can also have thrust vectoring of a kind , but it is done differently . Rocket engines have way too much thrust for a nozzle like this ( made up from smaller flaps etc . ) , instead they use a solid metal nozzle that looks like a bell . That nozzle can then be mounted on a system of hydraulics ( aka `` gimbal '' ) , which can swivel it around , vectoring the thrust .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Aggropop,todayilearned,"I think `` compatible '' is a bit of a stretch . In order to deem something compatible with something else you would you would have to have some pretty good empirical data on it , which is n't the case with god . ( in fact it might be impossible to get data on god , depending on what flavor/definition of god we 're talking about ) I think it would be more correct to say that god is `` not necessarily incompatible '' with the big bang . Anything beyond that is pure speculation .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
