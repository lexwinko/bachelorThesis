100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough . But when an entire coal pit closes , and hundreds of people loose their main source of income all at once , the town wo n't recover for generations .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

How often do you see rioters paying for the damage they 've done ? & gt ; I do n't doubt they 're that stupid at all , but I do hope that now the police will enforce the law and sentence the lot of them for it instead of just standing idly by while a bunch of children smash up the place because they do n't like someone . Your desired outcome demands that certain conditions are true . For example it means that the police can stop riots effectively and quickly . Also that even if they could , they would want to get their hands dirty , in this particular case for the sake of someone who 's likely to be abhorred by most people . The existence of the phenomena of riots means that at least one of those statements is sometimes false .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Then Obama and the `` reset '' came but relations soured again . Now Trump has come in , and it would not be surprising , if things follow a similar pattern .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"It is difficult for me to imagine the interests of an abstract ideology like Communism , which is why I 'm asking about the interests of the working classes . In that case the argument goes like that : 1 . The working class in modern ROK lives much better than in modern DPRK , with North Korea being practically a byword for repression and misery . Not saying that South Korea is perfect , just that workers would rather live there than under the Kim dynasty . 2 . Those that sympathized with DPRK would have aided the North in its attempts to conquer the South . 3 . Their aid would have increased the chance of the South being ruled by those that now rule the North . 4 . Thus leaving those people alive would have substantially increased the risk that future generations of South Korean workers live under repression and misery . 5 . Thus killing those people secures the well being of the working class . They may have not done anything wrong , but given the stakes involved letting them live would be an unacceptable risk . Other options could have been explored but the invasion left the South 's regime with no other choice . So , the question is , do you see any problems with that line of reasoning ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Given that , would you agree that Liberal governments are , in their suppression of far left movements motivated by ( perhaps misguided ) concern for the well being of their people ( including their working class ) .

And even more importantly why are so many people here discussing it as if it was a serious possibility ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,The reason why the war there was ended as quickly as it did is largely because both sides there fought ( mostly ) competently . In the Syrian conflict on the other hand the most we armed side is absolutely unable to conduct even the most basic operations . If Syrian government was able to do something as fundamental as maintaining a tight siege the war would have been over by now . But as it stands now the Ghouta pocket seems quite well supplied . In that sense the experience and knowledge the Ukrainian army got from that war is probably more valuable than whatever the various Syrian paramilitaries got from the five years of civil war .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; There was no will to continue the fighting in any meaningful way . There was . The reason why the fighting reached stopped was because it became abundantly clear both sides were unable to achieve their aims . By the end of the summer of 2014 it had became clear that at the present moment the Russian government had no ability to create a Russian state in the Ukrainian south and east and if such state were to be created it would probably collapse in less than a year taking the Russian government with it . By the end of the autumn of that same year it became clear the Ukrainian government could n't retake the areas the separatists already controlled because the Russian military would deploy their full forces if they tried ( and of course the gain from retaking those regions has always been questionable ) . & gt ; There are tons of operations done successfully but I think you are minimizing the situation . You 're right . Sorry for exaggerating . & gt ; 1 they do n't have the man power because of the reasons I stated to hold a full seige for an effective amount of time and still tend to all their fronts while maintaining multiple offensives . IS is fighting more opponents than the Syrian government , yet they somehow maintain the siege on Deir ez-Zor . & gt ; The second issue is that there is just to much lucrutive black market deals going on in Ghouta I 'm sure it is looked the other way because of the amount of money involved , difficulities combating the black market , corruption , and the need not to piss off his local population further . Ghouta need only be contained for now . Also I fail to see how failing to deal with a pocket that undoubtedly ties in a non-trivial amount of troops helps one to deal with his manpower shortages . Well , here it is . The Syrian government is not capable of conducting a siege because of it 's own corruption and incompetence . And pissing off the local population is no excuse . If they wanted they could have blocked all supplies apart from basic necessities . The rebels there would have still surrendered because of lack of munitions . You see my point is that the length and intensity of a conflict is rarely proportional to the skill with which it has been fought . In modern wars rarely drag on for very long unless the major adversaries in it fight in a defective manner . And there is much more military skill to be gained from fighting against skilled opponent with good soldiers and officers as compared to fighting against poor soldiers led by poor officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As of the US envoy , the one who should effectively counter treats of military nature against him are the local Kurdish warlords . With some luck IS could probably assemble diversionary groups of 30-50 men in Kurdish territory without being caught . Thus Defending an envoy against anything the IS could organize in the area around Kobani would probably require no less than 50 men in any case . Unless you have actual military deployed there of course . But 50 soldiers from special operations just protecting a guy is simply a waste of those men 's capabilities .

Though I still maintain that the main reason why Germany went to war was it 's obligations to Australia . & gt ; Oh and the text of the alliance mentions other great powers as well : It says that the parties should maintain benevolent neutrality in case one of them was attacked by a country different from Russia .

From what I gather the computer game `` King of Dragon Pass '' where the peasants could n't marry without the approval of the clan 's government is a pretty accurate representation of bronze age society . On the other hand once capital starts to accumulate the inherent limitations of collectivist systems become intolerable as wealth increases . Living in submission to a higher goal and forcing others to do so is not something most people would do if they did n't think it was needed for the good of the family/nation/race/humanity .

We 'd take the word of a businessman with a grain of salt if he 's talking about psychology , politics , military logistics or sociology and those contain a lot more useful information related to the running of a company than economics . The most successful guy in finance is Warren Buffet who advises to ignore all economic factors . In this case Mr. Thiel has completely failed to consider that businesses compete for investor 's money . No bank , nor fund , nor a rational person , will ever buy a 5 % bond over a 7 % one ( assuming both issues are equally sound ) . Nobody in their right mind would buy a share with P/E of 20 over a 10 ( assuming similar growth prospects/soundness of business ) . Businesses that fail to provide adequate return on investment wo n't be able to raise the money needed to keep up with the competition and would eventually be given over to some corporate raider to liquidate if that continues . Competition for customers will be moderated by competition for capital . This guarantees that capital gets accumulated and companies ( as well as investors ) have the money to innovate and try new things . As for Mr. Thiel 's Google example , I 'd seriously doubt Google feels secure in it 's place . This website we 're reading right now is apparently a replacement of something called Digg which lost it 's user base to Reddit in a matter of months . The collapse of MySpace was similarly swift .

Of course that ca n't continue forever . And when the system collapses the capital base would already be exhausted and unable to maintain the same quality of life as in the good old days , at least for a good while , even under a new system that does n't suffer from the contradictions of the old one . Thus Khrushchev could claim that his workers lived under comparable quality of life as people in the United States . By end of Brezhnev 's reign such claims no longer seemed plausible and by the time Gorbachev came into power it was clear to everyone that communism could n't last much longer . On the other hand leaders who put the expansion of the capital base before worker 's quality of life like Stalin often had reductions of quality of life so severe that they qualified as crimes against humanity .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Many regimes have been criticized for engaging in campaigns of brutal suppression against communists and communist sympathizers . From as far right as Chilean dictator Pinochet to as far left as the German social democrats , many regimes have found it necessary to suppress and sometimes even cull their communists , under the pretext that if communists were to take power many more would die . Among the left of center commentariat , the cruel logic behind such actions is either roundly criticized or outright rejected as intellectually dishonest and self serving . ( This in stark contrast to left wing governments which do quite often consider communists a grave danger to the interests of the working class . ) Yet there is one such regime seems to be largely forgotten . South Korean ( semi- ) autocrat Syngman Rhee suppressed communists with extreme prejudice , first sending them to gulags and then killing them when DPRK forces were about to liberate those camps . Estimates of the death toll put it at 100000 to 200000 . But we all know what he was fighting against . Even conservative estimates of state killings in North Korea are usually above 200000 for a mere decade or less . No one can deny that the South Korean proletariat lives much better than the workers in the North . Given all that , the question arises , as to your opinions on the actions of President Rhee . The Northern state is , from what I 've heard , not considered socialist , but rather closer to fascism . Yet it is certain that the Southern communists would have aided this fascist regime in its numerous attempts to conquer the peninsula . Reunification was , after all , one of the goals of the South Korean Workers Party . So was their destruction justified or not ? Or were those agents of fascism that marched under the red banner somehow different than the ones that marched under the swastika ? Perhaps one could argue that the amount of people killed was too large or that mass killing as a method is counter productive , but would n't that be a tacit admission that slaying South Korea 's communists would have been ethically sound and in the interests of the proletariat , if it were an effective suppression measure ? And if you were to say that Rhee 's actions were justified , questions arise about all those other regimes in the history of the world . Was Pinochet wrong ? Should the Social Democrats have murdered Rosa Luxembourg ? Was the CIA justified in overthrowing what could very well have been another fascist regime hiding under the red flag ? The CIA is a spy agency after all , they should recognize a fascist tendency in a government even before it is known to the general public , should n't they ?

A side effect of the First Past the Post system that the UK has is that party leaders are largely controlled by their parliamentary groups rather than the other way around . Any claim the Labour leader might claim on the right to set party policy would come from his election by the party 's membership .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Well , can a system always produce exactly as much as needed ? The answer should obviously be a `` No '' , you ca n't determine the needs of society with a high degree of accuracy without exactly foreseeing the cultural , political , scientific and ecological developments of the future . Thus we can assume that an economic system can only be designed so that it 's levels of production follow some probability distribution . But if the expected value of production is the exact amount society needs , you 'd suffer from occasional bouts of underproduction . It would mean that every crop blight starves some people . Thus in order to ensure that people are supplied with necessities a system should produce more than it needs . Hence why , for example every year the EU collects and throws away mountains of tomatoes . An argument could be made that luxuries are different , but the distinction between necessities and luxuries is rather arbitrary . Motor vehicles are vital necessities in some parts of the world and luxuries in others . There were points in history where a diet with enough calories to sustain an adult would be considered a luxury . So there 's an argument to be made about treating everything as a necessity , since misidentifying a necessity as luxury would have dire consequences , whereas misidentifying a luxury as a necessity is overall harmless .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

This suggests that males were not diverting resources towards females with whom they could potentially copulate on a short-term , and were therefore not exchanging meat for sex . Although males in the Ngogo community did share more with estrous than anestrous females given their proportional representation in hunting parties [ 14 ] , these sharing episodes did not confer males with immediate mating advantages over males who did not share meat with females ( Ngogo : [ 14 ] , Gombe : [ 20 ] ) . One important limitation of the above studies is that they have focused on short-term exchanges of meat for sex ( i.e . within the estrous phase of the female ) . Given that in this species dyads form long-lasting bonds [ 21 ] , and exchange services on a long-term basis [ 22 ] , it is plausible that exchanges of meat for sex could occur over a longer period of time than the estrous phase of a female .

( In fact it would mean that joint stock companies would dominate all sectors of the economy where output can be improved by injecting capital . ) I 'm sorry if any part of that was unclear . Also are you under the impression I somehow believe in socialism ? Sure , the question is addressed to socialists , but most other people who answer are n't socialists . Their answers are also missing what I believe is the key issue with cooperatives , namely what I tried to point out , so I felt compelled to add mine to theirs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Because firing 10 % of the workforce every time the cooperative has to take a controversial decision is a recipe for success .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"So , the majority decides , the minority accepts it . It does n't matter that they own a piece of every asset of the cooperative , so long as their opinion is unpopular enough , they ca n't protect themselves from losses in any way . It 's not like disagreeing with decisions made by the owners of a company , I do n't own any part of the company I work for and if I did I could sell it . I have no legitimate reason to care for the company I work for . My inability to liquidate my share of a cooperative without changing jobs , which is never an easy process , gives me reasons to care for it . Can you imagine how bad it 's going to be if the minority turns out to be right ? The grumbling , the `` I told you so '' , the hatred towards coworkers that have squandered a not insignificant part of the group 's wealth . Imagine the hatred you now see towards supporters of the current American president , only a thousand times worse and directed towards people you have to interact with every day . Even if the minority was dissuaded from a strike , management would have to convert the cooperative into a company in order to get people to talk to each other . The complete lack of liquidity of parts of a cooperative presents a great problem for the rights of minorities . There are a thousand ways in which the problem would express itself , which particular one is irrelevant . Unless somebody has discovered a reasonable solution for it vast sectors of the economy would be inaccessible to cooperatively governed organizations . The only solution I see is conversion to a joint stock company .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"I do n't think you understand . In a joint stock company I can increase or decrease the my ownership of the company for some money but most importantly *at no personal cost to myself* . In a cooperative I have to change jobs , which is *a significant disturbance to my life* . Saying workers should quit their jobs because they disagree with business decisions is like saying Americans should move to Canada if they disagree with political decisions . It 's just silly .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; you can quit and relinquish your share in a company and divorce yourself from all potential risk of a decision with without having to get another job first . Can I work permanently for the cooperative without owning a share or is it like giving my employer a 2 week notice ? & gt ; alright , so you 're a worker now in a capitalist business . a decision has to be made . your boss has full control , and makes a decision you hate , and your only options are to bend over and take it , or quit and go work somewhere else you think will have a boss that will make decisions for you that are more to your liking . So long as the decision is not about my compensation or work conditions , I do n't have to care . He could waste company money on crack for all I know , yet for me it does n't matter . Company money are his money not mine . Sure , if his decisions are utterly horrible at some point he will bankrupt the company and I 'd be out of a job , but my savings , be they in deposits or in stocks would still be there . As opposed to a high capex co-op where I 'd not only be out of a job but my net worth will also take a significant hit . Were Daimler a cooperative it 's workers would each own a share amounting to half a million euros . At that point the loss of the share of the company is going to be a lot more painful than the loss of the job . Edit : Added the example at the end .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; no So my point still stands , does n't it . I can get rid of my share only by suffering a great disturbance to my life . & gt ; it is your money when your employment stability depends on his successful management of the company . I doubt many people would willingly work for a boss that blows all the company money on crack . If he pays well , why not ? My employer 's shitty decisions only affect me if they are extremely shitty and even then I 'd usually have enough time to prepare if I could see it in advance . Since I do n't own any part of the company I 'm not going to loose anything , am I ? & gt ; yes , that 's how it works . if the profits are more socialized , so are the losses ( again , to a percentage that you agree to ) . you stand to gain a higher wage in a co-op , but this is balanced out by greater risk . So let me get this straight . I 'm in for a lot . In a hypothetical car manufacturing cooperative my share would be worth a few hundreds of thousands of dollars/euros . Yet all those money are at the complete mercy of the annual general meeting . I ca n't get those hundreds of thousands back without changing jobs . Those hundreds of thousands can become more or less , but there 's nothing I can do to protect myself from a change in their value . Do you not see the problems with that ? Do you think most working class folks would be OK with letting the majority do as they please with hundreds of thousands of their money ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"& gt ; I like how you complain about your employment disruption disturbing your life , and then in the same breath say you do n't care if you lose your job as long as you got paid in that time . There 's a difference . If the policies of the American government are bad enough to cause a civil war , most Americans are going to try to emigrate . On the other hand nobody 's going to be emigrating because Trump is a president . Most people would are just nasty to his supporters . Is it that hard to see how the observable realities of Democracy translate to the Democratic Workplace ? & gt ; if that 's all that concerns you , you can still work for a co-op , get paid well , and quit before it starts struggling . it 'd be the same thing .

100100145,investing,"The general error of Keynes ' theory is something called the Lucas critique . The crux of it is that while 2 variables may be correlated , an economic policy that uses the knowledge of that correlation may destroy it in its attempts to exploit it . To quote Calaghan on the correlation between inflation and unemployment which is quite important in Keynes ' economics : & gt ; `` We used to think you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by boosting government spending , I tell you , in all candour that that option no longer exists . And in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion… by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step… ” In general people are n't stupid and if they figure out the government will raise inflation they are going to demand higher wages , making the inflation raise ineffective at lowering unemployment . Likewise any economic theory that does n't base it 's sweeping observations on the study of small scale economic interactions ca n't survive prolonged contact with reality . It should be obvious how Lucas ' critique lead to more advocacy for more laissez-faire . As 30 years of economic theory were proven to be wrong , lots of people thought that we do n't have good enough understanding of an economy to conduct beneficial government interventions . Who knows what would people be saying in 30 years about current theories , after all ? In the 80 's a lot of people soured on macroeconomic interventions ( basically spending money for the sake of spending money ) in favor of mircoeconomic ones ( privatizations , the less popular nationalizations , altering regulations and other stuff that affects specific sectors rather than the whole economy ) .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Calaghan ( hardly a proponent of laissez-faire ) admitting that this theory no longer works , I can give you the American [ misery index ] ( https : //inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/ ) .

Nobody watches the Fed raising inflation targets then goes to their boss and argues for higher wages . This is n't how the economy works . Nobody watches them **now** . These days inflation targets are low and boring . Thus under current FED policy we have a Philips Curve . When inflation targets were higher and more interesting workers and more importantly union bosses would actually start looking at them and the Philips Curve will disappear . And even if workers were illiterate brutes who could n't read the inflation targets , they 'd have to notice that prices are rising considerably and they can no longer afford to live as well as they did before .

Yet once you become morbidly obese you do start modifying your weight depending on your eating habits ( or you die young , I guess ) . And regardless , whether the Lucas Critique is right or wrong should n't affect the validity of naive Keynesian modelling . The empirical fact is that by the 1970s there was a general agreement that a number of correlations between variables which were observed before WW2 no longer held .

I meant giving me a link to something or at the very least the naming someone who has successfully applied the theory . & gt ; Yes , but the accuracy of an economic theory is not the only criterion by which the government uses it in some way . There are obvious reasons why a government in a capitalist society would not use Marxian economics to fuel its understanding of what is going on and make policy based on those insights . Whether government 's are naturally inclined or disinclined to choosing to listen to surplus value believers is irrelevant to my argument . My point is entirely based on what happens once a capitalist country acquires a government that is inclined to listen to surplus value believers . If surplus value offers special insight into the market economy it is reasonable to assume that they 'd do better than governments that listen to orthodox economists . If the contrary is true that 's evidence against surplus value , is it not ? & gt ; I think you and I have different criteria what determines the usefulness of a theory . Your criteria is narrow and predisposed to promoting ignorance , because it prematurely tosses aside a lot of things that may be true and can be useful for human development , but not immediately applicable in people 's direct lives . So , let me get this straight . Surplus value may be true . On the other hand if I ever behave as if it were true I will not gain anything and would likely bring harm to me and those around me .

Thus they probably wo n't act against him until defeat is imminent . Furthermore both Russia and Iran are likely to obstruct a removal of the President rather facilitate it . You see , war devastated Syria is likely to need a lot of money to recover from the war . Thus a different Syrian leader might succumb to the temptations of the famously wealthy land of the House of Saud and the practically limitless wealth of the free world . As for the terrorists , if the object of their hatred was removed and the policies that caused it were to stop , I think there is hope . If nothing else it will stop the number of terrorists from growing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , the government controls by far the largest share of Syria 's population , yet it suffers from a well pronounced lack of reliable soldiers . This would imply that most of the population in government controlled areas is hostile or at least unsupportive to it . By contrast both the various rebel militias and the Islamic State control very little population , but do n't seem to lack men willing to risk and even sacrifice their lives in the name of the faction that they join . I do think that strongly suggests both the various rebel groups and IS are more popular than the government . As for the rebels being split into a multitude of separate groups , each with its own political designs , I 'm want to remind you that the Solidarity Citizen 's Committee was a quite disorganized political group , that consisted of people with many different ideologies , united only by their desire to see the communists gone . It still won elections by a landslide . EDIT : Clarified some things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,I do n't think that many support the government 's enemies . They just could n't care less about a government that could n't care less about them .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't know . Should n't government soldiers believe they are fighting for their lives and families ? At least when they are fighting something like the Islamic State ? That should be a good motivation . Furthermore the Nazi Volkssturm never had problems with making heroic last stands . The Red army never had problems fighting in far worse conditions and with far worse survival rate than the government 's troops now . And in the first world War nobody had problems recruiting pilots in spite of the ridiculously low life expectancy . I do believe people in general are quite willing to sacrifice their lives for their countries , it 's just that nobody would want to sacrifice himself on the altar of his superiors ' incompetence . Thus I strongly suspect if the commander in chief of the SAA was someone people believed in , the government 's manpower/soldier quality issues would go away . They control by far the largest share of the country 's population , surely they would be capable of finding enough decent soldiers . Edit : Fixed some unclear stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , as to the point about about islamism see my other reply to that other post . History is full of examples of men throwing away their lives for secular causes with the same lack of concern for themselves as suicide bombers . All that is needed is a cause soldiers would believe in and trust in their high command . Those things are , I think we can both agree , severely lacking in Syria , and nobody is going to really support a government he mistrusts . And if a government is going to allow corruption and nepotism to propagate in something as critical to its survival as the military , do n't you think the other spheres of government activity would be affected as well ? How do you think a corrupt and incompetent police , secret police , agricultural authority , industrial regulator , health services , regional authorities , etc . would affect civilian morale ? & gt ; EDIT : to be honest I had no idea what the solidarity citizens committee was , but a quick wikipedia read mentioned that the committee did n't even last a year ? That is precisely where I was going . Even if separate groups have different ideologies , they can be very popular together when they defend a common popular cause . I do n't think most people that support JaN would go home , if the group were destroyed . They would just join another one . Thus it is not meaningless to talk about support for the rebels , in spite of the fact that `` rebels '' is a category rather than a coherent group . Edit : I 'm bad at grammar .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It seems it is necessary to repeat myself . They `` fight '' for the government because they were forced to . SAA conscripts are directly forced into the armed forces .

If you live in a relatively safe area and join the NDF , you 'd be patrolling the streets , rather than dying on some distant front . I do n't think we have any reason to believe NDF members are more committed to fighting for the government than the SAA 's rank and file . As far as I can see , they get routed just as easily . And further while the rate of defections might have slowed , I do n't think the rate of desertion has slowed down significantly . Furthermore , seeing how the armed forces have recently suffered a rout on 2 separate fronts , I do n't really see any indication that the government 's soldiers , both SAA and NDF , are willing to fight and risk death in the name of the president .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"For one you could make sure that everybody hears about the intervention . That way when IS or JaN suffers a defeat , it could lead to terror attacks in Russia .

Interesting perspective and also probably correct to a significant degree , though I do think there is some evidence to suggest that it is not the main reason for the whole affair . For example Putin would have never used term Novorussia unless he was preparing for conquest . And Alexander Dugin 's infamous textbook for the Russian Geneal Staff Academy advocates the destruction of Ukraine trough splitting the country , as well as the style of warfare that is now often called `` hybrid '' .

Back then their commanders did show the same lack of regard for the lives of the men under their command that the SAA is known for . While I do n't doubt the Iranian armed forces are much better than the Syrian , I suspect it might not be because they lack the problems the SAA suffers from , but because they have them but to a far , far lesser degree .

100100145,syriancivilwar,Couter attacks are costly though . And as far as I remember the disaster in the southern Idlib region began as a counter offensive to recapture Idlib city .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Since the rebels have n't taken the road trough some kind of lighting offensive and since holding is probably preferable to retaking , I 'd guess if they were to take the road they would have to defeat the reserves in Aleppo either way . Apart from that both of Assad 's firefighters , Hassan and Zahreddine are currently busy , it 'll be a while till the road is recaptured . And if the rebels are smart enough the couter offensive could be extremely costly , when it finally comes . Edit : I really should n't write long posts from my phone .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , after going through quite a few pro-Iranian , pro-Syrian administrations the Lebanese state is now weak and corrupt , allowing for Hezbollah to flourish . After the al-Maliki 's administration , which was quite friendly to Iran , Iraq ended up with an army that ca n't fight . And lo and behold , Iran-backed shia militias are coming to the rescue . Do you see the pattern ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,V. Yankovic was democratically elected to be Ukrainian president it is not like Russia has chosen him to be the president there . Surely he must have represented his people 's interest not the Russian government 's .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I was n't thinking about the association agreements as much as the utterly outrageous way Yankovic treated his generals . And even in that regard your arguments do n't hold up . Yes sure , he wanted to save government finances . Which were in the state they were in because he , unlike the `` corrupt oligarch '' , had a mansion half the size of Malta .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , I doubt any government with Hezbollah in it will try to strengthen the LAF . And further considering how Hezbollah treats its political opponents , its only a matter of time before they start arming themselves , leading to a most unpleasant sequence of events . As for Iraq , I feel Maliki 's ousting had far more to do with his extreme military failure . Calls for his removal were first issued in Iraq and then echoed in Iran as it became obvious he could n't remain a prime minister . To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders , but then again Yankovic did n't follow Russian orders either . Instead his associates describe Moscow 's men making their way to his inner circle , driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him . Or it could be something even more innocent , like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him . Maybe he did n't even think about the way his presidency would affect Iraq , though I still think Iranian foreign policy strategist are n't that foolish .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,It 's not like Saddam 's army was that great either . And yes the Iraqi government was literally bankrolled and armed by the coalition . Then relations with the coalition broke down .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,If some foreign force appears to save the government are we sure this is going to be the conclusion rather than an interlude ? Iraqi militiamen probably wo n't stay in Syria for the years of counterinsurgency that are likely to follow .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"200,000 Syrians are in the army . How many of them fight and how many desert at the first opportunity is debatable . Furthermore , for the survival of the government , the reality is that numbers are going to mean far less than actual military effectiveness and many around here would cast doubt in government victory even if the government had not 200 000 , but 300 000 men at it 's command ( assuming foreign support were withdrawn ) . So , as you can see even those arguments , that you think are totally unreasonable , might be based on a reasonable line of logic . How correct that line of logic is , can usually be discovered trough an inquiry into it by a critical mind . So please , if you believe that somebody is making an incorrect argument , ask him about it . That way you can persuade not only yourself , but also a reader in his or her incorrectness and perhaps even learn something from him , regardless of whether he is correct or not . I assume you are n't here just to broadcast your beliefs , while failing to persuade anybody in them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , the question is , why would IS try prevent the army from reaching Palmyra ? The area around the city is mostly open desert , where they would be at a major disadvantage , against a conventional army with airplanes and all the paraphernalia of modern war . If they are smart , they are going to fight only in the city itself . And unfortunately IS commanders do n't strike me as particularly inept .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , `` state terrorism '' exists as a term . Whether the government engages in it , if it does to what degree , and how important is it for the government are all open to debate . And I do n't think the view that state terror is critical for the survival of the government , or at least the government in its present form , is absolutely devoid of arguments in its favor . Again , it could be wrong , but it ca n't be just be dismissed , it has to be proven wrong . Furthermore , if someone makes an argument that seems to you weird , bizarre or totally wrong , ask him about it . If his position is totally without merit , this shall become self-evident . If it 's not at least you are n't going to look like a someone , so lacking confidence in his views , that he 'd rather not debate opposing ones .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"From what I 've seen , my impression is that IS never really tries to defend what they ca n't defend . Rather , to keep the narrative , when they loose something important , they quickly capture something else instead . For example their force in Tikrit did n't seem to me as one built to repel the Iraqi forces converging on the city , but rather as one built to delay them . Yet after they lost Tikrit they captured Ramadi and Palmyra , and thus the narrative was kept intact . Now I think they have some chance of defending the city , so they will try to defend it . Also one should keep in mind that though IS 's lack of concern about it 's soldiers ' lives makes it seem otherwise , the organization is quite flexible strategically , thus meaning a general rule about what they do ca n't be true all the time .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed it did n't . My point is not that the lack of defensible terrain around the city makes it easier to defend . After all common sense dictates rather the opposite is true . I instead claim that , because of the terrain any attacker would be capable of reaching the city , since the defender 's best strategy would be not to resist an offensive to a significant degree , until the city itself . So IS 's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself . This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed . Thus being 3.5 km away from the city does n't mean much . The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided . As I mentioned so far it proceeds as SAA planers would want ( and expect ) it to proceed , yet it probably proceeds as IS planners would expect it to , as well . Edit : Fixed the repetition in the last sentence .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , keep in mind that the strategy I described would have been adopted ( if indeed this is the actual strategy of the IS ) because coalition air power would mean IS would not be able to use large concentrations of troops in battle . Also as far as I remember the Ramadi attack was supported by an impressive number of VBIEDs .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If it was a dune or a hill , would n't they be spotted by aerial reconnaissance ? EDIT : And further I 've always assumed such a large number of men would , when moving , scatter reconnaissance vehicles around , so as to avoid an ambush of the whole force . EDIT : a word .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , looking at the Donbass war , I feel like every Ukrainian or separatist brigade and artillery battery has like 10 drones with it , most of them bought by fundraisers , so they ca n't be that expensive . And even if aerial reconnaissance is out of the question , would n't ground based one work as well ? I assume a group large enough to capture tens of soldiers would be large enough to be visible .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see , you are right . I still do n't see why the SAA does n't use more drones , since they seem quite an artillery heavy military , though I suspect that this question belongs to a dumb question thread more than it belongs here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I do n't see how a guy 's beliefs damage his credibility . Who is to say it 's not his experience in the air force that turned him against the government ? And Assad could n't have lasted so long if he did n't have the support of some parts of Syria 's population . Yet there would be no civil war , especially a civil war as brutal as this one , if he was n't utterly hated by another part . Almost by necessity those 2 parts of the population must have been treated in a vastly different manner . And need I mention , there have been very few Alawi rebels . Edit : And on the point of Assad lasting so long , I do n't have to remind you how long the apartheid regime lasted with practically no support from the black majority .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well my reasoning was that ATGMs would be a new threat that the SAA has never faced before , while an ambush is amongst the oldest tricks in the book . So assuming SAA commanders are inflexible embodiments of bureaucratic inertia , they would follow their tactical manuals , which would account for the possibility of ambush . And no , you did n't sound mean .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Thank you .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"But is n't the forcing a retreat ( or making the enemy unable to resist the offensive in some other way ) part the one that consumes the most time and effort ?

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Yeah there is . Counter-propaganda . All it would take is one tech-savvy guy with a laptop connecting to some wifi in Olgino and spamming a few hundreds/thousands searches for `` reddit '' . It would n't take too much of an effort really , seeing how Reddit is not terribly popular in Russia anyway - even /russia has only 16,497 followers . Generally , english language social websistes are incomparably less popular that domestic ( russian ) alternatives , such as vk.com to facebook Not really . Google does tend to notice attempts at manipulation does it not . It 's not like advertisers do n't try to manipulate google to make their products look more popular .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Those are two different things . You are probably thinking about manipulating adsense ads or something . You ca n't have it both ways - paid trolls operating from a office in Olgino boosting the ranking of a search term , and discounting the option of someone doing counter propaganda from the same area . All I 'm saying is that if google data was manipulated , it would probably require a greater level of sophistication than some guy with a laptop running some kind of script . It is reasonable to assume it would require the kind of internet service used by a medium sized or maybe large business for example . At this point you begin to wonder whether the whole effort do discredit Russia is n't too risky and too costly to be really worth it . & gt ; If paid trolls do exist , I would tend to argue that both sides cancel each other out . Not really , the ones with more resources at their disposal would be more noticeable , would n't they ? And considering that Russia is known to spend much more money on propaganda than Western countries ( There are no less than 20 national TV channels in Russia controlled by the government . ) , I 'd say Russian ones are quite likely to amongst the best funded out there , would n't you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Why not ? It 's supposedly an organisation that houses hundreds of people , is it not ? It 's not like someone would go to Olgino and hire hundreds of people in a plot to discredit Russia . & gt ; Nah . Search queries are not bandwidth intensive , on the contrary . Still , I assume you are going to need some amount other traffic in order to impersonate a lot of people . And the question remains , why has n't the Russian government or anyone in Russia uncovered this plot to discredit the country . You 'd expect they 'd someone in their security services to uncover such a needlessly complex and expensive plot to discredit their already unpopular country . & gt ; As I have shown , western trolling campaign is being conducted even by the official military units . Knowing the huge discrepancy between Russian and western military budgets it is the West that has the upper hand by a wide margin . Once again , even the Russian military puts much more importance on propaganda than western military . The Russian defence military has it 's own television channel . Neither the American nor British not French military have the same thing . It is reasonable to assume that those that put great importance on propaganda , will spend much more on it , compared to those that value it far less . & gt ; Also besides direct media ownership you should be counting in the the myriad of non-governmental organizations and projects funded by the West , as it is a form of propaganda as well . The propaganda value of an NGO is extremely questionable . The propaganda value of a TV channel is not .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I do n't think that impersonating an organisation with hundreds of people on its payroll is a simple task . It would require an effort large enough to be noticed . And it that is what had really happened , at least someone in Russia would have noticed . Since plotting to make it look like the Russian government hires internet trolls ( trough some company in St. Peter in that case ) is a plot to discredit Russia , regardless of what you say , someone in the Russian counter-intelligence would have done something about it . And once again , there is no reason why anyone in the west spend so much effort , and risk so much on a harebrained plot to discredit Russia . It 's already a highly unpopular country in most of the world . Most of the countries where Russia is popular are autocracies or oligarchies anyway , and popular opinion in those kinds of countries does n't really matter . And there is nothing you can say to convince me , or most reasonable people at that , that the country where the government controls 20 TV channels , including most of the major ones , spends less on propaganda than countries where most TV channels are private . The american military might have made a game , or hired a sports team , the Russian military , apart from maintaining the TV channel I mentioned , organises massive annual parades , and events like Tank Biathlons , designed to promote it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

As far as I can remember , the Houthis have been loosing territory and cities , have they not ? & gt ; What is more likely to happen , even if KSA really starts shipping in heavy weapons , is that RuAF will simply have a more target rich environment . Because Russian airplanes are practically invincible to air defense , are they not ?

If NATO countries do nothing in a war between Russia and Turkey ( so long as the war escalates to the point where Russia counterattacks on Turkish soil ) , do n't you think that every headline of every newspaper in the western world would consist of nothing but sardonic puns on `` Peace of our time '' ? Let us be honest here , the only reason why we have n't seen a major western military engagement recently is because the Western world has so far been , strategically , on the offensive ( an extremely imprecise term , but unfortunately I can think of no better ) , in both Syria and Ukraine , with all of Russia 's recent actions being a reaction against pro-Russian governments collapsing or being at risk of collapse .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Here are the main problems with that . In order to achieve a lasting peace , the current Syrian government ( or any Syrian government that has come as the result of a `` reform '' of the present one ) would need large scale , persistent economic and military aid , provided over an exceedingly long period of time . Thus if FSA commanders have any reason to doubt that foreign support for the government will continue for the next say 10 years of conflict and recovery they are better of continuing their resistance . Throwing one 's lot with Bashar , a peacetime leader whose only major achievement is plunging his country in a civil war and a wartime leader under whose command the Army has required persistently larger foreign support , is just too risky . To put it simply , supporting the current Syrian government is to bet your and your family 's life on Iran , and now Russia being always there to help the Syrian army . As a corollary to that the Al-Nursa Front is far more valuable of an ally . While outside governments dislike that organization , it does n't depend on the fickle support of foreigners for its continued existence . Finally , there is no reason why the Coalition should support the Syrian government . The word terrorists does not make all the major rules of strategy and policy invalid . As of now Russia , Iran and Hezbollah are fighting those terrorists . Since the coalition governments consider Russia , Iran and Hezbollah enemies and in case of the last one terrorists , there is no reason why the coalition should try to end the fight between their major enemies . It is far better to let them fight each other and sap each other 's strength .

100100145,ukpolitics,"Then , do you think a society should sacrifice it 's ability to advance in order to increase social mobility ? Because high inheritance tax will only encourage old people to spend money on luxuries ( and probably tax avoidance schemes as well ) rather than invest .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; That 's not society sacrificing it 's ability to advance , it 's the rich sacrificing their ability to give unfair benefits to their lineage . The economy of the country is not a game . It 's the source of the people 's quality of life . Efforts to make it fair should not lower the standard of life it provides to all people , from the poorest to the richest . & gt ; Personally , I believe the elderly should be free to enjoy themselves rather than be so focused on making life easy for their family . We also have an economy based on spending , it 's not a problem if they spend on luxuries instead . When a company receives money from investment it spends them mostly to research and develop a new product , usually a product for the lower strata in a society . When a person buys a luxury product he only benefits himself and the usually quite few people that made the product . It 's also a matter of what we value as a society - would you rather we had a new line of microprocessors or some old guy had a yaht ? & gt ; If they did n't inherit it , they earned it , why should n't they enjoy it ? And why not have them give it to whomever they wish . & gt ; Also , people owning houses and passing them onto their children does ensure that there 's a gulf in society between those who 're lucky enough to have a home from their parents , and those whose parents were poor . Not really . A house is not that difficult thing to construct . Where I come from people would often build their own , sometimes just with the help of their families and extended families . Why would the poor have problems getting accommodation of their own ? & gt ; Tax avoidance is obviously going to happen , but refusing to do the right thing because of criminals is ridiculous , you just keep closing the loop holes . Because when you give people the choice of either loosing hundreds of thousands or becoming criminals the choice they are going to make is clear . And if you try to stop their criminal activities , they will simply offer a good part of the sum to your tax inspector , and he will make the same choice as well . & gt ; But anyway , this is just ideology . If you believe that your place in society should be entirely based upon your actions , you need inheritance tax . If you want people to be born into being rich , and never having to do anything themselves simply because of their luck to be born rich , and on the flip side with so much old money you accept the fact that those from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to succeed . If that 's fine with you , social mobility is n't for you . I 'd rather not sacrifice everyone 's quality of life to make everyone 's quality of life closer to everyone else 's quality of life , would you ?",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; It 's hard to lower someone 's quality of life once they 're dead . I 'm talking about inheritance tax here , lol . Yes and my argument against inheritance taxes is that they affect the way old people employ their money , in a way that ultimately hurts everyone , though mostly the poor . & gt ; And then the yacht company buys metals , woods , and plastics . They all employ people down the chain , who then spend on other goods and so on . It 's a chain , and you 've got to keep the money moving . The more transactions the better , this is why deflation is so bad , once people feel products will be cheaper in the future they stop buying luxuries and hoarding cash and the economy grinds to a halt . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts . The economy is a lot more than whether the rich buy shares or yachts , but it 's affected by it . And far more poor people will benefit from a rich guy spending money on shares , rather than yahts . & gt ; Because all land is owned , and if you 're lucky enough to own any land , permission is hard to get . If you go ahead and build something anyway councils then threaten to demolish it . We do n't have anywhere where someone can turn up with a positive attitude and a handful of tools , chop some wood and build a home . It 's against the law . Do n't you think that messing up with inheritance taxes is a poor substitute to addressing the actual issue . If permits are hard to get , there will be a housing shortage one way or another . If there is a housing shortage , quite a lot of people will be screwed up . If it 's not tenants paying exorbitant amount of money , it 's going to be people driven to homelessness because the new owners of the house , free from the burden of rent , have no incentive to share it with anyone else . The only way to deal with a housing shortage is to encourage the construction of more houses and that includes stuff like easing permits and allowing a procedure the legalization of illegal buildings . Where I come from , in some ( admittedly rare ) cases the municipality has been known to offer legalization of homes built on their property if people just agree to buy the land on which the home has been built , and at the ridiculously cheap rate of 0.61 euros per square meter at that . & gt ; Is n't corruption awesome ? It is not . It is a fact of life though , and if a policy of the government encourages corruption that has to be accounted for . & gt ; Yeah , fuck the poor . They should stay poor so that rich people can inherit everything they can from their families and never have to work . People should know their place in society and stay there . Well yeah , fuck the poor . Who cares if their lives get better ? Nah , they should be forced to live in pain and misery , just for the British people 's sadistic delight . As long as occasionally we force a rich guy to swap places with a poor one it 's all ethically OK ... Now do can we please refrain from making turning each other 's statements into a mockery of themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,UkrainianConflict,"`` Russia 's action in Ukraine was controversial '' does not imply that the conflict is over and the Russian actions towards Ukraine are accepted . Instead it implies that Russia 's actions in Ukraine are a thing of the past . At this point , it should be clear to everyone that Russia has lost its initiative as well as its ability to control events . Saying `` Russia 's action in Ukraine was controversial '' is like saying `` Serbia 's action in Croatia was controversial '' in 1992 . We are seeing a reduction in fighting not because Russia 's actions have been accepted but because Ukraine is awaiting an opportune moment to act .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Or that all negotiations with Russia have reached a dead end and they have now decided to take measures that would neutralize their aid to the Syrian government .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"That would be an unnecessarily aggressive course of action , but even that is not impossible . For example Russia might *bomb* the group participating in the train and equip program . If the whole thing has to be made more convincing to corpses are not that hard to acquire in a country in the middle of a civil war . Both NATO and the Arab countries posses significant numbers of soviet era aircraft , that could make a bombing run or two if that proves to be necessary . And of course there is the matter that the government of the Russian Federation has been screaming false flag left and right recently , so few will believe them . The times when the Syrian government bombed rebels that were fighting IS could be pointed out as well . If the whole thing is executed well enough Washington will be very outraged indeed at Russia deliberately sabotaging their efforts . Since the groups in the train and equip program were already forced to sign documents stating that they would not fight the Syrian government , only IS , there is no way to interpret Russia 's action but as a deliberate attempt to support the Islamic State , in the hope that this will help Assad politically . The American government will have no option but to declare that any Syrian or Russian military aircraft that enters or approaches rebel airspace could be shot down . If executed carefully and intelligently , there is no reason why the whole thing ca n't go as smoothly . But of course it 's probably not necessary to go that far . More subtle methods definitely exist as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If the US declares an area of Syria off limits for Russian aircraft what could Russia realistically do ? You are right though , the US is unlikely to take that step unless things change dramatically , since far simpler measures could do as well .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"The United States does poses stealth aircraft , you know .

The operators of those systems as well as their commanders should be well aware that if they do , they , as well as the entire Russian military mission are going to perish and there is nothing that anyone could do to save them . You see in general it 's the weak that have to fear escalation rather than the strong . Because escalation will only allow the strong to bring their might to bear against the weak .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Ok , first of all you have no idea how this AA performs against stealth fighters . I wager very well , but you can bet that the US does n't want to find out on the battlefield . NATO has been in possession of S-300 systems for quite some time now . It is extremely unlikely that those systems were not taken into account when designing their stealth aircraft . & gt ; Secondly , if you think Russians wo n't follow orders , you are delusional . The Russian army consists of conscripts and professional soldiers , not fanatics . They could follow suicidal orders , but they might choose not to . & gt ; Thirdly , even if the coalition wipes out this force which they wo n't , Russia can commit to a full ground invasion through and with Iran . Of course , right after they conquer the south Caucasus that is . As well as Iraq , as well . It 's not like Abadi is going to forget the reason why he is not fighting Islamic state armored and mechanized brigades . & gt ; Or they can just secretly pass a ballistic missile tech to NK putting the US under nuclear threat from NK . The Chinese are not going to like that , are they ? & gt ; Fourthly , the US will never risk a full scale war with a country that can wipe out the world several times ove And so will Russia .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's funny how Putin used to talk about Novorussia and how the South and East of Ukraine should n't really be part of that country . It 's funny how the Russian military academies have textbooks that say that Russia could not remain a great power if Ukraine continued to be an entity with its own independent desires . It 's funny how they recommended that Ukraine be divided into smaller states that Russia could control . And yet once it became clear that there is no way they could ever take and hold the South and East , once it became clear that the country could n't be divided , the goal of the Russian operations in Ukraine suddenly became much more limited . If you observe how the strategic situation has changed as a result of the Russian military intervention , you will see who won and who lost . Because now , with major parts of the pro-Russian population in Ukraine quarantined in the People 's Republics , the government in Kiev has never been more secure in its power , and could only be replaced by even more Russophobic forces . Now Russia has been effectively been cut of from Europe and it 's likely to remain so foe the forseeable future . Because now , Russia has a determined enemy right at its border , ready to use any moment of Russian weakness against Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Once again , I have to ask , given that back in the days Putin personally questioned why should the Ukrainian south and east be part of the country , do we have any evidence that he ever had such limited aims ? It 's interesting how goals can retroactively change , in order to make sure they were achieved successfully , is n't it ? And the whole using the Donbass to destabilize the country only makes sense if the Donbass was under government control . Now that it 's not pro-western forces are more secure in their power than they have ever been . Before the war the Donbass was , due to subsidies secured by the Party of Regions , a major drain on the Ukrainian budget . Nowadays Russia pays for it . The difference between annexing the region and splitting it away from the country is quite minimal . And I 've been hearing about the sanctions being lifted for the past 6 months . There is simply no reason for them to be lifted . They damage Russia and no one else . Finally , Russian pipelines being announced with a lot of fanfare happens quite often . Russian pipelines being built is a much more rare occurrence , to say the least . Another pipe being announced does n't indicate anything . I 'm sorry , but the Russian operations in Ukraine can be interpreted as a success , only if you do n't analyze the situation too deeply .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"My Russian is not very good but I think I think I could give you the gist it . The soldiers refuse to fight unless given written orders as required by military law . The military prosecution refuses to answer inquiries by the Presidential Human Rights Council on that matter . They military prosecution has instead given the case to the FSB . The FSB is threatening the soldiers with convictions for felony . For one reason or another they avoid mentioning articles of the criminal code , but informally mention `` state treason '' .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I can understand the article the source of Gazeta seems to be the lawyer of the soldiers and officials from the Presidential Human Rights Council , rather than the soldiers themselves .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,Do you have a source for that ? A link to the articles in question ?,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I see . But at least in the article , it 's the lawyer that describes the situation to the press , so I would guess someone connected to the case has already contacted him . Though it probably does not matter . Since the orders were given in clear violation of the law , the soldiers probably ca n't be charged for disclosing them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Indeed , and the internet researchers have come with them . I just do n't think they were here before , or , if nothing else , at least they used way more subtle methods in their research .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The end of Bashar al-Assad probably wo n't be the end of fighting , but it 's likely to dramatically turn the government 's fortunes . If the president were to be removed in a tidy way ( like an military coup for example ) quite a significant amount of rebel fighters would probably stop fighting or defect to the government 's side . Furthermore the government will no longer be intensely hated by large sections of Syrian society , which is an important prerequisite to long-lasting peace in the country . More importantly , in order to secure victory , the government desperately needs to conduct an army reform , and an enormous amount of the measures the government has to undertake are obstructed by the mere existence of the current president . If he were to be removed the SAA would at least have the chance to become a decent fighting force . So Bashar al-Assad 's probably wo n't end the war , nor will it guarantee that the war ends at some point in the future , but at least it would create a way out of this mess . This would be quite a massive improvement as compared to the present situation . The SAA being destroyed , right now , on the other hand is more likely than not to lead to unpleasant situations . The SAA being destroyed over the course of multiple years , is a more complex matter .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Of course they might increase the amount of planes they send , but doing so will tie up quite a lot of resources . And Russia needs to have quite a lot of resources prepared to deal with potential emergencies on more important fronts , seeing how the Post-Soviet area is mostly filled with hostile countries awaiting the moment to strike and disloyal allies that have to be kept in line . Both could probably rely on powerful allies outside of the post-Soviet space , in case of hostilities with the Russian Federation . Because in spite of all the talk about the Western World abandoning friendly post-soviet countries , they have so far received all the help they needed . Military procurement plans have already been cut , so Russia ca n't afford to spend too much on large scale campaigns on faraway fronts . It is my strong belief that in order to have a lasting effect on the course of the war , the Russian military 's involvement will have to be continuous . Because of that , and because of everything I said above , I believe the Russian government will not be willing to direct significant amount of resources towards Syria 's battlefields .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russian tactical doctrines , unlike American ones , actually advocate putting helicopters in harm 's way , though . From what I undetstand in general Russian helicopter casualties have always been much higher than American ones in comparable conflicts .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The SAA is worse . In fact I 'm going to say that the Syrian Arab Republic is more corrupt and in general worse for its people as a regime than fascist Italy . Autocracies that proudly proclaim themselves as such are in generals much less corrupt as compared to autocracies that claim they are democratic . In that sense the Syrian state has more similarities with imperial Rome than with the dictatorships of the first half of the 20th century . It is certainly more unstable , worse economically , and more self destructive than any of the fascist states ever were , with the major exception of Germany . And it goes beyond mere personalities . Fascist Italy managed to depose Mussolini , the German generals made like 5 attempts on Hitler 's life , yet the SAA 's generals just stand by while Assad leads the SAA and the entire Syrian state to its doom .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Its kind of sad , really . Before the Russian support , the Syrian government looked like it might adopt a reasonably good defensive strategy , they even seemed to reach some kind of stalemate with Jaish al-Fateh in the Al-Ghab plain .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"In Afghanistan there was an Afghan Military as well . And while the idea that the US should just support the South Vietnamese Army , rather than to fight the war on its own only gained traction when the Vietnam war was coming to a close , the idea that Soviet troops are there to assist and nothing more was an integral part of Soviet strategy in Afghanistan from the start .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Russians may not have supplied MANPADs to the Taliban , but from what I understand at the point of the American invasion of Afghanistan such rockets were readily available in the region , which was not true during the Soviet invasion for the most part . And once again we are comparing 2 separate wars with just one . As for Vietnam , once again I 'm going to say that the conflict is not comparable Afghanistan . North Vietnam was a country with an actual army , armored troops and air force . In Afghanistan the USSR fought militias . The wars can not be compared .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"If they really cared for that , they would have been ready to do whatever it takes to bring victory to the SAA . By now it should be obvious to everyone that the commander in chief is a massive liability . Yet no attempts to remove or kill him have been made . Yes , in event of a rebel victory there is a strong possibility of sectarian violence . But that is not going to be a problem for the SAA 's senior officers . Because sectarian violence is something that will happen to other people . High ranking officers and their families , meanwhile , will spend their time in comfort and luxury somewhere far away .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"As far as I remember the definition a republic is a state in which political power does not stem from the private matters of a single family . So any single form of government apart from hereditary autocracy . Thus the Syrian Arab Republic can not be called a republic , since it 's rule is in practice hereditary and autocratic . You are right though , contrasting autocracies and republics is incorrect . I should fix that .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"There might not be another option I 'm afraid . In recent years Russian foreign policy has been driven more and more by populism . Because of that I believe that the Russian government is going to be extremely hesitant to undertake any action that may hurt it 's popularity . That limits the courses of action they may choose . Giving up now is n't going to be perceived well by the Russian public . `` It seems that the side in the civil war that we have been supporting for 4 years now as stalwarts of stability is actually incapable of fighting , so I guess we 'd have to give up . '' is a statement that could be very difficult to sell . If the Russian government does not step up its intervention and does not achieve any significant effects on the ground it risks looking weak , probably out of touch as well . So that is out of the question as well . So unless there is another option , it might be the case that picking up the SAA 's slack is the only way they can proceed from here .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"People in the Russian government have suggested the use of the same mercenaries and right wing paramilitaries they used to send in Ukraine , so that is a way to go around the unpopularity of sending ground troops into Syria . Granted this would be reinforcing an under-performing army with another under-performing army , but nothing is perfect . It may not turn the tide in the war , but most likely would result in periods of temporary success for the Syrian armed forces . The Russian government can reasonably hope , that in the time it takes for the rebels to adapt to the new threat , there shall emerge a way for the Russian government to disengage from the conflict with its popularity intact . Edit : In practice things are quite likely to go bad , but they are unlikely to go bad immediately . Since I believe the Russian government is quite shortsighted , that would be acceptable to them .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"They would get far less volunteers , probably only the most dedicated among the religious fanatics would go to Syria with nationalists staying away , but the Russian Federation can draw ample amounts of mercenary soldiers from among its population . Because of conscription there is no shortage of trained men . Because of the economic and social system , there are enough poor people willing to risk their lives for relatively small sums of money . They would probably be sufficient to compensate for the lack of volunteers . And it 's not like the Russians has to or could afford to send that big of an army in Syria . In Ukraine they send tens of thousands of men , sending ten thousand men to Syria and supplying them there would be a major logistical challenge .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The Syrian army has been receiving training and advisers from Russia/The Soviet Union since the nineteen-sixties . If the Russian army could have helped , it would have done so decades ago .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I find that kind of arguments interesting . It 's so typical of Russian foreign thinking . Those oppressed people have no agency and no ability to act on their own . Instead they are mere tools to be used by other nations . I will tell you this , those Shia in Saudi Arabia either will rise in rebellion or they wo n't , it 's their decision to make . And the only country that could do anything to change their decision is neither Russia , nor Iran but Saudi Arabia itself .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The thing is they ca n't just switch from throwing armor at the rebels to throwing bombs at them as they seem to want to . The rebels and their allies will just adapt to that . Instead infantry and armor doctrines have to be altered in order to become viable in this war . Unfortunately to implement such a strategy is likely impossible without an overall army reform . And good luck getting that with this president . Edit : To add upon what I said I want to add that the Syrian government seems to think that the solution to any problem it encounters is more stuff . First it was more soldiers , which is why we got Hezbollah and the Hazas . That worked for a while , but eventually advances ground to a halt . Then it was more generals , which is why we got the IRCG generals . But more generals does n't equal better tactics and strategy . Now they seem to have decided they need more bombs , hence why the Russians are here . This too shall fail .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So there was some kind of riot in Najran , but it was defused relatively quickly and with very little bloodshed . My point still stands . And beyond that , considering that the only sources of information I 've been able to find about those events are wildly conflicting second hand accounts , the earliest of which seems to be from [ 2008 ] ( https : //www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0908web.pdf ) , I suspect that the events that transpired in the province in 2000 might have been much less serious than they are presented as in your article , and maybe in HRW 's document as well .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Ukraine was hardly backed by the west in the battlefield was it ? Anyway , the answer to your first question is yes , but not for military reasons . The Donbass rebellion had no chance to last simply because it was n't a rebellion . The most striking feature of the whole separatist movement there is just how unnatural it was . The Ukrainian government could send its army to quell the unrest , simply because a great part of the unrest involved armed men , often times hailing from foreign countries , seizing police offices and municipal buildings . It 's not so much that the Donbass people could n't have fought against the Ukrainian army , as much as that they would n't have risen up in the first place . To illustrate my point I will note that there was a point where the whole pro-Russian unrest designed to form the state of New-Russia looked like it might succeed , but after the events in Odessa it became clear that supporters of the new government , already battle hardened in street fights with Yanukovich 's special police , were neither intimidated , nor incapable of dealing with an enemy equipped with firearms . In an organic unrest the events that transpired in that city would have only inflamed tensions further . Instead the entire pro-Russian movement in the Ukrainian south east seems to have been recalled , from all regions except the Donbass , where the Russian government could dispatch an overwhelming force and thus ensure the pro-Russian side succeed . Ironically enough if the Russian Government had never resorted to creating a pro-Russian `` revolt '' the Ukrainian government would have now faced the possibility of an actual pro-Russian revolt . Such an event would have been much more difficult to suppress as it would have been politically difficult for the Ukrainian government to send the army against a genuine rebellion . When Yanukovich tried to do that the general staff simply refused his orders . Also pro-Russian protests would probably have been more effective if they involved large groups of people , rather than small ones , trying to compensate for their size with violence and occasionally with firearms . But instead of allowing a genuine revolt to form , and then supporting it , the Russian government decided to organize the revolt all by itself . As for Syria , the rebellion had largely been successful , without any significant foreign aid , before the point when the Syrian government got foreign aid of its own , in the form of Hezbollah troops . And I 'm going to say that rebellions can sometimes succeed without foreign aid , and sometimes they ca n't , but in any case , the a revolt can only hope to be successful , if it develops naturally , on its own , trough the grievances of the population . A `` rebellion '' raised by some foreign country , ( if you can even call it that ) is by bound to fail to achieve it 's goals , and it 's mere survival would require enormous amounts of foreign support . ( The post I was responding to was responding to was suggesting that Russia should raise a revolt among the Saudi Shia , in retaliation to Saudi Support for the rebels . No idea why it was deleted . )",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"The fact remains that we have no first hand accounts of the events , no documentary or material evidence to point us at what really happened , and both the author of your article , as well as his sources are likely to exaggerate the extent and the level of success of the whole thing . And to be frank , the series of events described in the article hardly make sense . All Saudi security servicemen in the town ran away in the face of the armed rioters around the governor 's residence , yet the governor was unharmed , and the whole incident ended incredibly peacefully and incredibly quickly . That sounds incredibly unlikely . And nothing that happened in 2000 indicates that the people of Najran have any desire to rid themselves of Saudi rule . Iran and Russia may provide all the weapons they wish to anyone they wish , but without a real rebellion they would achieve nothing , except anger the Saudi Government .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

That is correct , What I 'm saying is that it 's generally considered incredibly humiliating for a president to lack the support of those in his own government . & gt ; I was n't aware that the US Congress wants a no fly zone against Russia .

Regardless of what people around here may think , refusing a call to arms by a NATO member would have consequences far more serious than going to war with Russia . A war with Russia risks escalating things to the point where nuclear weapons are used , refusing to defend a NATO member would guarantee that . And no , the Falklands war is not indicative of anything . It 's just that Britain never requested military aid , mostly due to political reasons . Nobody refused Britain any help it requested , or needed . And in spite of that American carriers were sent to assist the British if they met any resistance they could n't handle .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; If Turkey , for whatever reason , starts undertaking independent and aggressive action , characteristic of a rogue state , resulting in a conflict with Russia . In my view , it would almost certainly be denied military assistance from NATO and perhaps even expelled from the alliance if regulations permit doing so . You suggest that direct military action is the only possible response that NATO members could take , despite the NATO Call to Arms ( Article 5 ) specifically leaving that decision in the hands of individual members to do what they deem wise and not necessarily thorough armed force . I think if Turkey happens to be in a war with Russia , the necessity of the use of armed force would be obvious , would n't it . & gt ; When keeping in mind the rational distinction between defending an ally from aggression and aiding an ally 's aggression . No western politician will have legal , moral or political difficulty justifying their lack of military response in such a scenario . Once again , this scenario involves the leadership of Turkey losing their minds and committing an intentional act of war against Russia . It is not a realistic scenario . Do you think the general public in America , or Britain or France cares about legal technicalities . The way they are going to see it a NATO ally has been attacked , because they refused to let a Russian ship trough their seas . Western politicians can ignore that only at their own peril . & gt ; I am afraid that I do not follow your logic here . How does a Turkey losing a skirmish or limited regional conflict with Russia guarantee the use of nuclear weapons ? More so than an actual war between NATO and Russia , where Russia is the party being attacked ? ? ? If Russia can attack a NATO country because of some legal technicality and get away with it , the question becomes can Russia do the same because of some vague moral statement or something . It 's not like the Russian government has shown itself to care about international law . To stick to the letter of the laws in that case would be interpreted as a sign of weakness . And the problem with showing signs of weakness , is that soon after you do it , you will be forced to prove your strength . & gt ; What makes you think that this hypothetical scenario would be called anything but a `` conflict '' or a `` crisis '' . We are not talking about a full land invasion of Turkey . Only about limited naval and aerial skirmishes with potential for bombing of military infrastructure such as ports , airbases and SAM sites .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The general public in America , Britain or France does not care about Turkey or Russia or Syria or NATO . The public however does care about joining in on unnecessary , bloody and expensive wars . Doubly so if this war when taken to its natural conclusion carries a very high likelihood of the apocalypse . I 'm sorry but I just do n't see anyone standing idly by while the Russian government imposes it 's will upon a NATO country . And if someone stands idly by , I assure you , that 's not going to be popular . & gt ; The Western media has found itself to always be closely aligned with the current foreign policy decisions of the respective state . It would not be difficult for the media to convey the government 's position to sway public opinion on their side . The western world is not Russia . Media around here would rather attack a government than support it . And abandoning a NATO country would give them ample opportunity to attack . & gt ; That not `` some legal technicality '' , its international law . The basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states . Its purpose is to avoid needless wars . An illegal naval blockade being an act of war is not some obscure technicality , is one of the oldest and most fundamental laws of the sea . I 'm sorry but what are you talking about ? `` Blockade '' ? ! The only thing Turkey would have to deny Russian ships passage trough it 's territorial waters . Need I remind you that the only reason why Turkey does not use that right is because of some document signed almost 80 years ago . Thus a legal technicality . Though come to think of it , I doubt said document would authorize an armed attack against Turkey , if the Turkish signature under it were withdrawn , so it might not be even that . And need I remind you how laughable the whole `` basis of civil conduct and diplomacy between nation states '' is , when you realize it 's we are discussing Russia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Because sticking with allies is something so fundamental that everyone understands the need to do it . If you stop doing it , you loose all your allies , it 's elementary common sense . The public does n't care about conventions , the UN , international law and all that . They understand international relations in simpler , yet far superior ways . They divide the world into friends and foes , and realize that foes should not be allowed to impose their will upon friends . I assure you , few would like a war , but that does not mean people are unaware of the consequences of betrayal , born out of cowardice and weakness . And because nowadays , in a moment of Russian weakness unlike any we have seen in a century , it 's easy enough to crush Russian attempts to impose their will upon NATO allies . It would be easy enough to hold of the Russians at Turkey 's borders and in the black sea , while coalition air force ends the Syrian government , thereby depriving the war of its purpose . The Warsaw Pact being dead makes the situation worse for the Russian government not better .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"International law is little more than a code of conduct , is it not ? To expect that someone would follow a code of conduct when dealing with those that have shown an utter contempt for that code of conduct is just silly .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"So , the dispatch of an elite infantry brigade was announced more than a weak before the brigade in question actually engaged the enemy in the area . If that 's true , it 's downright insane . Whatever problems the SAA might have , it is a well established army that has fought in multiple wars . I find idea that they would disregard military secrecy in such a horrible manner unbelievable . Also , are SAA 's elite soldiers really so undisciplined as to post information about their deployments ? From what I understand even JaN has cracked down on that practice . Though I can certainly believe that might be the case if the elite brigade in question has lost an excessive portion of its officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Observe , for example , the difference between the methods the Islamic Republic of Iran uses in promoting favorable viewpoints as compared to their arch rival , the Saudi Kingdom . Iranian news outlets , including state news organizations , all behave like tabloids . You 'd expect that a state TV channel would try to maintain a good standing , since it 's reputation is intrinsically linked to the reputation of the state it represents . Yet PressTV has quite justifiably acquired reputation for being deceptive and obviously biased . Overall , Iranian propaganda is crude and amateurish . When people see a story by an Iranian news organization , they expect misinformation . In comparison with Iran the Saudi government deals with foreign media in a far more traditional manner . While Iran has 2 state news agencies and a government TV channel , KSA has only 1 official press agency . The Saudi equivalent of FarsNews would be Al Arabiya , an agency usually taken far more seriously . Saudi media , unlike their Iranian counterparts , rarely tries to deceive it 's viewers and when they do it 's usually done well . As a result any deception they engage in is far more likely to be believed . Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have censorship but in the Kingdom the censor is not the preferred way of controlling the media landscape . Instead the Saudi state encourages a cultural and economic environment hostile to criticism of government . A consequence of that is the fact that they are more than capable of influencing media beyond its borders . It is said that even Al Manar reporters are hesitant to attack the Kingdom . Overall , there is a lot to discuss about Iranian propaganda . It should be clear by now that I consider it to be terrible , and beyond that vastly inferior to the more traditional means of persuasion employed by their main rival . ( I avoid the term propaganda when speaking about Saudi Arabia , since usually the term is used to denote rather crude ways to get one 's point across . ) The reasons for that are something worthy of discussion .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"I 'm afraid the course of the war at the present moment would contradict the idea that telling the enemy your intentions can somehow work to your advantage . Observe that the Syrian Army is vastly superior to the forces of the Islamic State in both manpower and weaponry . Perhaps the Islamic State may have some advantage in terms of fighting spirit but it is nowhere near enough to compensate for the superiority of the SAA 's forces . The SAA usually announces it 's offensives beforehand whereas IS does not . The SAA operations are sometimes successful but sometimes end disastrously . IS on the other hand has come to be known for their surprise offensives that catch the enemy off guard and thus capture large cities in mere days . In contrast to the SAA 's occasional great failures , the Islamic State achieves the occasional great success . The SAA 's failures have lead to a point where the government has been driven to searching salvation in foreign force after foreign force , first Hezbollah , then the IRGC , then Iraqi militias and now the armed forces of the Russian Federation . The Islamic State has been attacked by multiple foreign forces and , while it has been weakened to some degree , it still seems to remain militarily viable . You say that wars are won and lost by the calls of generals and their ability to exploit a situation . But the logical consequence of that is that the enemy 's generals have to be kept as ignorant as possible of the situation , because that way they are likely to make the wrong calls . Edit : Clarified some things . Fixed some other things .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"It 's not a matter of an ability to condemn . Whether you can condemn someone or not does n't really matter , condemnations are just words . What matters is that with regards to the Russian Federation and their allies , the US can now violate every article of international law , without this affecting their relations with other countries . When the US invaded Iraq relations with other countries suffered . When the Russian Federation annexed Ukrainian territory , the diplomatic damage was enormous , to say the least . Yet if the US declares a no fly zone upon Syria now , I assure you , few will care .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Perhaps he has . The Russian Federation and it 's allies ca n't demand that international law be followed , if someone else is violating it . Or rather they could , but doing so would result in nothing but in their contemptuous mockery .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"Deposing governments without UN approval , the US 's worst violation of international law , was something that both the Soviet Union and the Western powers would do occasionaly during the Cold War . Territorial expansion on the other hand was considered inconceivable . In practice the reason why the American government could violate international law and still cite it is that the US never violated it in a manner that shows an utter contempt for that law . Like it or not the fact is that trough its territorial expansion the Russian Federation has suspended the Cold War era rules of conduct between nations , to which the set of rules we call international law are a product of . American violations of international law were always conducted in such a manner that they would avoid a similar effect . There is a reason why the United States allowed Iraq to have an independent government of its own , and a major part of it is that they can now expect that other nations conduct themselves in their dealings with the US within the boundaries of international law , with the occasional acceptable violation . This is why you do n't see many people laughing .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; The idea that Russia would n't defend itself against a US attack is pretty ridiculous . In fact , they have every reason to escalate such a fight to a level where they have parity . The only way they could have parity is if things escalate to the point of use of nuclear weapons . And , to repeat what I said in another post , do you honestly believe that the billionaire rulers of the Russian Federation would risk loosing all they love and cherish for the sake of Russia 's pride and great power status ? Because I highly doubt this is the case . & gt ; The president publicly discarded his opinion . Yes , it 's rather humiliating . Rather more humiliating for the president I 'm afraid .

When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938 it deeply destabilized Europe . In spite of Germany having the muscle to get away with it , the diplomatic consequences were severe enough that a year later Germany found itself in a war with several major powers . When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 peace in Europe remained undisturbed . The diplomatic consequences for the USSR were far less significant . And you keep talking about weak and strong but you seem to forget that those terms are , by their meaning , relative . You repeat the whole strong and weak thing all the time , but you seem to forget that Russia is much weaker than the West in every regard except in strategic weapons .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is there really little to gain from picking up a fight with Russia ? I do n't think so .

All of a sudden , the Russian Federation would loose every ally it has in the Middle East . And beyond that Iran , for example , could reconsider it 's squabble with the Gulf monarchies , and that is something the US would benefit from greatly . I 'm not saying that a conflict with Russia would necessarily be worth it though . There are enormous risks involved in the whole thing . In this case the risks might be great but the reward is great as well . Whether the risks would be worth the reward is not a judgement for me to make , but rather for the people that read intelligence assessments and similar documents , but I assure you the choice is far less clear than you present it .

Most demographics maps say they were mostly Bulgarians with Greek and Serb majorities closer to the countries ' borders . Bulgaria fought many wars with reuniting with Macedonia being the major desire . But after losing the second Balkan war which was completely fought because of Macedonia and WW1 which Bulgaria basically joined to get Macedonia there was a decrease in tensions and there were much larger problems in Bulgaria that it had to deal with . After WW1 Yugoslavia was created and I think that is where Macedonia as a nation really developed . So by 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia there was a legitimate Macedonian nation that wanted to govern itself . An issue with this though was that Macedonia had no real history as a country , and no national identity past the part of the people feeling Macedonian . So in order to create a Macedonian national identity the government started separating the language with Bulgarian ( which tbh had already developed differences ) amongst other things while taking huge liberties with history like making outright wrong claims like saying they were descendants of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,Liberal,Capitalism is based on how the economy of the world has worked since the first coins were minted . There was always capitalism in the US ( at least after the Europeans arrived ) . I dont agree with Laissez-faire capitalism and I think there should be a socialist counter balance to capitalism but communism is going way too far . As a liberal I believe in equality and equality means that people have the right to work harder to achieve more . Its not a perfect system but until we get a better one we have to deal with it .

I do not reject Crimea 's desires but reject the way Russia invaded another nation , annexed territory from it and sent soldiers , supplies , and weaponry in that same country to support separatists . The referendum was illegal and of course so was the annexation . Ukraine is the one who needs to decided whether to give them a referendum or not , even though I personally would like them to choose which country they want to be in , especially because of the confusing situation of Ukraine .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,videos,"Ukraine 's government was corrupt and bought by Russia . Which is one of the reason why the people started protesting . Then the police responded with a very heave counter offensive indeed killing some people . But it wasnt a rebellion , it wasnt a riot . It was a protest turned violent by the police at certain points at certain places in Ukraine 's capital . Then the president escapes to Russia leaving a trail of corruption left to be discovered by the people . The whole protest was over by the time that Russia sent soldiers and tanks to Crimea and annexed it . At first they even denied sending any troops which is what they also did in Eastern Ukraine before even Putin admitting they had sent soldiers and heavy military equipment to aide the separatists and fight Ukraine . My country has done these things like in the early 20th century when such things were normal . But it is expected more of the modern states in fucking Europe . Plus I say again , just because other countries have done similar things it does not justify Russia in doing them as well . And critique of countries doing dumb shit is highly needed from the inside and the outside so it stops countries from doing such things . But Russia has no people on the inside who can call out because many of them turn up with bullets to the back of their heads if they do and also Russia controls all significant media organisations in the country and is very successful at mind-washing their citizens .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

If a city or a ranged unit can attack an enemy you no longer get a notification , also no notification if an enemy enters your borders . Very annoying in multiple-front wars . 2 . The warmongering system is dumb af . I declare one war after 200 turns and everybody goes to hating me when I had been attacked by all my neighbours at least 2 times per civ until then . This makes no sense . Plus why the hell is the war penalty harsher at the start of the game ? Surely war is much more despised now than during the medieval era . This is not historically accurate and breaks my immersion . 3 . The trading system with other civs is the most annoying aspect of all . I heard that they made it so that the more you have compared to the other civ the more they will want from you . This is completely illogical . At the end of my game people stopped even giving me anything and just wanted gifts , anything more would offend them . How is 1 luxury item worth 3 of mine because I have more than them ? Makes absolutely no sense and basically makes it impossible to use this aspect of the game if you start winning . 4 . The automatic change of unit selection . Oh.My.God . I have selected a unit stop throwing me on the other side of the map to play what you want . I have sent units on incorrect random trips so many times by mistake . I have selected move order and the dumbass game selects the other unit while I am clicking . Why ? ! Just let me have the option to turn it off . 5 . Smaller things : Range of ranged units sometimes change . One turn I can attack a unit the next turn I cant . I cant understand why this is happening . Other smaller annoyances with the AI in diplomacy . Why dont I have move your troops away ? Sometimes they can say that to me if I have 1 unit 2 tiles away but I have not once been able to use it myself . Why are land units so strong when being transported over water ? I had a battleship , a rocket ship and a submarine all trying to stop a small invasion force of 5-6 units ( mechs , tanks ) and I was only able to sink one .

Ive come to universally being hated in both games I played , in the second one I was much more passive only declaring war very late into the game and still . 5 : I think in most of these cases yes .

What about the Bangkok Titans 0-6 ? ANX is more likely a miracle run than a sign that other IWC regions are on that level . INTZ won the first game due to EDG completely underestimating them and then they proceeded to lose every other game . If that game was a BO2 or BO3 INTZ couldnt have taken the series because it was a fluke . IWC has become better but only so that the pther regions cant beat them without a gameplan and some prep . Imo IWC earned their first seed last worlds and thanks to ANX and ANX only they have maybe gotten competitive enough to maybe be given a second seed for next years . But still I believe that its most likely that one of the IWC seeds will just mean one less competitor in one of the groups and easier quarters for the other teams in the groups which is rather unfair .

I also have a huge interest in early humans so I found the first half of the book very interesting though once it got to Ancient Greece , the Renaissance I lost interest because I already knew enough about those periods to not need the gross oversimplification and compression .

They also managed to land a shit tonne of troops next to Nanjing even though I have the whole coastline and ports protected by the 30 or so Juntuans but they seem to be useless . They ca n't fight off a landing of more than a couple of units and then are completely useless in fighting the Japanese off the coasts before they reinforce .

They sent money to their families back home which boosted 'domestic ' income and thus Yugoslavia 's GDP .

2ntle,makemychoice,"Hi , I 'm from Split . First , tell your folks to educate themselves and second , get your tickets already , they 're going to sell out ! Seriously , Croatia is as safe as it gets in Europe , especially when it comes to violent crimes . There 's a ton of people here in the summer , an will be even more for Ultra , so there might be a pickpocket here and there , but that 's pretty much it .

2ntle,travel,"I 'm going to try to make an list of places that have all the stuff you mentioned that you enjoy . However , you might run into crowds , since there are a lot of people that enjoy those things as well : D Zagreb - in contrast to ancient history shared by many coastal towns , Zagreb 's is more medieval . It 's similar to Prague and Budapest in that regard . It 's not so crowded in the summer . Has lots of museums . Has a nice vista overlooking the city . Trogir - a small town near Split , really pretty and historic . Not really must-see but it 's near Split so it 's convenient . Plus , by being so underrated it 's not so crowded . It 's connected to island of Čiovo where you can find some nice beaches to unwind . Split - has an ancient Roman palace , museums and galleries . Nice vista from Marjan hill overlooking the city . The beaches in the city are okay , but the main ones are likely to be crowded . The nice , more secluded ones are usually known only to the locals . Split is a port to the ferry that will take you to Hvar - both town of Hvar and Stari Grad on island of Hvar are worth visiting . They have their bit of history ( Stari Grad is the oldest town in Croatia , dating back to ancient Greece ) , nature and good beaches . Dubrovnik - beautiful town with lots of ancient as well as recent history . Has a great view from the hill outside the town ( you can get up there by a cable car ) . Downside is that is probably the busiest town on the coast , especially if you have the 'luck ' of visiting on the same day as three cruise ships . Still worth the visit , though .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I believe that Split merits a visit , however , it does tend to get somewhat crowded since there are tourists that are there to see Split and others that are there to catch a ferry for the islands or a bus further down south . But it 's the biggest city on the coast so there more to do and see .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Foreign tourists are usually the ones to pick up hitchers , locals not so much . I would suggest contacting national newspaper based in Split , called Slobodna Dalmacija . If they could run a story on the charity and give some info to locals about orange hooded people on the roads you might have a easier time getting rides ( esp . seeing that there will be almost 400 of you here ) . I can try to dig up some contact info if you want . Good luck from Split .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,croatia,"1 . It 's pretty prevalent , you should be able to get by with no problems 2 . This is second-hand info , but I 've heard that the train is pretty good 3. and 4 . That would be the bus that does n't take the motorway but state roads instead . If you take a route that looks something like Zagreb - Plitvice Lakes - Zadar - Šibenik - Split you should cover the scenery and the other cities part . The trip back , from Split up north is practically the same , so you can split the stuff you want to see between coming and going . There are a couple of other national parks on the way like Krka and Brijuni so if nature floats your boat give them a go ( even if it does n't , you 'll be here for 2 weeks , you have to pass the time somehow ) . Other than that , the usual touristy stuff you 'll find in the cities and maybe some hiking , kayaking , whitewater rafting , biking , etc . Note that 15 days in Croatia , especially if Split is as far south as you 'll go , is plenty , so there are n't any must-see things 'cause you 'll see everything there is to see .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Your schedule is tight but not necessarily too tight . If you keep on track and stay organized you should n't have any problems . Try to make both Kotor and Mostar work if you can . Kotor for beautiful scenic drive and Mostar for history and culture . But , if you really ca n't , then scrap Kotor since it 's in the opposite direction . You can , however , skip Vis . It 's a long ferry ride from Split and it 's a more of a relaxing , tranquil kind of place with nothing really to see . Bring the car with you to Hvar . That way you 'll be able to easily see both Hvar and Stari Grad and check out lavender fields more inland on your own . Unless you 're Scandinavian and used to swimming in frozen lakes you 'll find the water too cold . Maybe if the weather is really warm that week give it a go in Rovinj . The water currents are weaker up north making the sea a bit warmer . Although Plitvice are becoming hugely popular , I do n't think you really need to spend the night there . Yes , there 'll probably be lots of tourists but nowhere near as in mid July so you 'll have no problem going around and seeing everything . It 's a 3 hour trip from Split so if you get up a bit earlier you can get there early enough . While Rovinj is said by many to be the most beautiful town on the coast it 's also , as Vis , more of a unwind type of place so I suggest you use it as a base for trips to other Istrian towns and maybe a trip to the wine country inland .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"No problem , hope you have a great time here !",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"I was going to say that 5 nights in Hvar is a bit too much , but I saw your explanation and that 's good enough for me . However , I really do n't know what do you plan on doing in Makarska for 2 nights , if you 're using Hvar for your chilling back and relaxation needs . Makarska is basically a place that attracts two types of tourists : a ) families with children that just want to unplug for a week and do nothing , and b ) day trippers from the surrounding area , mostly BiH . As for seeing or doing anything there really is n't anything there . So your options there are literally a ) go to the beach and b ) go to a different beach .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Hmm , the coastal part of the country between Split and Dubrovnik is filled with towns and villages similar to Makarska - lots of nice beaches and apartments and rooms for rent , but lacking in anything that would be considered an activity . There 's a catamaran connecting Hvar and Korčula ( I guess that 's how you 're planning on getting to Dubrovnik , there 's no ferry from Hvar to there ) . So maybe stop there on your way down . Korčula has more to offer than Makarska ( it 's allegedly the birthplace of Marco Polo ) but it 's not extremely popular so you wo n't be caught in a crowd like you 'll likely to be in Dubrovnik .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Yeah , that be a great idea , Plitvice Lakes definitely merit a visit . Zadar is a bit closer to them so you might want to squeeze them in in the beginning , before heading down to Split .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Korčula is somewhat less popular than Hvar so it 'll be emptier , but I 'm not sure will it be empty . Both islands have historical sights to check out . Hvar is more known for it 's lavander and nightlife . Korčula ( and the peninsula connecting it with land ) are know for their wine so choose accordingly . I 'd say that at least one of them merits a visit , but if your schedule is tight and you ca n't make it then I guess you 'll have to leave them for the next visit here : )",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"You can take the state roads in one direction and the motorway in the other . That way you can enjoy the scenery the state road has to offer ( especially the Split-Dubrovnik part ) and save some money on tolls . It will take longer , however . I 'd say , and that 's being as unbiased as I can , that there 's as much to do and see in Split as there 's in Dubrovnik . People that say otherwise usually fall into one of these categories a ) have only been to one of the two or b ) have n't been to either one . But I wo n't press you on this one , you can do your own research . Dubrovnik is more popular with tourists because it 's more , well , touristy . Everything is laid out for you and all you have to do is to follow your tour guide . As opposed to Split where I had a tourist ask me 'where 's that palace ' while being inside it . If you do decide to stay in Split for more than a few hours make sure that the place you 'll be sleeping at provides a parking space . As velynasha said , parking in Split can get a bit tricky , especially downtown , so if your accommodations are n't in the center leave your car there and walk and/or use public transportation to go sightseeing . Come on you Gooners",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Dubrovnik is easy , as in there 's only so much you can do there so you probably wo n't miss anything . I do n't know when you 're coming or what are your interests so I 'll try to keep it as general as possible . Things to do in Dubrovnik : Wander around the old town . Get lost in the small alleys . Push through the crowds ( Dubrovnik is 1 ) the most popular tourist destination in Croatia and 2 ) a stop on almost all Mediterranean cruises so it tends to get really busy ) . Take a walk around on top of the old city walls . Take a GoT tour ( Although I do n't know if they 're worth the money . You should employ some Google Fu to find some reviews . ) Take the cable car ( or drive ) up the hill overlooking the town for a fantastic view . Explore museums , galleries , restaurants . Make sure you 've exchanged enough Kunas for souvenirs . That pretty much covers Dubrovnik . Things to do in Split : The ancient Roman palace is a great place to get lost exploring , even if you 're local . People still live in it so it does n't have that 'museum-y ' feel to it . You can basically be looking at a 1700 year old ruin , turn around a corner and find yourself in someones back yard . So that 's neat . Check out museums and galleries if that 's what you 're into . Check out the palace basements where one part of the Split Got filming took place . I 'm not sure if there are any organized Got tours in Split , but even if there are I do n't think they 're worth the money , you can check out everything on your own . Take a stroll up the Marjan hill for a great view of Split . Check out some of the restaurants ( there are a lot of great reviews online ) . Grab a drink in the evening in one of the numerous bars in the palace and mingle with the locals and other tourists . Drive up to Klis Fort where the other part of the GoT filming took place plus enjoy a really breathtaking view of Split , the islands and surrounding area . Take a day trip to Hvar if you can squeeze it in . If you 're coming here in the summer : Check out Bačvice beach which becomes a party zone in the evening . It gets crowded during the day with beach-goers . There are other okay beaches in Split , but for really good ones you need to go outside the city . Luckily you 'll have a car . I would recommend somewhere south of Omiš ( probably an hour drive in summer traffic ) . There are good beaches in small villages in that area , just follow the southbound road . You can go kayaking in Split and whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Omiš . Probably other similar activities are available that I do n't know about , Google should know better . About the border checkpoint between Croatia and B & amp ; H on the Split - Dubrovnik route , there really is n't much to it . The Bosnians often are n't even there . Usually it 's just a quick passport check , you wo n't even need to get out of the car . During the summer when it gets busier , they sometimes just pass you through without any checks .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

I see where you 're going with this , like would I be happier with having more time to catch up ? Not really . It 's about the principle , playing a sport on equal ground . I see handicapping as a tennis player having to start 2-3 games down against a weaker opponent . No way in hell would anyone agree to that .

2ntle,travel,"As /u/tomjuliers said , it 's a matter of cost/convenience . Buses are frequent and cheap so if you do n't plan on staying anywhere in between they 'll do just fine for the Zagreb - & gt ; Split - & gt ; Dubrovnik - & gt ; Zagreb route . Forget about the trains , they are less comfortable ( inter-city type ) and slower than buses and only go as south as Split . If you do decide to rent you 'll be able to make stop along the way in other towns and national parks so that has it 's pros . If you want to take the slower , scenic route do n't take the motorway . However , keep in mind that finding a parking space in the ( relative ) center of Dubrovnik and especially Split can be either expensive or a pain in the ass . In the end make a decision based on your budget . If you can afford to rent then , by all means , go for it . If you have to a bit more wary about money ( especially since that 's quite a big trip you 're taking ) then buses will be more than adequate alternative .

2ntle,travel,"Some Croatia advice . The weather is usually nice in May but either way a week is enough to check out big ( ger ) cities and wonder a bit off the beaten path . Note that my suggestions could differ a bit from any other you may get here . That 's because May is still kinda 'off-season ' in Croatia so I took that into consideration . Seeing that you 're coming in from Italy and continuing on to Hungary , my suggested itinerary would look something like : * Istria ( Pula , Rovinj ) - cultural sightseeing . One day for both but if you 're stretched you can scrape Rovinj . It 's a nice quaint town but I found it as a unwind and relax kind of place , plus it could be dead in May so skip it if you do n't have the time . Pula is worth a visit , if only for the ancient Roman amphitheater . * Plitvice Lakes National Park - kick ass NP , basically the most universal suggestion ( besides Dubrovnik ) that anyone will give you about visiting Croatia * Zadar - a day or two . You might even come here before visiting Plitvice and using it as a base of sorts . Kornati NP is also nearby so check out if you find it worth visiting . Also Krka NP is en route when you continue down south so if that nature stuff floats your boat give it a shot . * Split - two to three days . Seeing that it 's May Split will be the liveliest city on the coast . Use the time for sightseeing and getting shitfaced . Split is also a bus and ferry hub for that part of the country so it 's convenient for island hopping and taking day trips to nearby places ( e.g . Trogir for culture/sightseeing or Omiš for whitewater rafting/rock climbing/paragliding ) . Island ( and town ) of Hvar is also advised . It 's famous for it 's nightlife but it could be dead in May . However it warrants at least a day visit . * Dubrovnik - two days . The most popular town on the coast . King 's Landing from GoT , yadda yadda , anyways you 'll want to visit . If you can squeeze it in ( ha ) go for a day trip to Mostar ( Bosnia ) . * Zagreb - two days . It 's worth a visit and on your way to Budapest so win-win . If you have any other questions about this part of the trip let me know .

The rough itinerary I would advise is Budapest - Belgrade - Sarajevo - Mostar - Split . Budapest -Belgrade is usually connected pretty well by train but I do n't know how or if the floods affected the route , you should check that out .

There are other National Parks in the general vicinity ( that 's where Zadar as a base really kicks in ) . Google around for NPs : Krka , Paklenica and Kornati . Krka is the most similar to Plitvice , while Kornati is an archipelago of small islands . For scenery and old towns stick to the coast . Since you 're on a itinerary the bigger ones like Zadar , Šibenik , Split and Dubrovnik should do you just fine . Maybe throw Trogir into the mix if you find the time .

This is one of those things that 's not easily translatable and which you mostly pick up through immersion . Croatian uses `` na '' ( which would translate to `` on ( top ) '' in English ) when talking about sea , rivers , lakes , etc in similar instances . So , you would say `` Putujem na more '' ( I 'm travelling to the sea ) . `` Putujem na moru '' is still awkward as `` putujem '' would n't be used in this case but `` plovim '' ( sailing ) would . So `` Plovim na moru '' would be I 'm sailing on the sea . Commonly used is also `` Plovim po moru '' which would be more like `` I 'm sailing across the sea '' but not literally across . I 'd say that `` Plovim na moru '' gives emphasis to the sea while `` plovim po moru '' gives emphasis to the sailing . Hope this helps ! Feel free to ask anything else ! P.S . there are instances where you would use `` u more '' , but just not with `` travel '' . The most common one is `` Idem u more !

The tradition was broken by a unlikely hero - the 18 year old midfielder Mario Pašalić scored twice to bring Hajduk just 1 point behind Dinamo and keep the battle for the top going . The Croatian Derby welcomed two very different teams . Dinamo , reigning and 8 times consecutive champion with a healthy budget and new foreign players brought to qualify for yet another CL . They were knocked out in the playoff by Austria Vienna which cost the coach Krunoslav Jurčić his job . The new/old coach became Branko Ivanković , hoping his third run with Dinamo would be the charm . Hajduk , on the other hand , is on the verge of bankruptcy . The city of Split , their main shareholder , ca n't financially support the club anymore and are actively looking for buyers to take over . Accordingly , Hajduk 's squad is filled with youngsters , most of them with hardly any first league experience . The coach is Igor Tudor , former Juventus and Croatia NT CB , whose only prior experience was coaching Hajduk 's U19 team , where he got to know most of the players he 's managing now . The match was a classic Hajduk - Dinamo clash , with aggression , pace and hard challenges . The more experienced and individually better Dinamo side dominated the first half , bringing the ball in the final third with ease but lacked any creativity in front of the goal . Hajduk 's defense was under constant pressure , trying to close down Dinamo 's pacey wingers El Soudani and Fernandes . The half time score was 0-0 , but Hajduk 's game did n't give their fans much hope for the second half . However , the Split side came out of the locker rooms more energetic and filled with vigor . Although inferior to Dinamo , they seemed to want the win more than their counterparts from Zagreb . Their attitude was awarded in the 49th minute when the 18 year old youngster Mario Pašalić craftily converted a corner swung in by debutant Haris Bukva . The goal did n't seem to wake up Dinamo and their pale approach was punished after another corner in 69th minute . Same assistant , same scorer . The remainder of the match offered nothing of note . Dinamo still looked like they do n't really want to be there while Hajduk neatly defended and waited out the clock . The win brought Hajduk to 1 point behind Dinamo and keeps the dreams of bringing home the title alive in Split , although the young and inexperienced side will face many challenges throughout the season .

2ntle,ireland,"Hey guys , I wo n't bother you with all kind of questions regarding immigration as I realize there are plenty of places online that can answer those ; however I need a couple of more specific and subjective questions answered . 1 . I know that I would work a minimum wage job upon arrival , while I get settled and find a job in my field of study . What I 'm wondering **is minimum wage livable on ? ** And I mean livable , not survivable . So , to take the most expensive example , if were to live in a small apartment in Dublin by myself , would min . wage cover rent , food , utilities and transportation while leaving me with a *reasonable* discretionary fund for gym , clothes , entertainment , etc. ? 2 . This one is a bit more subjective . I have a masters degree in finance with no related work experience . **How likely am I to find a job in that field ? ** And it does n't even have to be strictly in finance , any business/econ type jobs work as well . How likely is for an immigrant to land a job in his field of study if it 's not one of those 'in demand ' ones like IT or certain trades ? How many of such cases do you know of ?

Also there 's more to see/do in Dubrovnik like museums , galleries , etc.. OTOH , Korčula is more low key . While there are some historic sites and museums to see in the town of Korčula , the island as a whole is more suited to just relax and unwind . If you 're looking for something busier , Hvar might be more up your alley . It offers some history/architecture ( both towns of Hvar and Stari Grad ) , nature ( lavender fields and beaches ) and a busy nightlife ( the town of Hvar is akin to a mini Saint Tropez ) .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

If you 're not overly into it , but still think that the island as a whole could be a good place to visit , you can set up a base in a different town and to a day trip to the town of Hvar . However , if you 're looking for something more active than lounging on the beach all day then 2 days might be enough in/on Hvar and the rest better spent in Split with day trips to places like Plitvice National Park etc .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Although on and off-season Hvar are very different in regards of things available to do , there is still stuff to see . Stari Grad and Hvar for a bit of old architecture ( maybe a gallery and a museum thrown in for good measure ) and the lavender fields inland .

It 's a part of the city and although close to downtown , I would suggest taking a bus or a taxi to get there . Once you 're there just get down to the sea and look for a good place .

Another difference is that with soft tips you do n't have to worry about the angle of the dart in the board ( wondering will the one under the T20 cover the bed with the flight ) as soft tips stick perpendicular to the board . As far as the gameplay goes , some dislike the 'plastic ' sound instead of the cork 'thud ' , melodies and flashy lights .

2ntle,soccer,"Some of you US folk can correct me if i 'm wrong , but I always thought that the popularity of the high school/college sports in the US was due to the franchises ( NFL , MLS , NBA , etc. ) . People that do n't have any major sports team near by will support their local school teams 'cause they 're accessible and can more easily identify with them on a local/state/regional basis . When you add the factor that school teams are basically the only options for kids to train a given sport ( as far as I understand , there are no off-school football , soccer , etc . teams where a kid could just show up and sign up ) , these teams are practically mini academies for those kids where they pick up necessary skills to develop their talent . In the end , I do n't think that MLS will ever get the status among the fans in as the other leagues have around the world . People there do n't have a long tradition playing/watching soccer and more importantly , they have choices . Like a lot of them . So I think it will always be a 'niche ' sport , which does n't have to be that bad , 'cause a niche in such a big country can still be pretty huge . US soccer is rapidly moving forward , but it will be more noticeable via their NT and players in Europe than by MLS .

2ntle,CrusaderKings,"Thanks for the reply ! I 'll try to get into a bit more detail , 'cause I do n't think your ( albeit very helpful ) advice covered what I was aiming at . So here goes an example ( hypothetical , derived from many of the same outcomes ) : So , I have myself a nice little kingdom . All of my vassals ( of my and other cultures ) have positive loyalty ( as in rising , if it 's not at 100 it will be in a few months ) . Usually all from traits , friendship , prestige , the usual . When their heirs inherit them they are also very loyal . It says I have a ' ( very ) honorable reputation ' . Then it starts to get boring and I decide to expand a bit . And the Pope just called to arms . Excellent ! So I swoop in , let 's say , Burgos , liberate it and sue for peace demanding to be installed as a count 'cause that 's basically the only way to drive the heathens out . They accept and I keep it as a part of my demesne or give it to some of my kin ( the end result tends to be the same ) . I go for the next Muslim county , rinse and repeat . Then I see that my reputation is all of the sudden 'tarnished ' , but I do n't think of it that much because my vassals are still loyal . Then , let 's say , a new vassal ruler really does n't like me for my traits and he 's my rival . His loyalty has a negative trend . I 'm like 'Meh , if he revolts I 'll just send the army in , take the title back and give it to some one else ' . It happens exactly like that . Now I have a 'bad ' reputation . I conquer some more heathens . My reputation is now 'very bad ' . When I hover over the loyalty percentage over any vassal I see that the negative impact of my reputation is growing . Many more vassals are starting to revolt , and to emphasize since that 's the point of my question , practically only because of my bad reputation , and I have no idea how it got that bad ( I mean I know it 's from taking all those titles , but I have n't usurped them , I gained them through war/vassalization ) . So for example , a vassal is my son ( positive loyalty from family ties and succession order ) , is my friend ( another plus something % ) , likes my traits , scrutage , etc. , but ALL of that is n't enough to balance out the negative impact of my reputation ( it got to -10 % loyalty at one point ) . Same goes for my courtiers , my stewards have been know to get so disloyal that they robbed me blind and my martials fled from battle . That 's pretty much it . I do n't know am I going the wrong way obtaining these lands ( I thought that usurping them would be the shady thing to do , and I really do n't do I 'cause there has n't been a need for it yet ) , or is there something other messing with my reputation . I ca n't see what could it be , seeing how it does n't drop when I just stay put and do n't conquer heathens or when I let vassals go when they rebel . Appreciate the help ! P.S .

A strip of bars on Bačvice beach turns into a partying zone popular with tourists 'cause it 's convenient to get to and there 's no Croatian music that other clubs like to play and leave tourists confused : D It be easier to tell you about the prices if you told us where are you from : ) But they are not too high , even during the peak of the tourist season . A bottle of coke ( in a bar ) is ~2€ , cocktail 4-5€ , one person probably could n't eat everything they get in a restaurant for 25€ ( unless it 's some ultra fancy place of course ) , and that 's tops , it will be more around 15-20€ , depending on how hungry you are and what kind of food you ordered .

2ntle,funny,"Having played both rugby and football I 've noticed that it 's not quite simple as that . Rugby injuries are more common ( bruises ) and severe ones are more brutal and graphic ( broken collarbones , noses , etc . ) , but football ones are not as light as one would think . Parts of the body mostly targeted in football are basically the most vulnerable ones : lower legs , ankles and feet . And while they 're not so graphic , they are serious and very painful - ruptured muscles , sprains and torn ligaments . Plus , you have to take into consideration that rugby players are much more physically fit to compensate for the 'contact-ness ' of the sport , but you ca n't buff out your feet and ankles . But I agree , there 's a lot a diving in football . Precisely because injuries are likely to happen and are common , refs need to take every rougher contact into consideration .

2ntle,travel,"Definitely opt for the bus in Croatia . The train goes as far as Split to the south , so you 'll have to catch a bus for Dubrovnik anyway .

2ntle,croatia,"Well , you did n't give us much information , did you now ? : P Like where 're you coming from , whether you have ( or are planning on getting ) Eurorail pass or something similar . Although I do n't have specific info you 're looking for , like the Plitvice camp one , I can give you some general transportation info : * If you do n't have/qualify for some kind of discount , avoid using the train . It 's slow , uncomfortable ( except for the overnight one ) and overall not very cost-effective . Seeing how you ca n't get to Dubrovnik with it ( the southernmost stop is Split ) , the bus is your best bet . It 'll cost you roughly the same as the train , it will be more comfortable and faster and you 'll have a great view from Split to Dubrovnik ( make sure you sit on the right side going to Dubrovnik or left coming back ) * As far as accommodation goes , the cheapest way is sleeping in hostels . For the best deal look into reserving them early . Google it up for best deals you can find . If you 're going to stick to your itinerary , you should reserve 3 nights in Split ( as it 's a hub for Dubrovnik and Hvar ) and 2 nights in Šibenik ( it 's closer to Plitvice lakes ) * Since you have n't told us where you 're arriving from , I 'll take a shot in the dark assuming you 'll be coming in from the north ( Zagreb ) , so correct me if I 'm wrong and I 'll update you : Bus from Zagreb to Šibenik is around 150 HRK ( ~20€ ) ; from Šibenik to Split 60 HRK ( ~8€ ) ; from Split to Dubrovnik 100 HRK ( ~13€ ) . Ferry ( or catamaran , the price is roughly the same but the latter is much faster ) from Split to Hvar is around 6€ . I hope you 'll have a great time here .

Seeing how ( extended ) family bonds are strong here , average wedding has about 150 people so you do n't have to worry about the money other than down-payments .

2ntle,soccer,"well , that happens all the time . top of my head ( i 'm Croatian after all ) is Modrić . He wanted to leave Tottenham last summer for Chelsea , club 's president did n't let him go . He was a bit mopey for the first month after that but eventually accepted the situation and got over it . It looks like we could see the same scenario this transfer window again , but as Tottenham wo n't play in the UCL next season and could use the money , they 'll probably let him go . In this light , the most important part of the contract is the duration IMO . sometimes players intentionally sign long term contracts to indicate their devotion to the club and to end all speculations about their transfer",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,soccer,"sorry , no links , but as someone who 's been involved in football for all of my life , here goes : there 's no termination fee in a standard contract . so , in your exapmle , the club could keep him til the end of the contract . but that 's , as I said , in a standard contract . the better/more famous player is , he and his agent can negotiate better terms . some players have 'transfer clauses ' , for example , if the clause is 5 mil € then the club has to let the player negotiate a transfer with any club that offers a minimum 5 mil € ( Hulk had such clause at Porto for 100 mil € , but that was just a 'hands off ' signal for other clubs , they let him go to Chelsea for far less then that ) . some players have relegation clauses , saying that they 're free to leave the club if they 're relegated to a lower division ( this one is much more widespread ) . basically , it 's up to the player and his agent to negotiate as good of a deal as they can . in your expamle , the club can hold the player to the end of the contract , but clubs rarely keep disgruntled players on the squad and pay their salary just to have them mope around , so they usually agree to put them on a transfer list . however , if the club is n't respecting the terms of the contract ( usually regarding salary ) then the player can sue the club to the FA or FIFA and will usually get such contract terminated ( meaning he becomes a free player ) and the club still has to pay him what they owe . you wo n't find many links about this stuff as it 's a matter of a private contract and they do n't really let them go public . hope this helps a bit",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,soccer,"I guess you 're from US so I 'll let your compatriots give you more detailed advice . As far as coaching goes , here in Europe national football associations have coaching academies ( and you need to have a degree to coach a higher division club ) so if the USSF has it 's own academy ( or wherever you 're from ) you should really look into it . As far as experience goes , your best bet is to go to your local clubs and asking youth coaches to let you assist ( you 'll be doing this for free and just to gain some experience , noone is going to pay you at this point ) . From there on it 's only up to how much do you want it . Your lack of a professional playing career is certainly a drawback , but you can definitely overcome it with hard work . But you have to understand that , given your lack of experience and formal soccer education , it will be years before you 're given a youth team to manage ( unless you 're exceptionally talented and catch a huge lucky break ) or even put on a payroll ( so having a side job is a must ) .

2ntle,Darts,"I 'll try to give you some answers , other redditors will surely chip in to fill the gaps I leave : 1 . My favorite practicing game is Split score . It 's somewhat easier to play on soft tip boards since they automatically count score , but it 's not any more difficult to count as any other game on a steel tip board . Here 's how it goes : Each player starts with 40 points . Each round you shoot a different number , in order : 13 , 14 , 15 , any double , 15 , 16 , 17 , any triple , 18 , 19 , 20 , bull ( 25 and 50 both count ) . Only darts in the designated number count , e.g . in second round if you hit two darts in 14 and one in 11 you only get 28 points . The twist is if you miss all three darts your overall score is halved ( you round up for odd numbers ) . The game is fun and can be pretty even matched even if the players are n't on a similar playing level since halving your score makes it easier for a weaker player to catch up to you . Also , you practice cricket numbers ( which is good since you 're playing in a cricket league ) plus doubles and triples . Other popular games are Around the world , Shanghai , etc . which other redditors can give you more info on . 2 . General consensus is that you should stick with whatever works for you . That , however , does n't mean there are n't any steps to improve your game . Check out /r/flightschool ( althought it 's a bit dead ) or google Flight School and join up . Its creator George Silberzahn provides some great tips and practicing routines . Other , more general advice is the usual - keep your body steady and move only your arm , follow through , focus on your target , etc . 3 . Yeah , substantial pointing in cricket is considered poor sportsmanship . Now , what 's the threshold ? Well , that 's kinda subjective and different people may give you different opinions on it . My rule of thumb is that if my opponent ca n't catch up to me with 3 darts , any additional scoring is unnecessary . In friendly bar games where nothing is on the line , I usually score just enough to have more points than my opponent ; sometimes not even that .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,travel,"Maybe I 'm a bit biased ( being a native and all ) but Croatia could hit all of the points on your backpacking checklist . It 's definitely cheaper than all the other countries you 're considering . There a direct cheap flights from London to several touristy locations here . There are plenty of hostels and backpackers , do a bit of google-fu about 'Croatia backpacking ' to find other people 's experiences and advice . We have a lot of Aussie backpackers here so you 'll have no problem meeting new people ( Aussies being outgoing and English speaking as they are ) , esp . in hostels . We have great seafood here but a variety of other kind as well . Not what you would exactly call 'ethnic ' , but seeing how Croatia was under the influence ( lol ) of various nations through the ages , that has reflected in the cuisine as well . So you 'll find a mix of Italian , Slavic , and Turkish , with more German and Hungarian if you wander to the northern parts of the country . The same applies to the other aspects of the culture and architecture . Croatia had a turbulent history since well before it even became a country so there are plenty of sights to see , museums to visit etc . Nightlife is great in the more touristy cities while outdoorsy and off-the-beaten-path stuff is found a bit off the major tourist hot spots ( as one would expect ) . As far as safety goes , Croatia is basically as safe as it gets in Europe . With minuscule violent crime rates the only thing one should keep an eye out for ( esp . during the tourist season ) is an occasional pickpocket . For example , two girls going back to a hostel in the wee hours really do n't have anything to worry about . Of course , you should always practice standard safety precautions as you would anywhere else .

Basically , the MO is that a couple of girls sit at your table , order overpriced champagne for themselves without checking with you and that goes to your tab . When you 're ready to leave and see that your tab is inflated you can : a ) suck it up and pay up or b ) get beaten up and pay anyway . And do n't worry , if you do n't have enough money on you they 'll drag you to an ATM .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

As far as island hopping goes , there are plenty of ferries , catamarans and other kinds of boats so you 'll have no problem getting around . Additional advice : If you do get a motorcycle/scooter , make sure you do n't take the highway down south .

2ntle,travel,"I 'm glad you got such a great feedback and I do n't know if your mind is already set but I would like to add some things myself : * April ( even around Easter ) is off-season in Croatia . While it has it 's benefits ( no crowds ) it definitely has it 's disadvantages . There will be less to do . Compared to the season a LOT less . That 's why I would n't opt for two days on Hvar . Yes , it 's beautiful , but one full day should be enough . Remember , it 's off-season so you can forget about the famous Hvar nightlife ( which really is bitchin ' in the summer ) . * I would chop one day from Dubrovnik in favor of Split so it 's two days each . Three days in Dubrovnik may be a bit much . I 've managed to catch all the sites and museums in a day during the high season so two days should be fine while taking it easy and maybe taking that day trip to Montenegro . Split , being the bigger city and all , can give you more options . Not just considering nightlife . You can always hop to Trogir , a beautiful quaint town near Split , or visit ancient ruins of Salona or go whitewater rafting or rock climbing in Omiš . * Be careful around Easter . As my fellow redditors at /r/croatia already told you , the ferries are sparser but still run . Some museums might be closed . Supermarkets and such wo n't be open for sure so stock up the day before .

2ntle,Darts,"As I see it , the main allure of tungsten darts is that they 're heavier so you can have a smaller ( thinner ) dart which helps with grouping while keeping the weight the same . They 're also much tougher ( my last set came with a lifetime guarantee ) . Sometimes it 's tough to get used to to thinner darts , as thicker brass and bronze ones provide a better grip ( at least for me ) . So , if you 're happy with your bronze set and do n't feel any significant advantage in tungsten ( give 'em a try ) then stick with bronze at least for now . But as you get better and your grouping tighter , you 'll notice that your bulky darts sometimes get in the way of putting the third one in the bed .

2ntle,explainlikeimfive,"It 's going to be difficult to ELI5 such a complex question , especially without starting flame wars in comments like they always happen when such subject is brought up , but I 'll give it a shot . I 'm going to skip a lot of history here , because I think that 'ancient hatred ' argument is silly and not valid . Croats and Serbs were neighbors for a long time , and despite being in different empires/kingdoms their culture and language was very similar . The main thing that divided them was religion . Due to historical circumstances Croats are Roman Catholic and Serbs are Orthodox . When national movements started sweeping Europe in 19th century , religion was a major part of national identity . That , among other things , was basis in differentiating yourself from other nations . Seeing how Croats and Serbs were similar , religion played a major part in building their respective national identities . By the end of WWI , it was becoming obvious that Austro-Hungarian Empire was going to collapse . Croats , being under foreign rule since 1102 wanted to score a better deal . Realizing that they 're too small to be on their own ( since the bigger surrounding nations could chop them up ) decided to enter a union with Serbs and Slovenes , thinking that they 'll finally be equals between their similar ( 'brotherly ' ) Slavic neighbors . However , that Union soon turned into a monarchy with a Serbian king . Power struggles began and Croats found themselves once again oppressed by a bigger nation . This is the real beginning of the 'conflict ' between Croats and Serbs that will define their history later on . WWII came , Nazis rolled in , broke up the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and installed 'independent ' ( puppet ) states Croatia and Serbia . In Croatia , the power went to the Ustaše , a radical fascist party similar to Nazis . They set up labor and concentration camps and prosecuted and killed thousands of Serbs , Jews , Gypsies and uncooperative Croats . The hatred between the nations grew . In the meantime , opposing forces were Chetiniks , ruthless Serbian militia loyal to the King trying to create Greater Serbia ( often slaughtering civilians which , of course , created even a bigger wedge between the nations ) and coumminst Partisans , composed of all nationalities from the area . The anti-fascist Partisans eventually won and a communist federation Yugoslavia was formed . Charismatic leader Tito did his best to keep nationalistic tensions in check . And they were for 40 or so years . Now , to explain why Croatia decided to break from Yugoslavia in early 90s would take too long , but lets just say it was a mix of economical , political and nationalistic reasons . Serbia tried to forcefully keep them from leaving because , to put it simply , they were the dominating force in Yugoslavia at the time and Croatia was one of the most economically advanced states . When Croatia declared independence , a lot of Serbs living in Croatia were afraid that the genocide from WWII was going to repeat and rebelled . So Croatia found itself fighting Serbian insurgents and the official Yugoslav Army . Cue some more nationalistic tensions . There were war crimes on all sides which , again , just fueled the hatred further . Nowadays , you 'll find people in both countries with various opinions . Some keep deep hatred . Some just resentment . Others do n't really care .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

It will take time . Look how long it took for the US and WE and there 's still room for improvement there . Also , it does n't help that EE is extremely racially homogeneous and thus has exposure to other races mostly via tourism . It 's easier to overcome racism if you have people of other races living in your community , sharing the same problems , living similar lives right in front of you . Majority of people in EE live in non-touristy areas and probably wo n't see someone of a different race in person their whole lives . That 's not helpful .

Now , as for how one got citizenship of another FR after moving there , I 'm really not sure , but my best bet is by having permanent residence there . Although , most people would n't bother , since your FR citizenship was n't much of an issue so the majority would stick with their original one issued to them by place of birth . That , of course , does n't mean that all of the ethnicities were born in ( and thus had the citizenship of ) their ethnically respective FRs ( Serbs in FR Serbia , Croats in FR Croatia , etc. ) . As you can see [ here ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/hjXdk8o.jpg ) , there were areas were a lot of people lived in a non-'native ' FR ( notably middle of Southern Croatia and Bosnia ) which were consequently the areas mostly affected by war ( with Eastern Croatia being an exception since that was a main corridor of Serbian invasion , but that 's besides the point ) . Long story short : FR citizenship was issued by the place of birth regardless of ethnicity ; mobility between FRs was perfectly normal ( and sometimes encouraged ) ; people would usually stick with their FR citizenship after moving since it made no difference .

So , for instance , people that emigrated during the Yugoslavia were either yugo-nostalgic or , if they were more on the nationalistic side , were still ranting on about Yugoslavian secret service , Croatian struggle and so on . The people that emigrated because of the war in the 90s were almost all pretty far right nationalists , identifying with the Ustasha regime , blindly hating Serbs , etc . It 's like they did n't have any closure and the war is still going on in their minds ( there a lot of people like that here , mind you ) . On the other hand they said that the Australian Croats they met were all friendly ( at least towards them ) .

I may be a bit biased but I 'll just say not to write Split off . After all , you said you 've done your research so you did n't put it in your itinerary for no reason . As far as the ferries go , you have nothing to be concerned about . True , there are fewer departures then than during the season , but that just means there are 4-5 a day instead of 10+ , so you 'll have no problem getting to the islands and coming back on time . And about your day trip , Krka and Hvar are both worth visiting , so try to fit them in somehow in your itinerary . Makarska is more of a touristy summer vacation spot , with nothing notable to see or do aside from going to the beach and partying ( but both are only doable during the season ) . I especially like your 'stopping in random villages ' part on the way from Dubrovnik from Split .

It has foam pads which minimize back sweating and make it more comfortable to wear . It has one huge compartment where I can put all my gear ( no space for full face helmet though ) . Great for groceries because you can just throw everything inside as fast as the cashier scans stuff . Two side pockets - fits 0,5 l water bottle and candy bar in each Bunch of loops , rings and what not , which I do n't use , but have come in handy a few times . It 's made of a very heavy duty fabric , like a motorcycle jacket . It has lifetime warranty , and in 2,5 years of very frequent use ( and abuse ) , has stayed in the same shape as when I bought it .

305-1468,mechanicalpencils,"I have one in 0,7 . With it 's minimal styling it 's a very good looking pencil . One piece metal body , besides looking cool makes this pencil very robust . In fact it 's proven to be indestructible if you retract the lead sleeve . Even the cap is carved from one piece of steel ( as opposed to sheet metal forming ) , and engraved . Color is beautiful ( mine is blue ) and very durable . Makes a nice loud click . Grip on this paint is actually quite good despite not having knurled surface or whatever . I also removed the otherwise nice looking and sturdy clip , it looks better like that in my opinion . Hexagonal shape means it wo n't roll around . Disadvantages are top heaviness , and the impossibility of disassembly . Also the fact that the cone is a bit longer then on other pencils , so I sometimes find myself holding the pencil by the cone instead of the body , which is difficult and makes the pencil slip , but I tend to hold pens close to the tip so YMMW . For work or lot of writing I prefer a drafting pencil , but this one is the best for lying around on the desk when you need to write a note or whatever , and you 're not afraid if you accidentally sweep it across the room . EDIT : ( after reading comments ) The front does not move back and forth on mine . I probably have an older model since the sleeve is retractable . It does rattle a bit .

If you are measuring plastic parts , you need accuracy of ±0,01 to ±0,05 mm , and you can buy a caliper like [ this ] ( http : //www.insize.com/products/tools/pdf/caliper/1205.pdf ) . It 's rated ±0,03 mm ( about 1/3 width of a leaf of paper ) , but mine is actually accurate within ±0.01 mm . I use that at work and it performs great . It cost about 15 € . Used on plastic it shows the exact same value as a digital 10x more expensive Mitutoyo . It 's made of milled , engraved , thick stainless steel . It will also last longer than the Mitutoyo since it has no display or batteries . OTOH , if you have to measure high precision metal parts made with tight tolerances , you need a more precise caliper *and a micrometer* ( because calipers are not really that precise , after all , you must press on stuff using your shaky , variable hand ) , and many have recommended a lot of good calipers for that . TL ; DR : you can get a BIFL caliper for 15 € , the one for 150 € will of course be BIFL , but will also have ( slightly ) better precision .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
305-1468,BuyItForLife,"Micrometer is an order of magnitude more precise , but slow to work with . And they are usually made with much smaller range .

3w4v,Freethought,"Disease deaths matter ? Between 50 and 60 million people die every year , according to the WHO . Only around 9 % of those deaths are related to injuries of any kind , most commonly in automotive accidents . The rest are disease related . In 2012 , for example , 68 % of worldwide deaths were caused by non-communicable disease , and 23 % by communicable disease . Both categories include large proportions of preventable cases . The most common communicable disease deaths were respiratory , HIV-related , and diarrheal , which could be reduced by vaccinations , contraceptive availability and education , and water treatment . Many noncommunicable diseases were related to tobacco and alcohol abuse , as well as poor diet . All of these could be addressed by public education and commodity taxation programs . By focusing on violent deaths , you draw attention away from effective , moderate cost ways of saving far more net lives . **EDIT : ** Evidently I should spell this out : by parroting exactly the same faulty line of logic , I thought it would become more obvious _why_ it 's a faulty line of reasoning ( `` By focusing your attention on stray animals you 're drawing attention away from homeless people ! `` , `` Why do you insist on advocating for the arts when people are starving ?

This more than anything will keep you motivated when you are using online resources - by themselves , online tools are n't enough for a lot of people . If you have a little extra money , paying a tutor for weekly lessons might help with motivation too ( partially because the financial commitment tends to be a good motivator ) , but it is n't strictly necessary .

3w4v,changemyview,"You suggest that taxpayers should not pay to alleviate the inconvenience to a party whose case , while failing the test necessary for a conviction , leaves no significant room for doubt of their guilt . It seems morally repugnant to help such a person - why should the taxpayer pay a probable criminal for their inconvenience ? However , there are a some obvious corollary cases that you do n't mention . What about a case where reasonable suspicion is established at arrest , but in trial innocence is determined beyond a reasonable doubt ? If you assert that an individual is undeserving of compensation because , although there was n't enough evidence for a conviction , it can be rationally believed that guilt is very likely , then what of the certainly innocent ? What about the probably innocent ? Why is it also acceptable to inconvenience them ? If you frame the problem not by individual cases , but statistically over many cases , could facts from this perspective sway your opinion one way or the other ? If the statistics showed that 9000 out of 10000 people acquitted were determined to be more likely innocent than not , would that be enough that you 'd be comfortable awarding them all compensation ? 9500 ? 7000 ? 2000 ? Another angle . You are given four proposals : that the state provide 1 ) no compensation in the case of reasonable suspicion at time of arrest ; 2 ) compensation equivalent the pay given jurors ; 3 ) a flat compensation per day tied to the minimum living wage that year , regardless of income ; and 4 ) a tax rebate as compensation . Would you consider only the first of these fair ? Would you suggest a fifth alternative ? Yet another consideration : suppose a person is either actually innocent or actually guilty of a concrete crime . You only know how likely a person is to fall into one of these categories . Do you feel comfortable inconveniencing a person , perhaps significantly , when your certainty is n't very high because it 's cheaper to do so ? What about discrepancies in who bears the burden of accusation ? It 's easy to demonstrate that some races bear much more of the burden than others , for example , as do certain socio-economic classes . Given that the burden is significantly unevenly borne by some , is fulfilling a social contract for order really a good enough justification ? Some of these angles were discussed in other parts of the thread , but I thought it was worth putting them together .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

The case for reservations declaring sovereignty also has some legal support , although this case has n't been judicially tested .

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"I ’ d been talking with people I didn ’ t know In the park the other day , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove . The sky was solid gray , And we were talking about all the ways The world could be better . One woman said , “ It gets complicated , “ Taking value at its face . “ You ’ d think value was something obvious , ” Her hands were all over the place . She gestured left , then right , then left , And with frustration in her face , She sighed , “ The obvious “ Is the source of all confusion. ” Later that day , I was walking around By the pen where they keep the Bison And struck up with a rough looking man Built like Mike Tyson With a scar right down his neck , But a disarming grin . “ If you take all the little things that pile up around , “ Each little things weighs nothing at all , ” Like grains of sand ? “ Yeah , but take “ Every grain of sand on the beach in your hand , “ And you ’ ve got a problem. ” We shot shit for a good long while , Until that gray turned into graphite , And we said goodbye and walked away Into the almost night . I shivered . Left my coat somewhere , But damn , I couldn ’ t remember . Then I ran into this dude who smelled Like a broken sewer main . He offered his coat and asked for a buck , I said no , but all the same We got to talking , and for a while It felt like eternity went by . But before I escaped something happened , And his visage grew profound , Like his dirty hair was glowing From the inner peace he ’ d found , and then I remembered something dumb I had done Just a couple hours back , And in the darkening night , Not feeling quite right , I tried to stumble back To the place that I ’ d come from , But I couldn ’ t remember . I swear then I saw a pippala tree With a man lying down beneath , Who exuded grace and rainbows In his final dying breath , As he said , “ Every gear in this grand design “ Will fail and be replaced . “ Be the masters of your own machines , “ And find your special place. ” That ’ s the last thing I remember Before waking in my bed . Still don ’ t know how I got back here Or what else that prophet said . I know that trip was worth it , But the message isn ’ t clear . Good thing at least some images Didn ’ t disappear . I ’ ll talk with people I don ’ t know In the park today , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove , The sky a solid gray , And we will talk about all the ways The world could be better .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"The poem like all other art 's a thing unclassifiable Except , of course , to classifiers . That 's just undeniable . And I 'm a classifier , and a critic , and scientist - That 's why I ’ ve put in verse a mostly rhyming taxonomic list Of all the different ways in which a poem can be terrible , And as I share these ways with you I hope it will be bearable Because , in making such a list , I may have inadvertently Created an example of a terrible soliloquy . Now , to the strictest pedant , all the ways there are are very few , Since they would say that anything is bad if you believe that ’ s true . But if we all can just agree that mode of thought ’ s erroneous We can be less postmodern and considerably less onerous . The first flaw that I can ’ t abide is formal inconsistency , Which demonstrates no forethought , or no technical ability . Sure , poems can be good and have a Leaves-of-Grass-like laxity But usually it ’ s laziness , and not poetic strategy . Now , meter - that ’ s another thing about which I ’ m a strident prude . To mix an iamb with a trochee strikes me as extremely rude ! When poets flub the rhythm like a junior high school marching band I think they should be shot , or sent a sternly worded reprimand . And why is so much poetry so bland and unoriginal ? These heartfelt bleeding notes are often trite , clichéd and pitiful . Why must there be so many little replicas of Kanye West ? Such badly phrased confessionals would better be left unconfessed . But worst of all is poetry that rests itself on cleverness Without anything meaningful to say .

3w4v,linguistics,"Lojban is not what you imagine . The language is alien in the sense that it 's grammar is n't based on that of existing languages , but the grammar is both regular ( no exceptions ) and simple ( not many rules ) . The vocabulary is drawn from `` Mandarin , English , Russian , Hindi , Spanish , and Arabic , weighted according to the numbers of speakers , and using a phoneme-matching algorithm to assign words with the highest figures of merit relative to the six languages. '' [ [ source ] ] ( https : //mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi ) . This has the effect of making speakers of those languages , Mandarin and English especially , recognize many of the words once they get a hang of the phonetic rules . It 's also not too hard to pronounce by design . Lojban has 6 vowels and 17 consonants , picked to be distinct and allowing for some phonemic variation so people coming from different primary languages wo n't have a hard time pronouncing the words . Lojban has many interesting features that are n't very robotic . Emotion particles come to mind - simple words you can add to a sentence to let people know how you feel or how you feel about something . Another is evidential indicators , which let you concisely explain how you know something ; this lets you easily distinguish between knowing something from personal experience , vaguely remembering something , knowing something second-hand , or knowing something without evidence but with conviction .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alternative , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ? Human nature is that we tend to arrive at positions and then justify them after the fact , so it 's at least worth exploring if discomfort with the topic , rather than a utilitarian assessment , led to your original criticism . Your reasoning process happens on a weird evolved difference engine with all kinds of quirks . Your intuition is n't a utility maximizer .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,haskell,"I 'm a little surprised no one has mentioned Go . At OSCON this year I heard about quite a few companies that were happy with Go for large projects . Praise included the relatively small language size , ease in training new hires , good community , and excellent selection of libraries . I think it would meet all of your requirements . I 'll second Rust , but it 's a new and immature language - the community is great , but libraries are n't comprehensive yet , and idioms in the language are likely to change significantly over the next few years . It also does n't have as much industry use yet . Python is another solid , pragmatic choice , and it may serve you particularly well depending on your interests . Look at popular Python libraries and see if any of them catch your eye . It also has the best language learning resources of the three , so that 's a major plus . **EDIT : ** To keep things to the point , my number one recommendation for the original poster is Python based on their interests , professional utility , and availability of learning resources . But since there was such an ambivalent reaction to Go here ( with respect to voting - the comments have been more \*ahem\* _uniform_ ) I think a few things need to be said . Firstly , all of the criticisms made here are valid _on the level at which they criticize the language_ . But the comments , in my opinion , largely miss the point on other levels . Go might be good language to learn for a person who has only been seriously programming for nine months _and_ only deeply exposed to Haskell for several reasons . It 's important to understand that the Haskell community is an echo chamber for certain - correct , according to us - points of view . As an aspiring programmer , it 's worthwhile to be exposed to communities with different points of view and different priorities , and we should put at least some trust in the ability of a student to eventually , with experience , form their own informed opinions . Another pedagogical point : our concerns as more experienced programmers are not all the same as those of someone who has only really been programming for less than a year . Comments like `` There 's nothing you would learn from Go '' lack perspective ; the familiar ideas Go contains are the best ideas from several generations of languages , and for a new learner some of those ideas are still unfamiliar . And the specification of the language is short , which is another big win for a learner . Then there 's the straightforward tooling and a set of solid open source projects to look to for for architectural guidance . Remember , this is the _second_ language OP might be learning , not the last . You can move from Go to C easily , or with Go and Haskell you can pick up Python as the third language , or C # , or C++ ... as a student , half a year of Go programming might lead to a better jumping-off point career-wise and intellectually than many of you are acknowledging .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,UkrainianConflict,"Much of your summary is accurate : the only part I 'd contest is the `` two sides '' narrative . People in Ukraine have a wide range of views , but most have an ambivalent , stability above all perspective . A pro-EU , West-leaning bent prevails in the intellectual class , while rose-tinted nostalgia for the Soviet past is more common in ethnic Russian enclaves and the economically declining Eastern regions of the country - the two sides narrative has its roots in these biases . But a highly polarized , two-sided model of popular opinion , common as it may be in media representations , does n't match this reality very well .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,skeptic,"There are a few words in in this conversation that are confusing readers . To understand why I 'd reject what you say , we need to be clear about what you 're claiming and what I reject , so let 's work from those confusing words . & amp ; nbsp ; The first confusing word is _science_ , which is confusing because it 's polysemous . _Science_ in the current context may reasonably refer to : 1 . The _scientific method_ - A set of iterative , observation-based techniques for acquiring and updating beliefs ; 2 . _Scientific practice_ - The activities scientists actually engage in to arrive at beliefs , usually ( but not always ) by application of the scientific method ; 3 . _Scientific knowledge_ - The body of beliefs generally accepted by the scientific community , usually ( but not always ) arrived at by scientific practice . Scientific knowledge _is_ a set of beliefs . But , to pin the conversation down , we seem to be talking about the scientific method . & amp ; nbsp ; The second confusion occurs between a pair of similar verbs , _to believe_ and _to believe in_ . The verbs _to believe_ and _to believe in_ are used to convey different meanings . Commonly ( unfortunately , not consistently ) : - _To believe_ refers to a truth value judgement ( _I believe the mailman 's name is Frank_ ) . - _To believe in_ may refer to a higher-order belief , that is , a belief about a belief . This `` believing in '' can get complicated and often conceals some vagueness when you think about it more carefully . ( _I believe in the power of love , _ but usually not _I believe in the mailman , Frank._ ) There are people that _believe in_ the scientific method in the same nebulous sense that people _believe in_ karma or a higher purpose or the power of love . However , it is sufficient to believe that the scientific method satisfies certain information gathering properties ( properties that , not coincidentally , are falsifiable ) for a rational person to continue using and propagating the scientific method . No `` believing in '' is necessary at this level , except insofar as it is implied by believing that the scientific method has certain well specified properties . There are beliefs that are so fundamental as to be axiomatic ( `` I exist '' , `` there exists a fundamental reality '' , `` I have some information-preserving relationship with that fundamental reality '' , `` fundamental reality has non-random structure '' ) . There is no logical basis for truth-value determination of these `` reality axioms . '' There 's no way to test them , even in principle . Arguably , metaphysical naturalists _believe in_ these axioms as well as believing them . But these beliefs are lower-level than science in any of its senses . & amp ; nbsp ; The last confusion is around the phrase _a matter of faith_ . The classification _a matter of faith_ is being used to establish an equivalence between beliefs which I do n't think is justified , or perhaps is too vaguely specified . Stepping back to low-level beliefs , I 'd argue that accepting the reality axioms is n't a matter of faith - at least , not in the same sense that accepting divine revelation is a matter of faith ( I assume belief in divine revelation is a belief that mental forces , not reducible to natural forces and elementary particles , exist and do communicate with people to inform their beliefs about reality , and that this information is reliable in some sense ) . When I accept the reality axioms , there are different processes going on than what go on when I accept divine revelation . Defining _a matter of faith_ to include both not only stretches common usage , it also leaves a big bag of interesting processes that contribute to the acceptance of esoteric and religious beliefs either undescribed , or implies those processes are happening where they are n't . And that brings us back to the scientific method : the information-gathering efficacy of the scientific method is a consequence of these more fundamental reality axioms holding . So it 's not a matter of faith either , or even a consequence of faith . It follows from the derivability of the scientific method from the reality axioms that coherent rejections of the scientific method necessarily either involve rejecting some of those reality axioms , which can get weird , or adding new axioms , which is problematic for a slew of reasons . I 'm glossing over these arguments , but I think you get the picture . & amp ; nbsp ; I have n't presented a full argument , but I think this makes it clear what an argument against classifying the trustworthiness of the scientific method and the trustworthiness of divine revelation as both being matters of faith looks like . Ultimately , the conditions under which they both are matters of faith requires making `` faith '' mean something other than what `` faith '' is generally understood to mean or usefully defined as . There is something going on in accepting the axioms of reality , but it needs to be described separately . It is n't the same class of phenomenon .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,nonmonogamy,"Just warning you that I have analytical tendencies . That said , here 's how I would approach your issue if it were me : **TL ; DR** You should n't feel bad because you are asking for help with a problem . That 's normal and fine and okay ! Keeping your problem , your desired outcome , and proposed solution separate in your discussion will probably make things clearer to you . By involving your partner in the discussion , you 'll feel less guilt because you wo n't be prescribing a course of action but collaborating on the health of you and your relationship . Describe your problem and desired outcome first , and let your partner suggest a solution before you suggest yours in order to get a less pre-filtered opinion and gauge his feelings . Decide what to do after that . But definitely do n't feel guilty for asking him to participate . **Long Version** You have a problem , a causal hypothesis , and a proposed solution . You also have an implied desired outcome . The thing you seem to feel guilty about is the solution part . Some or all of this analysis may seem obvious . If so , great . & gt ; I 've been really struggling with my fear and anxiety about being left behind or abandoned [ ... ] Your problem is that you are experiencing abandonment anxiety , or , to be specific , the symptoms you are bundling under this label . This is the first thing you should discuss with your partner and his wife , if you have n't already . You also have a desired outcome , which you stated as `` build [ ing ] our foundation stronger '' , but that 's more of a solution . Your real desired outcome is to experience less anxiety . & gt ; [ ... ] which is connected to an anxiety problem and a recent dip in mental health . You attribute that anxiety to two factors . The first is a change in your underlying mental health , which implies that you have experienced/are experiencing other symptoms that suggest this is the case . Your intuition about this is probably right . I 'm assuming that you are taking steps to work on this issue on your own . The second is a change in the relationship dynamic . It 's a safe bet that your abandonment issues are linked to this . However , it may be worth exploring exactly what changes have happened - is it just that he 's dating , or have other habits changed as well ? You also believe this change is a problem _because of_ the first issue . Although this seems like a reasonable assumption , it 's not the only possibility . How true this is may influence how effective a given solution is for you . In any case , you should always be sceptical of your assumptions about hidden causes , and focus more on observed effects . When evaluating solutions , a solution that will work _without assuming a cause_ is more robust . & gt ; I wanted to ask him to for a month , at most , to not pursue any new romantic relationships [ ... ] so I can examine what is bothering me and work on healthy techniques for being both a good girlfriend and a good participant in a poly relationship . This is your proposed solution ( I 'm sure you have a lot of details here you 're leaving out ) . You probably feel guilty because your solution involves a restriction on your partner , and you might be forcing or manipulating your partner into doing something he is n't comfortable with . I think you can feel less guilty by viewing this not as a final and inflexible prescription , but as a possible solution you thought up that might help you . You do n't have to feel guilty about trying to solve your problem ! You also should keep in mind that you have to trust in your partner 's agency . As long as your request is a request and not an ultimatum , your partner deserves to be able to choose to help you in this way . However , it is problematic that you are framing the conversation as the acceptance or rejection of a fully-formed proposal . Although your solution seems reasonable , the sort of solution you might come to after a discussion with your partner , it is n't the only solution . You need feedback from your partner before you can know what parameters to flex , or even if it your proposal makes sense . Maybe allow your partner ( maybe his wife too ) to propose solutions himself before you prime him with your own . Maybe his proposal will be similar to yours . Maybe it 'll be something you had n't considered . In any case , it will help you take his feelings into account . Notice the assumptions your proposal makes , though , and weigh this idea against other options that are slightly or very different . If you think you 've already done this , do it again anyway - cognitive researchers have documented that subjects almost always attach themselves to the first solution they come up with and justify its merits after the fact , so you have to spend at least some effort in trying to correct for that tendency . What are you asking him to stop doing _exactly_ ? Date , or date without your involvement ? Is there some other behavior change on his or your part that would also help ? Why a month at most ? Is it because you 're making some assumptions about his needs and feelings ? Do you already know what steps you 'll take to work on yourself and think that 's the amount of time you need ? Have you explored options that might feel uncomfortable , like breaking up and being on your own for a while ( remember , you do n't actually have to _do_ things just because you think about them ) ? Also take time to explore different rough outcomes of that month ( or whatever time period ) - your problem improves a lot , it improves a little , it stays the same , it gets worse - and what that would mean your next steps would be . It may lead you to change your strategy . Maybe `` that thing I 'd do next '' is what you should start with in the first place .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

I see the big hype fizzling in less than a decade before its life as usual , with the exception of better funding for astronomy programs . Major religions would adopt official stances on alien intelligence , many opting for flat denial , and otherwise remain unchanged except for a few new cults . Suppose the data could be interpreted as something intriguing , however - images or sound files showing aliens and their culture . Everything is much more unstable in such a case , but in some ways it would look similar . Religious opinions could be much more divisive , since denial would be a more radical and visible stance .

Pick a few catchy things to establish location , people waiting , police officers , you guys if need be , and then get on with the show . Next time you go and film an event , try and put some more effort into the interviews . Prepare questions before hand and ask questions as they come to mind . Interview each other and interview strangers both before and after the event . You can even do audio only interviews with a digital audio recorder and use that material over the footage . On that note , the audio of the event itself is probably more interesting than the music you picked . The in-camera mic is n't that great , especially in windy conditions , but even an inexpensive audio recorder with a sock will give you usable audio . Speaking of the music , you do n't need to be such a slave to the music in your editing . The footage is what 's interesting . Maybe pick shorter clips of music , mixed in with the original audio , so that you do n't feel the film has to be the same length as the track , or ditch the music entirely . Those fancy transitions are like punctuation . If used at all , they should only delineate major sections and : not . Happen ! Between , every ; Single ? Shot ...

It has been complained about and there have been problems with this before , usually by experts , but reform has n't ever gotten public momentum . The NSA should change its policy for several reasons . One of them mentioned in the petition ( which by the way had an 800 character limit ) is that the release of these theorems and algorithms benefits academia and industry . Another argument is that broad classification is *bad* for national security . Those for which an application has not been found are especially ripe for exploration in the open sphere - and the argument that they should all be automatically labelled dangerous until proven harmless is itself dangerous . Duplicate discoveries by the agencies of other governments , also kept secret , may put our government and industry at risk for cryptographic attack . Transparency on cryptographic vulnerabilities ultimately leads to higher security . Another argument is that the NSA is losing some potential talent because there is no guarantee of recognition outside the agency . That 's not everything , and there are compelling arguments from the other side . But it is my ultimate belief that some moderate change in policy is good for national security , industry , and the scientific endeavour , and that it currently is n't on the agenda because the public does n't think about these issues very much and math does n't tend to capture the public imagination often more than anything else .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Think of this tutor in the same way you would a dance or music instructor , who can guide your child in different directions and develop ideas at her pace . Since there are n't likely to be many people experienced in this kind of role , find a math , computer science , physics , or economics graduate student at a nearby university who will be around for a few years and who seems like she/he would be a good tutor . * Do n't repeatedly tell her she 's smart or clever ! Encourage her love of math and tell her you 're proud of her when she does hard work on something , even if she does n't succeed .

Another economic crisis catapults a radicalized Svoboda and a new ultra-right party from the industrial , Russian speaking East to take over from Party of Regions dominance and create a new dichotomous party system . Svoboda pushes for a 'purely Ukrainian Ukraine ' policy that more aggressively targets the Ukrainian central dialects ( Surzhik ) for extinction and tries to place anti-Russian language laws on the books throughout the country . Russian language books are burned in some places . The attacks are clearly on not only the Russian language but also Russian ethnicity . The new right party moves for Eastern succession . Let the West rot in Europe - Crimea and the East will become their own state , possibly vying for annexation by the Russian Federation . In the East Ukrainian language textbooks are thrown out of school windows in retaliation . Meanwhile the economic crisis worsens , and as each side blames the other secession by the East and South becomes a serious political platform . At the same time pro-EU sentiments grow and lead to an election cycle dominated by right-wing Western politicians . In retaliation to the election , Crimea holds it 's own internal election and votes to secede , declaring Crimea a fully autonomous republic allied with Russia . Eastern attempts at secession are more mixed , and lead to skirmishes and conflicts . Local terrorism targets Ukranian law enforcement being ported form the West to `` keep the peace '' in the Eastern oblasts . With Crimea no longer voting , the votes swing to the West . The violence in the East mostly calms , but Ukrainian national identity is deeply wounded . Unlikely scenario , but I reached to make it happen .

He was freaking out that he was almost 50 and was the only one out of his siblings without a family . My favorite part of this story is that he said the last straw before he turned to `` dating magazines '' was when he went to a dance for singles and had to escape out of a bathroom window from a very agressive gay man . So he sent letters to all the women he was interested in and then planned his trip to meet all of them in their respective countries . The woman before he met my mom actually tried to trap him in a room when she found out there were other girls he was planning to see . I 'm glad he kept going after that because he went on to meet my mom in The Philippines . They had a connection and began dating until he brought her back to the states and got married . & gt ; & gt ; Reviewing this story now I ca n't believe I did n't think it was a mail order bride thing , for years I would deny it by saying it was a dating magazine .

Akaforty,FargoTV,"Welcome to Reddit . There are no counter arguments to personal preference . & gt ; *The `` This is a true story '' disclaimer at the start of every episode . It just does n't work for a TV show in 2014 , because I bet you the first thing a lot of people did after watching the first episode , was look up if it is based on a true story . It is n't , so what exactly is the point of telling us it is ? * An homage to the movie , probably the only thing it has in common . & gt ; *Tedious . That 's the word I 'd use to describe what I 've seen so far . There 's clearly some good actors on display and the storyline is alright , but for some reason I 've found the episodes so dull and slow-moving that I 've found myself zoning out and having to rewind and watch again . * Then it 's clearly not for you , I love slow pacing shows and movies . There are many fast shows and sitcoms that could be suited for you . & gt ; *Characters . The characters in the movie were brilliantly written , perfectly executed and , unlike the TV series , entirely convincing . The Coen brother 's characters suck you into the movie and deliver the perfect blend of charm , sympathy , quirkiness and darkness . The characters in the TV show are very uninteresting , with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton 's character . I feel nothing for the others . The female cop in the movie was exquisite , the female cop in the TV show is so dull I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow . The rest of the characters do n't convince me at all . I could n't care less if they all went through a woodchipper in the next episode . * You absolutely misread everything about the characters both in the movie and TV show . Just saying that the characters on the TV show are not brilliant written goes beyond me as all the main characters undergo grade A character development . & gt ; *I feel nothing for the others* & gt ; *I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow* You 've just contradicted yourself , you clearly do feel something for at least one character other than Billy 's . & gt ; *Hitmen . Look at this picture [ 1 ] . The top picture shows the hit men/kidnappers in Fargo the movie . They 're eerie , sleazy , menacing men who 's clumsiness gets them into to oddly hilarious situations . But the main thing is they 're convincing . They look exactly like the type of creeps who 'd offer to kidnaps someones wife or shoot someone for the right money , and then completely mess it up . Now , the hit men in the TV show do n't have any of this . First of all , one of them is deaf . Who the fuck is stupid enough to create a deaf hit man ? Think about it , he ca n't even hear himself , how 's he going to creep up on anyone ? How 's he going to know the police are on him if he ca n't hear sirens ? And the one in the beard is possibly the least convincing portrayal of a hit man I 've ever witnessed . He looks like a starbucks-drinking hipster who 'd have trouble fighting sleep , let alone killing anyone . I 'd laugh my head off if he 'd been sent to kill me . Pathetic . * That 's just a silly argument . You ca n't see into people 's heads , I bet you personally know many nice-looking people that do all kinds of nasty shit you do n't know about . And again , here 's your personal preference projecting . If you want to see something really realistic , why do n't you watch a documentary ? & gt ; *The whole Hess family . The Sam Hess character , worst acting ever ? The kids are just fucking irritating . Not funny , not smart , not clever , just cringeworthy and irritating . The wife 's character is such a cliché it 's embarrassing . * It seemed pretty solid to me and clichés exist for a reason .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Akaforty,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Well it 's not exactly like I can work around the ME-25 to get the guitar tones of Foo Fighters or Queens of the Stone Age . The ME-25 does n't have any good preamps and when I was recording , I just stuck to bypassing and recording the raw guitar input , since applying anything from ME-25 only decreased the overall quality.Although there are some effects that do n't affect the final quality , it all seemed detrimental to me . I did some tracks ( they 're on soundcloud ) where I liked the tones , but it 's usually only compensating for something else . If I record guitars as background instruments , it works , but I want to record guitar-driven music and it 's a disaster . I thought I tried everything , I think the quality simply lacks on a multi-effect pedal . Since I ca n't record what I mean right now , I 'll try to describe my problem to you with words . When I record my guitar directly , it sounds very bland , one-dimensional and boring . This is very different to what the actual tone of the guitar is , when played on an amp . It does have that full , jazzy Les-Paul tone with great bass and just the right amount of mids and heights . This does not show on the recordings in any way and you can obviously hear the low quality of recording , even though I 'm recording at the highest setting possible on ME-25 .

3Fyr,skyrim,"[ Video1 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=btOb2XqnNTw ) We ’ re starting the new year with a all-new Skyrim modding interview . This time around we ’ re talking to Will Willson , part of the Dark Creations team . A post-grad student in the UK , Will is an integral part of DC ’ s ambitious project known as “ Beyond Skyrim ” . What ’ s the mod all about ? Find out below… **Can you give a general overview of Beyond Skyrim and where the mod project currently stands ? ** Beyond Skyrim is a series of interlinking mods which will ultimately allow players to visit other areas of Tamriel within the Skyrim engine . Assets for each new region are being painstakingly created from scratch , including architecture , creatures , weapons , landscapes , textures and objects created by our artists and modelers . We pride ourselves on our fidelity to Elder Scrolls lore , and our ultimate aim is to create a player experience which will fit together seamlessly with Skyrim itself , allowing players to continue their existing character ’ s adventures in other lands , or perhaps even sidestep Skyrim ’ s story entirely and experience what the rest of Tamriel has to offer . [ Image1 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uVzSmEa.jpg ) We have made three years of progress towards this goal , though of course there remain many challenges ahead . When we started back in 2011 , we had little more than ideas and determination . While similar mods had been conceptualized and even released for previous Elder Scrolls games , we ’ re in uncharted territory for Skyrim . As we move into 2015 , we have built up a well-developed and cohesive community dedicated to our goals , in which our veteran members can actively train newcomers and continue to grow the project . Both our technical and artistic foundations are now firm and we are working hard to implement the quests , characters and stories that will bring this expanding world to life . **The project seems pretty ambitious… how much time is being put into the project ? ** It ’ s difficult to give a precise estimate , since our community depends entirely on volunteers working in their free time , which is of course a variable commodity . As a result of this a degree of membership “ cycling ” is necessary , as different individuals become able to contribute more or less , depending on their other commitments . At the last count , Beyond Skyrim had more than 50 active members , although the amount of hours each of those can contribute will continuously change based on their personal circumstances . Some members can work only a few hours a week , while others put in almost as much time as a job . At a minimum , thousands of hours have collectively been put into the project so far . We ’ ve become increasingly adept at managing and coordinating a highly flexible membership base . It ’ s necessary to break down some tasks like landscaping regions into smaller units , which can be worked on by individuals as they become available . We ’ ve found that taking many very small steps produces the most consistent rate of progress overall . **On your FAQ , you mention the project includes several modding teams – care to give any shoutouts ? ** The two largest groups within Beyond Skyrim are currently the teams working on Cyrodiil and High Rock . They are the oldest and most developed of the projects , and the closest to producing release-quality content . Cyrodiil in particular has gained a reputation for attracting high-caliber 3D artists eager to create their own interpretations of classic locations from Oblivion , some of which will be centre stage in what is likely to be the first Beyond Skyrim release : the region containing the Cyrodiilic city of Bruma . [ Image2 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Hrfeq1v.png ) Although much remains to be done on the asset front for High Rock , it has made great strides in landscaping , and is within sight of completing our first pass for the entire landmass of the Province . I think that it ’ s safe to say that many of the hardest challenges for both these projects have now been passed ( which of course isn ’ t to say there aren ’ t more still ahead ) . We also have teams working on Hammerfell , Morrowind and various other smaller projects , although they are currently at a less advanced stage of development . But progress has accelerated recently and we can expect to hear much more from them in the coming months . [ Image3 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/6CrDLFP.jpg ) As for individual members , there are too many , contributing in too many ways , to mention them all . But there are a few I would like to single out , not simply for their own work , but for their dedication to raising the bar of quality of Beyond Skyrim as a whole . In the field of 3D art , I should draw attention to Markus Liberty , who has constantly set new standards for himself in making architectural models , and inspired others to produce assets to match this quality . [ Image4 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/cYaHaek.jpg ) Among landscapers , we are greatly indebted to Wellpapp , not only for his phenomenal output but also for his generosity in sharing his hard-won expertise with multiple projects . [ Image5 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ZNRW8u8.jpg ) And on the soundtrack front , mention must be made of Xae and Guin , our two Lead Composers , who have forever raised our expectations for the original soundtracks that will accompany our project .

3Fyr,skyrim,"**With The Elder Scrolls Online having a more sweeping look at all of Tamriel , have you been taking any inspiration from the game for the modding project ? ** ESO has of course been a big inspiration to our project , since it filled in a lot of gaps which had previously existed in the lore . However , much of this has taken the form of backstory and helping inform the history of the regions we are making . After all , there is a gap of more than a millennium between the events of ESO and Skyrim , and cultures rarely stay static for long . There ’ s also the fact that ESO uses a different map scale to Skyrim , so we ’ ve had to be selective about what we can include . Many of our locations will take a look at the after-effects of the stories within ESO rather than directly reproducing them as they appeared in ESO . [ Image6 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/2lvKSQ9.jpg ) We ’ ve been having a lot of fun imagining ways in which the stories and characters of ESO have faded into legend with the passage of time . How biased local historians have converted the complex 2nd Era politics into fables about good and evil . Or how quests performed in ESO have cast long shadows over the intervening years that the player never intended . Skyrim players won ’ t need to have played ESO ( or Oblivion or Daggerfall for that matter ) to understand the events of Beyond Skyrim , but there will be plenty of nods and references which veterans of those games will recognize . **What other modding projects have you worked on ? ** I first caught the Elder Scrolls modding bug when contributing as a writer to Tamriel Rebuilt in 2008 . After that , I became involved in the still-ongoing Black Marsh project for Elder Scrolls 4 , where I soon found that my main talents lay more in administration . Since the Dark Creations website was founded in 2011 I ’ ve been involved in the running of the site and helping a great variety of Skyrim modding projects organize their hosting and forums . **What ’ s been your biggest challenge to date with the project ? ** Beyond Skyrim ’ s biggest challenge was , hands down , the creation of our Tamriel topographical map . This has formed the basis for the height maps on which all of our projects are built . Nothing else would have been possible without it , and it ’ s the hardest thing we ’ ve ever had to do . Although there were plenty of sources to draw on , even before the release of ESO , such as the in-game maps from Elder Scrolls II-IV — these were produced to fit wildly different scales and graphics . And of course , we wanted the end product to look as realistic as possible , which meant all the LOD at the borders joining up seamlessly . [ Image7 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/SmMHSZX.jpg ) Integrating all that information from different sources , and trying to deduce what all the rest of Tamriel would “ really ” look like at Skyrim ’ s scale , was both a technical and artistic mountain to climb . It meant figuring out ways to circumvent the hardcoded limits to the distances the game engine could render , and spending hours poring over the most obscure of Elder Scrolls lore references for clues about the landscape . On both of these fronts , we ’ re deeply indebted to a man known to us only by his username of Morcroft Darkes , who was responsible for many of the technical breakthroughs ( as well as the hard slog ) that made the final map possible . **Anything else you ’ d like to share ? New screenshots , trailers , etc ? ** Our most recent trailer ( shown at the top ) was created as a celebration of our third anniversary since the founding of Beyond Skyrim . It shows a selection of our landscapes and locations from across Tamriel , from the moors and citadels of High Rock , to the swamps of the Nibenay Valley in Cyrodiil , as well as glimpses of more exotic locations such as the Alik ’ r Desert in Hammerfell and the far eastern island nation of Roscrea . It also features footage of some of the new creatures that were custom made for Beyond Skyrim in action . A second trailer which we have also released recently , takes a more in-depth look at Country Bruma , the northernmost region of Cyrodiil , which is our current priority candidate for the first Beyond Skyrim release : [ Video2 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c2XsmMeCS9g ) And last but not least , here are a selection of screenshots from our cutting edge work on new regions : [ Album ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/oVHhH # 0 ) **Thanks for the interview ! **",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

I lived in a Multicultural center and the majority of crime was being committed by the ethnic minority . This is basic logic in 2016 . If you want to take this discussion down the `` yah but this is because they are less wealthy/educated '' fine but call it like it is : not all cultures are equal .

Europeans are skinnier so clothes are n't baggy/long . A funny mistake when I was younger : I would greet strangers with `` cześć '' which means Hello/Hi . But it is reserved for people you know . Instead the proper greeting is `` dzień dobry '' . It is still common to get up from your seat so elderly can have it . Personality wise : some Poles might assume you are not genuine because of constant smiling/small talk . On the flip side you might find Poles to be unpleasant or having a bad-day .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"If I can add anything about the song - this is n't a - so to say - 'killer ' song , or single , but maybe it should n't be ? It feels to me as this is the song that describes a moment when The Robot With Human Hair was born . The series always focused on problems - Robot always had it hard fitting with people due to his various problems . In part 2 he does n't gratuate high school . In par 2 1/2 he discovers and becomes addicted to sex . In parts 3-4 he struggles with drugs . This song , in my opinion shows how young and naive young people can be , thinking they do n't want the boring life , they want to have it all and wo n't miss anything . He 's talking how he is some kind of leader , as if he found the better way to live and he 's on the 'outside ' when they are on the 'inside ' - he is living the life of pleasures while they 're living boring , normal lives and he 's sure that his way is the better one and others will follow him . The song starts with the main protagonist reassuring himself that he should n't feel bad because it was in a way 'destined ' for him to live this life . The second Tilian verse feels like he 's breaking ties with those who would advise him to not do the things he wants to do . ( Like parents ) About the Mess first verse : Brain = Robot wang , he makes choices and thinks with his craving , no rational thinking involved . The onther line says that the protagonist wants to just fulfill his craving for sex . About I-8764 - when searched online , I-8764 will give you photos of particular wedding dress model , but it may be completely wrong . But these line mean that the protagonist does n't look at his girl/girls as a life companion , just rather as a person he has sex with and does n't have any feelings for her . Tilian 's second verse talks about how he devalues love as not something that the protagonist shares with one particular person , because he looks `` pathetic '' this way . Instead , he just feels addicted to feeling love , through sex f.e . The protagonist starts `` drinking the love '' , getting it no matter from whom or how . He feels like a savage , going from girl to girl and obtaining their 'love ' from them . He 's addicted , he wants all these thing and the WILL have these things . Jon Mess ' lyrics end it all with showing that protagonist knows how people think about him , how they say that his life is hedonistic , and he just does n't care about that and wants to corrupt those people instead by `` making them kiss their sistas '' . All in all , I think it 's a song about young people who get the wrong take on life and fall into their vices , thinking that that 's the way the life should be experienced . In whole , I think this song should n't be treated as some radio single , but rather as a fan-service for the fans that explains a little bit , gives context to the whole series of the songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"My thoughts exactly , I was pumped for the rest of the episode because I totally was n't expecting that ( I support Gen X'rs , dunno , I think they are underdogs so maybe that 's why ) and definitely made the episode better for me . Then I thought that the slide in fact was n't a red herring , because in the scene the pic was reffering to Chris was talking about who 's porbably will be voted out next , so in a way he was prepering for the next tribal council , the whole caption was just a stretch .

Will it help my game ? Can I manipulate the votes / the person to will this to me ? '' But the Legacy Advantage was only in possesion of two players who were nowhere near spilling any beans .

And avoid seasons with returnees - trust me , seasons 20 and 31 are sooo much better if you know the stories of the contestants ( also , avoid the casts of those seasons as they spoil big characters )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"What I meant was that from the edit Michaela was said to at least be at the merge and Michelle was supposed to win in a style of Michele from KR When Michaela went pre-merge I was excited because it meant someone else will get more screen time after she 's gone ( that seems to be Bret ) With Michelle , I have nothing against her but I just could n't see her as the winner and just did n't want another UTR winner , especially after we just had one . That 's why I was happy she 's gone because it lefts even the Edgic fans quite blindsided . With Ken I think it will be another blindside for Edgic community , when he 'll be booted around F5 and imo he 's getting a `` too perfect to win '' edit . ( and I suspect a heartbreaking betrayal from David ) Frankly , I do n't understand why I get downvoted here for stating that I like to be blindsided by the editors and unable to predict who goes next or to know who the winner is based on some confessional from episode 2 . But , sadly , you ca n't be rooting against UTR players or against this subreddit 's favorites . Especially when they are females . Oh well .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Also , his solo career seems to be doing well . Now that Kurt has left ALLB he 's a free agent ( I 'd be really surprised if he decided to continue as a solo artists with so many connections and musicians ready to collaborate with him ) and added the fact that through the anniversary tour he got closer to DGD once again ( you can see on the videos that he enjoyed playing his songs , on the first dates he wanted to sing the biggest part of `` Uneasy Hearts ...

The most consistend are the first two parts of of Strawberry Swisher songs as both are talking about girls/relationships ( so it kinda fits ? ) The Robot series I would say are loosely tight only by the interpretation by the fans as they usually focus on varying topics and only `` share '' the main protagonist , if you even can find a one in those songs .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

I can say that I expected to him to go a little bit deeper than he did and I think his story has n't been completed yet so he 's one of my favorites to get a chance another time . Also , I loved how at the merge the tribe immediately got rid of two great competitors - Tracy and Kevin . I was also shocked how easily Thomas had made bonds with outher like how you he made bonds with Tracy as you pointed out .

I like your season much more then mine : D I liked Samantha , Jason and Tom , they are greatly suited for and All-Stars season . IMO for second chancers , only Mercy ( and maybe Joseph ) could use a second shot at the game . Nice first season , first few seasons are a bit simple and thus boring but keep going , I like it !",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"That 's what I 'm planning on doing ; ) Dave had a nice game but I think that tribal council would be his last anyways .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Ha ! My favorite won the season . The merge was great , especailly that double idol play . I 'm only surprised that second runner up got no votes and got less votes than the first runner up who was pretty much a goat .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"I do n't know why you think that it is a awful winner . If you look at the statistic you notice that the winner was one of the most strategic players , had most immunity wins and was only one vote on the finale away from a perfect game . He also was in the alliance that run the game and if not for the idols - would be a final three . A pretty decent winner , imo",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Jeff Probst and Santa Claus,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yeah , I think my set alliances a little screwed the way how the simulator was creating alliances in the starting tribes , which made Hana the odd man out , without any allies so her game was a little bit bland . I have regrets because of this but on the other hand , this worked in a way I would like it to work - a group from Borneo was voted out early to ensure that they wo n't have power once they come together ( at least I believe it was meant this way lol ) Cynthia played a really good game but at the same time it painted a gigantic target at her back and once the tribe got the chance to take her out , they took it . What 's your opinion on the winner ? I liked the fact that it was somebody I was betting to not even make the pre-merge .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Tracy & amp ; Adam need to be in HvV , their hot-and-cold relationship was the best thing this season , I imagine Tracy as a Villain with her mutiny , convincing her new tribe to vote out it 's members , idoling and purple rocking people out , throwing them under the bus . She 's a villian . Adam on the other hand was a hero , being so many times on the exile but yet not switching tribes , even when they were loosing , founding an idol which he never played and being loyal to his alliances . I was rooting for one of them to win , I liked the winner but I 'd rather see him as the runner-up . Tristan and Bruce were interesting characters , poor Jordan L did n't even get a chance to play : (",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The Dear Hunter ' song has now been changed from `` Wait '' to `` Whisper '' La Dispute 's song has been changed from `` King Park '' to `` St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues '' Many times I chose the most popular or the most played tracks , when in doubt I compared them . Also , I wanted to keep this as post-hardcore as I could so I did n't include more popular songs of bands that later on changed their style , hence `` Devil In Jersey City '' by C & amp ; C is on the playlist . With Underoath , you may be reffering to the fact that their later albums stray from this sound and are often considered to be metalcore . But `` A Boy Brushed ... '' is a good representation of the sound from this album so it fits imo . `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' is a staple of this sound of post-hc spectrum so it fits . Also , Glassjaw 's sound on their albums can change pretty often so it 's not easy to pin-point the best representative . Letlive 's `` Muther '' is the song they 're most known for , and `` The Blackest Beautiful '' production is polarizing even Letlive 's so I did n't want to include a song from this album . Sadly , `` What Is It To Burn '' by Finch is n't available where I am , I 'll think on some solution to that",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I 'd recommend `` Constant Push '' and `` Dark Souls '' . ( Dark Souls would be definitely the best song if not for the chorus ) `` Discovery '' is also a worthy contender . Songs 9 - 14 are from theirs previous material `` If Only I Could Focus '' released in 2013 and from these songs I would recommend `` She 's Broke not Broken '' This band is unusual , because it has many influances but is executed in a style that is rather not seen in the scene . The record flows with mellow guitars tones and drumming only to transition to loud , noisy sounds in a minute . Also , the vocals at places remind me of Chino Moreno of Deftones , the vocalist wails , whispers , shouts , screams and sings lightly . I would say this is how Chino Moreno fronted post-hc band would sound like .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few borderline bands that can be loosely associated with post-hardcore genre so I decided to include them f.e . Foxing 's first album is mainly emo but could pull riffs and shouts in vain of DGD or Circa Survive BMTH 's `` Sempiternal '' is taken as post-hc release , similarly to Underoath 's `` They 're Only Chasing Safety '' even though they 're a metalcore band . Also , songs from `` Sempiternal '' are n't forbidden to post here , so there 's that . I do n't listen to blessthefall but only saw an opinion on the internet and last.fm that they 're a post-hardcore band but , I 'll give it a closer look Sadly , there is no Ling Tosite Sigure on Spotify , trust me If they were there I would be included .

1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh this is not how it works Network Ten is paying Endemol to create the show for them , so acquiring Ten by CBS may result in things like AUS being available in All Access , but they did not acquire the creative force , sadly . Also , I think that the US version would benefit sooo much only from extending it for another 20 minutes . I ca n't just understand why it 's the shortest of any Survivor version . When the series are starting ( Australia , recently one in Poland ) they always make the episodes long ( Australian is around one hour , polish one is an hour and a half ) so they can pay off . But US Survivor , the biggest of them all , with dedicated fanbase is the shortest and as of late needs to cut corners ( f.e . staying in Fiji , reusing challenges every season to save on creating new props ) while just by making episodes longer would give benefits to nearly everybody .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Their message is here , the guitars might have been more prominent but it 's ok and I think it will be better when we get the context of it on the album . `` Live Outside '' was a single but also a satire , this is bouncy with more power to it .

1Sopel6,survivor,I do n't think there was anything portraing her as a real threat or an mastermind that the edit did n't show - Annelise for the whole season did n't stick strong to anyone so she was kind of there . tbh if she did n't stumble upon that immunity idol or did n't give an iformation about having it she would be riding the wave like Tara is doing right now . On an island where 9 people are fighting with fists she was on of those who found a knife . She was a threat that needed to be simply disarmed .,Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"For the whole episode I was looking forward a move and it never came , I do n't know if my logic if flawed but ... Why not blindside Ziggy at this point ? The plan literally was just writing itself - they knew for sure that Ana is using her idol , you somehow get Ziggy to play her Super Idol . So you 're getting rid of two idols in one go . But here 's the plan - you know right then the 3 votes are going for Locky , one is going fo Annaliese . You take the remaining 7 and Ziggy gets clipped . And that would have worked even if Ziggy did n't screw Annaliese ! In one swoop you get rid of : two hidden immunity idols , one super idol , one flipper , original Samatau member and a challenge beast . Yeah , the Samatu are sitting together as a 3 , not as a 2 , and you 're exposing yourself by getting rid of one of your shields . But who 's going to win the challenges anyway . As we saw it 's really left between Jericho , Locky and Henry at this point . I just do n't know , this was so obvious to me , but is there something I 'm missing out that ? I know we see an end-product , but even Henry and Locky had all the info that I 've pointed out .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"tbh , after my practices in hospital he has a typical mentality of an seasoned doctor - both weird and cringy in jokes / interests and with a feeling of superiority .

1Sopel6,survivor,"What I love about the cast is that it 's a very diverse bunch , almost to the point when it looks like some fanmade fanfiction . Just look at the bunch that is left in the game I mean , you have whacky Luke , a sweet cookie-monster Jericho , an silent and seemingly always scared Peter , an hilarious alpha male Locky to the point that he looks like a caraicature of an archetype , an elusive shadow that is Sarah , a complete gossip girl and chatterbox that is Michelle , the underdog scrappy fighter Tessa , the smarter-than-he-thinks but still lovable dude that is Henry , the kickass chellange beast Ziggy and the one everyone loves to hate - Tara . And the best part is that all of them have that fire to fight for the immunity or to scramble and be strategic , and everyobody does it in their own style - Michelle can create a drama out of the tiniest information , Locky with his subtle as a punch strategies , Henry 's constant running and gunning , etc . Not to mention some good characters that we had in the pre-merge were also good .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Australian one proved that Survivor US got too meta , too full of itself . Sadly , US one probably wo n't learn a thing from that as it 's not threatening for their market .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"Yes ! I also think that the boot order is ideal . The only ones I miss from pre-merge is Mark W ( I would have him in the place of Annelise anyday ) and as I understand that AK may have been getting on some people 's nerves I think his eventual downfall in the merge would be more satisfying then a pre-merge boot because of the swap . Other then that - yeah , everyone else left in the ideal place , just enough to show their characters , or would n't deliver anything exciting and were gone fast ( Kate , Aimee )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Oh sweet summerchild Welcome to the world of messism . In overall , Craig 's lyrics are mostly constant blabbing about girls , Travis ' are about relationships and are the ones that are filled most with emotions , Pearson 's are overly sexual . But Jon Mess ? That 's a whole other bag . He has a style in which he is both very blunt about the delivery but also very very cryptic about the meaning . If you want some insane lyrics from him check out `` Need Money '' . As to connections to video games , on `` Jesus H. Macy '' the lyrics '' Set it up , cover the plans , record everyone , make demands Positional strategy , split was disastrous , flanking the siege '' is in fact about Starcraft .

1Sopel6,survivor,"Tell that to all the UTR winners ; ) Calling the shots in benefitial for your game when the plan follows as you intend them but when the pyramid gets flipped upside down - you 're the first head of the chopping block . Just look at AK - went from bottom to top and I smell that he can be in another turmoil caused by Locky and Henry . Why is that ? Because from being the target of the majority he rose up and now is the target of the minority . And the thing in Survivor is - you never know when that minority becomes a majority . Revolution eats their own children . That 's what riding the middle is - playing enough to not be the last in the alliances pecking order but not playing too much to be the one calling the shots . And yes , I 'll agree that it 's result based as it will determine if we will remember it as a great move or as a stupid move . But Henry made his choices , gambled and the payoff may be massive . But well , if you 're getting `` JT flashbacks '' you probably are one of the crowd that disregard the whole idea of the move and only repeat the same opinion - in this case `` JT was a dumbass , he should n't give that idol to Russel '' . BUT , if the JT 's perception of Russell / what is going on in Villains tribe proved to be right , this gifted idol would be praised as the most brilliant thing in the whole series . It 's the gamble . JT gambled , Henry is gambling right now . As for Henry - guy saw an opportunity , took it , he has some connections back at his old tribe , he knows he will be valuable at his new tribe . Again - big gamble , big payoff . Thinking about that - yeah , JT and Henry seem to be the same kind of a player . I 'd like to call them `` the experimentator '' , they do crazy things if that little stroke of brilliance . Sometimes they play the perfect game , sometimes they come down in history as `` the stupidiest move in the history , hurr hurr '' . But still , JT is in the realm of legends , and Henry is 9 episodes in , a major character od this season ( at least for now ) I think that 's the way of percieving of good players . I would argue who 's thinking is really flawed here .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

She may use it but everyone knows she 's dangerous with it * it has been 25 out of 55 days out there , it 's nearly the middle of season for them , so a good motivation for another half is a good idea . Besides , in US version they get the letters around the same day . It also helped to give some background to the characters , sympathise with them while fillin the filler . * well , it 's pretty naive to think that production would let that happen ... * also , a good timing given that the majorities on both tribes are getting to comfortable with their powers",Balto-Slavic,Polish

Also , I think that it could be a little bit less stripped out , bit quieter . Something in the liking of the passage in `` Tetra Hydro Cannonball '' from their EP ( [ this ] ( https : //youtu.be/6KYc9HwB_9g ? t=95 ) ) , I just think it lacks a bit of intimacy . I still have hope for this album , it 's their debut after all .

1Sopel6,survivor,"No , it has been there in previous episodes - although not so over-the-top like in this one ( it 's also present in Luke 's confessionals ) . This is also not so uncommon in the US version - it was quite noticeable in S33 , especially in Zeke 's confessionals . Possibly it 's a matter of lightning , lense like Ben 's wild hair and their color may not look so good on the background with morning sunlight , hence they need to create a contrast .

1Sopel6,survivor,"IMO twists are fine at this point , still better then Advantage Fest that was GC . And I 'm glad that the `` dumb stuff the American version has n't seen '' is there , because it makes the series unique , not another carbon copy of the format . 24 people was overbearing at the start , and the edit of some early boots left something to desire , but given the people who went out first - they were n't that interesting anyway , and them going home was always against our [ ed/lo ] gic and we were truly blindsided that way . I 'm not really that mad that I have n't known Kate or Aimee very much . That time was spent on some people that are main characters of the season ( atm ) And I think that at this point I can say at least something about the characters , everybody left got at least a little of their personality shown , but some are given to us in a more subtle way ( like Peter ) . ALSO , I do n't think the alliances are that hard to follow , especially since in both tribes people split into two groups and paired up in them , which imo makes things only easier to follow ( like you know that Jericho is always with Luke , AK with Tessa , Locky with Tara , Henry with Jacqui and later her with Kent , etc . ) and every voteout is based on the fight of the two opposing forces for the people who are more or less in the middle , and they are presented to us so we know who is the deciding force .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

I would also really love to know what ( and how many ) teams are playing in Tonga Major League as of lately . These informations will be used in the process of creating a modification that would add Tongan football league into the game Football Manager 2017 .

A `` regular '' marriage is an option but I wanted to push a matrilineal marriage but there 's a problem - Harry does n't want it only because Arya is `` unlikely to have children '' . That was a bit confusing for me so I checked her out with charinfo - she has a `` fertility '' of -99950 % ! We 're for sure not getting any babies from that ! What 's worse , Bran and Rickon suffer from the same deal . What should I do ? Wait 2 years more until Arya is 16 , her portrait updates and maybe something refreshes ? I 've searched around the web , I 've come to this that the fertility is to assure she wo n't be having children too fast ( same goes f.e . for Asha Greyjoy ) But seeing that it affects the `` missing '' Stark children ( Sansa i a-ok ) I 'm wondering if everything is alright with this situation . Also , I 've checked Arya 's fertility before , after finding her when she was around 10 - it has n't changed / updated since then .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"wow , nice way to be a douche It 's a decent tune but defenitely not belonging in post-hardcore , as the whole genre is veeery broad this song does n't really have any elements typical to post-hardcore , not even the core structure .

It happens when everyone is so at their throats that everyone can be trusted only at the given moment like in Cambodia . Does Sandra play this strategy ? No , she just escapes with the boat that will sail her to the next TC . The problem of this strategy is that it 's based heavily on luck , so it is n't the best , the winning formula . Is Sandra cunning and perceptive ? Yes . Is she boring ? Character-wise not at all , strategy-wise yes . Does she deserve her wins ? `` Winner is always worthy '' Is Sandra the best player ever ?

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , that was a really fascinating season ! I really liked how you could see the storylines forming . Also , very strangely I could see some parallels to real life Survivor Fiji players ! Kendra being first out to weaken the alliance of younger ones , Gigi voted out because of being annoying just after her , I especially liked how the younger alliance at the first tribal voted Gigi as a obvious vote out to strenghten the team and were basically blindsided . Hunter got very unlucky , but the fact that he was n't very promient to the story really fits well with that Armando was really robbed of playing the game , Sylvia Kwan style I liked how Izumi was voted out because of her feud with Manuel who was more valuable at the time Ferris voted out because of his Rocky-like character Whitney being the one to strat picking the new tribe at the twist and essentailly chhosing her poison by being voted 5-1 Lee got a little BrantSteelle logic - fucked because he should reconnect with his old tribemates or the opposing ones but sadly there are some flaws in the simulation Manuel was a fun pre-merge villain , not a great player but if there was some drama he was always included Meili is the ideal boot for the merge , as she did n't do anything to that point , and was booted at the right time for the story , leaving us with a very interesting group Monty Dickinson was a real dick and I loved every little moment of it , he gave me some Randy vibes , would like to see him again maybe ? Libby was a good player , sadly go picked off because she was quite savvy Autumn was a typical `` the leader won immunity so vote out his ally '' Chris was a great character , great villain and quite a challenge beast , would like to see him return Joshua was an ally of Ji-Tae and Ashley , he seemed to trust them but got blindsided when Ji-Tae started to build his resume . Being a comedian I suppose he could be a social threat Ashley would probably be another victim of Ji-Tae 's flip . But on the bright side - you have a great candidate for a team captain when you get to the Phillipines ! Leah was such a drama queen , kind of like Abi Maria , most votes received yet still dragged to the end as a total goat , just like Cassandra in Fiji Ji-Tae was a great character and my pick going into this season , I liked how he stuck with the older alliance at the start , survived at Ravu with Joshua and Ashley , later jumping into Moto camp . He had a good plan going forward but I feel people may have felt betrayed at the end . He seemed to me to be a good strategist but lacking in skill to pull that all off . Regardless , I still loved him , would definitely be a pick for a Second Chance season - because his storyline needs a second chance And last but not least - Von . Member of the younger alliance at Ravu . Started off as a villain but later evolved into a more mature person . He survived everything that fate tossed him and somewhat fought till the end and without a single vote casted for him ! He had strategy , he had immunity wins and he had respect of the jury for what he achieved . Truly a fantastic winner , he reminded me of Jay from MvGX as he would be probably regarded in the same way if he won his season . Overall , fantastic season , this lengthy comment and the fact that I could remember thing about every single contestant just proves that this is a quality rarely achieved on this subreddit .

1Sopel6,survivor,"In the first episode , when they 're stranded on the beach for a day you see the castaways splitting up - one half ( the younger one ) went exploring the island and the second half ( the older one ) stayed behind and started building the shelter . What we were n't shown is that those two groups formed alliances , because no one had a clue what 's this seasons theme , etc . Also , it happend naturally as older ones were scared that if they do n't stick together the younger ones will boot them . The same went for the younger group . This is how two , big alliances of ~10 were formed - Explorers and Builders . Later , when the crew finally decided how to continue the season with 19 castaways , one person would divide the tribes and would join the losing one . That person was Sylvia - a member of the builders . Calculating her chances she decided to split the two alliances as evenly as she could so she would n't end up in a position with no allies , regardless of which tribe went to the Tribal Council . After that we have pretty much seen what happened next , although it 's quite a crucial plot point that was left out of the final edit , that would explain why some people bonded so easily ( like younger guys on new Ravu )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'm not an english native speaker but I find the music behind the conversations much much more bearable than in the american one . I 'll give you that the splicing is quite obvious , with additional one second scenes that do n't really add any much power to the words or anything , but only show us the contestant in different place , setting , wearing different clothes which adds another level to this . I think that by not revealing the AK 's idol the episode only got better . With that reveal we would n't have gotten the Chicken Idol scene . Also , plot wise - without the reveal we kind of understood the situation of the rest of the tribe - `` does AK have an idol ? I guess he has . Or maybe Adam is playing us ? '' . Lastly , after all - the idol itself did n't amount to anything , it did n't negate any votes . The format includes many people , their thoughts and stories , all at the same time , but I 'm not worrying that much about it , I 'm sure we will get into those characters when they will start to matter . This is n't quite te American standard , where the winner is hamfisted and forshadeowed since the first episode . Hell , the previous winner of AUS Survivor for the most part was for the most part a supporting character , people did n't see her chances even after the merge hit . So I would n't worry that much about it all - afterall , what do you even want to hear from someone who is in the middle of the pecking order in the main alliance and is n't targeted ?",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,survivor,"Hmm , so aligning with Sasha saves you from the boot at F5 ? In that case I have a new theory , spend every round talking once to the person that is going to be eliminated and once to Sasha . It seems that an alliance with him is crucial to the game but does n't bring anything new after the alliance is formed . I only know that talking to Margo is pointless because she 's just depressed and you ca n't help her ( unless you can somehow save her through the conversations ) -- wait , is Margo voting too if the vote is 7-1 ? Also , what would happen if you allied with Vinni ? We know Sasha guarantees us F3 and finale with an idol . But what if Vinni 's `` storyline '' gives us something else . tbh I 've never talked to her Also , this is less a `` game '' and rather a digital art form for an expo . I bet this is n't about being on the right side etc because you ca n't be on the first run , only with outside knowledge . Also , every character is pretty one-dimensional - Karo is a superfan , Jo works hard , Sasha is nice but naive , Margo is a depressed pile of mess and so on . There is - some - massage there , not quite sure what , I 've watched a short interview with the creator ( and host ) of the game . It was n't very explaining but the basis is that like in game of Survivor you need to interact , think and in overall move forward in the dog eat dog world . Or so I think that was the intent . So there is no our - the real-life Survivor fans - way of winning as you do n't talk strategy and ca n't possibly be in control . You 're never in the control of the game . But through trial and error you can solve what path the game wants you to take . Also , I 'm curious if there is some theme of going against the rules , like if you would have stick to the path all of the players take you would have never found the HII . I wonder if there is something else hidden somewhere , mainly in the lodge by the entrence ( I purely base it on the fact that HII are n't just hidden in regular rooms , but like the library in some specific ones ) . Also , waht I 've noticed is the second dialog with Jo is always written as if you were talking to her after her second immunity win , as if we were meant to talk to her in an order ( but that may be just an oversight from the developer 's part ) . Also , the last thing is the 4th wall breaking host that in The Stanley Parable 's comments on you dicking around the place , I wonder how far can you push her limits . Ok , main takeaways * it 's possible that the way to win is allying with Sasha to not get booted at F5 and talking everyday to the contestant that is going to be elliminated to maybe get their sympathy and get votes from them * Maybe there is a way to save Margo ( after all , the host points out that you did n't do anything after her death , maybe it has some role , like keeping Margo in game changes the outcome ? ) * there may be some room to screw around with the came with the big space that is the museum and with the narrator that breaks the 4th wall . There may be something left to uncover , because as the narrator says - there is no way for us to win the game , no scenario like that . But on the other hand - by the game logic we were n't supposed to be in the game after F5 . So this game might be about outsmarting the game . * it 's unknown what happens when you ally with the finalist - Vinni",Balto-Slavic,Polish

The vote should be Jo . I do n't know if this is the solution , first time I played it I also got voted out at F5 , later by running around I found the HI , played it , and Jo went out in a 5-1 vote out Then I continued , Nikola has been voted out , I 've got left with Vinni and Sasha , the only person I talked to for the whole game . I do n't know how to continue past that , Vinni wins immunity so it 's me or Sasha and Vinni votes me . I do n't know what should be done , I have a few ideas * talk to Sasha till you make an alliance with him , later switch to Vinni * talk to Sasha and when asked , advise him to quit * I 've noticed that after the tribal I 've found the HII the floor that I 've found it on - 5th - started to burn down . Later , on the day that I 've been voted out the 4th floor started to burn down . I do n't know if a HII is hidden there ? When I tried to look for it the host said she 's tired of it and reused the `` break the wall '' challange , but it was impossible to beat * Normally it seems that you go out if you do not play the idol after the fourth challange , but when I played no votes were cancelled and Jo went 5-1 . Probably it 's how it 's supposed to be but maybe you can keep the idol and play it on the FTC and single handedly vote out Sasha I 'm probably somewhere close to beating this game but I do n't think I want to go through the creepiness of it If someone is interested in the `` boot list '' , here it is ( it 's always the same thing but maybe it 's helpful to be on the good side of the votes ) Ellis Asla Dana Margo Karo ( pick up the HII ) Jo Nikola My tactic was to stick with Sasha and Jo , but she is n't the late gamer . Talk to Sasha from the start , when he talks about Solidarity do n't tell him that the ship is sinking , on the next convo he will become your ally . Two or three conversations later he will consider quitting . I do n't know , anymore , game is very creepy and artsy-fartsy but on the other end , it definitely creates some interest and being against the game itself is also interesting . ( the game outright tells you after the vote out you are normally meant to be going but you played your idol that you was n't going to get that far and there is nothing left for you ) Whew , that became a longer post then I intended but if someone wants to try and solve this game I 'd be more than happy to know how it ends .

1Sopel6,BrantSteele,Thanks for your insights but : 1 . I think in a normal Survivor enviroment the villains would rather break the main alliances ( pecking order etc ) and reorganize with them and getting the additional votes from the last heroes who would n't have any other better option - this is how blindsides are made 2 . The quotes would make it more obvious but there are limitations .

1Sopel6,survivor,"Scot - yes , he may act like a dick , but I think it 's partly because of the companionship of Jason . You know , when boys get bored and decide to do some pranks etc . But without him - we 've seen he could work with Tai and that he had a good sense of strategy and quite decent sense of man management , probably from his days as a pro athlete I also liked Rodney , he is n't a good social player and I do n't think that if he ever returned he would have lasted as long as he did in WA , but man , Survivor sometimes needs some rude asshole villains to root against , you know ? Also , seconding the love for Spencer , Tai , Troyzan and Rocky - guess I like underdogs pushed to the wall",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I 'd totally swap Mike and Ryan . I think that our lovely urologist will not mesh well with his tribe . A red flag for me is how he 's talking about his strenghts . Also , I think that a tribe consisting of nurses and therapists would gladly get rid off an underperforming , thinking too highly of himself and maybe a little bit bossy ( him coming to the challenge in front etc , signs of wanting to be the leader - you know , in the leaders tribe he 's the MD , leader of the `` medical '' team ) Ryan , on the other hand I think can manouver to the merge at least , from what we have seen/read about him so far he 's kind of like David but with more social chops than him . I think that he could easily survive the first vote as I think that Lauren got the short end of the stick with her hustling tribemates .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Yay , my favorite actually won ! I guess those who say that he played a weak game do n't really get into these simualtions as I do Pre-merge was kind of fun , Fang was a diseaster unfolding , happily the more interesting people from Fang got into the first swap ca n't say much about three first boots other then they were kind of typical I 'm happy Cody went so early , I hated him Naomi and Kelli greatly integrated with the other Kota alliance who while counting the number , eliminated those who were opposing them pre-swap - Grace and Jack . Funny situation how they were swap-fucked when on paper they should be safe among their own Later on , on double elimination , Kelli and Naomi greatly baited the rest of Kotas and blindsided Rico , who was on of the physical pawns of Alice , good move on their part On Fang Scott just could n't escape - he was a quite fun , grumpy pre-merge villain imo , could get a shot at SC down the line , maybe ? After the next vote Fang alliances could n't work together and the tribe imploded , with Kelli once again surviving Nadia being the merge boot seems kinda fitting , she seamed to me to be a strong competitor and a scrappy player , could be dangerous Alice was such a diva , wrapping guys around her finger , while using them as pawns and eventually wanting to get rid off one of her meat shields , but Vincent turned on her and Colby went rogue , leaving her behind Vince 's blindside more significatn for the btrayal of Anne-Marie , she sensed the danger and protected herself from the boot The next episode was about rallying the troops between Anne Marie and Eric , two big characters thus far Anne Marie was a big breakout character , one to return , thats for sure - she was a great villainous schemer at the same time , very rootable , she caused some drama , manouvered strategically . The finale 5 was a quite enjoyable bunch - Colby , thus far a pawn in other 's games , Sarah , an old kickass lady , Naomi and Kelli , a duo with trust issues and Eric , ( for me at least ) a Todd-like player Colby was booted , quite unceremoniously , I think that was done to not ruin the alliances that were going on - Eric with Naomi both keeping Sarah and Kelli on their sides , I think that everyone thought they had a plan and this just was n't the time to make the final move , as Colby was basically a free agent At Final 4 , Naomi finally woke up and wanted to make the last move that counts , recruited by Sarah she saw Kelli as an underdog story that could win the jury . On the other end Eric and Kelli , while being more strategic knew that it was going to be either of them so they teamed up and voted for a big jury threat - old Sarah . At this point I think only Naomi was out of the running for the title . Kelli got beaten in the firemaking and surprisingly that was the best outcome for Eric As to the votes at FTC - i loved the bitter throwaway Anne Marie 's vote for Naomi , because she was bittter to both of their blindsiders xD Roy has voted for Sarah as she was his tribemate ( also , I do n't think he was very inept in the game so I 'd guess that would be a good explanation ) Vincent was a close ally of Sarah , so it 's no wonder taht he stayed loyal and voted for her And , as to the winner - Eric . He had put on the jury Alice , who liked him more than other ( no wonder as for the whole season , she was sticking with the guys , it 's also a funny characteristic for her character ) Kelli admired Eric because he was the best strategist , after her . He also smooth talked his way to the win at the jury questions and swayed two lone guns - Nadia and Colby - to his side . I enjoyed that win , it was a very Todd-like As for returnee posibilities FvF - Alice and Scott Second Chances - Kelli , Sarah HvV - Anne Marie , Eric ( both villains , but Eric is more like an anti-hero - Todd , Sandra and Natalie A style )",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,BrantSteele,"Wow , well , here 's a legend to your series ; ) I 'm dissapointed with the winner , at least Edmund was looking quite reasonable and was a character ( Kristen , Tanesha and Blake voted for him and they were the best jurors ) but oh well , you can say he was blindsided at the finale ! ( I think that he got too comfortable , looked upon himself as the leader of such successful tribe , but probably lost Sofia 's vote , as she thought he would n't ever betray her ) Kristen was a good villain with epic blindside , maybe you can fix her a spot somewhere Tanesha is simply a villain legend , I understand that as a creator you were rooting for her to win it all , just as Probst was rooting for Stephenie but her boot was inevitable Doreen is in fact a good SC candidate , but I do n't know what rules do you follow but she may be `` too old '' for SC - maybe a spot on Heroes tribe ? She had a very strange story I liked Edmund , maybe a little too confident but maybe he could return as a Favorite ? Blake was also good but nothing that really stood out imo he was good character for the season but I do n't see too much sense in him returning .",Balto-Slavic,Polish
1Sopel6,survivor,"I think it works because it references to overall people 's traits so the theme is n't forces on the players as they practically do n't change their playstyle or personality - Kyle Jason , Scott Pollard and Cliff Robinson would always play like jocks , Spencer Garrett and David would always play like smartasses , etc . Also , characteristics like these make people on the tribes really gel together . WA is n't exactly the same . It 's similiar in the way but BvBvB theme bases on the overall characteristics - from personalities ( Alecia is feisty hence is a Brawn , Tai has amazing positivness and joy of life hence is a ( n inner ) Beauty ) to their jobs ( Sarah is a cop and brawn is the characteristic of the job , Peter is a doctor so he clearly must be an intelectual ) ending with simply their looks ( Anna , Lindsey , Aubry ) WA takes only one characteristic into consideration - the job . It 's just one link to the other format but it gives slightly different group HvHvH seems to be taking into consideration the personality and life motivation but I do n't know if it is n't too wide of a characteristic to create groups that would gel together . IMO they should try again with the collar themes to see if with better cast it can produce a better season . The cast of HvHvH would be pretty much set to the theme , maybe with a few changes in the cast",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"Yeah , I would say we do , more and more every year as the generation that was born after the fall of communism is growing bigger . That generation also learns english . In Poland homemade metal music is dominant but nonetheless is american ( Slayer , Metallica , Machine Head , System of a Down etc ) . Electronic music also is quite popular , mostly the british ones . ( But check our polish band [ The Dumplings ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Me_AJzcqOcg ) as they 're called `` the voice of the young polish generation '' ) Also , you know , pop and rap music . `` Core '' music is pretty much niche , but from them metalcore is the most popular here for sure ( mostly british band as they 're closer so they tour more often ) . But post-hc bands like Enter Shikari , Dance Gavin Dance , A Day To Remember , Bring Me The Horizon or Chiodos have some ( bigger or smaller ) recognition around here . And everyone is learning english because it is world 's most communicative language right now . Just as in past , in Europe it was latin or french .

I really liked when my 19 yo that I got for free , mid season , as a young talent got pissed for not playing in the first 11 after 2 months ( ! ) of being in the goddamn club ! He could n't even speak french and wanted to be my starting winger . He also threatened me with him leaving the club just after he signed a 5 year contract with me . Other great story involved a player that I got mid season that got really butthurt about a player that was loaned a season before and later sold . He was 21 yo defender , so okay , you may say that i sold a youngster , I 'll take that , but the player who was angry about it ( and nearly turned the whole team against me ) have n't even spend a day in the same club with the sold player , they did n't even know eachother and were n't even from the same continent ! This whole morale and players interaction is a cool idea but it needs some touches , I do n't want do get sacked because some youngster wants first team football that he would recive anyway in the future .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"They are as post-hardcore as Circa Survive is . What makes them post-hardcore'ish for me is their more artistic take on their music with more complexed guitar work than in hardcore or indie rock , with more poetic-like lyrics that maybe are n't targeted to be catchy but seem to have a meaningful express instead . Also , unclean vocals are present on this track too ( around 3:30 , followed with breakdown ) . They also use harsher vocals , not necessarily pure scream , but a shout/yell . ( f.e . in [ Stay Outside ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=TpQoS_zg5aY & amp ; feature=player_detailpage # t=175 ) or in [ Your Son ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? feature=player_detailpage & amp ; v=vxu4gzGo7x8 # t=153 ) ) Of course that does n't make them 100 % post-hc but I do n't know if there is any 'pure ' post-hardcore band .

To be honest this is so far a friends label ( Oranges played shows with Stolas since 2012 ) with only Eidola and Adventurer being out of the DGD friends circle . I dig this song and I believe that Oranges are talented so I 'm okay with that , but BSR really needs to branch out in genres IMHO Someone suggested thath they should sign some hip-hop artists and I messaged them about Hyro Da Hero , who 's living in CA , made music with members of At The Drive-In and The Blood Brothers and is looking for label . Sadly , my message has never been even opened . I would love to see bands like VIS , Visitors , Microwave , Wayne Szalinski or Makari being picked up by some label but probably not by BSR .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"'Plan B ' was a colaborative work of Sacramento arstists to make something big and epic . But do you imagine how would they stick around with so many band members ? It 's just hard to operate with so many different people - get them in one place at given time just to practice . You need to remember that artists are also people with their own lives and problems . They 're crafting their own style as they want it , there are still some of the sounds that resemble these present on the Plan B in their later albums . If they would stay in the same formula , you could 've called them `` repetetive '' . What they 're doing is progression , doing something new . Michael Franzino did n't had to record solo because band did n't let him utilize his ideas in ALLB songs , he just wanted to make a solo album because the whole idea behind alone . originated from his breakup and he wanted to express his emotions and feelings through the music . But it 's HIS story , he is just a guitarist , not a singer , he just wanted to make this his own , personal stuff . He wanted to make this alone .",Balto-Slavic,Polish

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"There are few methods 1 . I pick a tag I like and if the tag is big enough there will be four `` Hyped artists '' , by that you can find new and coming bands and also bands that released f.e . albums recently ( not to mention the section of `` Top Artists '' ) 2 . Recommended artists , you can find this on the main site , if you click to see more you will be presented with six pages of artist that you may like , also , last.fm will compare them to the artists that you have in your library so you can judge if you may like something by their similarities to the bands you already like ( If you go to the bands page and click on `` add to library '' or a plus icon on the right side of the page you will add them to your library so you can remember about them and check them out later . These bands are also counted while presenting you recommended music so you can dig deeper and deeper into the sound that you like and might build up a long list of bands to check out later ) 3 . Looking at similiar artists you like but it 's based for every user individually so it kinda works the same as the recommended music . Also , explore new tags of music that you 're unknown to you but you dig a band from that genre . 4 . Checking out the bands our favorite bands are playing shows with , by looking at who Rise Against toured in the past I 've found out about Architects and Touche Amore 5 . Stalk your friends . If I find someone that is listening to a lot of new music I visit their profiles often and look at what they 're listening lately ( in a month , in a week ) that is also a great source of new music If you want to you can dig through [ mine ] ( http : //www.last.fm/user/Sopel_1/library ) last.fm library and look for some cool sounding or looking band , maybe you 'll find something new ; )",Balto-Slavic,Polish

But I still dig it The Bank Of England and There Is A Price On Your Head were something new from the band 's sound IMO and it eventually rooted on me . ( At first `` The Bank Of England '' to me sounded like a bluesy-Alestorm song , and I guess you have already heard about the second song being compared to SOAD 's songs ) But to the rest of the album I have In overall - Shikari done it again Ca n't wait for the next one ^^^^^^but ^^^^^^yeah , ^^^^^^I 'm ^^^^^^not ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^fan ^^^^^^of ^^^^^^this ^^^^^^cover ^^^^^^art",Balto-Slavic,Polish

[ 1 ] Most of these men served time in regular prisons , and an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 of those sentenced were incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps . [ 1 ] It is unclear how many of the 5,000 to 15,000 eventually died in the camps , but leading scholar Rüdiger Lautmann believes that the death rate of homosexuals in concentration camps may have been as high as 60 % .

1010x,hoi4,"I just saw last week 's developer 's stream of Kaiserreich where they are playing Russia and was disappointed on how uneventful it was . When I chose Russia during my first game of Kaiserreich , I decided to restore a rightful monarchy and made all the according choices , however , I got really screwed mid-way . Obviously , I had a 'Disaster ' stability and almost zero national unity , as well as huge shortage of infantry equipment . First , Soviet Union spawned in the western part of Russia . A Civil War , great ! I was completely unprepared for that so I had to consolidate all my troops throughout the territory and wait for them to unite along the front which took a lot of time and cost me in a lot of territories . My unarmed infantry was practically useless in offensive so I just held the line and hoped for the best , waiting for the planning bonuses and more infantry equipment . After a few months , I started an offensive and it was going great , Soviets were losing and I felt victorious . However , that did not last long as I got a telegram from Siberia , stating that they are seceding , permanently . I could not allow more divided Russia , so I had to declare war on them . I could n't actually start conquering Siberia right away , so I took 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive and put them in Ural mountains , hoping that they would hold until they can get reinforcements from the west after I 've dealt with Soviets . Soviets were still losing , but not as fast as I wanted them to , so the offensive was going really slowly but fortunately , the Siberian AI was indecisive and did n't push into my undermanned border which they could easily do . I slowly moved into Soviet territories , the victory was not near but it was almost assured , but then I got a telegram from the south : Don - Kuban union declared a war on me , damned cossacks wanted more land to pillage ! I had to take another 20 divisions from my Soviet offensive just to protect the Southern borders from the barbarians . Same as in Siberia , I also could n't launch a direct assault , so they just had to hold the line until I dealt with the Red Menace . My Soviet Offensive was becoming more and more undermanned , but it was still going strong : after all , people believed in their tsar and his Divine Authority . Russian armies were fighting on three fronts , severely underpowered and underarmed , so it could n't get much worse , could it ? Well , it could and it did . Right as I was pushing into Petrograd 's territories , the Tsar received another telegram : the King of Finland was asking for their `` rightful '' territories : pretty much all the land East of Finland . ( i.e . majority of Novgorod territories in EU4 ) . Obviously , I could not bow to these Finnish pretenders ; I politely refused and got a war declared on me . Now I have a war in the north with Finland , a war in the west with Soviet Union , a war in the south with Don - Kubans and a war in the east with Siberia and it 's not even 1937 . My armies are overstretched , hungry and out of supply , but it ca n't get any worse , right ? The submission got pretty long , tell me if you want me to continue . I just wanted to tell on how crazy Russian games in Kaiserreich can get and why I was kinda underwhelmed by what events ( or lack of them ) developers got during their stream . I mean , good for them for playing it right , but my completely screwed up game turned out to be far more interesting than a 'perfect ' playthrough : )",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Wheezing his last few words with difficulty , Yeltsin tells Vladimir , `` Komrade , the reins of the country are now in your hands . But before I go , I want to give you some advice .

Vladimir decided it was time to open the first letter . All it said was : `` Blame everything on me !

13lack_Baron,european,"There are many reasons why the Roman Empire fell , and many speculations . But I remember one of the biggest reasons that they let immigrants become part of the Roman citizen . The Roman military became diluted and had a lower quality as many of their soldiers were mercenaries from other regions , and they only fought for Rome for the money , not for the pride , as they did n't have any Roman pride . This caused less volunteers as once they gained their citizenship for fighting in the military , why would they fight anymore for someone else who is n't their own ? **Also** , Germans began to integrate more and more into their society , but still retained who they are . They were able to learn about Roman tactics , then they had the *quality* , and the *quantity* to beat the Romans down . Additionally , immigrants such as the Germans began to gain positions of power in the politics of Rome , as one German became the advisor of a boy-emperor , and of course , he would work for the benefit of the Germans , not the Romans .

13lack_Baron,wow,"Well , let 's say you 're on a PvP server and everyone is flying , it prevents you from doing PvP since you ca n't reach them in the sky . ( To an extent ) And if you 're on a PvE server or just doing a quest you could bump into someone who is ALSO doing those quests and group up together and do it as a group , and while doing the quests you could have some things in common , you may like the person and become friends . When I was in Westfall I met some friends who were killing those pesky hunting machines and we teamed up , became friends , and years later we are still friends . Another example of how I met one of my best friends on WoW is when I was in the TBC zone for Blood Elves and met him in the Ghostlands trying to kill an elite and he needed some help , I helped him out as I could see him waiting outside of the keep and we became friends , formed a guild , and we still play WoW together ; however , the guild does n't exist anymore : (",Balto-Slavic,Russian

3dom,EliteDangerous,I got similar feeling .

Right now project cost more to maintain than it bring back - because it does n't have enough attention due to low funds : it literally can be interesting only as a form of fund with big sum in it . Project in question is http : //moredoge.com/ It is a `` dice '' / casino site which work for ~1.5 months already . I did n't advertise the site anywhere but in couple niche sub-reddits , site got handful of players , replies were mostly positive : http : //www.reddit.com/r/dogebetting/comments/2ftmhe/moredogecom_shibefriendly_dice_site_with/ Advertisement was so humble because I wanted to see reaction and behavior of players , real level of profitability compared to investments and advertisement expenses + there is n't enough prize funds for `` full-scale '' advertisement campaign in dedicated gambling communities . However during this period site was tested and developed further ( jackpot , partial jackpot , chat , affiliate program ) , and now it is stable , protected from DDoS attacks ( there were couple already ) and use HTTPS protocol ( premium CloudFlare account ) . Site is somewhat pleasurable to use and there were some really interesting visitors / players who bet up to 50k doges per single bet on other sites - for example J_Roc - but they left since bankroll was only 500k ( +1M in jackpot ) and bank could n't afford bets above ~500 doges ( I 've artificially lowered maximum income per bet by x2 factor to protect investment of my only present investor ) . So income from the site is only around 10k doges , but that 's approximately 50 % of all deposits players made during this month so you can get a clue - how profitable it could be ? Site has transparent statistic and investment information ( links are on interface ) + top losses and winning series and bets ( I 'll add weekly/monthly statistic - besides hourly stats - when more data will be available ) . As you probably know similar sites have hundreds of millions and billions doges in prize funds - but for this project it could be nice to offer to players at least $ 1-2 income per bet so I 'm looking for ~5 millions dogecoins ( 4M to go ) in bankroll before starting advertisement in dedicated gambling communities and on bigger cryptocurrency forums such as bitcointalk.org . Income shares planned as 60/30/10 between investors/jackpot/developer . Unlike on sites with huge bankrolls on MoreDoge.com you can get substantial part of income with relatively small sums ( for example 4M would yield ~50 % of total income - compared to ~1.5 % for a site with 250M bankroll ) .

Some things i like , some i hate , but this is n't about that . I am kinda asking myself ( and you i guess ) , is it worth playing now ?

So my question to you is , should i stick with it now or not ? And also , what 's up with people not defending cities anymore ? There were 2 Horde raids on IF and people were just standing at AH till they killed the auctioneers , and then just jumped around the attacking players while they cleaned the rest of the city .

She said how they processed around 3000something of them yesterday and how there was less that 200 women and children among them . Those women and children where the first ones to be put onto the train , but as soon as the men got in , they started hitting the women that were sitting down and kicking them out into the hallway . She also said that they threw all the clothes and food out of the windows and even had some of them say how they do n't need our old clothes , the things they threw away were picked up by the locals and the gypsies . She also mentioned that they had some 50 year old guy that got heart attack , and that when the medics came and took his shirt off , they found thousands of euros tapped onto his body . In conclusion she noted that the only normal ones that behave like humans were Syrians , which ironically are the ones they encounter the least .

12084182,relationships,"This is so true . The weirdest thing in this whole situation , when the first big conversation happened , we discussed a lot of things , like me not really wanting kids but liking the idea of adoption . I think that bothered him in the end more than anything because he still brings it up and asks me to consider having my own kids . Anyway , my sister went for a job interview in a neighboring country , took her kids ( 7,8 ) and fell in love with a guy working for the company , they plan on getting married . My dad was so shocked . My other sister is dating a guy 10 years younger and he 's all tattooed up and in piercings . So he goes to me 'you know my friend Brian ? He got divorced , found himself a young girl and got two kids now he 's running around after them . He looks 10 years younger , says he has a purpose for life now , something to fight for . Maybe I should find myself a young girl and get a little kiddo ' ( although my parents are married , their marriage is really weird and strained and they almost divorced a dozen times but ended up just not doing it , they do n't really do anything together much anymore except family meals and him occasionally visiting to see how she is or staying at the house , but in a different bedroom . They both claim the other snores too much ) That hurt , on such a huge level . You were n't there for me , but want a kid to be there for and fight for ? It honestly was n't the first thing that popped into my head since dad told me that my sister 's getting married and I Was like , what ? Since when ? and to whom ? And then I was like , well , you 're 70 , so if that kids in high school when you die , what then ? or the age factor , you 're 70 'well at least he had a dad that loved him , that 'll always stay with him , kids love their parents no matter who they are or how old they are , I probably ca n't have kids , but if I did , I 'm sure it would n't judge me for my age ' . And then I felt shit because he was n't there for me and said that but I kept quiet cause he was like 'well if your sister gets to get married on a whim , the other one dates a guy 10 years younger with tattoos , and you do n't want kids , just to adopt and might marry a girl , then I think it 's fair I can want to have kids of my own , it 's been 10 years since I had any sexual relations ( note the viagra I spotted on his bedside table in a bag full of meds , possibly telling me otherwise , did he find someone already ? and just wants approval ? ) and it would be nice if I could have someone ... How unfair would that be on mom who 's sick and suffering ? Every time she knows he 's coming over , she insists on some blue ring he got her and does little things she normally would n't . To me it 's clear she still cares and wants something . I do n't think he does . Also , my oldest sister might be a half-sister . Wow . Interesting news from my middle sister , who says that 's why dads so panicked about neither of us wanting kids of our own cause those might not be his real grandkids . Sorry for the long ass rant . my mom started yelling at me earlier for forcing her to go get something rather than me get it for her ( we 're trying to get her to be active and not become a statue , her left hand has lost mobility because she refuses to use it , and she just watches tv all day , so I told her to get the item herself , it 's short , and she has n't been on her nightly walks in 2 days anyway because of rain so it 'll be exercise even though I would n't call it that as it 's 5 steps to the item and then 20 to bed ) . Anyway , she started yelling I 'm an idiot , over and over and I just lost it . I asked was I an idiot for trying to help her get back into shape ? Yes , apparently . Then I said I should just kill myself since I 'm that much of an idiot . she agreed and I said I was heading to the balcony and did , and when she said 'go for it ' I just lost it and almost jumped . Sorry for dumping this here but I had nowhere to put all this and I 've had the worst past 2 years of my life and all this shit piling on just makes it so hard to keep going . After not being able to do it , I sat and cried on the balcony and she came 10 minutes later crying herself , asking for an apology . Saying I do n't know how hard it is for her . A year ago I had a car wreck and spinal fusion . I could n't move my arms even an inch in any direction at first . Could n't move my head . It was painful and all the physiotherapy was a nightmare . I hated it , I wanted to yell at them and tell them to stop and that I could n't do it . But had I let that happen , I would almost be a statue right now .

12084182,AskReddit,"That post itself might very well not be real ( as most things on the internet are n't , and we should all be cautious ) . But things like that do exist out there . You 'd be amazed at what is real and people think it 's just there to be gore for us . That movie , where the girls go on a trip and take a random ride in a bus to their hotel thinking it 's an airport bus and one of them ends up on a shipping container with a cat litter box and stuff . That movie is actually pretty spot on with what happens . When I was younger I was approached by someone late at night ( I was like 14 coming home from a night out ) and I later found out that they were a convicted sex trafficker trying to get me to go with them . It fueled my anger towards how little is done to help sex trafficking victims . As a college student I did a research paper on sex-trafficking and slaves because it bothered me so much how little people knew about it and I wanted to shock my class with the facts . Girls as young as under 10 get kidnapped . They are promised jobs like working in a carpet factory . Family agrees because they do n't have money or is n't aware it 's happening as the children just walk off with strangers claiming to know their family . Sometimes girls just get kidnapped as I almost did ( guy tried to bribe me with his private plane and mansion , I did n't buy it , he then tried proposing to me and telling me he loved me ) and are sent off . Girls are forced to have sex ( in some cases ) with at least 30 men a day . Does n't matter if you 're on your period , do n't feel well , are in too much pain from the last client or anything for that matter , you do it . If you do n't have sex with at least 30 men you get punished . All girls are drugged so they are numb and keep needing more drugs so they do what they are told and are too fucked up to try and escape . You want to escape ? You get punished if you get found out . One girl had her teeth knocked out . another got pregnant at 12 and when she managed to escape and get home , her family ostracized her and did n't believe her and said she put it on herself , then her 'uncle ' said he 'd offer her a better life and a job and ended up sending her right back into the sex industry she just barely got out of . If you 've been in there long enough , and are not useful to them anymore Stockholm syndrome kinda happens . They offer you money and all the latest fashion and a nice car and place , in exchange you recruit new girls ( and yes , girls do this , it 's either getting a new life with nice things or fucking 30 guys a day , so of course you 'd rather recruit new girls . You 're so numb and drugged at this point that you do n't care , anything that takes you away from the day in day out of fucking is better ) . So these women , go out there , act as role models for girls from shitty countries in Eastern Europe or some Asian place or anywhere this is rampant and these girls think 'ooh , I could be like her , I can get a job and have nice things and look how confident she is , she 's happy with her life , I can get away from this shitty life where my family sucks and is poor ' . Then they get sold off to the highest bidder . You could end up in someone 's basement as a slave , or go work in a brothel . Making friends with a brothel worker ? Nope , boss does n't like that , he 's selling you off to another brothel . He does n't want to see you possibly happy or making friends with a worker . New boss finds out that you were being sneaky at last brothel and insists your new sex limit is at least 50 guys a day or punishment . Why do people encourage this ? It 's cheap . Taxi workers can take an hour off of work and not lose much because it 's so cheap to get sex . Some people like that they get young girls , too young to get anywhere else . Others like the fact that they might not speak their language . Or that they can do what they please because they have the money . Or because it 's risky and illegal . It 's disgusting is what that is and I really hope that something gets done about it . I 'm apparently from ( well , grew up in ) the country with one of the highest sex trafficking rates in Europe . It disgusts me how this is capable of happening . And my class was flabbergasted when I brought up the statistics and directly quoted our country as one with a high problem . People turn a blind eye too easily to problems around us and refuse to believe that things are real and happening .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"Not the OP but just some points of view to consider . My parents are pretty controlling , they constantly badger us about everything . Even when I still lived with them and my older sisters would come visit , mom would be like 'where are you going ? Who with ? When will you be home ? ' Apparently they were a lot worse before I was born . My oldest sister wanted to be a makeup artist , she got accepted into a top make-up school in England , and dad wanted her to live her dream , and she wrote to them I guess because she was away from home , in a new environment and was n't used to this lifestyle and confided in them that some students were using drugs like cocaine and she was n't sure how to handle it . Instead of just telling her to avoid that crowd and stick to her guns , they freaked out , pulled her out and killed her dream . She went into I hate you mode and started doing things to piss them off ( I think she even got into heavy drugs after that ) because they were n't being the support she needed but just ruining things . I was raised partly like an only child as my sisters are both well over 10 years my senior . My middle sister did spend some time around me , but not a whole lot as she lived abroad for most of it . They raised me like an audiobook on repeat , I was an annoying parrot around people 'you should n't smoke ' 'you should n't swear ' you should n't this or that , I criticized my older sister all the time for smoking pot and pretty much gave her an ultimatum at one point because I thought she did n't care for me if she chose drugs over what we had . Yeah ... .. I started hanging around a different crowd , who pretty much made me realize that I need to be more open minded , more accepting , less of a bigot and I also started not believing in religion as much as I did before . I was never overly religious but I was raised with a God and suddenly started seeing things differently . I also hated how strict my mom was . I 'd have to be in bed by a certain hour , the computer got moved downstairs so I ca n't be on it when it 's 'bed ' time . I couldnt ' stay out late , no matter how late my friends parents let them stay out , moms rules were different and I had to abide by them . I started resenting them . I could never tell them anything without worrying they would freak out . I rebelled the way I did ( although not to the extreme of OP 's child ) because I could , because I was angry . Because I hated being caged . And because curiosity . I realized I wanted to try everything and anything even if it did n't seem like I 'd like it , just to know what it 's like and how I feel about it . I know several people who had strict parents who tried to smother them and were over protective and did n't want to lose their kid , so they 'd monitor everything they did and the kids hated it and would act out because of that . And some people just go off for no reason . Knew a girl that was really bright and a really nice , quiet , good girl . Started doing modeling . Started dating a guy , started doing drugs to keep her body right or whatever . She was best friends with a friend of mine and I had met her on a few occasions . One day my friend told me that she got an ultimatum from her that she could n't hang with her unless she was n't a virgin anymore , and offered a friend of her boyfriends to have sex with her . What the fuck ? It was so unlike her , she had changed and turned into this whole other person and if you were n't into sex and drugs , you were n't welcome . So just someone else 's perspective from what I 've seen , or experienced . I 'd like to see myself ( if I ever have kids ) as an open parent . Growing up I 've seen parents that were very open with their kids and the kids treated them like best friends . I want to have that with my kid . Even if it means he 'll do things I might not agree with , at least I 'll know what they 're doing and where so I can act accordingly if something goes wrong and know how to help them out , and if there are parents that are strict or kids feel they ca n't reach out to them , I can be the parent they can talk to and then I wont feel like they are suffering or I can help talk to their parents if they feel they ca n't do it themselves .

Then the big day came , and it was just a show of how years of touring turns you into something you might not have wanted . We stuck tape in arrow shapes all over the floor so that Deryck would know where to go to get to the green room ( where the band stays ) .

Then the show happened , Deryck brought girls on stage to dance , quite a few of them and they jumped around and he was drunk happy and then it ended and fans are waiting for them to come back on and they are off the stage now , taking time for the chant to kick in , and Stevo just looked so dead , like he was tired of it all , of Deryck acting like a teenager still , drunk on stage with girls and wishing things were different .

12084182,sociopath,"1 . None of that , just people that are either fucked emotionally or some other way damaged and drugs help them get by or abuse them for the fun they bring . 2 . ASPD is characterized by lack of empathy , whereas killing for drugs , does n't mean you lack empathy , it just means the hold the drugs have on you is so strong you 'd consider going to extreme measures . These people before the drugs were otherwise normal people for the most part , whereas the drug changed them into completely different people . Not everyone can change with sobriety but some people do . 3 . They become substance abusers because it 's a change from the norm , it 's fun , it 's a way to kill the boredom which we suffer . 4 . Boredom , living on the edge , all of that basically describes me . I do n't know if I 'd be immune , I do feel the addiction and I feel the withdrawal symptoms but I 'm fairly strong willed and I just tolerate it . Like if I do some h and then start to feel the nauseous , and get the shivers or whatever , I just plow through if I do n't feel like doing more or do n't have any . I do n't necessarily do one drug over another , it all depends on my mood and I tend to abuse whatever I can get a hold of . New Year 's for example , hung out with some people , we did coke , ritalin oxy , dilaudid , various benzos , DMT and weed . Just went at it all night , alternating lines or whatever and ended the night ( or rather morning ) with DMT at sunrise and tripped out .

12084182,sociopath,"Ritalin , various bezons ( xanax , valium , etc . ) , had dilaudid and oxy for a while . Ritalin is pretty simple , as with any other ADD medication . Benzos , just need a good trauma story and stress . One way to do it is fake social anxiety , make it extreme , like you ca n't even order pizza on the phone without panicking , and then add on a trauma that amplifies the need for meds like that . Example , death in family , discovering long lost relatives , etc , have to deal with people because of it , and you ca n't deal with people . Oxy/dilaudid , had an actual injury and surgery , but after that just maintained how painful it all was , and convinced them to prescribe more . Also helps if you have a good family doctor that knows you , and then out of the blue , without abusing them and going to them for only legitimate reasons , you show up , they recognize you , and then trust you to prescribe something with minimal backstory because they know you and you do n't come off as the abusive type . Also easy if for example , you fake an injury , ( buy plaster of paris online and make a fake cast or any other injury item such as neck brace ) , and then tell them that the pain is bad and you owe the hospital lots of money ( if you do n't have insurance ) and that they would n't see you because of that and need meds . Or that they are your family doctor and you 'd rather see them from thereon out , you trusted the surgeon to do the important stuff when it happened but would now rather see your doctor , etc .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Thank you for this , it 's really opened things up for me . And as for the him part , my best friend is going to talk to him , they 're sorta friends too , so the moment I said he pissed me off , he was upset and asked what happened . At the time I thought I was over it , or trying too be anyway so just told him I had a meltdown but I 'm over it . He got pissed off and said he 'd kill him and made me tell him what happened and said he 'd talk to him . And that if he were me , he would n't be friends with him anymore so we 'll see what he says to him and how Rick reacts . I also sent him an email of what I might say to Rick ( the dick ) if I were to say anything at all and see how it goes . I liked what another poster said how I should let him know that although he is entitled to his opinion ( so he does n't just feel like I 'm attacking him and refuses to listen ) that he should understand what I went through and try and see why I reacted the way I did and realize how he affected me .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Yeah , but he also did n't say sorry or act like what he said had any effect on me . He asked if I was okay , but the moment I said yeah , and before I had a chance to think of something else to say , because okay is just a standard reaction and I really was n't , he just went on and on about something else like it was n't a big deal . I did n't want to fuck up the mood further , so I wanted to say something to let him know what he did was n't okay but I 'd let it go , but never got the chance to . But thanks for that response , it kind of made me realize what other people in the other sub that I posed to were trying to say , but they made it sound as if he was stating his opinion and I was wrong for feeling how I felt so I deleted my post because the negativity was getting to me .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Oh he is arrogant as fuck ! ! ! Sadly , my hometown , is pretty dead in terms of people to hang with . Most foreigners like myself who went to high school here , tend to leave for college elsewhere after as it 's a small place and the only good schools are private schools . They also usually do n't come back . The friends I do have here are in a different city as I went to college there . And it 's 2 hours away , and even some of those left for masters abroad . My best friend and our mutual best friend who 's family friends with Rick , who were in the city I studied in , suggested I hang with him for lack of things to do since he 's from my city so that 's how I ended up hanging with him . I decided before coming home this summer after studying abroad that I would eliminate all the people I know here as they are n't really good friends , just people to kill time with , and I hang with them for lack of options . I thought , better having no friends than friends that do n't help you grow as a person . ( I also have social phobia due to depression and just cling to whoever I can because I do n't have skills to meet new people or do something about my life ) So I ended up hanging with Rick and was not expecting that to happen . He 's arrogant but at least we do fun things and I can usually look past it . So without him , I do n't have a lot of people to hang with . I like some of his friends , they 're actually nice for a change , but I do n't want to make it weird if I ask them to hang out but then not include him . I think they 're tired of him too , like Dave who hangs with us , I can tell he 's always irritated with his arrogance . Case in point , the other night we were at this tabletop/board game bar , and we hung out there , played some new game , and as it was nearing the end Rick was n't bothered to put effort since clearly he was losing , and started playing a guitar laying around . Then when the game ended , and we were gon na tally up who won , he just got up and started picking out what game we should play next . He always acts like he 's in charge and it pisses me off . We all got annoyed and I called him out on it and said how we are here as a team and to have fun , not to compete and get pissy if we lose . And that he should sit and find out who won . Finally he sat down grudgingly and his other friend at one point said he was glad that for once he was n't the only one calling him out on his actions . I straight up tell him how I feel , just being honest . Even though I 've only hung out with Dave 5-6 times , I 'm thinking of messaging him since he stood up for me , or rather my point of view , and saw Rick being an asshole , and tell him that I 'm considering cutting ties with Rick or giving it some time and waiting for an apology . I feel he 'd understand ( in case he wonders why I 'm not coming out anymore ) and that maybe he 'd offer to hang without Rick . But even though I know he 's tired of him too , they go to the gym together with another friend and hang often so maybe he 'd feel weird about it . I think he 's a cool person , but I do n't want to make things weird between Rick and him since they 've been friends for years vs. me just meeting him . I hate being depressed and having social anxiety . Makes having friends so much harder . I cling to people even if they 're bad for me because I have no one else . Tried changing that and found out the one friend I did have turned out to be an ass . So now I 'm stuck with either repairing that or being friendless until I figure out a way to make new friends . He also acts like he knows it all half the time and just has this pompous thing about him , I hate people like that . Ahh .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I hated it there , but at least I was able to go to classes and come home without much hassle .

Like if I had to talk to someone in an office , I dreaded that , so I 'd have her go with me to make it easier . I ended up switching degrees a year later , and although I never finished that one , I got closer to doing something I liked . I met some awesome people and they made socializing a lot easier and the anxieties started to fade . A year before graduation , I transferred yet again , but to a different country and a better university , and I can safely say most of my anxiety is gone .

12084182,relationships,"It 's not like it was all convenience . But I ca n't say for certain that I loved him . I might have been clouded by the way I felt at that point in time . When I met him there was someone else I was n't over , and we met under the pretense that I was kinda in a relationship ( despite not being in one , it was easier to say that I was since the feelings ) , and then he asked me about it one day and said that he 'd like me to be his gf . Meanwhile I went out with some other guy ( who I thought understood I was looking for friends and acted like he was too ) and the whole time I wondered what my ex was up to and started thinking about all the fun we could be having , and then it became clear I was on a date , and I did n't like it at all , but I realized that I liked my ex since he was on my mind and not the guy I was trying to get over . I do n't know if I ever saw a future together , like us starting a family and marriage . I remember the first time I saw his house , my brain instantly tried to picture us there because we 're in a relationship so naturally down the line , stuff might happen . It was weird , I realized he was n't my usual type , but I guess a part of me kinda saw something . But not a whole lot I guess , cause we had different ideas about future stuff . I guess it was convenient because it was a distraction from other things , but that feels so bad to say .

He offered cheaper rent , and made me feel bad for not wanting to move in with him . 'Do you not love me enough ? Is that it ? Your mom is suffering , your dad has to pay for her surgery and recovery and you want to move into an apartment when you can stay with me for a lot less than any place around here offers ' etc ... he said I could get a car instead of paying for rent and just make monthly payments , which seemed like a good idea at the time I suppose . I 'm weak and he made me feel bad and I did n't know how to face him . I know that 's my fault , no one else ' .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"Close to the start . We were hanging out every day , and it was cool and I had fun , and then it started being weird . I 'd go to hang with my friends and he 'd seem like it 's weird that I do n't include him . I did some of the time , but like if it 's a study group right after class , then we 're just gon na chill , go over homework and test work and I do n't see why he needs to be there . He got all weird that day , but my friends hinted at liking him so I called him to come and bring us pizza , and he was over in a flash , despite being with his friends . Ever since it 's like I never had any time to myself , he 'd just feel weird why I need time to myself , why I need to browse the internet without him behind me watching . It 's not that I need to or have something to hide it 's just that it felt weird , he felt possessive with all of that . He wanted to get me a car not even two months in , like maybe not even a month in , my sister came down to visit for a day , and I spent it with her , get home to my apartment to find a gift on the bed , a watch he knew I had wanted . Okay , it 's cool , you got me something I wanted and paid attention to me . But wanting to get me a car that 's like 4-5k and then have me move in with you so fast is weird . I was going home to the summer and looking forward to spending it with my friends , then one night my friend drunkenly messages me for a threesome and he flips out . The next day he wanted to leave and never come back , leave his whole life behind , house and education included . I prove to him through my previous conversations with said friend that there 's no history between us , nothing . And the message was something out of the blue too , like 'oh btw , do you mind if a girl joins us in our whatever ' so it was hinting to something already arranged . He did n't trust me going home and surprised me with a ticket to see me and I had planned on breaking up with him when I was gone as I thought it would be easier . Him wasting more money on me made it harder . I had to tell my parents that I had a boyfriend and he was coming over , huge shock . I kept trying to make it work , to want it to work but it was just hard with everything he was doing . I lost my friend cause he would n't hear of him , even when the guy added him and sent him a message and said 'sorry man , it was my honest mistake , we 're good friends I do n't want to loser her , I 'm glad she 's found someone finally and I 'd like to get t know you and we can all be friends ' That just angered him more and he threatened to be violent if he saw him . We went to spend Christmas with his family and unbeknownst to me he planned on proposing to me in front of his family but for once he thought about how that would make me feel and realized that I would n't be into that . He only told me after the break-up when he had a breakdown and hoped that knowing that would make me change my mind about the situation . I 'm not the kind of person to get married 6 months into the relationship . Or move in 5 months later . It was all too rushed and stuff . We did n't have much in common either , he was happy to do anything I wanted to but I knew he would n't be into it entirely , he 'd just be doing it because he 'll do anything to make me happy . I do n't want that , I want to meet someone that actually has stuff in common with me and enjoys it in full . I liked all the same things he did , but as I 'm a diverse person whereas he 's narrow minded with interests , that became a problem over time .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll definitely do that . Once I move out I 'll stop answering to his parents or anyone , I 've been on his computer , removed my facebook messages or history so he ca n't link to my account , and will block him once I move out ( right now have his sister added so do n't want to stir something up by blocking him early ) then hope he does n't ask her for my link though I will block her too . and then not talk to them and his parents . they 'll hate me but hopefully understand over time . I have to do this once I 'm out already so that they do n't come looking for me . I 'll definitely write out the amount and stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I 'll just put it in an envelope under his door .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll pay him back somehow . I know that if I request him to not talk to me again , he 'd ( grudgingly ) do it because it 's what I want .

12084182,sociopath,"First rule of the sub : No asking if you are a socio-path , psychopath , or have ASPD . It takes a detailed patient history , psych evaluation , evidence , and in the end , you do n't truly want this despite popular culture . With that being said , I have to kinda agree with other posters , you might have some ASPD traits , but you 're not necessarily a sociopath . and there might be a bit of narcissism in there too , but I do n't think that 's the main issue at hand .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"I assume that with me it was trauma , although I ca n't be sure . My mom has bi-polar and narcissism . Two really annoying traits . Supposedly she also used to steal regularly , like a kleptomaniac , but I do n't think she 's a sociopath so I would n't say it 's inherited . When I was a kid , my parents were never around much , I had a lot of other people taking care of me . Kids always picked on me for being different and I guess that 's why I take pleasure now in seeing people suffer , it 's like payback , now I have the power they had over me . I hate my parents with a passion sometimes , I remember being the last kid to be picked up in school cause mom was at work still , and later on I had someone else pick me up every day . My parents raised me to be self sufficient , from age 10 I flew by myself on most flights if I knew where I was going ( to meet up with my parents ) . I lived with my cousins for a year once when I was 7 . Yeah , they were n't really there much ... I was alone a lot . They were also fairly materialistic , and possibly treating everything like an object is something I 've taken from them . And I think all this hate for all of that made me who I am today . My mom tells stories of me as a kid which to her are 'cute ' but to me sound creepy now knowing what I am . 'what will you do if I die ? ' ( who asks their kid that anyway ? ) 'I 'll just go travel the world with daddy ... or the maid will take care of me ' nonchalantly like I wont be bothered that my moms gon na die . Yeah , I never cared much . Supposedly I never cried as a kid until I saw my cousins getting all the attention in the world when they cried so I did it too for the attention . I also was never too fond of physical affection , like where my family 's from , it 's very common to greet someone and cheek kiss them or hug them , and I was always kinda cold in that regard ( why is that necessary ? ) and I remember my dad asking my mom if something was wrong with me cause I do n't like being around people that much ... . Meh ... I feel like the signs were there when I was really little but nothing concrete materialized until later . I remember when I was picked on , I was so tired of it that one day I told my sister that this girl that picks on me picked up a desk and tried to throw it at me .

I get to the airport , and they 're like , 'your flight has been cancelled , there 's a new flight leaving tomorrow , here 's a hotel pass and a food coupon ' Umm , what about my connecting flights ? 'are they on Norwegian too ? ' nope ... 'good luck ' . So I fly to Norway , needed to get a room cause my flight was literally an hour after I land from the first one , so it fell through , stayed in Norway for 3 days . Most expensive place on the whole fucking planet . Found a hostel , HOSTEL ! ! ! 8 people in the room . 50 $ for a night . I spent 25 bucks in the supermarket to make basic sandwiches and drink water . Fly out to Milan , cause my original flight plan , does n't happen again for another week , so at Milan , again stayed in a hotel overnight . Thankfully Milan was cheaper and I had my own hotel room with TV and fancy bathroom for the same price as the hostel . It was 20 mins from the airport too , got a free ride from the hotel .

Apparently , they thought it was fake . I did n't even get to the stall to get my ticket , and the security guy just signaled us to go somewhere . They take me to a room where police start asking random ridiculous questions , like picking through my passport and challenging me if I knew where I was on certain dates . And then insisted I go to an ATM and verify that I can withdraw money from my card and prove that it works and it 's not a dummy card or I 'm carding , or some shit . They even called the Irish embassy that told them my passport was valid and fine . Do n't get a refund , do n't get to fly , they were still confused but let us go finally . We end up flying into Ireland , talk to a lawyer , and he 's like , your passport should be fine , my mom flew to the States recently on a passport just like yours , the type of passport should n't matter . I could n't get a new passport issued there because I do n't live there currently so we just flew from Dublin to NY and flew just fine , no issues with Aerlingus . Blah .

12084182,ipod,"I 've always had a Zune , I do n't know why but they always worked for me . Recently my Zune died and I figured since I want more space anyway and somehow possibly iPod 's are better ( and the Zune was discontinued ) I 'm better off with an iPod . I 'm getting pretty frustrated with it . For starters , Zune knows how to organize a library , it can detect the same artists from similar files whereas the iPod ca n't . For example , The Band and The Band , are according to the iPod a different band , even though they have the same name . Or The Band vs The band or the band or just band . It ca n't seem to tell that it 's the same thing . Also , Zune categorizes things by album artist , so if there 's a song The Band Feat . The The , it knows that the main artist due to the album artist field is The Band and sorts it accordingly , that way I do n't have a ton of compilation songs all under separate names . Another thing , I recently added a lot of random music from an old HDD , now the iPod sorted it into the library but gives me no option of seeing what was recently added . With the Zune however , I can see recently added artists and add them accordingly . With iTunes , I have to go through all my files to find the new ones and add them ( and I have over 200GB of music ) . I decided to double check all the name fields so it sorts it under one , make all mixed files sorted by genre so I do n't have to look for a ton of files at once but add by genre , but iTunes did not decide to update all this ( I did it externally ) and even when I reloaded it , it refused to update the files . What can I do ? EDIT : My library is not set to auto sync as I have two computers and originally used one to add music , but then found songs on the other one and added them manually , and that 's where this problem comes in . I ca n't sync automatically on this computer without erasing all music .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

We go to pay with the finance manager for the second car , and it turns out to be more than we expected , about 100 $ more , and we were quite irritated . We even picked the minimum for the protection plan . We go home and he starts to calculate everything , we need to come up with 2,000 in a week . We paid 1,000 , but were told we can pay the 2,000 in no later than a week . That 's what started to screw us over . We then call his parents who currently pay for his insurance , and who are in South Carolina , they say that they ca n't pay anymore , it 's too much now with 2 more cars to be added , and complicates things . We ca n't find insurance under 300 $ per month , that 's too much for us . We go back to the dealership the next day , tell them we ca n't afford the insurance , and we got screwed over by a 100 $ ( not to mention that I spent 7+ hours at the dealership the previous day ) and they say they 'll work something out for us . We said we 'd like to return the one car , cause we really ca n't afford to struggle with the payments . They give us some papers to sign for insurance , and stupidly we did n't read them through , just assumed they were paying for us , but nope , they got us insurance for a few days . The catch : We never expected his credit score to be high enough to even get the car , neither did the salesperson . My boyfriend makes car and house payments each month ( owns a house and car ) and other things . And they never asked to see proof of income , they mentioned needing it , but I guess his credit score covered it since he mentioned paying for those things . They asked what he does ( freelance work , sells stuff in his own time , not employed , full time student , as am I ) and that 's where they 're flawed , oh and not to mention that they let us out of there without us having insurance based in Florida . They said our only other option since they do n't have a return policy is to trade the car in as soon as the other payment gets cleared and get a cheaper car . Which we are definitely considering .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"This girl needed to pay her rent or get evicted , I offered to help if she signs a contract . I have a copy of her drivers license as well as a contract that says she has to pay me until a specific day , and she even said she 'd give me an extra 50 for it . I 'm just wondering , if that does n't go through , what can I do with this contract ? Who can I take it to ? She printed it off herself and I signed a copy and she has another copy . That was my spending money for the next month and she said I 'd have the money by the end of this one , and she 's a college student like me , so I took pity on her . A little background to my story . My parents are super strict and get angry for a lot of things . I scratched a guys car at my old campus due to having no way to park out without doing so , I did not know it was going to happen , but it did and I had to pay him 600 $ or get my insurance to pay in which case my parents would find out and get angry and take my car away from me . I got really lucky as a friend of mine found out by chance ( after me being harassed over the phone by this guy constantly , and my friend assumed he was an ex or something and told him to fuck off . He then found out I owed him and paid off my debt and I paid him back ) This month has been literally upside down for me with everything that could possibly go wrong , doing so . and also needing to spend money on things I did not account for and ending up broke . I started to panic as I could n't afford to buy credit for my phone . Verizon is stupid and I ca n't receive calls or texts without having credit , so no way for this girl to reach me , I emailed her and told her my phone was broken , as I did n't want her to find out I 'm broke because of her ( no idea why ) I got no response and found that odd . I searched online and everything led to going to court and it wont pay off and I 'll never get my money back , if I do n't , I 'll have no food for next month and there 's no way I 'm telling my parents I gave their money to a random stranger .

12084182,socialanxiety,"I hate dealing with people , facing them or anything of the sort . I never ask for help from teachers , always do things on my own . Which has become somewhat of a problem . My SA has improved somewhat over the years , but I still have big issues that I ca n't seem to overcome . I had problems with one of my projects but failed to talk to the teacher , I did n't show up for the final class where we discussed stuff as I had not much to show , I ended up doing it last minute and showed up for the presentation ( sort of like an exam day ) and something was n't right with the program , then I got home only to find out that I did n't do something right . I kept telling myself I 'd do it fast , then other stuff started piling on as it was my last exam so my parents decided to drop the bomb on their divorce as they thought my school stuff was over . And I do n't even know what happened , time flew so fast and it 's been 2-3 weeks since my exam , and I still have n't emailed the teacher and I hate myself for it cause I do n't know what to say to him . He saw me on the exam day and I told him I had issues and I 'd email him later and I never got round to it . My friend said to tell him the divorce had a huge effect on me and I could n't study or do anything , but I do n't wan na lie , I could find the time to work even though my mom is depressed as fuck lately and taking it out on me . I want to ask if there 's any way to resubmit for a regrading or something of the sort but I need to get it done asap and do that before it 's too late . I feel time is ticking so fast but I keep not having the motivation to do it . Maybe it 's cause I 'm all stressed and stuff in general all the time , my friend says I 'm clinically depressed with the way I go about things . I just think it 's my SA ruining my life as I ca n't do any normal things . I do n't think he realizes how bad it is . I could n't even call delivery before or walk into a store cause of this issue .

12084182,Health,"Ok , so I 'm partially deaf . Ca n't hear 80 % on my left ear . I have what is known as glue ear , the hammer , anvil and stirrup in my ear are glued together and therefore ca n't produce any vibrations which make sound . I went for surgery about 3 years ago when I was 19 , it was horrible , I had bad doctors , and turns out they did n't do anything . They were supposed to find out what kind of brace I need put in , but then they said they still did n't know and needed to do another surgery for that and then the final one . I told my parents I did n't want to do that again . They also just were unprofessional overall , being unprepared . Now we 're gon na see different doctors , I 'm actually gon na travel out of the country to get the surgery done . I do n't trust doctors here . So I 've got some questions .

Do you think it just becomes normal , because I suddenly have fluid or it takes time to adjust and I have to work on it ?

A chaotic reality which we try to understand and master so as to be able to control it , as well as ourselves . It is a hard job , but each and every one of us has to do it . We live in and live out the pattern that is laid down before us . Comment : We live in facebook . a social networking site where we try to understand what people are talking about when they post dumbass shit . its a hard job ignorin all these idiots that are on here especially when you cant control what they post , but to live in a world where we want to keep in touch with our loved ones we have to wade throught the sea of farmvillers , taggers and idiots that post t hings they think we care about . We do n't . you think you live in the Matrix , but the Matrix was full of robots and cool cyborg people . This is Facebook . Umm he plays games on there , tags people , and makes comments . I do n't play games , yeah I 've been doing a little too much Facebook lately , but it 's summer and I 'm bored staying over with cousins so I put statues up and song links . This was going to be my response , but I do n't want to make an enemy out of it , what do you think ? On your homepage you can remove who you see updates from . So you do n't have to see crap from me again ! : P And well when I post stuff , usually people comment on it , or like it or something so I get the impression people are interested in reading my shit . If they did n't do that then I 'd be stupid for adding more shit that no one likes or is interested in . Btw , from your profile , I can tell you 're worse than me , you tag people , same way I do , make status updates , and you play Facebook games that ( I do n't play ) that probably forces people to join something , or do something to help you out . Those personally annoy me , so I do n't do it . I do n't mind the status updates . So why complain on me when you 're no better ? Btw , if you 're bothered to go back a bit on my Facebook , you 'll see I barely use it , just now I 'm on much more cause it 's summer and I 'm bored at my cousins place and so this is where I end up at . - I hate Facebook ! I actually deleted my account a few times how annoyed and bored I got of it . But then I realized I had a few people I had no other way of staying in touch with , as sad as it is .

Why be so hypocritical ? -- -- I replied saying how he 's not any better , and asked what he meant by it , and he said he did n't direct it at me , that he was just making it as a remark in general , and we sorted things out . `` wasnt directed at u love , i liked it but i was makin a point that the world is run thru social network sites now , its sad really . just a joke tho : D an like i sed wasnt aimed at u x ''",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Paranormal,"I wanted to get some advice on this , I feel kinda weird about it but a couple of situations happened where beforehand I felt like something would happen . A premonition if you will . First time this happened was last summer , I was with my boyfriend at the time in some botanical garden , he saw a flower just randomly on it 's own by some mound and decided to go photograph it cause it was unique , anw , the point is that as he got on the soil ( which is not a firm surface and it was downhill ) I thought of offering him my hand back up as he might fall , I just pictured him slipping and falling . But then I thought , I know he wont take my hand , would I his in that situation ? He lost his grip and slipped . I was kinda shocked but did n't say a thing . About a month later , I was at a gas station pumping some air into my tires and suddenly it felt so weird like something bad was gon na happen , something felt so wrong and I pumped the tires just fine and thought , hmm , nothing wrong . Well just as I left the gas station , suddenly I hear a bang and my car broke down , some metal pipe that 's between the front tires broke . : O Again it was weird but I did n't think much about it and maybe a few weeks later I was driving down a road and noticed an odd taxi next to me and somehow I just pictured it looking through the side mirror and not seeing me due to the blind spot and just trying to switch to my lane and low and behold it happened , the driver tried to go to my lane and then suddenly saw me there and swerved back . That 's when I told people how odd it was that I felt something each time that happened . I forgot about that , and about a week ago I was up late chatting with my friend and at one point the light flickered , nothing out of the ordinary , lights do flicker right ? And it happened again later and I heard the a/c go off for a split second and thought to myself , tomorrow there will be no electricity , I bet it 's gon na run out . a little later my net went off completely , and it happened to my friend a bit earlier and I told him , somethings off , I 'm sure of it . I slept around 4am I think and I woke up to the lack of electricity , my room was boiling hot . But what I did n't know was how severe the issue was . I live in an island in Europe , and at a army base , well a naval base , some idiot decided that it 's ok to put containers full of ammunition in the sun , and those containers blew up from the pressure , and he just told army boys to spray them with water so they cool down . Of course they did n't and they were situated right next to a power generator which when they blew up , blew up as well . And now because of the lack of power , half the island ( it 's kinda small ) has only a few hours of electricity a day ( including me ) Anw , that really freaked me out and I reminded my friend of last years incidents and he thought it was a bit odd too cause I told him , there 's gon na be no electricity tomorrow . Anw , is this odd or just chance ? I just feel like I need to get in touch with a part of me that will help me channel what I 'm seeing/feeling and work on it . I first thought , well ok , I saw a taxi , I could have easily thought he might not see me cause it is possible , and it 's possible that my ex would fall cause he 's on unstable ground , and the light flickered , so maybe it 's a sign , but all the same I feel like there was a reason I felt something so strong . It just stood out . Anw , I 'm not sure if I believe in premonitions , since I 've watched far too much Charmed and I think that kinda got to me and I 'm just combining things in my environment , but I 'm open to things . I do believe in a lot of paranormal things , I 'm just not sure if I 'm really seeing things or it 's my mind putting two and two together . TLDR ; I predicted a couple of things to happen and am wondering what people think about it . Did I really have a premonition or is my mind just putting information from my surroundings together to form a vision .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Our university originally turned her down because she was 'overqualified ' . They could n't hire someone like that even if she was content with the low salary because it would look bad on their part why they would pay so little for someone who is that good at what they do .

So I detested him and never talked to him about projects or anything . Just kept to myself which he despised . If you talked to him , you were guaranteed a pass in the class .

12084182,Shoestring,"The concept is pretty simple : The traveler performs a service for a host in exchange for free accommodation . The service can be anything the two people agree on : from cooking lessons or massage to website design or house repairs . Likewise , the length of stay can be accordingly negotiated . Sometimes a service will require host ’ s presence ( in case of , lets say , personal coaching ) . Other times , the service can be delivered independently , such as website design . In such instances , it ’ s possible that the host will let you use his summerhouse for a week or two or maybe even their home without them actually being there . Whatever you two agree upon should be honored . We are here to provide a platform that will help you find a great opportunity and enable you to make a connection with your match , be it a host or a service provider . We are still in the early stages of project development , but are working hard to make it come to life . One of our main goals is to make this platform free for everyone . If that turns out to be impossible , and we are cornered into charging some kind of fee to cover our operating expenses , we will aim to make access fee as low as possible . We are determined , however , to grant our early adopters Premium Free Membership for life regardless of how much we may later decide to charge regular users . It 's for people that would love to travel and see new places but ca n't really afford to get a room . So you 'd just offer your skill set to a potential host and they 'd let you stay at theirs for free in exchange for helping them out with what you can offer . For example : I need someone to help me with this programming course I 've started . I ca n't seem to get a hang of it . You come along and I offer you to stay at mine in exchange for help with programming . You 've got a place to stay , food , and outings if we arrange it . It 's up to the host if they want to offer more than a place to stay and food/necessities . Discuss with them and find a suitable arrangement . Sure , you can teach programming online and get yourself a room in a hotel as you travel and work , but why not meet people along the way ? We think this is the best way to integrate into a local culture , be with locals !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

He said it was probably an experimental phase , I was trying things out when I was with a girl ( we did n't date , but we went all out ) and he thinks I was just feeling adventurous or whatever , but I like guys better . He said I 'm straight , cause I 'm with him , right ? So that must make me straight .

12084182,ElectricalEngineering,"I have some old Sony stereo speakers that I got and ended up in my car a few years back and have stayed there since . Now I want to use them to power my birthday party . A friend who dj 's suggested he 'd play music if we can figure out a sound setup and throw a party in the middle of the woods . So we have the speakers from my car which are n't too bad ( in terms of loudness ) , but they just have wires at the end , like the cable sticks out of the speaker , and at the end it splits off into two separate wires ( I 'm guessing power and ground ) and then they turn into left and right when they connect to the main power of the car that the door speakers connect to . But how can I turn that wire into something more useful ? And would a generator help ? I might have an amp of sorts at home , but I 'm not sure if it works , it 's just been laying around collecting dust , some Pioneer amp that 's been in this house since my parents got it . Let me know if that 's of use and I 'll find a way to see if it works . But the amp needs powering as well , so maybe it 's not necessary if I can just plug the speakers straight to a generator without needing one . Also how much noise would a generator cause ? The speakers are n't bad but if a generator makes noise that will be problematic since they 're not party speakers per se . I just figured woods would make everything louder , but with a generator ... But if it can be kept at a distance , like really long cables away from the speakers then it should n't be a problem . And if this is not the right sub , let me know , I had no idea where to post this . tl ; dr : Have some regular stereo system speakers I would like to power in the woods .

12084182,careerguidance,"Well there 's nothing really bad about the employers themselves . The office is wow in a weird way . It 's a call center based out of a house . Right now we 're by ourselves at the night shift . But the one guy that trained us , he was here for the first week and then left to train people in another office ( different country ) but he 's super chill , like jokes around on the phone with clients , smokes weed at work , I think ( more like know as another employee that has been there longer hinted at ) he does coke as well . Tells us to swim in the house pool any time we like as well . So it 's a very weird atmosphere . We fuck around a lot , like the guy that 's been there a while , he recently got back from being at their other office in the other country and said they fuck around a lot too and barely do any work , the company is a mess and when I told him how we signed contracts the other day , he was surprised saying until recently there were n't any contracts . Another guy worked for 6 months without a contract , cash payments only but left for personal reasons . We 're basically 800+5 % . But the contract I signed says after the 3 months 'probation ' which is basically training and us being 'outsourced ' workers , we go permanent , just the 5 % and we were told it 's because of the amount of people that do n't like call center work and quit . Which did happen , out of 10 of us , only 5 of us are on the team now . Thing is after the 3 months , contract states it 's just 5 % and I do n't like that , it 's going to take me longer than 3 months to get a solid client from cold calling and getting money out of him a while longer before he decides to invest bigger money . ( We do sports betting/handicapping ) For now I 'm sticking around for the salary . Now the guy that 's been there longer said that he 's not sticking around either if he has to sign on permanently , we 're slowly piecing together how much of a scam our company is ( product wise ) and the shit they pull for evasion of things and I just do n't like it that much . It took them 2 weeks to get our contracts , we got paid for the 2 weeks , then the guy said to not date the contracts so the lawyer can date them when she gets back from holiday . We feel she might not exist and it 's a contract for us to think there 's one so we ca n't do anything but they do n't have it signed so it 's not legal in case we do try to do anything . What do I tell a new employer ? Why would I be leaving such a job ? I like the people I work with , I like the chill atmosphere , we can dress however , do whatever , I just do n't think I can handle living off just the 5 % and if something happens to them as a company because of weird practices , it 's not good for me .

12084182,cyprus,"So I got a job at a call center . First three months I get salary+5 % which is n't really going to happen unless I 'm extremely lucky and get a customer to sign up .

Is that legal ? I had one co-worker tell me they worked for another place and were only paid 5 % so if this is standard practice , then I assume it 's legal , but I do know we have a minimum wage depending on industry and I ca n't imagine commission falling into that because what if you get no commission that month ? I understand why they do the first type of contract as I 've only been here 2 weeks and had 3 people quit within the second week ( first was training ) and so they do n't want to waste their time , but how can they not give us a salary after that ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,careeradvice,"So , my resume might make me out to be a bit flaky . I started one degree , a year in , transferred to another university ( the degree was really crappy , and the university too ) . The other one was better , but 3 years in I got accepted to a really good university in the States and moved there . I graduated . All 3 degrees were somewhat arts related , so nothing businesslike . The first one had a focus on advertising , but I never got to that , as the first year was very traditional arts based . I 've come to the conclusion ( long story , involving family , and me being fed up with my current situation , 26- jobless and stuck with family problems ) , that I 'd like to move out and just get any job . So I 'm trying to get into the forex/binary options/trading industry , whatever you call it . It 's huge in my country , so there 's constantly jobs available . Even though I possess a skill they always want : Languages ( I speak more than 3 fluently ) , I 'm not their ideal candidate . My social skills are not that great , and even though they hire just about anyone , ( you do n't need any skills for entry-level positions because they offer training ) , they want to see extroversion in a person . The last interview I went to , the lady asked some general questions , and even though I answered them the way she wanted , she was a bit stuck on how I have 3 artsy degrees and nothing on my resume related to their industry or business in general or customer service . I said I was looking for a long term job , but it did n't seem to help . I have a job listed on my CV , working in promotions , where I used to hand out product samples and interact with people , but I do n't think she cared for that . She pointed out how I worked as a lyricist for about 2 years , but when asked if I still do that , I said no . I regret not expounding on the interview . For lyricist I could have said that I did n't like the contract , which was true . My manager got 20 % of all profits and if I had any kind of job during that contract ( other than it ) , he got 20 % of my profits , even if the job continued when the contract expired ( what kind of bs is that ? who does that ? ) If she had known I quit not because I got bored and do that all the time , but because I was being treated unfairly , it would have been different , no ? Another thing I wish I had mentioned , though I 'm hoping you can tell me if my logic is sound , I have epilepsy that has only recently been discovered though I 've had it all my life ( a type that is n't easily noticeable ) and I might not be able to work in my field anyway if the doctors conclude that lights and sounds affect my health . So I wish when she had asked me 'what was your first job choice upon graduation , or what would you rather chose right now if given the chance ... ' that I had said I had epilepsy and could n't work in my field either way because of that , and am thus seeking work elsewhere without having to obtain another degree . Would that have helped reassure her I was n't a fight risk ? I 'm not sure how to land a job like that , since I do n't look like someone that would last long , but I really just want a job so I can move out and be on my own and not be surrounded by my toxic family .

The one saying remember , remember the 6th of December is referring to the [ Greek Riots of 2008 ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Greek_riots ) The Akamas ones are referring to a part of the Island called Akamas that 's very peaceful and beautiful . There 's no human pollution , how to say it , no destruction of nature . and because of it 's beauty , various greedy pigs want to come and make hotels there and destroy it . The other thing , it 's also known as a breeding ground for a certain type of turtle that comes there once a year to breed and lays eggs on the sand . And people come to watch and ruin that , so we have to go and protect the turtles so they can breed and keep their species going . Building hotels and tourist attractions there would ruin the chances for the turtles survival . So there 's a lot of green anarchists protesting to keep that area clear of greedy fucks . There 's also anarcha-feminists , hence the purple anarchy logo ! The one poster with the antifa flag is stating that there 's a documentary on refugees screening and discussion at a cafe . I also saw another thing while driving but did n't get to take a picture : `` it 's a class war '' written on a wall . And the last two images were just nice graffiti I saw on the way . Bonus : forgot to add pictures of [ some stickers on my car ! ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/adgEH )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskMen,"Basically , there 's a guy I used to have a crush on in high school . Some 10 years ago or so . We both went to this group math lessons place where a bunch of people would show up randomly . We only interacted twice , one time outside of class ( years later ) , but he did n't know who I was , so he definitely would n't now . Now I 'm back in my home town and have stumbled across his linkedin , and I 'd like to message him but I do n't want it to come off as weird . I looked him up in general after that and found another profile that hinted we have a lot in common . If anything , just to make a new friend since I do n't really have a lot here , they all moved off or are in a different city . But somehow I feel it might seem weird if I remember him and he does n't remember me , maybe it 'll weird him out , so I 'm asking other guys what they think would work in this situation ? How to message him and have him see it as a positive thing that someone remembers him and would like to make friends ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,MechanicAdvice,"I got some chains from a friend but I 'm not sure if they fit my car . Basically my front wheels are different from my back ones . They told me when I was replacing my last ones that it was fine as long as I was n't doing MOT anytime soon , they fit the car just fine . Front are : 155/80/13 back are : 175/70/13 but the chains box says : 155/13 ( which matches front , but it does n't have the middle digits listed so I 'm not sure how relevant those are or if it 's including anything in that category ) 165/70-13 175/65-13 185/60-13 195/55-13 There 's nothing that matches the back tires , so I 'm a bit lost . If front are fine , why would n't back be ? The rest listed on the box is 14 , 15 and numbers in the 300s , so I do n't think that matters ? if it does , let me know and I 'll add them . I just assumed the back ones were most important . EDIT : Also , box says : Group 40 , mm 12 . Whatever that means .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,techsupport,"Laptop , HP EliteBook 8760W A rundown of recent events : HDD crashed . Plugged another one in from a different laptop . I downloaded Windows to do a fresh install as that one had windows configured for the other laptop . Before I got to that though , the laptop suggested I do a free upgrade to Windows 10 . I accepted it and did n't realize that it had 32-bit architecture and that it would follow on to the Windows 10 installation without prompting me if I 'd like 64-bit instead . So I got 10 at 32-bit and it was sluggish so I downloaded the ISO for Windows 10 64-bit . Used some Microsoft tool for creating a bootable USB . Formatted the drive to install Windows on a blank drive without previous Windows on it . Now every time it preps Windows to install , it restarts and it gets stuck on the boot screen that says 'press esc to enter setup menu ' or whatever . If I do n't click esc right away the screen freezes and I ca n't click any button to get a response . I have no idea what to do at this point . In the installation menu for Windows it asks if I have a product key . I tried typing what came with the 32-bit windows ( going from what the properties of My Computer had displayed ) but I was missing 4 digits . So I chose 'I do n't have a product key ' thinking it 'd just know that I had Windows 10 and it was a free upgrade and register it for me . Should I find a key for it ? Would that make a difference ? I currently do not have access to any other computer other than a MacBook and I 'm not sure how helpful that is since it 's not Windows . I asked on the Microsoft support forums but all I got was 'we 're working on the issue . We 'll get back to you as soon as possible ' Like that 's of any use .

12084182,techsupport,"My main question is about Windows 10 . Here 's what happened , my laptop fell , HDD died and I just grabbed one from another laptop that was too slow for any use . Loaded it just to see if everything else was okay as hardware side seemed fine . It loaded fine , but I just needed to reinstall windows as it was set up for the other laptop with other drivers . Get the internet drivers , and basic drivers just so I can get a few things done as I did n't have time to reinstall Windows right away . Windows suggests I upgrade for free to 10 , I 've heard good stuff so figured it was worth a shot . And just did the upgrade while running Windows . It installed 32-bit as apparently the Windows 7 installation on that HDD was 32-bit and it kept the architecture and did n't ask me to chose . What can I do now ? I did n't think it would just default to what I had , and honestly forgot that it might have something other than 64-bit as I got so used to most modern computers being 64-bit . I tried resetting through settings , but it told me it had an error and could n't do it . Downloaded a windows upgrade installer , but I feel it 's going to do the same thing and just install 32-bit . Is my windows 7 activation code good if I just download a Windows 10 download , or would it require me to purchase a key for 10 ? 2 other hopefully simple questions . One , my trackpad has the scroll in reverse , so now I have to go up to scroll down and vice versa . Why ? How can I change this ? Two , my middle click button on the track bar is normally for open in new tab . It still does that but it also loads Cortana and I really do n't need Cortana to load every time I try to open something in a new tab . Can I change this as well ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I work a night shift and until recently tried getting my day sleep as my night sleep - 8 hours but found it hard to get a good nights sleep even after more than 8 hours sometimes . I found myself these past few days sleeping in two shifts . I come home , sleep for a few hours ( waking up naturally without an alarm clock ) , and then resume right before work for another few hours and just get up and go to work . But I do still wake up a little groggy in the afternoon and tired right before work but I manage to stay awake during my shift once I wake up and do n't feel sleepy , so I 'm taking this as a good thing , I get a few hours of wake time during the day where I can get stuff done .

12084182,relationships,"So our mom has been sick for some time now . Its gotten to the point that she 's in hospice care ( refuses a nursing home ) , and she pretty much does n't move from the bed . She gets up to eat and use the bathroom ( a porta chair/toilet next to her bed ) and that 's about it . No one knows how to talk to my one sister . She blames everyone for everything and is always angry and is on drugs as she claims it 's the only thing keeping her same . She until recently took care of anything mom related , paid the hospice women , organized doctors visits and anything else needed . I 've since taken over this role as dad has deemed her unstable and he thinks it 's brought her down too much . Anyway , mom has been given another 5 years to live and she will most likely not die from the Parkinson 's but from everything else , not moving and whatever else could happen as her brain is fine . But she does have at least 5 years in her and she 's a fighter . I recently planned a trip and my sister sees my status on facebook and messages me to hold off on buying tickets as our aunt is coming on the 12th ( september , I was planning on leaving 10th but with my aunt coming I planned on 13th so I get to see her but my sister wanted me to delay it further ) Then she drops the bomb that she 's planning a family reunion as a farewell for mom . What the fuck ? A farewell ? I told my other sister who is furious as to why we are having a farewell for mom when although she 's in a bad state , she 's far from dying . I ca n't wrap my head around this . My trip was perfectly planned to fit with a break in work , going back to the country I grew up in , need to get all new documents as my bag was stolen a while back so I 'm without passport , drivers license , etc . And I have a wedding to attend . I was willing to move the departure date a few days when aunt told me she was coming but I wo n't move it a week just so I can attend a farewell for mom . I think having a farewell is absurd . I 'm gon na call dad later and let him know what she 's planning and see how he feels about it . But I do n't know what to tell her . I feel like she 'll blow it way out of proportion and act like I do n't care for mom when I moved here 6 months ago to be close to her while she 's in care . But I do n't agree in a farewell so I need to find a way to approach the situation and explain how wrong I think it is . Tl ; Dr : mom has been given at least 5 years to live but sister is planning a farewell mid September for the family to get together . I think it 's absurd .

12084182,relationships,"Maybe I 'm overreacting but sometimes her attitude really grinds my gears and we 've had issues in the past over it , but I 'm trying to deal with it so we do n't have problems . I 've known her since high school . She 's always thought of herself highly and thought everyone likes her and so on . She 's also easily hurt and I 've made her cry in the past ( and I do n't think I 've ever made anyone else cry before ... ) She never really had any friends . I was her only friend in high school bar from one guy at her school ( we went to different schools ) Then we went our separate ways for college and just saw each other over holidays . But now we 're both living in the same city . She 's been here for 2 years , and does n't really have any friends , and I moved here 6 months ago . I found a group through Facebook that get together on a bi-weekly basis to play a board game I like . I invited her the first time because I did n't want to go alone as I do n't know anyone . We met 4-5 people that day and played some board games . The next few times I went alone as she was on holidays and more people came and it turns out it 's usually a bigger group , just that day it was a few people . I met the group and we all got to know each other . It 's been more than a month since she 's been and she was in town last time so I reminded her I was going ( so she does n't get hurt I did n't invite her if she realizes I went because that 's what would usually happen and she 'd start having self destructive thoughts ) . We walk in ( it 's a small neighborhood bar , really small , and just a place for regulars to chill and have a beer ) and her first reaction is `` HEY EVERYONE , REMEMBER ME ? '' I feel kinda awkward because we walked in to part of the bar and I know for a fact that she did n't know anyone there , and they looked at her like , no , who are you ? Then 2 people she knew came over and we did some introductions with the others . And decided to play games . We played cards against humanity because there were a lot of people and everyone knows the game . At some point people were engaging in discussion about something she does n't know anything about , and she was getting frustrated that a ) she ca n't participate in discussion because it 's a foreign topic to her , and she does n't like being silent , she has the need to always be talking or center of attention and b ) the game was n't being played . But we 're not there to just play games , we 're there to socialize and if we play games , great , if not , still great , we 're enjoying ourselves . She would be like 'ahem , so yeah , let 's continue with the game , we are playing are n't we ? ' Especially if it was her turn , she 'd be like 'so yeah , it 's my turn , and I 'm gon na read my cards now ... ' And one turn I pointed out how someone went for beer and we should wait for them to get back and she 's like 'OH , someone went for beer , so I ca n't read my cards , but when they get back , it 's my turn , so I 'll read my cards , and we 'll continue with the game ' really loudly . It just felt unnatural , and she left early and made it a point to say bye to everyone and loudly point out she was leaving more than once so everyone knew and make sure they remember her . So we 're texting when she left , and I said how I think the one guy liked her ( there were two were sitting together and talking most of the night , but the other guy definitely looked like he had it in for her ) , and she 's like 'yeah , I think they both liked me , they were into me ' She 's insecure so I tell her things like how someone might have liked her . I also compliment her without reason just because she 's like 'aww , thanks , really ? You think so ? ' to help her with her self-esteem . But then with things like this she gets this attitude ... All the guys liked me , I 'm sure of it ... I 'm so amazing and pretty , they ca n't help themselves . and I just hate that attitude that she just assumes everyone is into her and all that ... Maybe they are , hey , that 's not a bad thing ... but when people talk like that and say those things ... I hate that `` all attention to me everyone ! '' It 's fine and well that it 's her thing , I do n't want to change her , but when it affects the whole situation and gives her a lack of social awareness , then I have an issue because I 'm not enjoying myself anymore . Like if we 're all enjoying a discussion and having fun , laughing , whatever , you should n't just be like 'ahem , let 's play the game please . ' We 're all clearly in the mood to talk about something for a bit before continuing . It made her look weird cause she was n't fitting in with what was going on in the moment . I do n't really know anyone in this city and she 's pretty much my only friend , so I do n't exactly want to ditch her because she 's fine when we hang 1on1 or do something else , but it 's situations like these that make it weird . I like these people and would like to become friends outside of our bi-weekly game nights so I have more people in my friend pool . But I feel like she might make the game nights weird . If I do n't invite her to game night , she 's going to get hurt , but if I do , I 'm gon na get frustrated because she ca n't be in a social space where all the attention is not on her . It 's fine if you like attention , but save it for a club or some other environment . But if we 're all having a fine time and just talking , do n't ruin it by making everyone stare at you every second ... So I do n't know . Am I overreacting ? I feel like I should just ignore it and let it play itself out and hopefully she comes to her own conclusions but all the same , I feel awkward bringing her along if she 's gon na act like that and make things flow not as seamlessly as they would otherwise . Ideas ? -- - **tl ; dr** : So , in my opinion , I feel like my friend is really awkward in public and I feel like she does n't understand social cues . If I do n't invite her out , she 'll get hurt . If I do , she 'll make things weird for everyone ( or maybe it 's in my head ) .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,badroommates,"/x/post from /r/relationships since they thought it was more suited here . So I met my ex roommate Claire while she was in a tight spot and needed a place to crash fast . At the time I lived with my ex who was away for the summer teaching a camp and I was planning on moving out . I offered her a place to stay until she finds a place . Let the adventures begin . I had another girl staying with me who was to be my roommate once I moved out of my ex 's . In the meantime I end up in a car accident whiplashed and in a neck brace unable to even lift a glass of water . My to-be roommate decided it was too much for her and bailed . Claire seemed more than willing to help me with groceries , changing , and anything else because after the accident my hands could n't even go past my hips without it being too hard and painful . I was doped up 24/7 to kill the pain . We move in and I find out that Claire is one of the most disgusting people ever . Ex . Dishes never washed , to the point of mouldy food . Shower and shave and leave hairs in bathtub because she does n't know how to get rid of them . Her room was so gross with everything all over the floor ( and in general in the apartment ) . I 'd try and clean when I was a bit better but she 'd yell that I moved such and such item and lost it and now she does n't know where it is . Anyway , she was also BPD and would not stop leaving me alone . She 'd wake up and be like 'Hey , you awake ? ' I am now ... 'Great ! I 'm making breakfast ' 'Oh , where ya headed ? Can I come with ? What are you doing ? Can I join ? Oh I do n't mind that you 're just painting , I like to watch . Oh you want to read ... Oh , we can go to a park and read together ... Oh , I 'll watch that TV show with you even though it 's linear and I do n't know the history of the show or characters ... ' We were college students and my family was in Europe while I was an international student in the States so having family help out was complicated especially since they barely saved up to get me into this college , it 's good but affording rent too and all the other stuff post-accident was really complicated . So yeah . Also , Claire is bad with money . Ca n't make money for this or that . I 'm stuck . I ca n't be rude and have her starve , I 'm human , of course I care . But I also do n't have a backbone . So I bought food for the both of us . She got a job at Macy 's temporarily . Before she got fired she bought stuff like a TV for the apartment , which we did n't need . Among other things , like a GoPro for herself and some personal items for hobbies . Then she lost the job and could n't seem to land another one . We went to food banks all the time and she 'd get angry if I did n't have time to help her with her problems , like what kind of a friend am I ? What if I have my own life to live ? Like she broke her smartphone so she could n't have a phone with Uber . I was out with a friend . She calls me asking for an Uber since she got up late to get to work ( always woke up late and was bad with time management ) and got angry when I said I was busy ( it was a date , I thought it might be urgent ) , and could n't help her . Or she 'd bang on my door when she had a morning shift ( 1 hour ride to work , so up at 6-7 or something ) and she 'd bang on my door for the Uber when she was late and be like 'Do you not want me to make rent ? ' when I say I 'm still sleeping . Stop manipulating me . I could n't get her to move out as it was a joint lease and she 'd have to sign she 's leaving . Great . I tried everything , but where would she go anyway ? Be homeless ? She was also full of suicidal threats and transgender so on hormone therapy which made her mood swings insane , I tried to deal with it because you ca n't help who you are but some days I just could n't . Anyway , at some point I count up all the money she owes me for bills . 380 $ or something like that . I 'm broke at this point too because we let this couple crash on our living room for money and found out they are known for doing that and robbing the people they stay with so they took 1k out of her student loan and 600 $ that I got paid for something . I tell her at the end that I ca n't make last months internet bill , or rather 3 bills back that I did n't pay . About 300 , and instead of her paying me the 380 that she owes for what I did pay , she can just pay that off when she gets her tax returns and I 'll forgo the rest , so I 'm not stuck trying to find 300 in a hurry . She does n't do that . I think I hit her up about it once but she said she called and they made a fuss about it being in my name or something . I was outside of the states by then and back with family as my mom is sick and I just wanted to get away from there . I notice today on my credit report that the Brighthouse internet bill has showed up ( 3 years later ? ) and it 's sitting there , and I 'm not liking it . I already have some of the medical stuff on there that I have n't paid off yet , I made arrangements for most of it but I 'm not made of money so it 's stuck . But I 'm also not liking seeing her Facebook statuses that involve her crashing from couch to couch and being kicked out for bad habits of being a roommate and having no money for food , and how no-one will hire her . What do I do at this point ? I want to bring it up somehow , let her know I understand she 's broke but she needs to understand the consequences of her actions and that she needs to work on herself . I see her making posts about how maybe this is the life she 's destined for , she 's accepted that she 'll always be couch surfing and broke and jobless or some shit I want to write a positive email to her explaining how she can change if she puts the effort and she can make better habits and inspire her , because it 's no way to live . She 's also resorted to being an activist as of late and all her posts are protesting things and Trump . So I do n't know if it 'll be worth it , but she should know that she 's affected people . She 'd message me from time to time to ask how I 'm doing and if I know anyone that can help with her activism ... and I 'm like , err ... you screwed up big-time ... I do n't know how to talk to you . Sorry for the vent , I know a lot of it is unrelated but I went through quite a bit and felt that I was driving my friends away by venting about her on a daily basis so I just bottled it in instead and shut up about it and now it 's all out here but I do n't know what to do . I do n't want her to just get away with it , but at the same time she 's struggling so much that I do n't know if I should put more pressure on her . tl ; dr : Long-ass post about roommate that was more than one can handle but I had a car accident and no-one would help me out but her , and she owes me money and I want to let her know she did n't do her part of the deal we had .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Was originally 341 $ . ) [ Roland A-500 Pro ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/A500Pro ) ( 280 Euros . Also the local site has a different version it seems , instead of Roland it says cakewalk in it 's place .

Not sure how to describe this as I do n't know mushroom terminology , but basically the center of the mushroom and what you can see in some photos laying on the ground , is what was originally on the tree for a while . Just a lump of mushroom . And one day I kicked it just to see what would happen and it fell off ( to note , the tree has broken apart about a year ago , it just snapped , and I 'm wondering if it 's the mushroom ? ) Anyway , for a while it was just that centerpiece until I kicked it off , and then within like 3-4 days of kicking it off it somehow managed to not only grow back , but grow that extra puffy bit surrounding the center ball . What the fuck ? I 'm wondering if the rain helped it grow faster or if the rain is the result of that extra bit that 's now there ? Also you can see in some photos droplets of something , that drip on the ground .

But I have no clue how to figure this out . Now there was another guy who came during another shift and he did some stuff , like get the email reports I mentioned above . The guy has done some weird stuff with the company so they are planning on letting him go , but for now they are slowly limiting his access to stuff . So they changed the godaddy password to the web/email they use . He came in and asked for it since he was locked out , and they said they did n't want him to have it , just them two . So then he goes 'well at least let me know what emails are being sent out each day so I can send you guys reports ' Now I work at a call center , and we ask people for emails to tell them about our company . So sometimes we get the email wrong , and I can see that in the mailbox , but I do n't have access to the other report that he supposedly has access to . Where we can see how often they 've looked at our email and if they 've clicked on our link ? He asked for a list of emails sent each day so he can send us a detailed report of each one . How can he still have access to something like that if he does n't have access to the inbox ? How can we see something like that ? I only see 'delivery status notification ' in the inbox , just saying the email has bounced back . Nothing more than that . We want to stop him from having any kind of access but would also like to have access to those reports ourselves . I do n't see anything of the sorts in the godaddy email page . Nothing in settings , anywhere . Nothing suggesting he 's getting something forwarded to him . In the old emails we used to send ( ones made by him ) I can assume he had an image in there that he would track how often it was loaded , but I 've made a new email for the company since because the old one kind of sucked and they liked mine better .

12084182,callcenter,"So I got this job 2 months ago . I 'm a pretty quiet person so I was surprised I got it , but I needed something until I get something in my field . Anyway , we are outbound and try and convince people to sign up with our company ( sports betting sorta ) . We trade on their behalf . Anyway , first database we had , it was full of people that were previously in that industry and was really bad as most people would just be like 'fuck off , you 're all scammers ' , or 'I do n't bet anymore ' or some shit . Really hard to find clients to give emails as they 've had bad experiences in the past . Second database we got the other day was of general people , and most do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . With the first database I could write extensive scripts and change my approach every time because I knew the client knew what I was on about and their tone of voice and word choices would give them away if they were really interested or trying to get rid of me . New database , I say simple things because most people are just like 'I do n't do that , I do n't know what that is , I do n't have time for that , or money etc . ' So I just briefly state that we 're an investor company and we have a free email for them if they are interested . Anyway , manager that listens to all the calls and monitors us came in today to do our monthly meeting and give paychecks and told me that our boss who watches the cameras and stuff has seen me slack off quite a bit and be lazy . And I have two weeks to improve . BUT that he personally , from listening to my calls , says that I have the potential to be better than anyone of the others in my team and that I have a knack for knowing when the client is interested and when they 're just wanting me to fuck off which is hard to do and I know how to write great scripts and rebuttals ( using the customers words against them ) . He also said that he 's heard my prank calls ( at the end of the shift everyone gives me their 'bad ' customers and I prank them from a private line that they 've won something or another and everyone makes me do it cause they think I 'm the best at it ) and he 's confused how my prank calls are so brilliant and perfect and yet my regular calls are lacking enthusiasm and I sound 'docile ' as he put it . He said I 'm really intelligent , he can see that in me but he does n't know how to motivate me . Any other employee , he can tell them exactly what to do to improve but I 'm an enigma to him and he knows I 've got tremendous potential but he ca n't figure out how to get me to pull it out of me . Honestly , it 's a really boring job , we 're doing things manually as they do n't have computers set up yet . So I have a paper sheet in front of me , dial numbers on the phone and then write feedback on the paper and it 's just so tedious . I get distracted easily and do something else other than calls . I want to push myself but I do n't know how . I lack motivation because I never saw myself doing this , I have 2 degrees and ca n't find a job in either field . Maybe because I see this as temporary it 's hard to take it more seriously .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Do n't really need rape counseling with this post but since relationships might not want to deal with my post , here it is . Also to state , the rape in question happened when I was 11 , I 'm 26 now . Here 's the original post I had : Why do some people think that because rape is n't so bad compared to something else , it therefore is n't so bad at all ... ? This concept just baffles me . Last night I ( 26 ) was out with some friends I 've been hanging with lately . Rick ( 19 ) , a friend of a friend that I 've known for some time , have hung out a few times lately and sometimes with his friends . I moved back home 2 months ago and did n't really have anyone to hang with so my friend suggested I hang with him since he has nothing to do either . Anna ( Rick 's gf ) is a really quiet girl , she comes out and just tags along with whatever we do . And then there 's Dave who 's also Rick 's friend . So last night we went to some exhibition , checked it out and then at 9 there was a movie and discussion thing at another place that we go to once a week and we had time to kill so we just sat somewhere and talked . Me and Rick really started disagreeing about a lot of things , but whatever , it happens , everyone 's got their opinion , until he started talking about rape . First he said how rape is n't so bad . Me and Dave lost it , 'what do you mean rape is n't so bad ? ' Anna being quiet and just absorbing everything . Rick says 'Well , compared to getting your vagina sewed shut , rape is n't so bad ' Well duhh if I had to chose between rape and my vagina sewed shut , I 'd chose rape , but in the grand scheme of things , rape is fucked up and wrong . And it should n't be said that it 's not bad . So Dave says how Rick does n't know what he 's talking about since he 's never experienced it and Rick says how he 'd rather have a rape experience , which he said was 'temporary physical trauma ' than his finger chopped off . Me and Dave said how there 's emotional trauma too , and his response was 'emotional trauma is far from physical trauma ' At this point I just lost it , and started yelling and grabbed him really hard ( he was sitting in front of me , a step below me ) and I was crying/wailing . When I finally managed to compose myself , I explained how I 'd rather have my finger chopped off than 10 years of emotional torture that I suffered , and then cried more and kept apologizing , I guess because I was embarrassed of making a scene in front of them all . Dave kept saying how I should n't be sorry , why am I sorry ? It was just so overwhelming , I thought back to all that I went through , and explained how I could n't even let someone close to me hug me for the longest time , even that was impossible for me and then we had this awkward silence for a while . No one said anything . I wanted to break the silence and say that everything was fine , but it was n't and I did n't know how . So after some time Rick asks if we should go , and we 're like , alright . He gets up , asks if I 'm okay and before I could say anything more than 'yeah ' he starts talking about something like nothing happened . I hated it . The rest of the night was fine , as usual , and I tried to act like nothing happened but driving Rick and Anna home there was this silence , and the only thing Rick said was thanks for the ride and see ya or something to that effect , I did n't really pay attention , nor did I care to . Told my best friend today who 's sorta friends with him ( well , our other best friend is close to him as a family friend so that 's how we know him ) , and he got so upset when I said I had a breakdown because of him . I did n't really tell him what happened right away just that I was angry at him and that I was over it , but when he got angry and said he was going to kill him ( figuratively ) , and I explained what happened since he asked , I realized I was n't over it and it was all coming back and I felt so uncomfortable and thought , how could someone even think something like that ? He said that he would n't know if he could be friends with him after something like that if it were him . I honestly do n't know either . I want to explain why he 's wrong , and how that affected me so he can see things differently , but I do n't know if it 's going to affect him or if I should even bother . I feel like the only way I can keep being friends is if I explain why I reacted the way I did and why I think that he 's wrong in thinking that emotional and physical trauma are separate and they are not correlated . I get that he 's entitled to his opinion , and if he 'd want to be raped over his finger chopped off , that 's fine . But to state that rape is nothing and there 's no emotional trauma involved and that it 's not correlated to physical trauma just bothers the fuck out of me . and I get that as a guy , he 's taught to repress any physical stuff and not let it get emotional and that emotional stuff might not be real , but that does n't mean he should state that it 's true for everyone . Ahh . Any advice ? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way ? My best friend agrees with me but I know that he 's also experienced rape as a kid and that he might just feel this way because he 's thinking back to his own experiences and he does n't have that whole 'you need to suppress emotions ' thing that most guys have . So I want to know if his reaction was justified , but so far Dave and my best friend think he was out of line , but somehow I feel like maybe I 'm just overreacting .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

When loading said band/artist , do n't force me to pick a specific album or chose all songs . Have them all there , categorized under album , so I can just pick a song without having to make another touch to get to all the songs . 3 . When past 5-10 seconds of a song and I click the skip back button , I want to restart the song , not go to the previous one . First five seconds , fine , I 'll go to the previous one and play it again . ( this would be really handy , so used to windows programs that do that ) 4 . On the lock screen , I do n't need an extra screen with song info , only to exit that one and get to my regular lock screen and then finally get to my device , so if it has this option , I 'd like to be able to disable it so I only have one lock screen to go through . ( sometimes I need to get to my device fast ) 5 . When I pause a song and want to skip through to find another song , do n't auto play each song . I paused for a reason so I would n't hear 2 seconds of each song as passing through . Keep it paused until I press play when I reach the song of choice . ( definitely a plus )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"We dated for about 6 months , I moved in with him and then we broke up but stayed roommates for about another 6 months ( his abuse made it hard to leave ) . He 's in jail now which is why I 'm able to leave without feeling bad for hurting his feelings and ditching him when he 's all alone and depressed and you get it ... Here 's the thing , while we were dating I had a tooth problem . I was waiting on my dad to send money so I could go to the dentist ( around 3-4k for all treatments ) , but in the meantime my tooth hurt so bad one day that it was impossible to do anything from the pain . I ended up at an emergency 24 dentist and you guessed it , he charged like almost the same amount just for one tooth that was aching ( whereas I was going to get multiple teeth done for that amount at a regular dentist ) . My ex pays and says I 'll just pay him when I get the money . Then when I got the money he said it was more important to get my teeth fixed and just give him what 's left over and pay him back later since he 's okay with money and I need my teeth fixed . Note that around this time my mom had a surgery and my dad had to shell out roughly around 10k for that , so money was tight for him ( he 's also paying for my education in full which is n't too cheap ) . My ex had no problem waiting . I went away for the summer to see my family ( right after he got jailed ) and now that I 'm back , I went to see him . He knew that I had some plan of moving out but I guess he did n't realize the extent of it . First he was saying how I should stay and that he 'll tell his mom to not charge me for staying in his house ( he owns it , and I was paying him rent ) , and that I can save up to move out properly , etc ... and even saying I do n't have to pay him back since I brought up how I still owe him and I 'll do what I can to get it to him . Since then he 's called twice to talk ( threeway call with his parents ) and has I suppose noticed my stern tone and me avoiding certain topics like coming to see him and moving out . I told him that it is happening for certain and most likely middle of the month and how it 's a lot cheaper ( so I have another reason for moving out ) . Then he goes , well do n't forget to save up so you can pay me back . Ahhh ... I have no issue paying him back , I just hate how first he tries to keep me around by letting me know I do n't have to pay him and not rent , but then wants the money cause he knows when I move out I can just lose all contact with him and now I 'm forced to contact him to give the money , and he 'll want to know where I am , and I plan on changing my number which is n't going to help . What can I do ? Our relationship was pretty much him being controlling ( from my/our finances , to outings/shopping decisions ) , and possessive ( if I 'm out with friends , he 's at home sulking and wondering what I 'm up to , and why I 'm having fun while he 's depressed ) , to him saying 'I did this and that for you ( which I never asked for and even told him not to ) and you do what for me ? ' -- - **tl ; dr** : If I stay in my ex 's house , I apparently do n't have to pay rent or pay him back , but if I leave , I have to pay him back since my rent is significantly cheaper than what I was paying him .

12084182,travel,"So my friend was looking for flights to Miami , and he did n't want to search for flights from his origin ( Georgia , Europe ) but from any other big city in Europe that would have cheap flights to Miami .

( According to CreditKarma - it 's 662 ) I 've recently wanted to purchase some things from Amazon ( I have a bunch of gift cards saved up ) , Amazon offered ( through Chase bank ) to give me 6 months , no interest financing if I sign up for their card . I do n't know if I want to add another card and have more things to think about and pay each month , also from what I 've seen , Chase is n't the best bank . On the other hand , if I do n't have to pay for everything right away , I would go for that since it means I can afford all the things I want now without spending my gift cards . If I just pay a little over the minimum balance each month , does that mean my credit wont drop ? If I take one of the items out of my cart , I get 30 $ off instead , which is n't bad , but it involves paying for everything else with cash vs. gift cards . So I do n't know if I want to consider that instead . Any thoughts on the Amazon card ? Another card will help boost my score , but at the same time , is it a good one ? I 've looked at their terms ( such as no yearly fee , and cash-back ) and they did n't seem bad . I never bite more than I can chew , so right now I 'm not worried about any fees , but ...

12084182,Norway,"Hey , I 'm flying from Florida and my cheapest route takes me through Oslo . My current flight has me there at 1pm and leaving at 1pm the next day .

Graduation is only a month and a week away ( for him , not me , different degrees ) , and given the nature of the industry , we might not see each other again for years . For that reason , it is imperative that I do this now and not later . Also , I trust you will keep this private and not share this information with anyone . It 's a pretty big thing , so I do n't want anyone else in on this but you and me . So here it goes : Remember when you posted the `` Squeezing Cute Things '' article that you talked about fetishes ? Well , I have one . Do n't worry , it 's nothing kinky or disgusting or anything of that sort . It started out as a foot fetish that evolved to macrophilia . Look it up if you must , but I ai n't typing it out . Anyways , I satisfy that itch by sneakily taking pictures of girls ' feet . Apparently I 'm good at it because I have n't been caught yet , and since it 's not as intrusive as taking pictures up girls ' skirts , then there 's no real harm done . I do feel it 's somewhat intrusive , which is why I 've decided that it 's best that I go and ask instead . And that 's where YOU come in . You 're the first person I test this new idea on . I want you to come over and let me take pictures of you . It wo n't be anything weird like having you strip or anything - merely you going around my apartment doing normal things . It 's for my benefit only - it wo n't be posted on the Internet or anything of that sort . I know this may seem really weird to you and you have every reason to think that and back out if you wish . But I can assure you that it wo n't be anything outside of your comfort zone and believe me when I say it 's even weirder for me to be letting someone in on this . But like I said , I trust you enough to not go and spread the word . Please let me know if you 're willing to do this huge favor for me , and if you are , then we can arrange for you to swing by . I 'm free tomorrow ( tuesday ) ; it would be best to meet when the sun is still up , so anywhere from 12 noon to 4pm works .

First month , late payment . Second month , late again . Third month , no payment as of yet , ( should have been on the 25th of last month ) .

Then we got a call that because it was a civil matter , they ca n't do anything . But we do n't know where he is , if we did , it would be fine , but we do n't , so it 's not really a civil matter . The whole contract thing screwed us up and therefore the police wont do anything about it . We started going to all known addresses , everyone is clearly covering for him .

During our conversations I mentioned I was moving from Miami and that I did n't have a car . and then he goes 'I work at a dealership , I can hook you up with a car ' which now makes me think he 's sold the car and that 's why he could n't have delivered it because he does n't drive a truck . We 've considered telling the repo man to say we already got the car back and he stole it again , and at that point be able to report him for theft .

I frequently forget to do things he tells me to do or mess them up . Example , I often forget to put the sponge in the sink , a huge pet peeve of his as everything has to be clean and orderly , and I 'm not like that . I forget important things such as going somewhere and forgetting to bring something I needed to bring for that task such as a document . Or even simpler , putting laundry in the machine and forgetting to put detergent and washing a load without it . I 'm not focusing well in classes as well , even if they are really interesting .

When I first got off the meds , my symptoms were really bad , like I 'd forget car keys in the car door and then spend an hour looking for them only to find they 're in the door . Leave the house without half my stuff , forget that I 've done stuff so I 'd do it again or not at all thinking I have . But with time I got better at it and spoke to psychologists and learned techniques and can now more or less do most of those things fairly well . My roommate on the other hand takes some seizure meds that supposedly give her ADD according to her doctor . She is so forgetful it 's almost frustrating , I 've learned to make habits of things , like turning off the lights in the bathroom when I 'm done . She however ca n't . Every time I bring up a pet peeve like how the bathroom floor is soaked after she showers , she says that she just wont remember to clean up or dry in the bath so it does n't happen and it 's just how she is . She forgot her house keys on several occasions and was locked out . She left the stove on a few times , once I came home to the house in smoke , and she burnt my pot , which had her coffee in it . She says that there 's nothing she can do , no technique will work because her meds force her brain to act that way , it 's not a natural state therefore there 's nothing she can do to change that . I think she 's just not wanting to even try .

Do you feel there 's a difference between the two , is her state the same as mine or is it different because there 's a different cause ?

A few years back , let 's say 4-5 years ago , I had a period where I 'd dream that I 'm awake and doing my morning routine , I 'd get up , take a shower , do whatever in the bathroom then get back into bed , nap a little more and then go to classes or whatever . One day by chance my friend and I discussed something and he said there 's no way I was showering at 10am as he was late to work and was up at 10am still at home . And I came to a conclusion as he mentioned that lately I had not been up at all until a certain point ( other roommate pointed it out ) that I had dreamt it all . I thought it was odd . It did n't last long though and stopped completely until recently . Now I 've graduated college 2 months ago and moved in with my mom and sister , who 's also come home to help with her as she 's old and needs care . I got her this squeaky dog toy so if she needs me from another room I can hear her ( she 's gotten real quiet and sometimes I want to watch something or she 's watching something ) and suddenly it became a trigger in my sleep . I 'd hear the squeak and know it 's her and realize I 'm dreaming but wake up and help her only to realize that I never woke up , she 'd squeak again and I 'd realize I 'm sleeping and wake up for real . Once I dreamt that she squaked , I got up , and realized she had fallen while wanting to go to the bathroom and I got her back up and went back to bed . The next day I asked her how she felt after the fall , and she goes 'what fall ? ' She never fell in the night . And now sometimes I just dream that I 'm up , helping her out , getting her breakfast and her meds ready only to have her wake me up and tell me she wants her breakfast . So I 'm wondering if it has any relation to my epilepsy or it 's random . Has anyone else had experiences like this ? I did n't even know it could relate to epilepsy until I randomly stumbled upon that article today . I have absence seizures and currently take 1000mgs of Keppra .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Dentistry,"So about a year ago I had some major stuff done to my teeth . I went to a dentist at my moms village that was cheap and he said I had more to be done but since I was only visiting for a week he said he did the major stuff and next year I can get the rest done and he thinks it 'll be fine for a year . Now I 'm back home for the summer but in the city ( my parents have an apartment in the city and my mom has her parents summer house in a village ) . I went to a dentist my sister goes to , she says he 's great , blah blah . He looked at scans of my teeth I did before the visit , said he really liked the work the previous dentist did , and all I needed were my fillings replaced as they were reaching their expiry date and falling apart . Alright , cool . First time just bottom right side . Second time bottom left . ( two teeth each time ) . Second visit he says for the top it 's easy , he can do both sides at once with anesthetic , unlike the bottom which has to be done separately for whatever reason so I 'll only have one more visit and he 'll also give me a nightguard for my bruxism . Great ! Next visit though he only does top right . I find that odd , but maybe he was just making a remark how the top does n't need to be done separately and never intended to do both sides . Gets the imprint for my guard thing and fixes my filling a bit ( from previous visit ) as I felt my bite was a bit weird . When he did my bottom and top right side , I had no problems , even after the visit , after the anesthetic wore off , no pain . Left side though , one tooth , as he was drilling , just kept being sensitive , he said it 's probably under too much stress . So I figured , okay , that must be it . Then after the visit , it kept hurting a few nights in a row , oddly enough right as I want to sleep , so I 'd take an ibuprofen and then finally it went away but the cold issue came in . Cold water makes my left side feel weird . Sometimes it 's the bottom part , my jaw area , sometimes it 's even the top part where he did n't even do anything to my teeth . My sister schedules a visit for general cleaning and so I can ask him stuff . He cleans my teeth , massages my gums or whatever . My sister made an off comment to him how I have breath issues and maybe something 's still up , and he said the spacing between my teeth is really tight , and that 's was what caused breath because I do n't floss enough and remove the food that 's stuck there . But when we got in the car , I said how he forgot to tell me why my gums are sensitive to cold , and she said it was the teeth spacing but then I told her it only started after he worked on my bottom tooth and now I do n't know why I 'm still sensitive to it . Do I have a problem ? Or is it normal to take a bit longer for some teeth to recover from all the drilling ? I do n't get my upper gums feel sensitive too at times even though he never touched my upper teeth at all . tl ; dr : Went for change of fillings , one tooth was more sensitive than the others during filling change . Since then ( a month ago ) my whole left side has become sensitive to cold and it took a while for the pain in my tooth to subside while other teeth that had fillings had no pain afterward .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Leave in for 1-5 minutes ) and a shampoo/conditioner set that 's for damaged hair with natural oils to restore the hair so I want to help it restore itself , but I 'd also like to use the anti-yellow shampoo . Do I alternate ? Do I use one and then the other after in the same wash ? Or do I not need the anti-yellow now as I 'm bleaching again and it will remove yellow and then I 'd only need it then if I still get some yellow .

12084182,HaircareScience,"Bleached my hair , so of course it 's in the brittle stage . I have one shampoo , purple for removing unwanted golden tones or whatever . Make it less yellow . But I also have another shampoo/conditioner set for strengthening hair and full of natural oils to help the hair get strong after bleaching . I want to remove the unwanted tones but also want to help my hair get stronger so I can bleach it a second time in two weeks so I can add color . Can I use both ? After bleaching I used the color one and then figured I need to make my hair stronger so used the other shampoo after rinsing the purple one and then used the conditioner that 's paired with it . Would this be weird on the hair ? Should I alternate ? How often should I shampoo now that I 've bleached ? ( my whole head , usually I only do partial ) I usually wash 2-3 times a week , try and let the natural oils kick in , but maybe using these products will help , so more often might work . Edit : If I 'm bleaching again in 1-2 weeks time , will the blue shampoo be of any use ? Will my hair get yellow again or will the second bleach just kill the yellow and there 's no use ? I 'm trying to get blues in my hair and have previously had dark colors like greens , reds , purples that have n't needed the hair to be perfectly white .

I only noticed it the other day when I tried installing Pro Tools and found out that the USB key I have that authenticates the software was n't working . It 's 70 $ for a new one and then 40 $ to talk to support so they transfer the key . Figured since I already own the software I 'd just crack it , and downloaded a crack . Uninstalled software , installed crack , told me it needed the usb key . Figured I did something wrong , repeated the process .

So I was confused , I not only uninstalled the software but deleted any related folders under program files so I should have enough space for at least that . I ran disk cleanup and found out that 60GB was taken up by 'temporary files ' whatever that was for . Could it be the crack or did I have this problem from before ? Today I 'm low on space again , and I hardly have anything on this computer . C drive says that 5gb is free of 300 .

She walks with a cane and needs help getting to the bathroom most of the time . She 's very slow , speech is slow and her left hand ca n't do much . She thinks right is left and vice versa . I try and get her to do something with her left hand , like using it with the cane or picking something up with her left hand but it 's as if it 's paralyzed , she just ca n't . She forgets what she 's supposed to do with it and gets this confused look on her face and looks like she wants to cry because it 's too complicated for her . On the other hand , she 's also easily confused and set in her ways . She takes one medication that she 's supposed to slowly phase out and take another one instead . The doctor said 10mg 3x a day , then 10mg x2 a day , and then 5mg 3 times a day . That goes from 30 to 20 , to 15 . The thing is , when I put 3 x 5 today in her medicine holder , she said it was wrong , she needed just two a day . I said how it 's 3 a day but it 's a smaller dosage , resulting in a smaller overall amount of the medicine despite the increase in frequency . She got very frustrated with me , despite showing her the doctors orders , and said that I was reading it wrong but finally gave in and accepted what I said . She was on the verge of crying out of frustration because she could n't understand the situation and what I was saying was too confusing for her to comprehend . On the upside , she 's also on Prozac which makes her laugh at everything , even when I 'm telling her off for repeating things she should n't . It 's very frustrating to deal with this situation , I 'd like to help her with her hand , and my sister who was with her until I got here , said she 's trying to get her to go to physical therapy again .

12084182,CasualConversation,"So , met this dude at this place I was volunteering at a while back , briefly talked , though he seemed really friendly . Girl from said place adds me on Facebook , turns out she added a lot of people , including him . Thought he was cute so added him , had an excuse to . Profile did n't seem like he was in a relationship currently , no info , but it did show that he was with this girl for years from what I gathered , but any recent activity , past month or so made him seem like he was single or broken up .

12084182,Epilepsy,"Just looking for other people 's stories . Started last night . Took one dose , first three days I 'll be taking just one dose to adapt and then 2 doses a day . Woke up with swollen eyes and was too tired to get up , could n't even change my alarm , which is what I usually do if I 'm tired , set it for 5 mins later ( rare though , if I have to be up for something specific , I 'm up ) . ( had ~7 hours of sleep , not unusual but prefer 8 ) Woke up 35 mins later and got up . Went to the bathroom , stumbled a bit by the door . Maybe I 'm just so tired , maybe it 's the meds . Felt like farting later . Everyone farts , but this felt really strong , and it was ! Did n't eat anything out of the usual . Rest of the day would occasionally get knots in my stomach and feel like I might need the bathroom . Thankfully nothing happened there . Maybe it 's the meds , maybe something else . Only thing I could n't find under symptoms , I found stomach upset , but no farting . Maybe that counts . Came home , passed out , slept for a good 4 or so hours . Woke up , found my left eye to be swollen a bit . I guess I 'm a bit drowsy , but not a whole lot , just tiredness I guess . Took my next dose like 2 hours ago . I hope tomorrow 's better . Might be worse , oh well . Really do n't like this tiredness thing , my line of work requires not a lot of sleep and energy . Tomorrow night is my last night of a single dose . From then on I start morning doses too . I 'm on 500mg for starters , then it 'll keep going up until I reach my needed dose . I have staring spells , which is why I 'm taking this . At least I do n't have anger outbursts , that was my biggest worry as I irritate easily . Apparently the side effects subside within 4 weeks , get weaker so I 'm hoping that 's the case . Edit : Second day , right eye is n't swollen or even hurting to touch anymore , but left eye is swollen some more and hurts . Also itchy . Slight sore throat . Had a mild headache/earache this morning . Or , more like pressure on the head . No other symptoms , farted a bit ago , so I know that 's still ongoing , but less than before . Stomach still twists on occasion . Second Edit : So , turns out the whole eye thing was a completely separate thing . I got a [ stye ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye ) in my eye , literally right as I started taking Keppra so I assumed it was a side effect , but turns out a pore on my eyelid got blocked so that happened . And my stomach being upset was just my period happening , and I guess I did n't realize it cause I was too focused on the meds and trying to see what side effects I was getting . They probably affected how I felt too so I did n't recognize the usual symptoms .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Singing meat . This is altogether too much . So what do you advise ? '' `` Officially or unofficially ? '' `` Both . '' `` Officially , we are required to contact , welcome and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe , without prejudice , fear or favor . Unofficially , I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing . '' `` I was hoping you would say that . '' `` It seems harsh , but there is a limit .

How many planets are we dealing with here ? '' `` Just one . They can travel to other planets in special meat containers , but they ca n't live on them . And being meat , they can only travel through C space . Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim . Infinitesimal , in fact . '' `` So we just pretend there 's no one home in the Universe . '' `` That 's it . '' `` Cruel . But you said it yourself , who wants to meet meat ? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels , the ones you probed ? You 're sure they wo n't remember ? '' `` They 'll be considered crackpots if they do . We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we 're just a dream to them . '' `` A dream to meat ! How strangely appropriate , that we should be meat 's dream .

It 's like talking to a wall but you know it can hear you , and he liked that . But then he realized that there 's more to a relationship than that , and figured he should break it off since he was n't even sure what they were to begin with . When he said that , I was like , what ? Did you not even discuss if you were in a relationship or not ? Everyone thought that , and they always came out with us and were like a couple ... It was just a given , but I guess they never officially discussed it . Anyway , he starts to suspect that this other dude she was hanging with that he knew sorta , might have a thing for her and decided he 'd rather not know and just break it off . He was planning to go to the mountains one day , see snow , and he asked her if she wanted to come . She said she had plans . Now this dude that was his acquaintance , said he was going for snow and would call him when they go and he 'd come . He never called . But he later saw over Facebook that the dude had gone and he had invited her as well and they were tagged in photos together , that 's why she had plans already , she was doing the same thing he had asked her , but with other dude . Weird breakup cause he brought her snow in a lunchbox and left it at her door as a breakup gift , and wrote a breakup letter , which was more of him writing some abstract ideas about how he feels about her , him , their relationship , future and stuff . I do n't think she really understood as her English is n't that great , since her response was 'thanks , it was very nice of you ' and acted like nothing had happened .

Second year of show pro is amazing , you get to do all the lighting stuff , live sound , and video , and bands come in all the time and you help set up actual concerts weekly .

12084182,bestof,"All valid points . But I think that 's why it stood out to me , why would someone fake something like that on some obscure subreddit ? But then again , it 's the internet and nothing surprises me anymore . My reasoning for that though , was that perhaps someone knew what he was doing or saw him on Reddit . And then they saw what he did because of that , so they checked it . A student at my school got busted for making a fake Facebook profile of our chemistry teacher , and the profile added everyone and they tracked the person down , and monitored Facebook , but they also monitored a lot of other stuff , and could at any moment while you 're in the IT lab check what you 're browsing . But it is really odd that they 'd publicly state something like that . Maybe to teach him a lesson , or it 's probably like you pointed out , just a big sham so someone would notice and be like , 'this guy ... '",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I saw his profile on linkedin and just that alone did n't make me think of doing anything ( his professional life is not something I care for , just something people do for money vs. passion ) , but I saw he was still in my city - 99 % of people that I have known from high school are no longer in this country . I Googled him and found a profile on Couch Surfing which turned out to blow my expectations because his professional profile seemed boring to me , but everyone 's different at work , which is why I looked him up further . Anyway , turns out we have everything in common and he 's like me in a lot of ways so I wanted to find a way to meet him but I 'm not sure how . Hence my question . I do n't usually just message people out of the blue so I wanted to know how to do it so it does n't come off as weird . Most of my friends here are in another city where I first studied , and all my high school friends went on elsewhere , and I did too after my initial degree here . So I do n't really have any in my city . Well , I do , a friend of a friend , but he 's 19 and I 'm 26 , and even though we hang out just fine , and his friends are cool too , it 's a bit weird with the age gap , I 'd like to meet people my own age as well . But I 'm sorta busy and then it 's easy to hang with them because they fit into my schedule , and are always down to hang .

12084182,MechanicAdvice,"Also , there were other numbers that had bigger rim sizes , but had the width of my back tires , and aspect ratio . Would that make it compatible ? Like if it 's compatible with a tire of width 155 , would that mean anything of 155 is compatible ? As an example , another compatible tire listed on the box is `` 175/60-14 '' my back tire has a width of 175 . And the aspect ratio is 70 and this thing is compatible with an aspect ratio of `` 165/70-13 '' as well , does that mean that it would work since it does work with 175 in one scenario and 70 in another ?

12084182,MechanicAdvice,"My tires were in really bad shape , like one went flat and then I noticed that the others had wires sticking out . Yeah ... So I just bought the cheapest used tires I could . One tire place said they only had 2 tires , and I went for them since I really needed the spare tire changed . Then I found another place that had 2 more tires but different sizes and they said they were compatible with my car . 2 weeks later I got my dad to go with me to take my car for a check up ( thought a problem I had was the suspension as the car feels every bump and pothole on the road , but no , they said it 's fine , nothing I should worry about ) and he asked them if we should change my tires ( different place to any other that I 've been to when I got my tires ) and they said although the tires are n't of a good brand , they 're in ok shape for now so they would n't change them . It 's a Nissan Pulsar ( 1996 ? 98 ? ) I 'll see if I can find some paperwork for it .

12084182,AskReddit,"Upbringing is a weird term . I had a weird upbringing , but a lot of these things didn ’ t come from my parents , it came from realising what it takes to be a decent human being and gain respect from others and be treated fairly . It comes with having common sense . Sometimes parents are retarded and raise their children to be that way too , but oftentimes like in my own example , I tried to do my best to not be like my parents and have better habits . Not saying these are theirs , just giving a general statement , but these are some things that tick me off and give me a general impression about yourself and your choices growing up : If they constantly try to sound smarter than they are . If they litter and try to say that there ’ s a janitor or city worker that cleans up that mess , it ’ s their job . Basic manners . People who fuck up , and apologize by saying “ I ’ m sorry , but… ” There ’ s no but . If you are sorry , you say so , then shut up and deal with the consequences . How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them . Maybe that McDonalds worker has a degree but can ’ t find a job in it . Maybe life forced them to change course . Also , who would serve you that McDonalds if they didn ’ t ? If you have read nothing but the Bible . Big red-flag for me . Open your eyes a little . At least try and understand other people ’ s points of view . I might not have cared for the bible , and am not religious , but I don ’ t judge you for your choice , so don ’ t judge me for mine . Try and understand my point of view and know how to have a civilised conversation without getting angry because I disagree about your God . Tattoos of a person you 're in a relationship with or were in a relationship with . That 's permanent , think about it . I do not regret tattoos , and you should n't either . I had a best friend in high school . This girl was madly into him , she messed up and he could n't get over it . She decided to show her undying love for him by getting huge wings on her back ( like , whole upper back ) with some saying and his name to show that she wishes she had wings to fly to him and fly off with him . Needless to say he was n't impressed and she lost him as a friend , lover , everything . Why the fuck would you get that as a tattoo ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"What life path to take . Found out my health is affecting my career choice ( my degree is now practically useless ) . It ’ s not a big health issue , I can work just about anywhere else but with my degree , it ’ s impossible to find a suitable job . So now it seems I have to look for work in fields I have no knowledge about or get a regular job until I figure out what I ’ m going to do with my life . I just hope I don ’ t get sucked in to being stuck with no progress because I end up living paycheck to paycheck . I can freelance , but that 's very unpredictable . I have three other attempted degrees , so maybe I can try and finish one of those ( saves time , instead of spending another 4 in a university , since I 'm 26 and already kind of old to not have held a job in a field of study ) but that 's also time wasting . I ’ m currently back under my parents roof and daily think about how homelessness would be better than this ( we do n't get along ) and that I should just move out and figure things out . But I have nowhere to go , can ’ t drive for a while until my medical tests come back as safe to drive . So can ’ t take a car either . I think about ending it all but then I remember the things I have to look forward to . My best friend of 10 years now , is finally seeing his life looking up and it ’ s because of me among other people/things . It ’ s something that gives me hope every day , knowing I ’ m the reason he ’ s still alive and here for me . I also think about this kid I took in , who was homeless , and had nowhere to go . I saw something in him , I wanted to help him somehow . Knowing what it felt like to have nowhere to go and feel worthless was something I didn ’ t want anyone to have to experience . I gave him a place to stay for a bit , and told him to apply for jobs daily and make something of himself . Find a way to finish high school and do something more . I wonder how he is , if he ’ s okay . We lost touch but he could n't have been more grateful that I came along and gave him something , hope , a home , something to look forward to . I ’ m jealous in a way that even though he was homeless and on the street , he managed to get away from his parents and get away from the abuse and didn ’ t give in to the manipulation . I also think about how I can find someone that 'll stay with me as both a best friend and partner . I ’ ve had some odd life choices and it makes it hard to open up to people because I fear they ’ ll reject my past . I also have issues with emotional abuse , I ’ ve been dealing with it my whole life with my mom and it ’ s affected all my relationships too , I always end up with those types , and I just end up giving in to their tactics and am too nice to do anything about it . I ’ ve learned my lesson though and am not letting it get to me , but for a while I was stuck in this pattern where people would manipulate me to stay in the relationship . I don ’ t care if we lack a social life because we ’ re both struggling to make something of ourselves , I just want us to have each other and be happy . My last ex tried to kill himself because of our break-up ( manipulation tactic , not really wanting to die… ) and I still can ’ t get over that . It was so hard because I still cared about him as a person . I was supposed to fly out to visit my sister , which he knew would result in me just leaving ( he was going away for a while , and figured I ’ d move out while he ’ s gone ) . So me missing my flight to be in the hospital with him was a sign of hope that I still cared and wanted to be with him . He changed himself for the relationship , he turned into someone he wasn ’ t just to get me to like him more but that made me like him even less . And I have this constant paranoia of ending up in a relationship where the person keeps doing that . Just be yourself . I ’ m tired of people suddenly being like me because they fear I ’ ll leave them because there ’ s nothing there . Do n't suddenly read books because you think I 'll like you more for reading them . I know you hate reading them so do n't torture yourself so I can stay . It 's weird . You might try and turn into all the things I want from a partner , but it ’ ll never be real . I ’ ll always want someone who ’ s just themselves around me and I ’ m myself and we never have to hide or be fake to feel like the other person will stay . I ’ m not changing for you , and I don ’ t expect you to change for me . If you change , change for the better , make better habits , be a better person for YOU . Not for me . So I think about that . Also friendships . I ’ m so busy all the time and the friends I ’ ve had have mostly left or are busy themselves , have gone their own ways and are doing other things with their closer friends . The few friends I do have that want to hang all the time aren ’ t as intellectually stimulating as I ’ d like or are n't doing anything worthwhile . They just sit around high all day and do nothing worthwhile for the most part . I have friends I can have a good conversation with , but now that they 're working and busy , they 're always tired and weekends involve sitting in a coffee shop chatting instead of activities like camping/picnics or going out like we used to . I want to make new friends but because I get busy at times and am not sure when I ’ m free it makes it harder because I don ’ t want people to get the wrong idea that I ’ m not interested . Also I don ’ t know if I ’ m staying here for now or leaving ( I want to leave as soon as possible but I know I need a job first to save up money and get medical stuff in order , I live in a small island in the middle of nowhere and it makes it hard to do anything here , small population and all ) but if I make friends , and then have to move , it ’ ll just be so much harder . I guess I hope I find people that are as busy as me or understanding of my situation so when we do hang out , it ’ s worthwhile and we understand if one of us can ’ t . So yeah , those are some of the things I think about .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Be grateful to the past you for the positive things you 've done . And do favors for the future you like you would for your best friend . Not feeling so good today ? Stop a second , think of a good decision you made yesterday . Thank you younger me .

The cycle of doing something for someone else ( future you ) and thanking someone for the good in your life ( past you ) is key to building gratitude and productivity . Remember to forgive yourself if you did not succeed in something . You tried hard , but you still did n't do it .

12084182,AskReddit,"Depression is always a bitch , but you have to try and not let it get to you . We can let it swallow us up , or get up and fight it . It 's not easy , I struggle with that same fight every day , but do n't let it get to you and give in . You broke it off so clearly you had some reasons as to why you did n't see it working out , but do n't focus on the negative , focus on the positives that you 've learned from it . Maybe it took time to realize how it was affecting you and how negative the situation really was , but whatever the reasons , do n't let them get to you . Focus on the good things you 've got going on . Instead of wallowing of what could have been , think about what can be . Right now you probably have no intention of a new relationship , but it 's good to think about what you 've learned from it . If you broke up for reasons other than infidelity , there 's something to take from it , a reason why you could n't see marriage in the future anymore . Take that and focus on what you want out of the next relationship , so you when it comes along , you realize it 's what you 've been waiting for and it does n't pass you by . Do n't let the depression swallow you so you miss out on something , but also focus on other things that are important to you right now and get them done so you can stop thinking about how badly the relationship affected you . My last relationship ended with me realizing how it just was n't meant to be in the long term , and I now know what to expect of my next one . It 's painful , but you need to find a way to let go of the pain . Avoiding pain would n't be a problem if we did it once or twice a year . But for most of us , it 's a habit we 've embedded deeply into ourselves . We barricade ourselves behind an invisible wall and do n't venture out because beyond the wall is pain . I do this all the time . But you and I both need to get the strength to move on and find the motivation to get those things done that we think about . Instead of 'I should ... ' you need to say 'I will ... ' it reinforces the thought in your head that you will get it done . You might be avoiding anything that can make you feel exposed ... Avoiding facing responsibility , you hide in your comfort zone . Most people have a faulty way of motivating themselves . They ’ re motivated to get whatever they want , because they feel they don ’ t have enough already . This feeling of lacking is powerful as a motivator , but you pay a huge price for it . That price is the ongoing feeling that there ’ s always something missing . Even if you get something you ’ ve wanted , you quickly become dissatisfied with it , which then motivates you to get something else . You can never be happy on this treadmill . Eventually , it sucks the meaning and energy out of your life . So try instead of thinking that you lack something , think of what you 've got , use that to motivate you that you 've gotten so much out of life already , and there 's so much more yet to come . Pick something you hate doing . In your case it might be any of the things you mentioned , painting your walls , washing the dog . Or maybe a phone call/email you 've been delaying or running an errand you 've been asked of . Imagine that pattern is a place you hide in . That 's your comfort zone . What does it feel like ? You probably felt you were in a safe and familiar place . Free of the pain the world brings with it . This almost completely re-creates your comfort zone , but it leaves out the final ingredient . Strange as it might seem , merely escaping pain is n't enough for us . We insist the pain be replaced with pleasure . We do this with an endless array of addictive activities : internet surfing , alcohol , drugs , the aptly named `` comfort food '' . You order out , which is more likely less healthy than cooking , you might smoke , I did and it was n't all that good for me , but for those few moments , you get relaxed and feel stress free . All these behaviors are widespread - we 're an entire culture looking for it 's comfort zone . You weave those activities into your daily routine . Some get high every evening with their friends eating pizza and might feel like they 're in an alternate universe . I will never get that , but for them it works , they take one hit and the rest of the world disappears . This alternate world , which for you is different , as is for most people , feels like a soothing , pleasurable , warm bath , as if , for a moment , you 've found your way back to the womb . These `` warm-bath '' activities just cripple us further . The more you hide in the warm bath , the less willing you become to deal with the cold shower of reality . Ask yourself what your warm bath activities are . The more frequently you indulge in them , the more likely it is that you 're using them to create a comfort zone . Here 's another exercise I 'd like for you to try : Feel yourself indulging in one or more of these behaviors . Imagine the pleasure you feel lifts you into a womb-like world . How does this world affect your sense of purpose ? Think about these things . Try and change your thought process regarding them and make yourself more productive . It takes 21 days to make a habit apparently , so take one task at a time , something you are avoiding , and get into the habit of facing it daily and forcing yourself to do it . The same way you might wake up for work or class or whatever it is that you 're doing with life , you have to face other tasks . There are days we might not want to wake up at all , and just sing 'I 'm never waking up ... ' but the reality is , we have to , reality awaits and we have to face it otherwise our problems pile up and the stack of things we have to do gets bigger and bigger and we struggle harder and harder because it seems ever more daunting . The more we put things off , the harder they become to face . Think about someone you might admire . In my example it would be Elon Musk . He 's like a modern day Tesla . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla - electric car company - was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . So no ordering out , being lazy on the couch ... ( Which makes me feel like a hypocrite as I 'm writing this , as I 'm being lazy , eating delivery from this place called Burger Lab and not doing anything productive ... aha . ) But moving on , because Elon avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . He 's like an [ Ubermensch ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ % C3 % 9Cbermensch ) in a way . Always in the news with some new crazy project , and yet finding the time to have a family . The avoider , which would be you and me in this example , only care for immediate gratification ; we take no responsibility for the future . But we need to try our hardest to find a way to . The future being the things we need to get done that we 're lazy to do . That 's why you might have regrets about your past , I know I do . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . The moment you do this , you activate a force more powerful than the force to avoid pain . ( and I 'm not talking some high above force , just something within all of us , but see it as you find fitting ) Now as an avoider , like most people , we choose avoidance instead . As a result , you don ’ t live up to your potential , never becoming fully yourself . ( Just my statements , you might feel differently about this , not meant as negative criticism , just being constructive ) Like for example , my mom was always making negative remarks to me , and I tried hard to get past them and prove her wrong , but I started to feel I did n't want to be vulnerable anymore . That turned me into a limited version of who I wanted to be . I set up walls and did n't let anyone past them , and it took a long time to get over that , and I 'm still not , but I 'm trying , and I think everyone in a similar situation should do too . Just try and tap into yourself , find a center in you , and think of what you are avoiding doing , but then start to focus on how that feels , not the action itself , but how it makes you feel , and make yourself desire that pain or whatever it might be . Try and make yourself desire the feeling that what you 're avoiding is creating . You ’ ve now taken your normal desire to avoid pain and reversed it into a desire to face it . Doing this regularly will reveal the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . That ’ s why desire is a crucial part of this . It keeps you moving toward pain . You ’ re not desiring pain because you ’ re masochistic ; you ’ re desiring pain so you can shrink it . When you become confident you can do this every time , you ’ ve mastered your fear of pain . I do n't always remember to do this , but when I do , it helps me get over a task quickly and I feel satisfied knowing I 've managed to do something I 've been slacking off about . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the endless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and fuelled your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . You had one goal and nothing was stopping you from reaching it . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,elonmusk,"Also , he 's one of the few rare individuals that refuses to have a limited life . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . Because he avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . Always in the news with some new insane project , and yet finding the time to have a family . Most of us are avoiders , we only care for immediate gratification ; and take no responsibility for the future . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . Elon has mastered the impossible , he does n't feel pain most of us do . Pain can be in the form of rejection of projects , loss of finances , etc . It manifests itself in many ways . Most of us , despite such setbacks , try to get past them , but there comes a point where we do n't want to be vulnerable anymore . And that decision makes us a limited version of who we are meant to be . Elon on the other hand has mastered facing and desiring pain . It 's not that he 's desiring having no money or his business failing , he 's facing the pain the situation creates itself . Doing this reveals the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . To quote Elon : '' when I was a little kid I was really scared of the dark . But then I came to understand , dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength-400 to 700 nanometers . Then I thought , well it 's really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons . Then I was n't afraid of the dark anymore after that . '' Desire is a crucial part of learning to conquer pain . It keeps one moving toward pain . He 's not desiring pain because he 's masochistic ; he 's desiring pain so he can shrink it . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the countless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and pursued your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of . Most of us become aware of pain and start to build up walls and comfort zones . But to be truly Elon , you need to eliminate all of that fear , and just do it ! Whatever it is , face it , and work on it , no matter what others think or say or what comes your way .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Do a lot of research , look up facts , statistics , information , anything to further your knowledge on a specific topic then create short animations that broaden people 's perspective/information on that topic . Perhaps create a YouTube channel and then forward that to any companies/NGO 's that you 'd like to work for and explain that you 're so dedicated you 're willing to sell your car and relocate because you 're so into the cause .

Admittedly mistakes were made , but every human makes mistakes , especially when we do n't know any better . You ca n't blame yourself for your mother 's condition , the pain she went through or not knowing how to deal with it . I know your mother would n't want you to do that . She 'd want you to forgive yourself , and live your life without being paralyzed with regret and suffering from low self-esteem . It is possible to raise your self esteem by investing in yourself , doing things which you feel improve yourself , and giving yourself credit for your accomplishments and positive traits . Learning new skills , trying new things , anything that you feel betters yourself as a person really . Exercise is a good one , and studies have shown it is as effective as an anti-depressant . You already have a job and are sustaining yourself . That 's more than a lot of people your age .

12084182,relationships,"There 's actually quite a few ways you can get chlamydia . My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past . The birds carry it , get sick and then sicken their owners . There is Chlamydia pneumoniae , and it causes a different form of pneumonia . You find this infection more often in older people . It 's not common ( and neither is psittacosis ) . There are also chlamydia eye infections , too . Chlamydia in the eye is rare in countries that have better sanitation and hygiene . But it blinds many women in Africa every year . Not that I intend to exonerate the girl myself , but I would like to note that vaginal chlamydia is often silent in women , and it can go undetected for a long time . If she has not had a STD screen in a while , the infection could have gone undetected , and she may have given it to him .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

They essentially turn into zombies and walk around until the fungus has found a convenient spot . If other ants spot them , they take them away so they do n't infect anyone . There 's a colony of female only ants , that are all clones of the queen , and reproduce by cloning themselves . Ina regular ant colony , only the queen is allowed to reproduce , if other ants have sex , they give off a scent that they did so and other ants have orders to beat them to death , so the ants find ways to mask that smell . They may even enslave ants from other colonies and make them work for them !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,getdisciplined,"Tell your mind otherwise , try and see your mind as a completely separate thing . As , not you but the voice in your head that tells you to feel and act a certain way . Tell it to fuck off and that you 're in charge now ! You have an absence of awareness of what 's going on around you , except for the thoughts that are continuously passing through your mind . It is the state of being so identified with the voices in your head , that you think you are the voices in your head . It is when we identify with this inner chatter - when we come to think of it as us - that thinking becomes compulsive . We do it all the time , ceaselessly , and the idea that we might ever enjoy a respite from thinking never occurs to us . We come to see our thinking , and our continuing to exist as people , as one and the same thing . Not being able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction . But we do n't realize this , because almost everybody is suffering from it . So it 's considered normal . The sense of self that we construct from identifying with our thoughts is what we call the 'ego ' . And by definition living in the service of the ego can never make us happy . Why can the ego never bring happiness ? Eckhart Tolle argues that the Stoics , who concluded that our judgements about the world are the source of our distress . But he takes things further , suggesting that these judgments , along with all our other thoughts , are what we take ourselves to be . We 're not only distressed by our thoughts ; we imagine that we are those thoughts . The ego that results from this identification has a life of it 's own . It sustains itself through dissatisfaction - through the friction it creates against the present moment , by opposiing itself to what 's happening , and by constantly projecting into the future , so that happiness is always some other time , never now . The ego , Tolle likes to say , thrives on drama , because compulsive thinking can sink it 's teeth into drama . The ego also thrives on focusing on the future , since it 's much easier to think compulsively about the future then about the present . ( It 's really quite tricky , when you try it , to think compulsively about now . ) If all this is correct , we have inadvertently sentenced ourselves to unhappiness . Compulsive thinking is what we take to be the core of our being - and yet conpulsive thinking relies on our feeling dissatisfied . The way out of this trap is not to stop thinking - thinking , is exceedingly useful - but to disidentify from thoughts : to stop taking your thoughts to be you , to realize , that 'you are not your mind ' . we should start using the mind as a tool , instead of letting the mind use us , which is the normal state of affairs . When Descartes said 'I think , therefore I am , ' he had not discovered 'the most fundamental truth ' , Tolle insists ; instead , he had given expression to 'the most basic error ' .

Definitely want to say that you should be on campus , not just because the online classes suck ( they really do , it 's so boring ) but because you get to network with people , experience a new environment and can experience so much more that the campus has to offer , such as talks from industry people ( sure , you can see them online , but it 's better being there in person and asking the right questions , and meeting people , networking ) If it were me , I 'd go for the Game Design , but both sound good . I 'm in Show Production , loads of fun , my boyfriend is in Game Art , and he enjoys it too , though from what I 've seen it 's super easy , last month he had what he said was one of the most boring classes as they switched round how they were going to approach that class , he decided to not do his best , got an 85 % and was the highest in his class in terms of grades ( I could n't believe it , my group is way more competitive , I guess people there do n't care as much )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Here 's his banner : http : //images.neobux.com/imagens/banner9/ ? u=pathal2123 & amp ; u3=8833260 This is mine after about 1-2 years http : //images.neobux.com/imagens/banner9/ ? u=soulcorruptor & amp ; u3=4420746 I 'm not as dedicated , stuff comes up and on some days I do n't click , or I get too busy , but I do try my best to click as often as I can . ( usually periods of daily clicking and then a random period where I do n't click a few days ) All of the 300 there was invested back into my referrals , so it will be a while before any of that money becomes my own , but since I got it for nothing , it 's worth sticking around and waiting for it to work out so I can have my cake and eat it too ! : ) Or at least I hope that will happen .

I 'm 6 years old and do n't know what it 's called , in the stall I tell my friend I have a problem and she tells me I have the 'pennies ' which of course her parents told her . So we 're headed to the secretary 's office to have her call my house and tell them cause we did n't know better , and I tell her I have pennies and she asks to see them ( clearly not understanding my terminology ) and I 'm about to take my pants down when our teacher shows up looking for us saying we should be in class and not elsewhere and not paying attention to me having 'pennies ' it was n't till I got home that I got my penny problem sorted .

12084182,beermoney,"Hey all , odd question , but does anyone want my account ? I 've been on the site for ages ( no investment ) but I got enough to get golden and had about 300 referrals almost , but then had no internet for a while and really things were hectic , no free time so I started losing referrals and I feel the only way to save my account now is investing or just really clicking religiously . Neither which I have time for . My account has about 50 referrals . According to my friend ( who got me into the site , as I saw his statistics ) he earns about 100 $ a month , no investment on his end , but a LOT of time . OP is right , it will take a long time for anything to happen . But I think it 's worth it in the long run . Recycle when your referrals have n't clicked in a week and/or if they have average clicks below 2 or even 3 . But start of with 1-2 as it 's really hard to find users that click daily . Renew at the highest option possible ( currently 240 as it has the highest discount - definitely worth it ) This is how much I have earned in total : http : //images.neobux.com/imagens/banner9/ ? u=soulcorruptor & amp ; u3=4420746 This is my friends earnings : http : //images.neobux.com/imagens/banner9/ ? u=pathal2123 & amp ; u3=8833260",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I guess he was hoping I 'd go for a puppy to keep me amused ( and less attention on his end ) and did not expect what would happen next . When we got there I saw this old dog just lying in the corner of his cell , all alone , no one wanted him , he was heartbroken and I was gon na be his savior ! I 'll never forget that day , they told me he was 12 years old , he was their oldest dog they had . Something about him , about his loneliness , and maybe mine too , made me realize we were the perfect match ! All the other dogs could jump around , wag their tails all they wanted , pull off those cute puppy faces , but I wanted him . We bought him everything new , collar , bowl , a chew toy , and took him home . I took him for a long walk and he fell asleep on the bed next to me . I never expected that I would wake up to him not with me anymore . For years I kept blaming myself , that I did something wrong , even though they told me it was not my fault . It was n't until I was much older that I realized that , that was probably the best day in his life , and he waited his whole life , using whatever energy he had left , hoping that someone would love him , if at least for one day , and I gave him that and he went to rest in peace .

Either way I 'd be really surprised and a little creeped out that someone got a ticket just to see me , but depending on the ex , I 'd either be okay with it or feel very uneasy about the situation and lock myself up . I know you 're not gon na back down cause you 're like me . I 've been in situations where I asked for advice and no matter how many people told me the same thing , I found counter arguments hoping they 'd change their minds and give me advice that in my head would be the ideal situation even though I knew it was n't . I would say try and contact her first cause it might creep her out that you went out of your way to find her contact info and so on ... Or if you 're planning to go there , make sure to let her know , do n't have to tell her about the ticket cause she 'll definitely get the wrong idea about you flying over just to talk about a break up that happened 1 year ago . I 'd say find a way to call her or text her . Well personally I think writings better as she has to read it all before responding and wont but in and shut you off . If you call she might put the phone down . Writing a letter is great as she has the option to chose if she 'll read it or not . If she does , make it clear that you 're over her , so she knows that you 're not wanting to meet up to get back together cause that 'll stir up old memories and make her think how you 're just gon na hurt her again . Once you 've made that clear , just tell her you 'd like to meet up , you 'll be in her area and it would really mean a lot to her or mention that you have a ticket and the relationship meant a lot to you and you thought you were doing what was for the best at the time and her parents disapproved of you and that you felt you needed some closure .

12084182,Paranormal,"Nothing as drastic as the other three posts , but I used to hear the sound of chairs screeching above me when I went to bed to sleep , like someone on the roof was dragging chairs , and no one could hear it but me . Another thing , years ago mom had some guests over and a woman told her we have a ghost in the house and he 's reading a newspaper . I did n't think too much of it . Weird person . Then a friend of mine about 2-3 years ago told me I had a ghost in my room and he likes to read newspapers but he 's annoyed that it 's on the same page for a while now ( I do n't really read ) So that kinda freaked me out , and sometimes my dog loves to bark into the middle of nowhere at absolutely nothing . It drives me crazy cause I feel there 's a ghost somewhere , and strange thing is I guess I feel a little afraid ? I mean I 'm not scared of them like watching horror movies , those are fun for me . But I guess the realization that there 's something unknown out there and it 's in my room watching me makes me feel a little uncomfortable ... Also I a made a post about this , I had some premonitions in the past year and I just felt something would happen or kinda saw it happen and it did and it 's really weirding me out . hahaha",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"No down votes from me . I was 11 when I got molested by a guy at the beach . Long story short , years later trying to do it for the first time with my boyfriend , I ended up beating the crap out of him when we tried to do it as I had horrible visions of what happened when I was younger flash before me . I just kept hitting him and crying and ended up having to explain why , it was so hard for me as I had never told anyone before about what happened . That fueled some anger in him I guess , and he would n't stop pressuring for the details , and finally I caved in and told him . Pretty much every time we tried to get close , he 'd end up getting so anger filled that some guy did that to me that it ended up tearing our relationship apart . He just could n't get over it .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"A slightly different situation on my end , but still dealing with it in the same way . When I was younger , just beginning school , so 1st-3rd grade , I got bullied so much and the whole class hated me , and it was so traumatic for me . Now , years later , when I talk about it , I joke about it , but I start crying . Well the other night I was talking with a friend and the subject somehow came up , and I was laughing how all the kids would throw lunch food at me and call me names and stuff but I was crying at the same time , trying to laugh it off but it still bothered me in a bad way . Do n't know why I try to laugh about it , she was nowhere near laughing , more in shock . 'Why are you laughing about it ? '",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"That 's not bad at all . For a research paper at school I chose to study the sex trade industry . Girls as young as 11 get traded , or even younger on some occasions . Stories from survivor girls include the most gruesome shit you 'll ever read . To sum up the day of a girl working as a prostitute : Almost no sleep , drugs keep you awake , barely any food , if you do n't sleep with at least 30 men ( in some cases more ) a day , you get beaten badly , having a bad day ? Your pimp does n't care . On your period ? Lower the light so the customer does n't notice . Hungry ? Well tough luck . Absolutely horrible . One girl got forced into a marriage by a man that claimed money for her , he sold her for a couple thousand , remarried other girls in the same way . She ended up being used as a sex slave in a guys house , tied her to a wall in chains and his friends could fuck her whenever they pleased . Another girl got sold into the sex trade by a false job ad , she found her way home finally , pregnant , her dad failed to believe her and the rest of her family , they called her a slut , so she went to a family friend who offered her a job and told her it was safe , when really she just got sold into the sex trade again . If you want references let me know and I 'll find my paper and cite the sources/books I read . That 's just some of the stuff I 've read . Another unrelated story was a girl that got molested by her grandpa since she was 4 , that led her to do heavy drugs so she would n't sleep cause sleep induced dreams of him molesting her . As a rape victim myself , I do n't even want to know what that feels like for them , it 's bad enough that I occasionally have flashbacks and nightmares about it . I really hope to be able to do something about it some day , go out there and help these women in need .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I remember lying that I was going to a sleepover at a friends house and then I 'd just bike home or walk home from town really late . I never told her stuff , mostly cause I knew how she 'd react , she was overly protective and strict , and I still do n't tell her stuff . Had she been different , like your parents , I think I 'd be able to be open as I know she 'd be ok with that stuff .

12084182,IAmA,"Ok , here 's my opinion as a girl : First thing , everyone 's different , but I do think you should try out different things and find what works for you . For me personally , masturbating by hand and fingering myself has never done much for me , tbh it 's probably me not wanting to invest a lot of time learning what my body likes as I know that I can easily be thrown out of the mood and then I 'll be annoyed and so I do n't bother with that . It rarely got me anywhere . What I do when I 'm in my bedroom , put some porn on and masturbate by rubbing my underwear . I also usually have daily pads in there ( but that 's usually out of habit , I always wear them and I find when I 'm doing it , it also adds pressure , without one , it 's not the same . ) So I just rub and get off . But seriously , that 's nothing compared to what happens in the shower . Just rubbing will give me a mild orgasm , and after a few times it gets weaker and then I do n't do it for a while so when I do it , it gets strong again . Maybe do n't do it for a while and then see what happens . But in the shower , it 's amazing . Take your shower head and bonus if you can change the strength and make it extra strong pressure or if you have a jet thing like in a jacuzzi . Mess around with that and see what happens , those are the best orgasms you can ever get . Just place it on your pussy and move it around and find what feels good and keep it there . Also note that if you feel like peeing , that 's normal , you do n't need to pee you 're just on the way to orgasm . And here 's something , I do n't know if it works for other girls , but I know it definitely works for me . Cold water . When I was a kid I was always the one daring to jump into the sea or the pool when it was cold , everyone else would slowly get in , putting little water on them to adapt/adjust . I would jump in and swim fast to get warm . Thought I also found out that moving my legs in cold water gave a good feeling , which I later found out was an orgasm ( kinda disturbing when I think about it now ) Anw , I used to fill up the bathtub with really freezing water and get in to feel that way . Though when I found out there were better ways to do it and learned what an orgasm is , then things changed . But if that is true to all girls , maybe try that : Fill a bathtub up to the top with cold water , freezing water will only do the trick and then get in quickly and just move your legs apart and close fast . And I 've never been able to get an orgasm through sex . I 've been with two guys , one was a virgin , and the other claimed he was good at it and whatnot , did n't do anything for me .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,funny,"I think that 's great . I really think it 's stupid how in the US you drive before you can drink . So of course a 16 year old that can drive to a party will drink and not know of the consequences . You learn to drink and what effects it has on you so then when you are able to drive , you know what your limits are . I hate when I see stupid kids here drinking and then driving cars ( I do n't know how they get access to a car as driving age is 18 here ) But I 've seen it happen at parties I 've attended . My parents were always against drinking and those things . Though I was never a crazy party type , but my best friend liked beer , so I got into drinking some of that when we were out . I know my limits now .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"I know I 'm not him , but I 'll try and put it from his perspective , take that how you will , I know I might not even know what 's going through his head . `` It 's been years since the incident , I 'm still depressed but I manage to go on . I 'm in college for game art , I suppose that 's good , better than engineering school , that was too easy , though I suppose this is too since I 'm better than most of the other students . I 'm bored enough to join a dating site , lets message some girls to see if they want to hang . Hmm , she seems cool , she 's into games too . Maybe we can play sometime . Oh God , she 's amazing , we spent every day together this week , I have n't had so much fun in years . I 'm in Love . I told her that today , I think it might have been to sudden when I blurted it out , she looked at me funny , but hey , I ca n't help what I 'm feeling . I asked her to be my girlfriend . There 's not a day we do n't spend together , I do n't want to be around anyone else . I broke down tonight , I guess my past caught up to me . I told her about my only other girlfriend , how she was in a car crash when we were 18 , after dating for four years , and how I had to pull the plug . Nothing was the same since . I was so depressed and gained weight abnormally ( after stopping all sports that I was actively in ) , that they had to remove my stomach , I became obese , I 'm better now , but she has n't seen what I was like . I told her that she was the only thing that made me feel good anymore . She made my world . We 've been together for 3 weeks , and she 's going away to visit her family in a little over a month for 3 months . I do n't want her to go but I do n't want to be too forward to suggest to go with her . I brought it up , kinda , I do n't get why she 's being weird about it , what has she got to hide ? She got a weird message the other night from a friend back home . I could n't sleep , it was 3am and I did n't like it , but there was nothing to suggest anything weird in their conversation history . I 'm worried she 's hiding something , I should just leave this place , forget it all . I do n't want to get hurt . She 's awake and convincing me to stay , that it was a wrong message , and that there 's nothing in the history , which is true . I 'll trust her . But as I say this , I do n't trust her going home , I 'm going to go with her , I bought myself tickets , it 's two months in and I 'm spending 2k to go be with her , is n't that romantic ? I hope she thinks it 's as romantic as I do . I hope she moves in with me soon , I told her I 'd get her a cheap car from craigslist so she can drive to school since I 'm not at a walking distance from it . We 're heading back home , her lease is running up and I suggested she moves in with me . It 's been 5 months now . I 'd like her to be with me , we have n't spent a day apart except from her being 1 week home until I got there . Her roommate brings up moving with some friends so she can move in with me , perfect ! I told her she 'd be paying less rent if she stays with me , besides , her mom just had expensive surgery and her parents are probably short on money . She 's not going to be selfish and spend more money is she ? She can get a car now with that money she was meant to use for rent . I lost my income , things have been a bit tight so I 've asked her to contribute to me more than usual . But we 're a couple and we help each other right ? I helped her with her stuff when she needed it , now it 's her turn . She wants to go out often , which I think is a waste of money ( by often I mean , 2-3 times a month ) . She goes out with her friends and stays up late , like 3-4 am and I do n't know what she 's doing or if she 's alright . She texts me all the time but I feel bad to interfere with her friend time so I tell her so but she still texts me . Then I start feeling bad for her so I stop texting , but then I sulk at how she 's out having fun while I 'm home alone . But it 's okay , I make sacrifices for the relationship . She says I should go out with my friends , but why ? I 've got her , she 's all I need , I do n't need anyone else in my life , she makes me happy , my friends were there just to kill time . I was still bored , even hanging with them . She gets me , like no one else does , she makes my day , anything she does is just magical . If she were to leave , I 'd be devastated . I said the other day that I 'd probably kill myself , then I realized later that she took it the wrong way . I noticed she posted to that Reddit site she 's always on , I did n't like her post , it sounded like she was unhappy . She mentioned that it was emotional abuse , but then I told her that I did n't mean it that way , I was joking . I was n't , but I did n't want to crush her , I love her , she 's my everything . I do n't want to hurt her . She told me it was n't the same , things have changed , she has different feelings now . It crushed me , I was devastated , how could she say that ? Was what I offered her not enough ? I got her everything that she wanted , even when she told me I did n't have to , I knew she 'd want it and was just modest . We still have sex regularly , 1-2 times a day , I know she 's not always into it , but she knows it makes me happy and I know she wants to make me happy . I do n't get how she can suddenly not be into it , it 's weird . I still try hard to get her to enjoy herself and hope that she changes her mind . I ca n't take it anymore , everything 's piling on , I 've got a warrant for my arrest , I failed to mention I have some bad habits , but it 's okay , she accepts me , bad habits or not . That 's what I love about her . I told her I could n't take it , and I got some sleeping pills . I planned on doing it right at the time she leaves , oh yeah she 's flying to see her sister for a month , I feel like she ca n't take it here anymore and it 's the only reason . I told her it was selfish of her to want to just hang with her sister while I 'm here struggling with a warrant and everything turning to shit . I used to make 4k a week , and now I 've got nothing . Except the job that I got right out of college , out of 500 people applying to the same company , 80 in my city , I got the job among 6 other people . I was that lucky guy . I mean , I also have a house , of my own , my own car , smart TV , gaming computer , 5 consoles , 4 laptops , etc ... But I 'm broke , really . I have nothing , I ca n't afford to pay for things soon . And she 's leaving . She found me , paralyzed in the bed , not feeling it , and called an ambulance . I told her to go , but she could n't , she stayed by my side . I made sure my parents did n't find out , it would devastate them . I got out but realized I could n't evade my warrant for too long so I turned myself in right before she got a second ticket to just go see her parents . My parents had to find out eventually . They were more supportive than I thought , I told her to not tell them all the details of what I did , just enough . Especially not about killing myself , I ca n't have them know that . She 's gone for the summer , I ca n't call her . I used to call her daily , and she 'd brighten up my time in here . I ca n't take it , I 'm not meant for jail . She 's back now , and she came to visit me once , but seems to be busy to come again . She wants to move out . I do n't see why she should , I mean , she can stay there , and does n't even have to pay rent , my parents got it covered , I do n't want to stress her while she has school and all these other stresses moving is too much for her . I told her I 'd help her once I 'm out , I want to help her . Plus money 's tight , so she should save up while she 's here and I can help her get money and fix things . It 's official , she 's leaving and sooner than I thought . I told her to at least stay until I can get house visits once a week for 10 hours . Just to hold her and hug her and watch a movie one last time . I was hoping the distance would make the heart grow fonder . Turns out I was wrong , oh so wrong . What do ? I get out of jail , I lost the job I had for the summer , I lost my car , did n't make payments . I have the house , but it 's empty , she 's gone and I 've got nothing .

12084182,AskReddit,"When I was in high school I had some really fucked up dreams that kept recurring . I 'd watch something take place ( usually some form of abuse or a murder , or something just downright atrocious ) and I could n't do a thing to help , I 'd be there physically and talking and trying to get people to notice me but nothing happening . So a girl would be raped , and I 'm just standing there , watching and not being able to do anything . This started happening after an operation I had in which they did n't administer the anesthetic properly . I woke up after the operation to find I could n't move or talk or respond . The doctors were trying to wake me up yet I was there , trying to talk to them to tell them I was awake and I could n't do a thing . It was a horrible fear of mine and I still have n't gone for that second operation I was supposed to go for ( 5 years later ) because of that fear . The dream manifests that fear in a strange way . I have lots of recurring dreams though . The most common being where I 'm running from something or someone . Usually with someone else or a bunch of people , or occasionally on my own .

12084182,canada,"Hopefully these tragedies will shine more light on our society 's mental health problems . General knowledge about mental health is pretty distorted . A lot of people disparage anti-depressants and other pills . Well , do you know why most people turn to medication instead of counseling or talk therapy ? No , it 's not because the drug companies are pushing their products on people . It 's because counseling and talk therapy are not covered by any healthcare plan , and they cost dearly . Moreover , it 's very difficult to obtain a psychiatrist in most provinces in this country . In Ontario , you need a referral from a medical doctor ... you ca n't just book your own appointments . If you manage to get such a reference , you 'll be lucky to land one appointment every six months or so . So what ends up happening is that most people are treated for their mental health issues by their family doctors or other regular MDs . And all they can really do is prescribe drugs and encourage you to seek counseling which you ca n't afford in the first place . This is the world that people suffering from mental illnesses face .

He was the hungriest man alive for me and he was the happiest man that he got a bar of chocolate ( or whatever ) . He could n't stop thanking me and everyone just stood shocked and I 'm sure in a similar way , his eyes just lit up and I 'll just never forget that moment . It really affected me somehow .

12084182,relationships,"1 ) Heard that story before . Until you start feeling lonely and realize someone is better for you and realize you do n't want to hurt your SO 's feelings ... I 've had guys tell me how heartbroken they were from before to get my pity only to do the same thing to me . Well , one guy , but I 'm sure there 's other people out there like that . Perfect liars too , always know what to say . 2 ) Maybe they do n't have sex yet ? Or early on ... But I assume by that , that she 's still into you , so this is a tough one . Maybe they 're just friends and she thought you 'd feel weird by it if you knew since he isnt ' a mutual friend or anything . Or maybe for the reasons she 's friends with him , and you would n't like them , but they 're anything but sexual . Or he likes her and she does n't like him but likes his friendship . This is my advice , bring it up , why is it weird to look at each others phones ? Me and by boyfriend do it all the time , nothing to hide , right ? Just say you want to check something . If she gets weird about it , ask why ? Or maybe be playful about it , be like , why is he texting you so much ? Hmm ? Or I do n't know how you guys are in a relationship , byut if you are that comfortable and playful , you can be like , oh Julia huh ? Let me text her and see if she notices that it 's not you , and take her phone from her . Prank her essentialy ... Or if that 's weird , talk to her friends , if you 're on good terms with them and they know you , just call 'Julia ' or whoever and ask her how things are going ... hint hint ... and then be like 'so Julia said you guys never met up ' or even better , make a surprise date for your girlfriend and call Julia and say , I know you guys are meeting up today , so I was wondering ... and then plan a surprise and she 'll be like , 'we 're meeting up ? ' Just find out indirectly what 's up if you ca n't confront her Talking is what saves any relationship , talk , talk , talk . Be open about things .

I would suggest explaining that it was your first relationship , and you have only spoken to him twice because that 's how little he mattered , it 's merely catching up since you were important people in each others lives . The main thing I want to say is that if he disapproves , maybe an option is to invite him along , as akward as it might be , it might give him the perspective that it 's the last time you 'll ever see him and nothing 's gon na happen since you invited him along and he might either feel more trusting of you or might decide to come along for your sake , so it 's a win win sorta , if you 're okay with him being there .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My current boyfriend ( that I love to death ) had one girlfriend before me , and she died in a car crash . Even though it would pain me to do this , I 'd prevent that so he did n't have to suffer the way he did ( totally messed up his life , he stopped exercising , caused him to gain a lot of weight since he ate a lot and did n't burn it off , and it got so bad that he became obese and his stomach overproduced acid and it ate his stomach and they had to operate to remove it , which resulted in no stomach , he can only eat a cup worth of food for a meal . No more . ) He 's lost the weight but you can see the scars from the surgery all over . I 'm pretty sure he 'd be better off not having to experience all that , also his life was very dull before he met me . And I know he would n't be with me unless I was physically around him , and we lived countries apart , and he 'd be with her at some point so I 'd just hate to live life knowing him but not at the same time , and so on ... I 'd stop my best friend from dating the bitch he was dating for 5 years that told him that she did n't love him for the past 2 years but stayed with him cause she felt sorry for him and finally felt the courage to tell him that since they were long distance for a year . Almost killed himself over it . Stop my dog from getting run over and suffering badly after that . Assholes ( tried to break into our house , he bit the guys leg - mind you , he 's a small terrier/poodle type mix and is n't violent at all , but knows bad intentions when he sees them ) They came back a few days later and as he chased the car ( according to neighbors ) they ran at him . Complete internal bleeding and for months he could n't move an inch without pain and suffering . Find better ways to make money . I was always scheming how to make more money , but definitely make better choices there . Maybe even make something I knew would be popular ( not necessarily something big , I do n't want to alter the world that much so that the whole future changes and I do n't know a thing about it - I do want to retain at least some control of my future ) Now that I know what people think about me , perhaps change their perceptions to something better ? If they did n't think much of me anyway ... ( A lot of people in high school thought I was weird cause I stuck to myself , I just did n't want to be a part of that stupid crowd )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

While someone waits 5 years to get adopted , because of adoption laws , others go out into the world without parents .

Had to start his own life , did n't want anything to do with the people from the adoption place , hated everyone there .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# The Carnivorous Hare ’ s-tail Cottongrass * *What is plant 's name , etymology , season for bloom ? * Ok , so… on the first glance you would call this cottongrass…but I have named it Eirophorum Dangerousus because when no one else is around these specific blades of cottongrass in front of my door get wildly unpredictable and grow sharp venomous teeth . I have not been able to show this trait to anyone yet because they seem to only do it when I ’ m on my own but I think this is my chance to show the world that this exists and needs to be taken seriously . In all respects except this one , the Eirophorum Dangerousus is equal to the hare ’ s-tail cottongrass ( Eriphorum vaginatum ) . They are native to bogs and other wetlands and grow to be about 30-60cm . The hare ’ s-tail cottongrass is a tussock-forming plant and the fruit is an achene . * *Where does it grow ? What does it look like ? Feel free to include an image ! * As far as I can tell , these plants only grow right outside my house but my hypothesis is that they exist in all appropriate climates but usually kill anyone that comes near them . * *What history does the plant have ? Who discovered it ? * This plant has probably been around for millennia because it will eat or poison anything that comes to close to it . Everyone that discovered it before me probably died from the poison . I noticed something was wrong because I kept finding corpses of rabbits and birds next to the plants but I originally thought there must be a den of some carnivorous animal close by . I was never a big fan of plants ( sorry Madam Pomfrey ) so I didn ’ t usually come too close to this particular bunch of cottongrass until one day when I was retrieving the newspaper and one of the bunch lashed out at me . Luckily , I was wearing full-body armor after a whole night of working in my laboratory . At first , I thought this was just a side effect of the chemicals I was experimenting with , but later inspections of the armor revealed significant traces of poison and I have since retrieved several samples to confirm my findings . * *What are its uses ? How were these discovered ? How does this plant help Madam Pomfrey care for her patients ? * This plant needs to be handled with extreme caution ! A steel armor needs to be worn at all times when handling this plant . However , there are uses to the plant that will be helpful in treating patients . When extracted and applied to a patient , this poison will eliminate any other poison and overpower it . With an equation I developed , the exact amount of poison can be calculated so that it overpowers most known poisons but only leaves the person with symptoms similar to the common flu for a week , which can obviously be very convenient .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species ? Hagrid used all his favorite , completely harmless animal friends , now presented in one compact species : the acromantula , the norwegian ridgeback and the three-headed dog . **Yes , you 're reading this right folks , all your favorite cuddlies at once ! ** * What is its name ? What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem . These magical researchers report back to Hagrid on a daily basis and send him monthly paintings to keep him up to date on what these cuddlies are up to . This author would not recommend keeping norwegian acrowoofs as pets unless your dwellings are inflammable but whatever floats your boat .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,relationships,"I do n't really know what this falls under . Background : I 'm 19 , living with my mom , stepdad and their son in a European country where it 's customary to live with your family until you get a job . My parents got divorced when I was 2 , but I saw my dad at least once a week and I was always much closer to him than I was to my mom . I never got along with my stepdad , especially since him and my mom got a child , because he uses everything I do as a reason to mock me ( for example , if I decide not to eat dinner with them I 'm ''on a diet again '' if I do I 'm ''finally deciding to get out of my room '' if I 'm taking too long to pick what I want to eat I 'm ''picky '' if I get a good grade in school I ''have no life '' ) . He also says those things to my brother when he thinks I 'm not listening . My dad died three years ago and because I was underage , I was justified to what is basically his pension money , 800€ a month until I finish college ( so that 's about 7 years of getting it which is 67,200€ ) . This money was only mine . Because I was only 16 and very upset and did n't even want to think about anything relating to his death , I asked my mom to take care of it . We decided the money would be going to her account and be put away every month , possibly to eventually buy an apartment for when I decided to move out . After a couple of months of her getting the money , I checked in with her and she said she had n't been able to put it aside because of something urgent . After another few months , the same thing . So we decided we would buy an apartment and rent it out ( I mostly decided on it because I saw she was n't going to save the money ) . I did n't do anything then because an apartment would be more money than I was going to get in the long-term and I was grateful she decided to buy it for me . Nothing happened with the purchase of the apartment even though I repeatedly asked about it and whenever I pushed too hard , she would call me ungrateful and unloving for even thinking about doubting that she 'll do it . Meanwhile , she has used this money to remodel the kitchen and bathroom while she keeps telling me we do n't have enough money to put any of mine on the side . Fast forward to this year when I started college . Because I have to eat out due to my schedule and receive no money beside what she decides to give me , her and I decided together that 200€ a month would be enough for me to buy myself food , pay for my bus rides and be able to save a bit on the side . A month after we made that deal , I went to the ATM to withdraw my lunch money and found out it was n't there . When I confronted her about it , she said she did n't have the time to do it yet ( the whole month ) . She promised she 'd take care of it that week and also give me what she owed me from the month before . She went last Friday , decided to give me 160€ a month instead of 200€ without even checking with me , saying that if I need anything more I can just tell her every time I want to buy something , and she also did n't give me any money for last month . I have begged her to let me move out and she wo n't . She says it 's proof that I hate my family and want to destroy it like the ungrateful daughter I am . She also said that she will divorce her husband before letting me move out ( and I think she will do it ) and when I brought up the fact that she ca n't use up more than 300€ a month for me she agreed but said that after 19 years of taking care of me , she deserves to get something for her effort . I could make the money go into my account without her permission , but it would naturally make her scream at me and cry because of how much I hate her . If I moved out without her permission , I am certain that she would follow me around , wait for me at college etc and do everything she could to make me come back . There 's also the issue of her parents which already think she 's a bad mother and as she says ( and I agree with her to some extent ) would make her life miserable if I moved out . The only solution I see right now is to move to America with my long-term boyfriend . That way my family would n't be able to force me to move back with them and I would n't have to listen to them anymore . His parents that know about this situation have also offered me to stay with them until I can figure things out . Basically the only thing that 's stopping me is that I 'm currently in med school and ca n't transfer because here medicine is a study like every other , not a post-graduate study , and I do n't have a degree in anything else . As such , I would have to find a way to transfer to something else or quit school and also stop receiving my father 's pension money , which would make moving a lot more challenging . I 've also told my mom already that since I am planning on moving to America eventually , I wo n't be needing that apartment , but she 's still intent on buying it with my money . I 'm sure there 's something vital to the story I 've forgotten since this has been going on for years and years . Thank you for listening . **tl ; dr** : My dad died and my mom 's taking all the money I should be getting while also not letting me move out . I want to run away from all of my family 's bulshit and move in with my boyfriend who lives across the world .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,HogwartsRP,"**Personal Information** Name : Leena Crakey Age : 11 Place of Birth : Isle of Man **Appearance** Short and slender , her hair is a muddy brown , cut short and always messy . Her skin seems permanently smudged from climbing trees and her eyes appear unusually big in comparison with her thin face , like two drops of green paint on a face made brown by spending so much time outdoors . **Personality** Leena is a bit shy and slow to trust at first , but once she gets to know you she 's very warm and fiercely loyal . Her laughter is loud and natural , always to be heard among her friends . She 's rather mischievous , not above setting up small pranks ( though always careful not to actually hurt anyone ) , but can also be patient and hardworking if it 's for something she finds important . Above all , she loves spending time with her friends and being there for them . Her world is full of excitement and laughter and she ca n't wait to make new friends at Hogwarts . **Hobbies** Anything involving the outside ( she does n't mind getting dirty ) , spending time with her friends , maybe just lying and chatting on their beds after a day of excitement . **Wand** Cedar with unicorn tail hair , 12 '' , pleasantly springy . **Backstory** Both of her parents being writers ( muggles ) , Leena was often left to entertain herself on her own . She quickly made friends with the rest of the neighborhood children and together they formed bands of pirates and aliens , battling each other in the woods surrounding her town . For some reason , whichever team Leena was on seemed to win more often than the other .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Now , A is asexual/aromantic and I guess you could argue asexuals and aromantics are queer because their sexual preferences do n't fit the norm , but it 's still a little different from what most people consider queer . Intersex , on the other hand , is not a sexual preference , it 's closer to trans in that your body/mind does n't match with your label in society . A lot more goes into making your biological sex than most people think ( hormones , outside sexual organs , inside sexual organs ) and sometimes those do n't all match up , though doctors at birth will usually mark you as whatever your outside organ is , or sometimes not even that - maybe you were born with both .

Our team of travel experts will then sit down with you and discuss your wishes then arrange the perfect experience – without telling you about it ! On the day of your trip , you just have to show up and hold onto the pre-prepared portkey ! Per request , one of our employees will travel to the location with you to make sure you settle in nicely ( not available for the survivalist package ) . Your accommodation will be included in the package , as will all food and drinks unless you specify otherwise . We offer a variety of customizable packages , help us choose the best fit for you ! * The standard package : Includes a week/two-week vacation for one to two people at one location put together by a team of travel experts . * The family package : Includes a family-friendly adventure that takes into account non-magic-performing travelers . * The adventure hop : Our most popular choice is a multi-destination experience that lasts between two weeks and a full month . You will be sent off to your primary destination and regularly supplied with new portkeys that will take you to another destination . The frequency of environment swaps is your choice and will determine the price of this package . * The survivalist : Our challenge is to challenge you ! This one-week experience will test your skills of survival and is only intended for the bravest of wizards and witches . Your environment will be changed multiple times by portkeys in disguise . Obviously , you could disapparate at any time but this is intended as a challenge to yourself . You will be observed to insure nothing goes wrong . Wizards and witches that make it through the week will be rewarded . *A testimony by Gilderoy Lockhart : Being the fearless adventurer I am , I of course went with the survivalist option . I requested an emphasis of monsters to see what their ‘ ’ adventure ’ ’ were really made of and test myself against them . I was faced in rapid succession with a colony of acromantulas , a horde of manticores and a hive of tarantula hawk wasps . Being as skilled as I am , I readily dispatched them . Then they threw a basilisk at me . I averted my eyes and quickly retrieved a mirror from my pocket ( I always carry a mirror ) , instantly turning the basilisk to stone with its own gaze , and returned home for my reward .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # By Thy Sparkling Brew The Triwizard contestants are always very talented witches and wizards , able to cast a variety of powerful spells , but do they have the versatility a true champion needs ? Many witches and wizards neglect one of the most useful and potent facets of magic : **Potionmaking . ** We propose to challenge the contestants with a series of four rooms , each with its own unique mini challenges designed to test more than raw power . The contestants will be allowed a 12 hour period in a private chamber stocked with potion-making ingredients and equipment to prepare ( as well as supplied with a potion bandoleer with which to carry vials ) and will be relieved of their wands immediately following their potion-making . In the process of completing the previous challenge , contestants will find themselves in possession of a piece of parchment , blank but for a picture of a potion . Upon holding this piece of parchment above a cauldron with a brewing potion , [ four additional images ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fjff1bo.jpg ) will be revealed on the parchment , each image providing a hint for one of the four rooms . The judges will be instructed to score the contestants based not on their speed of completion , but more the finesse and subtlety used in passing each obstacle . Therefore , a less straightforward path will be worth more than a more obvious one ; phasing through a wall would garner more points than knocking it over . Points will be reduced for injuries received from the various obstacles . Bonus points will be awarded for skill , imagination , and care in handling the challenges faced . & amp ; nbsp ; *The four rooms are as follows : * The **first room** consists of two chambers completely devoid of light . The antechamber is separated from the rest of the room by light-proof curtains , and has the following riddle carved on the ceiling : & amp ; nbsp ; *Go boldly forth unto the night* *Fearing not your fate ahead* *Step quickly , bravely , without fright* *If you wish to end up dead ! * *Move slowly , quietly , without noise* For sleep disturbed will cause your doom* *Should you tread with utmost poise* *You may survive to the next room . * & amp ; nbsp ; In the main chamber sleeps a mountain troll , sensitive to noise and light . Scattered across the floor are the skeletal remains of the troll 's previous meals , sure to wake him if kicked or stepped upon . Contestants objectives are to read the instructions in the antechamber , and move past the troll in the second chamber . & amp ; nbsp ; The **second room** consists of a rickety , swaying bridge over a moat of blast-ended skrewts . An enchanted wind ensures the bridge 's constant movement . Upon entry , contestants pass through a spell that completely paralyzes their legs . Upon exit , they pass through a counterspell that undoes any remaining leg paralysis . Inscribed on the wall is the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *A simple walk from door to door* *Without your legs is made a struggle . * *Will you crawl across the floor ? * *Can you do better than a muggle ? * & amp ; nbsp ; The bridge shall not at any point degrade or fall further apart except at two predetermined planks , which will immediately fall should any weight be put on them . We can not guarantee that the bridge will not at any point swing to the point of being upside down , especially given the variable intelligence of contestants . Contestants objectives are to pass from one side of the room to the other , preferably without falling into the moat . & amp ; nbsp ; The **third room** consists of a goblet on a pedestal , clearly marked with a symbol for deadly poison . It should be noted here that the supply room in which the potions are made is conspicuously absent of bezoars . Upon the wall is inscribed the following mockery : & amp ; nbsp ; *This room is easy , without malice ... * *no nasty creatures seek your death . * *Just down the contents of this chalice , * *take a step , and your last breath . * & amp ; nbsp ; The door at the other end of the room shall unlock when the final drop of the poison has been consumed , however , without some method of mitigating the poison , the contestant shall not make it more than two steps . Contestants objectives are to drink the poison , and to not die . & amp ; nbsp ; The **fourth room** consists of a gauntlet of mini-mini-challenges . The contestants must get through a relatively simple and straightforward obstacle course , with the addition of a spout of flame , continuously falling shards of razor sharp ice , and a dense cluster of Venemous Tentaculae , each of which completely obstructs a portion of the path ahead . Upon the wall is inscribed the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *Good work surviving , you may yet live ! * *You 've made it through the easy part . * *Three challenges this room will give . * *And not one for the weak of heart . * *Try not to burn within the heat* *If you truly be must told . * *Do n't supply a plant with meat* *And avoid bitter shards of cold . * & amp ; nbsp ; The obstacle course on its own is of a level than can be easily completed with minor to moderate athletic skill , but the specific obstacles should be expected to add some substantial difficulty . & amp ; nbsp ; EDIT : @ * # $ reddit formatting",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # Conservation - The pudgiemudgies & amp ; nbsp ; **Description** The pudgiemudgies are small forest creatures , not much bigger than an ant but incredibly cute . They look similar to a [ puffskein ] ( http : //www.deviantart.com/art/Puffskein-261178762 ) and are their distant relatives . However , pudgiemudgies live in groups up to 500 individuals and stay close to each other at all times . Consequentially , pudgiemudgie clans will look like a curious colorful moss patch to an uneducated witch or wizard but upon further observation it will become obvious that the ‘ ’ moss patch ’ ’ is pulsing and moving as pudgiemudgies communicate by dancing . Pudgiemudgies vary in color but one clan will always only consist of one color and all the babies born to that clan will be of that color . Scholars assume that the colors are based on their environment . Once a year , all pudgiemudgie clans of an area will congregate for a meeting and a ball . This event is known as a *kaleidoball* in scholarly circles due to the mesmerizing mixtures of different clans and their colors . & amp ; nbsp ; **Endangerment** The pudgiemudgies are pretty much defenseless and rely on their small size to evade any predators . Recently however , there has been an increase in the illegal trade of pudgiemudgies as decoration and even potion ingredients . Furthermore , due to the changes in global climate , some colors of pudgiemudgie clans are beginning to die out , most notable cobalt blue and electric orange . These two clan variations were found in colder climates and need a period of snow to continue producing offspring with their colors . When offspring of the wrong color are born in a clan , they have to find a clan with their colors , which can be a treacherous journey for a young pudgiemudgie . & amp ; nbsp ; **Protection** There have been a couple of plans made to protect this vulnerable species , including bringing up the fines for trade and possession of pudgiemudgies , and efforts to restore and protect the natural environment of the clans endangered by climate change . The most interesting of conservation plans , however , is to selectively breed pudgiemudgies in order for them to develop defensive abilities that would make them less desirable as decoration and harder to hunt , such as breathing fire and manipulating their environment . Your average wizard would be much less likely to scatter them over his Yuletide tree when doing so when doing so is likely to set that tree on fire .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

How many students do you want in your class ? ** The wizarding world is amazing and awe-inspiring but let ’ s be honest : the delay in technology can sometimes be inconvenient . There are ways in which muggles have definitely overtaken us . That ’ s why I want to not only teach young witches and wizards about the ways technology and magic can intertwine but also work with them to create new ways to improve the magical world . The new subject I am proposing will be called Wiztech and will incorporate muggle technology with magical ways or repurposing and improving it . **How long will you be a guest instructor for ? Are your classes consecutive or will you be doing various courses over the year ? Is your course a one-time exclusive ? ** I will teach students for a full year ( or maybe more if this class is successful ) . My classes will occur every week in groups of 10 to 15 witches and wizards . **What is your teaching like ? Can you share a lesson plan with us ? ** My classes will begin with a series of lectures introducing students that haven ’ t had experience with muggle technology before to the ways in which it works and ways in which it can be improved with magic . Afterwards we will begin workshops in which I will show the students how to incorporate magic and technology . The last part of our year will be spent on students working on their own projects in smaller groups . These projects will be represent the majority of the final grade in my class . **What sort of homework assignments do you plan to give our students ? ** Students will spend the first two thirds of our year together researching muggle technology and ways magic can be incorporated into it , and will be required to write essays on their findings . Homework will not be given in the last part of the year when students are working on their own project . Students can obviously spend time outside of classrooms figuring out ways to improve their project , however , students will not be permitted to work on the actual project without supervision . **Describe how you would like to begin your first class , or tell us about a previous teaching experience you are proud of . ** This will be my first time teaching a class at a school but I have taken on several young assistants in my many years of invention .

AgentSmax,funny,"If we are going into specifics then you are only partially right here . From wikipedia : & gt ; Fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 , basing it on three reference points of temperature .

This is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically : that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F ( −17.78 °C ) . The second point , at 32 degrees , was a mixture of ice and water without the ammonium chloride at a 1:1 ratio . The third point , 96 degrees , was approximately the human body temperature , then called `` blood-heat '' . Only 0°F was using salt water out of the three points .

AgentSmax,Tribes,"So I 've been having issues with Tribes Ascend for a while now ( last 1 or 2 patches ) . I usually have over 60fps consistently , but then I started having framedrops in intervals ( 10-20fps for about 10 seconds in 15-30 second intervals ) . It was very consistent - especially on full servers . I have tried many solutions - closing programs that could affect the performance , trying different drivers ... Nothing worked particularly well . Since it clearly was n't the graphics card lagging ( fps drop remained if I looked at the floor or at the sky ) the only possible fault is the CPU . One day I was monitoring the CPU with the task manager and came on the idea of changing the CPU core affinity . Turns out it works for me on no more or less than 4 cores . If Tribes runs on any other amount than 4 cores it starts either being jerky or has framedrop intervals . Computer specs : The laptop is an MSI GT780DXR CPU - Intel Core i7 - 2670QM Graphics card - Nvidia GTX 570m Ram - 8GB DDR3 **TL ; DR** - Tribes only likes exactly 4 cores on my pc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Third of all : There actually are a lot of big sponsors ( like siemens and intel ) that actually do support e-sports but that 's mostly the prize money . The money gathered through season tickets is what directly goes into upgrading the stream so more people could watch it without interruption and better quality , thus insuring the bigger growth of e-sports .

AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting games is n't `` talking over a game you play '' . I find people cast sc2 because they genuinely love the game and would like to try their hand at casting . From what I see in cod , there were actually vlogs with gameplay in the background . That is not casting . There is also a difference between `` need '' and `` want to '' . And you do n't know it 's going to be bad . If people do n't try we may not get good casters . You ca n't just say you will cast it in a new way if you do n't know you can pull it off . Casting style develops with experience .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting I would think is not talking random non-game related bullshit . Casting ( to me ) is play-by-play and analysis . Talking random shit is talking random shit . The thing is , cod community is n't really the same as SC community . From what I have seen , except for a troll here or there , the SC community is much more mature than any mainstream FPS community . The thing is , it 's always nice to see fresh talent . And if no one wants to someone who says `` uhm '' every two words , I would think they would want to improve their casting , which could only benefit the community . This may sound a bit optimistic , but I think people recognize quality .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"From what I have seen from the front page is either people wanting to learn SC , big events or some big stuff that 's good for SC , or something funny . I 'm not quite sure about the comments but I have found nothing wrong with it yet . The topics that are bad usually disappear pretty fast . Concerning the 100 people as good as Husky , It 's your problem who you would want to watch . It 's not like you 're forced to watch them . Nobody can be exactly the same as another caster . Everyone has unique properties . More options is often times good .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,arma,I 'm not an expert in this but I reckon the explosive in those grenades is only powerful enough to launch shrapnel and is n't really meant to do anything else . The shrapnel is most likely designed to penetrate and the mass of shrapnel is so little it would n't really move you a whole lot . That 's my theory .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"Though I wish it was better I would n't say it 's terrible . I find the sound assets miles better than ArmA 2 . Weapons sound like they have actual power behind them . Walking sounds are great though it seems some sounds for different materials are still missing . Helicopters could use a bit more `` punch '' if you know what I mean , but otherwise they sound great . Sounds that bother me are explosions and miniguns . Explosions sound similar to arma 2 so they might as well be placeholders . Miniguns just sound weak . And I 'd like to hear some good echo . Although I wish something like [ this ] ( http : //youtu.be/MQt1jtDBNK4 ) would be picked up by game developers already . Sound technology generally seems to be lacking in games . EDIT : Seems like I should have researched the engine problems more . Yeah , they should definitely fix those things .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I also did n't quite understand it before posting my comment due to my mistake of not checking OP 's link . To quote the description on the page : & gt ; Sound positioning is terrible , there only seems to be few different volumes of gunshots- less than 50m , 50-250 , 250+ ( anything within that range sounds exactly as loud ) , you can only hear footsteps at less than 10m , when you lean your footsteps sound 3m away etc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"So basically I thought it was a sound assets problem , but it 's actually a sound engine problem . I do agree with that . It feels like that the sound engine really was n't the big focus point of the game or they have n't pushed out the proper one to the public yet . Hopefully it will be improved in the coming months .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I do n't know the specifics of either JSRS or the ArmA engine but I do n't see any other way to enhance awareness but through scripts/proper code . Different sound assets might come in handy under different conditions ( for instance a grenade explosion or weapons fire behind a wall ) , but most of this could be simulated via the engine should it be written to support that . I 'd probably go as far as to say that they are already working on it because the issues described in the link seem to be either a placeholder of some sort or maybe even an attempt at optimization . It 's still good to point out these issues though , just in case .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,The thing about sound is there was actually very good and promising sound technology back in the 90 's with a sound card that actually simulated sound very well with reverb and everything . I ca n't remember the name of it but I 'll try to find it . Most games used that technology back then . Why there seems to be no such thing today is iirc soundblaster bought it and pretty much scrapped it for its own inferior system .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"Okay , after a bit of a search I found [ this ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3D ) . You can find some demos on youtube showcasing the technology .

The question then is : Is it more efficient to create high pressure gas by explosions or by boiling water ? Turns out , boiling is better . Mainly because the boiler of a power station can be very finely tuned to produce steam at a constant rate 24/7 , while gasoline engines have to be able to adapt to various operating conditions , like cold/hot weather , slow/fast speeds , low or high load ( towing ) ...

When transmogrification was introduced in Cataclysm , Blizz needed to add some extra inventory space to every character in the game to store all their transmog items . They did this by reworking the key ring , which was the only container without a set upper limit ( because there used to be hundreds of different keys in the game ) .

Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation .

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

We find it funny when we see people of high status put into situations where they are humiliated/embarrassed . The juxtaposition of the two ( high and mighty vs. humiliated ) is a source of humor . For example : A priest slipping on a banana peal is considered funny because priests are seen as cautious , reliable , inflexible people who do n't make simple mistakes like stepping on slippery trash ; when the priest slips his stature is reduced , there is a juxtaposition and this can be considered funny ( no accounting for taste , obv ) A crippled homeless woman slipping on a banana peel is n't funny . She has no stature , when she slips she is not reduced in status , there is no juxtaposition , so that scene would n't ( generally ) be considered funny .

It basically guarantees you die to reflect , but it can also delete ( discharge style ) pretty much any boss that spawns with adds . 5 .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It 's hard to give a complete answer in a Reddit post , but if I had to attempt it , I would say that they are two ways in which nondualism exists . The Vedanta nondualism is nondualism *as opposed* to dualism . But when we juxtapose the two , we create another dualism . By contrast , the Śaiva nondualism is thoroughly nondualistic , which means that its nondualism *includes* dualism . A nondualism that rejects dualism is dualistic by this very rejection ; true nondualism must be able to absorb , integrate , its own opposite . To be less abstract : for instance , the relationship between the individual and God . In Śaiva advaita , they are identical . God is simply playing , willfully limiting Himself , His essence , and descending into individuality : being a mere man with all the stupidities and sufferings that this entails . This world is not an illusion , but it is an inward projection on the `` screen '' , as it were , of God-consciousness . So even maya is not merely negative and illusory , but it 's also true in a way , as it was created by God ( Śiva , which is ultimately You , Yourself - pure *I-consciousness* ) . If you 're familiar with European philosophy , the philosopher most resembling Śaiva idealism is Hegel . God , the Absolute Spirit , is involved in a kind of self-alienation , a cancellation of His simple perfection , and descends into limitation , negation ; later , he negates this negation itself , and regains his infinity ( when he recognize his true nature as the universal Self ) . So God Himself is dynamic , he is the totality , but at the same time , he projects his own opposite in order to reflect on what he is not . - The Vedanta view is more similar to Spinoza : the Absolute is a self-same Substance that is static , it 's like an absolute object that , because of being perfect , it is immovable , it does n't transform , nothing happens to it . If there is any happening , that is illusion , a mistake of perception . The Śaiva idealism would reply : but this illusion , too , is a Power of that God ! So , from my very limited and also partisan perspective , the difference is that the Śaiva nondualism is more thorough and radical .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

However , I think all the peculiarities of Kamakura-era sects like Shin can be deduced from the common Tendai background . - Even more interestingly , I found out Chinese Tiantai was influenced by Japanese Tendai since 10-11th century on , mainly because China lost its own texts ( by Zhiyi and Zhanran ) , and those texts were conserved only in Japan . )",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,Trika,"> 1 ) `` Trika '' means `` threefold '' . One interpretation states that Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir is known as Trika or Threefold System because it analyzes the nature of Śiva , Śakti and Nara . Śiva is God , and Śakti is God 's I-consciousness . Nara is man ( the human being ) . Trika teachs that Śiva , Śakti and Nara are not different from one another . In short , Man and God are one and the same . In fact , just the Supreme Self , known as Śiva in this philosophical system , is the Self of the entire universe . > 2 ) Therefore , there is no difference between Śiva ( God ) and Śakti ( God 's I-consciousness ) . God is and knows He is . There is not any difference at all . > 3 ) Śiva is a name for the static aspect of God . > 4 ) Śakti is a name for the dynamic aspect of God . > 5 ) Śiva-Śakti is Freedom Itself . > 6 ) Therefore , the human being is inherently free too . > 7 ) However , the human being experiences bondage because of `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) . > 8 ) Nevertheless , that mala is not something outside human being himself . > 9 ) God becomes `` man '' ( so to speak ; because lastly God is God and becomes nothing ) through mala ( impurity , limiting condition ) . In a word , mala arises from God . > 10 ) Śiva or God is not inactive . He has Śakti or I-consciousness . In short , He has Will , which gives rise to Knowledge and Activity . > 11 ) When a human being realizes his inherent unity with Śiva and Śakti , `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) ceases to exist completely . > 12 ) His realization puts an end to the whole `` apparent '' bondage . > 13 ) Since a human being is essentially God , manifests the entire universe around him ( maybe a `` difficult to accept '' teaching ) . > 14 ) Even though Non-dualism between God and human being is predominant in this philosophical system , all others viewpoints ( mostly dualistic ) are explained and included too . > 15 ) The universe is the playful unfoldment of God 's power . Therefore , the universe is born right now from Joy . > 16 ) Unhappiness is experienced by a human being when he becomes oblivious of his spiritual nature . > 17 ) When he remembers his spiritual nature and realizes his unity with God , unhappiness is turned into happiness . > 18 ) Mala or impurity is nothing but ignorance of one 's essential nature . > 19 ) Human mind is Śakti Herself having undergone a process of successive contractions . > 20 ) Therefore , human mind experiences complete happiness only when it merges in God . > 21 ) God is not a void , but a Self full of I-consciousness . > 22 ) He may appears to be a `` void '' because He does not contain , in His innermost nature , any objects . > 23 ) The human being must understand that his own mind is the Divine Mind having undergone a process of succesive contractions . > 24 ) Consequently , understanding of one 's mind is encouraged , not simply control of it . > 25 ) To control mind , as it were , one must firstly understand it . -- - source : http : //www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/en/trika-1-1-non-dual-shaivism-of-kashmir/496",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,PureLand,"In Jōdo Shinshū at least , the answer is yes . Edit : To expand on that , I 'll quote the new book by John Paraskevopoulos , writer and Shin priest from Australia . In it , he reproduced liturgical correspondence , in one of the Q & amp ; A we find this very question : & gt ; Q : I came across a Japanese Shinshu scholar who states that *it was the Dharma-Body itself that incarnated as Dharmakara* . The identity of the Dharma-Body and Amida is thereby made explicit , and I remember you describing Amida as the 'personal ' face of the Dharma-Body . Amida is not just another Buddha and , even though all Budhas are , in essence , of the Dharma-Body , and invoking or worshipping them is , in effect , referencing the Absolute , Amida is the Supreme Buddha in Whom all other Buddhas may be subsumed . & gt ; A : Regarding your remarks about Dharmakara , *Shinran himself actually said 'Manifesting a form from this ( formless ) treasure-ocean of Suchness , calling himself Dharmakara Bodhisattva , and making the unhindered Vow as the causes , he became Amida Buddha'* . In that sense , you are quite right - Amida is more than `` just another Buddha '' but a manifestation of the wisdom and compassion inherent in ultimate reality itself . ( p166,167 , *The Unhindered Path* by John Paraskevopoulos ) -- - This idea of `` Suchness-itself-as-compassionate '' is the special mark of the Shinshu school , perhaps not found in any other PL school . I think this ... rather unconventional ... view of Amida ... was not derived from `` standard '' PL theory of the Shan-dao `` line '' , but rather comes from Shinran 's Tendai background ( he was trained as a Tendai monk ) , his thinking seems perfumed by Tiantai theories of nature-inclusion / interpenetration which allow such maneuvers .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It only appears that way and I 'll tell you why I think that 's the case . As a non-American follower of Shaivism : 1 ) The separation between religion and philosophy is more pronounced in the West , because of historical reasons we do n't need to go into . So you wo n't include Leibniz or Hegel in the list of `` Christian philosophers '' , even though they were , and their thought contains a Christology etc . If we were to include say , a Hegel , into the umbrella `` Christian thought '' , then Christianity would suddenly become at least equal to Hinduism in philosophical depth . The trick is that in the case of Buddhism and Hinduism , many philosophers are included as religious thinkers ; while in the case of Christianity , the thinkers , even if Christian , like Hegel , philosophized about Christ , are simply considered `` philosophers who happened to be Christian '' and are n't thought of as `` Christian thought '' 2 ) American Christianity - probably here you mean the mainland Protestants - have a somehow anti-intellectual attitude towards existential questions . You know , the *Bible says it , I believes it , that settles it ! * - so when you break away from *that* , you want to go as far away from it as possible from anything related to Christianity . In the Catholic tradition for instance , you have profound mystical writings , texts on meditation , similar in Sufi Islam or in Buddhism .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,Buddhism,"This is not the `` ultimate standpoint '' , though . It 's still caught up in duality ( the duality between duality and non-duality ) . Huang Po knows this of course , as he remarks elsewhere : * '' Ordinary people look to their surroundings , while followers of the Way look to Mind ; but the true Dharma is to forget them both . `` * Here `` looking to surroundings '' means being caught up in distinctions and nonduality . `` Looking to the Mind '' means overcoming dualistic distinction , refraining from dualistic distinction . `` Forgetting them both '' means seeing the non-distinction between distinction and non-distinction , between Mind and surroundings . So the quote you show is the `` second step '' to take , to see oneness in everything . But that `` oneness '' is still caught up in dualistic thinking , and it means that the mountains are something other than mountains and the rivers are something other than rivers . You can arrive at the ultimate standpoint through mere logical means like this : What 's the difference between dualistic and nondualistic thinking ? Whatever answer we may come up with , that will be already `` dualistic distinction '' . So , from the standpoint of nonduality , dualistic and nondualistic are one ; but then why refrain from dualistic thinking , if dualistic and nondualistic thinking are nondual ? The very idea of refraining from something and instead opting for something else is dualistic . Ultimately , nonduality is duality , duality is nonduality , and what is Mind ? Mind is mountains and rivers . TL ; DR : Dualistic distinction is oneness .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,artificial,"Because its body behaves similar to a dog 's , it triggers our empathy regardless of what we intellectually know about it ( namely , that it 's not sentient ) . This is like an optical illusion where even though you know it 's `` not true '' , you still see it . For instance , [ this picture ] ( https : //i.ytimg.com/vi/J4fJxavHRAA/maxresdefault.jpg ) is static not animated , yet even if you know that , you ca n't stop seeing the movement . Similarly , we wo n't be able to stop our empathy from triggering even though we will know , intellectually , that `` it 's just a machine '' . This will have some interesting consequences as I think the more emotional people will even act irrationally to `` protect '' machines , and since the majority is like that , it will create confusing social situations . But what fascinates me is that the empathy we feel toward the *automaton* actually demonstrates how we ourselves are automatic , too - that is to say , even something as `` human '' as empathy ( we usually consider it an authentically human emotion ) is just an automatic trigger , not different from a program running in a robot .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
