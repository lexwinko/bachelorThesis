123456789012345678,wow,"Hey guys , i used to play WoW long time ago , and i stopped when Cata came out . Few days ago , when i went to watch the Warcraft movie i had no idea that they were giving away free game codes at entrance and it kinda caught me by surprise , but i when got home i decided to make a new battlenet acc and check out what has changed . Some things i like , some i hate , but this is n't about that . I am kinda asking myself ( and you i guess ) , is it worth playing now ? I feel that with the release of Legion so near , i wo n't ever get to experience the Raids of WoD , or any from Cata and Pandaria . I do n't care much for PvP , but when it comes to PvE i am kind of completionist and i like the cheevos . That 's really the biggest issue for me , because from what i saw till now , raiding guilds are either taking themselves way too serious or are too casual , not even organized . So my question to you is , should i stick with it now or not ? And also , what 's up with people not defending cities anymore ? There were 2 Horde raids on IF and people were just standing at AH till they killed the auctioneers , and then just jumped around the attacking players while they cleaned the rest of the city . Is it just apathy or are city attacks something no one pays any attention to any more ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

As i later found out , it was bunch of Pakistanis and Afghans fighting over some shit . During the time we waited there was the Croat lady that checks tickets ( i think ) few seats behind me . She was talking to some guy telling him how she 's sick from all those migrants in the last few days , saying how in the begging she felt sorry but is now getting increasingly frustrated with them and the media for not showing the true picture . She said how they processed around 3000something of them yesterday and how there was less that 200 women and children among them . Those women and children where the first ones to be put onto the train , but as soon as the men got in , they started hitting the women that were sitting down and kicking them out into the hallway . She also said that they threw all the clothes and food out of the windows and even had some of them say how they do n't need our old clothes , the things they threw away were picked up by the locals and the gypsies . She also mentioned that they had some 50 year old guy that got heart attack , and that when the medics came and took his shirt off , they found thousands of euros tapped onto his body . In conclusion she noted that the only normal ones that behave like humans were Syrians , which ironically are the ones they encounter the least . She also said that Afghans smell like shit for some reason .

They left and we were stuck again , trying to make rent any way we could . Turns out that 's what they did , found people needing cash fast , move in for a brief period of time , and steal .

I think that bothered him in the end more than anything because he still brings it up and asks me to consider having my own kids . Anyway , my sister went for a job interview in a neighboring country , took her kids ( 7,8 ) and fell in love with a guy working for the company , they plan on getting married . My dad was so shocked . My other sister is dating a guy 10 years younger and he 's all tattooed up and in piercings . So he goes to me 'you know my friend Brian ? He got divorced , found himself a young girl and got two kids now he 's running around after them . He looks 10 years younger , says he has a purpose for life now , something to fight for . Maybe I should find myself a young girl and get a little kiddo ' ( although my parents are married , their marriage is really weird and strained and they almost divorced a dozen times but ended up just not doing it , they do n't really do anything together much anymore except family meals and him occasionally visiting to see how she is or staying at the house , but in a different bedroom . They both claim the other snores too much ) That hurt , on such a huge level . You were n't there for me , but want a kid to be there for and fight for ? It honestly was n't the first thing that popped into my head since dad told me that my sister 's getting married and I Was like , what ? Since when ? and to whom ? And then I was like , well , you 're 70 , so if that kids in high school when you die , what then ? or the age factor , you 're 70 'well at least he had a dad that loved him , that 'll always stay with him , kids love their parents no matter who they are or how old they are , I probably ca n't have kids , but if I did , I 'm sure it would n't judge me for my age ' . And then I felt shit because he was n't there for me and said that but I kept quiet cause he was like 'well if your sister gets to get married on a whim , the other one dates a guy 10 years younger with tattoos , and you do n't want kids , just to adopt and might marry a girl , then I think it 's fair I can want to have kids of my own , it 's been 10 years since I had any sexual relations ( note the viagra I spotted on his bedside table in a bag full of meds , possibly telling me otherwise , did he find someone already ? and just wants approval ? ) and it would be nice if I could have someone ... How unfair would that be on mom who 's sick and suffering ? Every time she knows he 's coming over , she insists on some blue ring he got her and does little things she normally would n't . To me it 's clear she still cares and wants something . I do n't think he does . Also , my oldest sister might be a half-sister . Wow . Interesting news from my middle sister , who says that 's why dads so panicked about neither of us wanting kids of our own cause those might not be his real grandkids . Sorry for the long ass rant . my mom started yelling at me earlier for forcing her to go get something rather than me get it for her ( we 're trying to get her to be active and not become a statue , her left hand has lost mobility because she refuses to use it , and she just watches tv all day , so I told her to get the item herself , it 's short , and she has n't been on her nightly walks in 2 days anyway because of rain so it 'll be exercise even though I would n't call it that as it 's 5 steps to the item and then 20 to bed ) . Anyway , she started yelling I 'm an idiot , over and over and I just lost it . I asked was I an idiot for trying to help her get back into shape ? Yes , apparently . Then I said I should just kill myself since I 'm that much of an idiot . she agreed and I said I was heading to the balcony and did , and when she said 'go for it ' I just lost it and almost jumped . Sorry for dumping this here but I had nowhere to put all this and I 've had the worst past 2 years of my life and all this shit piling on just makes it so hard to keep going . After not being able to do it , I sat and cried on the balcony and she came 10 minutes later crying herself , asking for an apology . Saying I do n't know how hard it is for her . A year ago I had a car wreck and spinal fusion . I could n't move my arms even an inch in any direction at first . Could n't move my head . It was painful and all the physiotherapy was a nightmare . I hated it , I wanted to yell at them and tell them to stop and that I could n't do it . But had I let that happen , I would almost be a statue right now . It 's the only reason I make her do things on her own sometimes so she can get back into shape .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,synthesizers,Awesome . I like the idea of having actual hardware and using analog stuff . I was taught on analog consoles and far prefer them to the digital ones we were taught .

12084182,synthesizers,"See , I did n't realize that there were two different things . Glad I asked here for advice , I realized how clueless I was about this whole thing . Our university classroom had some really fancy synths and they were definitely polyphonic and had some awesome functions in them and we had to 'compose ' something for our final project , basically just fit it within some criteria and I really had fun and realized that I missed playing piano and I could compose stuff like scores and when I looked up the synth , it was a couple grand so definitely out of my range , but these looked attainable .

12084182,AskReddit,"That post itself might very well not be real ( as most things on the internet are n't , and we should all be cautious ) . But things like that do exist out there . You 'd be amazed at what is real and people think it 's just there to be gore for us . That movie , where the girls go on a trip and take a random ride in a bus to their hotel thinking it 's an airport bus and one of them ends up on a shipping container with a cat litter box and stuff . That movie is actually pretty spot on with what happens . When I was younger I was approached by someone late at night ( I was like 14 coming home from a night out ) and I later found out that they were a convicted sex trafficker trying to get me to go with them . It fueled my anger towards how little is done to help sex trafficking victims . As a college student I did a research paper on sex-trafficking and slaves because it bothered me so much how little people knew about it and I wanted to shock my class with the facts . Girls as young as under 10 get kidnapped . They are promised jobs like working in a carpet factory . Family agrees because they do n't have money or is n't aware it 's happening as the children just walk off with strangers claiming to know their family . Sometimes girls just get kidnapped as I almost did ( guy tried to bribe me with his private plane and mansion , I did n't buy it , he then tried proposing to me and telling me he loved me ) and are sent off . Girls are forced to have sex ( in some cases ) with at least 30 men a day . Does n't matter if you 're on your period , do n't feel well , are in too much pain from the last client or anything for that matter , you do it . If you do n't have sex with at least 30 men you get punished . All girls are drugged so they are numb and keep needing more drugs so they do what they are told and are too fucked up to try and escape . You want to escape ? You get punished if you get found out . One girl had her teeth knocked out . another got pregnant at 12 and when she managed to escape and get home , her family ostracized her and did n't believe her and said she put it on herself , then her 'uncle ' said he 'd offer her a better life and a job and ended up sending her right back into the sex industry she just barely got out of . If you 've been in there long enough , and are not useful to them anymore Stockholm syndrome kinda happens . They offer you money and all the latest fashion and a nice car and place , in exchange you recruit new girls ( and yes , girls do this , it 's either getting a new life with nice things or fucking 30 guys a day , so of course you 'd rather recruit new girls . You 're so numb and drugged at this point that you do n't care , anything that takes you away from the day in day out of fucking is better ) . So these women , go out there , act as role models for girls from shitty countries in Eastern Europe or some Asian place or anywhere this is rampant and these girls think 'ooh , I could be like her , I can get a job and have nice things and look how confident she is , she 's happy with her life , I can get away from this shitty life where my family sucks and is poor ' . Then they get sold off to the highest bidder . You could end up in someone 's basement as a slave , or go work in a brothel . Making friends with a brothel worker ? Nope , boss does n't like that , he 's selling you off to another brothel . He does n't want to see you possibly happy or making friends with a worker . New boss finds out that you were being sneaky at last brothel and insists your new sex limit is at least 50 guys a day or punishment . Why do people encourage this ? It 's cheap . Taxi workers can take an hour off of work and not lose much because it 's so cheap to get sex . Some people like that they get young girls , too young to get anywhere else . Others like the fact that they might not speak their language . Or that they can do what they please because they have the money . Or because it 's risky and illegal . It 's disgusting is what that is and I really hope that something gets done about it . I 'm apparently from ( well , grew up in ) the country with one of the highest sex trafficking rates in Europe . It disgusts me how this is capable of happening . And my class was flabbergasted when I brought up the statistics and directly quoted our country as one with a high problem . People turn a blind eye too easily to problems around us and refuse to believe that things are real and happening .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"Not the OP but just some points of view to consider . My parents are pretty controlling , they constantly badger us about everything . Even when I still lived with them and my older sisters would come visit , mom would be like 'where are you going ? Who with ? When will you be home ? ' Apparently they were a lot worse before I was born . My oldest sister wanted to be a makeup artist , she got accepted into a top make-up school in England , and dad wanted her to live her dream , and she wrote to them I guess because she was away from home , in a new environment and was n't used to this lifestyle and confided in them that some students were using drugs like cocaine and she was n't sure how to handle it . Instead of just telling her to avoid that crowd and stick to her guns , they freaked out , pulled her out and killed her dream . She went into I hate you mode and started doing things to piss them off ( I think she even got into heavy drugs after that ) because they were n't being the support she needed but just ruining things . I was raised partly like an only child as my sisters are both well over 10 years my senior . My middle sister did spend some time around me , but not a whole lot as she lived abroad for most of it . They raised me like an audiobook on repeat , I was an annoying parrot around people 'you should n't smoke ' 'you should n't swear ' you should n't this or that , I criticized my older sister all the time for smoking pot and pretty much gave her an ultimatum at one point because I thought she did n't care for me if she chose drugs over what we had . Yeah ... .. I started hanging around a different crowd , who pretty much made me realize that I need to be more open minded , more accepting , less of a bigot and I also started not believing in religion as much as I did before . I was never overly religious but I was raised with a God and suddenly started seeing things differently . I also hated how strict my mom was . I 'd have to be in bed by a certain hour , the computer got moved downstairs so I ca n't be on it when it 's 'bed ' time . I couldnt ' stay out late , no matter how late my friends parents let them stay out , moms rules were different and I had to abide by them . I started resenting them . I could never tell them anything without worrying they would freak out . I rebelled the way I did ( although not to the extreme of OP 's child ) because I could , because I was angry . Because I hated being caged . And because curiosity . I realized I wanted to try everything and anything even if it did n't seem like I 'd like it , just to know what it 's like and how I feel about it . I know several people who had strict parents who tried to smother them and were over protective and did n't want to lose their kid , so they 'd monitor everything they did and the kids hated it and would act out because of that . And some people just go off for no reason . Knew a girl that was really bright and a really nice , quiet , good girl . Started doing modeling . Started dating a guy , started doing drugs to keep her body right or whatever . She was best friends with a friend of mine and I had met her on a few occasions . One day my friend told me that she got an ultimatum from her that she could n't hang with her unless she was n't a virgin anymore , and offered a friend of her boyfriends to have sex with her . What the fuck ? It was so unlike her , she had changed and turned into this whole other person and if you were n't into sex and drugs , you were n't welcome . So just someone else 's perspective from what I 've seen , or experienced . I 'd like to see myself ( if I ever have kids ) as an open parent . Growing up I 've seen parents that were very open with their kids and the kids treated them like best friends . I want to have that with my kid . Even if it means he 'll do things I might not agree with , at least I 'll know what they 're doing and where so I can act accordingly if something goes wrong and know how to help them out , and if there are parents that are strict or kids feel they ca n't reach out to them , I can be the parent they can talk to and then I wont feel like they are suffering or I can help talk to their parents if they feel they ca n't do it themselves . Although I 'm not sure if going in the exact opposite direction of my parents will be the solution to not having these problems .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,TrueAskReddit,"I never said it was a source , just that it was discussed .

So although the two words do n't necessarily have a legitimate scientific meaning behind them , there are two distinct forms of being anti-social even if your 'symptoms ' or 'traits ' are the same . I had an anti-social friend growing up , he took his life a few years back but he was one of the people that had an event happen in his life that turned him into that and I 've seen how he 's been affected by it . I 've also met some of the people he was surrounded by which were possibly anti-social too ( judging by their behavior and as they attract like magnets ) , and I 've seen in his last moments the possibility of the empathy switch that is spoken about and felt that although the two terms are n't used by psychologists , I do feel that two distinct characteristics exist , being born that way and raised that way .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My parents are from Serbia , so I 've spent every summer and some Christmases there . And I spent 3 months in London . As well as traveled quite a bit . Although I do think Cyprus is relatively safe compared to other countries , I do n't see why it 's 3rd on the list , it just made me wonder how unsafe must the other countries be ?

12084182,sociopath,"1 . None of that , just people that are either fucked emotionally or some other way damaged and drugs help them get by or abuse them for the fun they bring . 2 . ASPD is characterized by lack of empathy , whereas killing for drugs , does n't mean you lack empathy , it just means the hold the drugs have on you is so strong you 'd consider going to extreme measures . These people before the drugs were otherwise normal people for the most part , whereas the drug changed them into completely different people . Not everyone can change with sobriety but some people do . 3 . They become substance abusers because it 's a change from the norm , it 's fun , it 's a way to kill the boredom which we suffer . 4 . Boredom , living on the edge , all of that basically describes me . I do n't know if I 'd be immune , I do feel the addiction and I feel the withdrawal symptoms but I 'm fairly strong willed and I just tolerate it . Like if I do some h and then start to feel the nauseous , and get the shivers or whatever , I just plow through if I do n't feel like doing more or do n't have any . I do n't necessarily do one drug over another , it all depends on my mood and I tend to abuse whatever I can get a hold of . New Year 's for example , hung out with some people , we did coke , ritalin oxy , dilaudid , various benzos , DMT and weed . Just went at it all night , alternating lines or whatever and ended the night ( or rather morning ) with DMT at sunrise and tripped out .

12084182,sociopath,"Ritalin , various bezons ( xanax , valium , etc . ) , had dilaudid and oxy for a while . Ritalin is pretty simple , as with any other ADD medication . Benzos , just need a good trauma story and stress . One way to do it is fake social anxiety , make it extreme , like you ca n't even order pizza on the phone without panicking , and then add on a trauma that amplifies the need for meds like that . Example , death in family , discovering long lost relatives , etc , have to deal with people because of it , and you ca n't deal with people . Oxy/dilaudid , had an actual injury and surgery , but after that just maintained how painful it all was , and convinced them to prescribe more . Also helps if you have a good family doctor that knows you , and then out of the blue , without abusing them and going to them for only legitimate reasons , you show up , they recognize you , and then trust you to prescribe something with minimal backstory because they know you and you do n't come off as the abusive type . Also easy if for example , you fake an injury , ( buy plaster of paris online and make a fake cast or any other injury item such as neck brace ) , and then tell them that the pain is bad and you owe the hospital lots of money ( if you do n't have insurance ) and that they would n't see you because of that and need meds . Or that they are your family doctor and you 'd rather see them from thereon out , you trusted the surgeon to do the important stuff when it happened but would now rather see your doctor , etc .

That stabbing happened while I was out in the area , and suddenly there 's police everywhere and they 're questioning everyone . My parents house got robbed 5 years ago , and another time a neighbor intercepted some people trying to scope our house . My dog ( who was calm and usually scared of guests ) attacked them and when neighbor apologized for his sudden change in temperament , a car emerged from bushes and the guy ran off so she knew something was up . And in Nicosia where I lived , a gang decided to take over our neighborhood and every night you 'd hear their motorbikes loudly and if you walked where they were hanging out , they 'd be all weird , and it was n't pleasant walking around there .

Then as the site grows and they gain advertisers interested in the site , instead of taking all revenue for themselves , they share it with you depending on how active you were . Also you get paid for recruiting people to join Tsu . For example , say user 1 invites user 2 to join tsu . If user 2 decides to join , user 1 gets paid . Then , if users 2 decides to stay and invites user 3 to check out tsu , both user 2 and user 1 get paid—and so on . As I said before , users are also encouraged to share photo , video and text content that garners pageviews from their social media audience—all typical behavior for social networks .

Most foreigners like myself who went to high school here , tend to leave for college elsewhere after as it 's a small place and the only good schools are private schools . They also usually do n't come back . The friends I do have here are in a different city as I went to college there . And it 's 2 hours away , and even some of those left for masters abroad . My best friend and our mutual best friend who 's family friends with Rick , who were in the city I studied in , suggested I hang with him for lack of things to do since he 's from my city so that 's how I ended up hanging with him . I decided before coming home this summer after studying abroad that I would eliminate all the people I know here as they are n't really good friends , just people to kill time with , and I hang with them for lack of options . I thought , better having no friends than friends that do n't help you grow as a person . ( I also have social phobia due to depression and just cling to whoever I can because I do n't have skills to meet new people or do something about my life ) So I ended up hanging with Rick and was not expecting that to happen . He 's arrogant but at least we do fun things and I can usually look past it . So without him , I do n't have a lot of people to hang with . I like some of his friends , they 're actually nice for a change , but I do n't want to make it weird if I ask them to hang out but then not include him . I think they 're tired of him too , like Dave who hangs with us , I can tell he 's always irritated with his arrogance . Case in point , the other night we were at this tabletop/board game bar , and we hung out there , played some new game , and as it was nearing the end Rick was n't bothered to put effort since clearly he was losing , and started playing a guitar laying around . Then when the game ended , and we were gon na tally up who won , he just got up and started picking out what game we should play next . He always acts like he 's in charge and it pisses me off . We all got annoyed and I called him out on it and said how we are here as a team and to have fun , not to compete and get pissy if we lose . And that he should sit and find out who won . Finally he sat down grudgingly and his other friend at one point said he was glad that for once he was n't the only one calling him out on his actions . I straight up tell him how I feel , just being honest . Even though I 've only hung out with Dave 5-6 times , I 'm thinking of messaging him since he stood up for me , or rather my point of view , and saw Rick being an asshole , and tell him that I 'm considering cutting ties with Rick or giving it some time and waiting for an apology . I feel he 'd understand ( in case he wonders why I 'm not coming out anymore ) and that maybe he 'd offer to hang without Rick . But even though I know he 's tired of him too , they go to the gym together with another friend and hang often so maybe he 'd feel weird about it . I think he 's a cool person , but I do n't want to make things weird between Rick and him since they 've been friends for years vs. me just meeting him . I hate being depressed and having social anxiety . Makes having friends so much harder . I cling to people even if they 're bad for me because I have no one else . Tried changing that and found out the one friend I did have turned out to be an ass . So now I 'm stuck with either repairing that or being friendless until I figure out a way to make new friends .

Went to a local college that accepted me , did n't even bother trying to go anywhere decent or away from the comforts of my home . I hated it there , but at least I was able to go to classes and come home without much hassle . I met a girl there , she befriended me , and sad to say I pretty much used her as a crutch , I mean she was a good friend , but half the time I just had her around to make awkward situations easier . Like if I had to talk to someone in an office , I dreaded that , so I 'd have her go with me to make it easier . I ended up switching degrees a year later , and although I never finished that one , I got closer to doing something I liked . I met some awesome people and they made socializing a lot easier and the anxieties started to fade . A year before graduation , I transferred yet again , but to a different country and a better university , and I can safely say most of my anxiety is gone .

When I met him there was someone else I was n't over , and we met under the pretense that I was kinda in a relationship ( despite not being in one , it was easier to say that I was since the feelings ) , and then he asked me about it one day and said that he 'd like me to be his gf . Meanwhile I went out with some other guy ( who I thought understood I was looking for friends and acted like he was too ) and the whole time I wondered what my ex was up to and started thinking about all the fun we could be having , and then it became clear I was on a date , and I did n't like it at all , but I realized that I liked my ex since he was on my mind and not the guy I was trying to get over . I do n't know if I ever saw a future together , like us starting a family and marriage . I remember the first time I saw his house , my brain instantly tried to picture us there because we 're in a relationship so naturally down the line , stuff might happen . It was weird , I realized he was n't my usual type , but I guess a part of me kinda saw something . But not a whole lot I guess , cause we had different ideas about future stuff . I guess it was convenient because it was a distraction from other things , but that feels so bad to say . I do remember feeling genuinely happy around him , being at home and waiting for him to come over so we could hang and being impatient over it ...",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Pressure I guess . My mom had surgery and I wanted cheaper rent . As an international student it 's really hard to get an apartment without income or credit history . My roommate decided she was moving in with other people last minute and honestly , it would have been hard to land a place on time before we had to move out . He offered cheaper rent , and made me feel bad for not wanting to move in with him . 'Do you not love me enough ? Is that it ? Your mom is suffering , your dad has to pay for her surgery and recovery and you want to move into an apartment when you can stay with me for a lot less than any place around here offers ' etc ... he said I could get a car instead of paying for rent and just make monthly payments , which seemed like a good idea at the time I suppose . I 'm weak and he made me feel bad and I did n't know how to face him . I know that 's my fault , no one else ' .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,CRedit,"Awesome , I read some bad reviews but now I 'm seriously considering it haha . Gon na apply as soon as my credit goes up a little this month so I know I have a better shot at getting it .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Close to the start . We were hanging out every day , and it was cool and I had fun , and then it started being weird . I 'd go to hang with my friends and he 'd seem like it 's weird that I do n't include him . I did some of the time , but like if it 's a study group right after class , then we 're just gon na chill , go over homework and test work and I do n't see why he needs to be there . He got all weird that day , but my friends hinted at liking him so I called him to come and bring us pizza , and he was over in a flash , despite being with his friends . Ever since it 's like I never had any time to myself , he 'd just feel weird why I need time to myself , why I need to browse the internet without him behind me watching . It 's not that I need to or have something to hide it 's just that it felt weird , he felt possessive with all of that . He wanted to get me a car not even two months in , like maybe not even a month in , my sister came down to visit for a day , and I spent it with her , get home to my apartment to find a gift on the bed , a watch he knew I had wanted . Okay , it 's cool , you got me something I wanted and paid attention to me . But wanting to get me a car that 's like 4-5k and then have me move in with you so fast is weird . I was going home to the summer and looking forward to spending it with my friends , then one night my friend drunkenly messages me for a threesome and he flips out . The next day he wanted to leave and never come back , leave his whole life behind , house and education included . I prove to him through my previous conversations with said friend that there 's no history between us , nothing . And the message was something out of the blue too , like 'oh btw , do you mind if a girl joins us in our whatever ' so it was hinting to something already arranged . He did n't trust me going home and surprised me with a ticket to see me and I had planned on breaking up with him when I was gone as I thought it would be easier . Him wasting more money on me made it harder . I had to tell my parents that I had a boyfriend and he was coming over , huge shock . I kept trying to make it work , to want it to work but it was just hard with everything he was doing . I lost my friend cause he would n't hear of him , even when the guy added him and sent him a message and said 'sorry man , it was my honest mistake , we 're good friends I do n't want to loser her , I 'm glad she 's found someone finally and I 'd like to get t know you and we can all be friends ' That just angered him more and he threatened to be violent if he saw him . We went to spend Christmas with his family and unbeknownst to me he planned on proposing to me in front of his family but for once he thought about how that would make me feel and realized that I would n't be into that . He only told me after the break-up when he had a breakdown and hoped that knowing that would make me change my mind about the situation . I 'm not the kind of person to get married 6 months into the relationship . Or move in 5 months later . It was all too rushed and stuff . We did n't have much in common either , he was happy to do anything I wanted to but I knew he would n't be into it entirely , he 'd just be doing it because he 'll do anything to make me happy . I do n't want that , I want to meet someone that actually has stuff in common with me and enjoys it in full . I liked all the same things he did , but as I 'm a diverse person whereas he 's narrow minded with interests , that became a problem over time .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll definitely do that . Once I move out I 'll stop answering to his parents or anyone , I 've been on his computer , removed my facebook messages or history so he ca n't link to my account , and will block him once I move out ( right now have his sister added so do n't want to stir something up by blocking him early ) then hope he does n't ask her for my link though I will block her too . and then not talk to them and his parents . they 'll hate me but hopefully understand over time . I have to do this once I 'm out already so that they do n't come looking for me . I 'll definitely write out the amount and stuff .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Not going to talk to his parents , his mom is just like him and is trying to get me to stick around and be with him . Though she says that if I 'm doing it just to make him happy , I should n't , she hints that she could use help with the payments and it would be cheap and that maybe one day things will be different when we both take some time away and we 'll be back together in no time . I 'll just put it in an envelope under his door .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"Yeah , I 'll pay him back somehow . I know that if I request him to not talk to me again , he 'd ( grudgingly ) do it because it 's what I want .

It takes a detailed patient history , psych evaluation , evidence , and in the end , you do n't truly want this despite popular culture . With that being said , I have to kinda agree with other posters , you might have some ASPD traits , but you 're not necessarily a sociopath . and there might be a bit of narcissism in there too , but I do n't think that 's the main issue at hand .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,sociopath,"I assume that with me it was trauma , although I ca n't be sure . My mom has bi-polar and narcissism . Two really annoying traits . Supposedly she also used to steal regularly , like a kleptomaniac , but I do n't think she 's a sociopath so I would n't say it 's inherited . When I was a kid , my parents were never around much , I had a lot of other people taking care of me . Kids always picked on me for being different and I guess that 's why I take pleasure now in seeing people suffer , it 's like payback , now I have the power they had over me . I hate my parents with a passion sometimes , I remember being the last kid to be picked up in school cause mom was at work still , and later on I had someone else pick me up every day . My parents raised me to be self sufficient , from age 10 I flew by myself on most flights if I knew where I was going ( to meet up with my parents ) . I lived with my cousins for a year once when I was 7 . Yeah , they were n't really there much ... I was alone a lot . They were also fairly materialistic , and possibly treating everything like an object is something I 've taken from them . And I think all this hate for all of that made me who I am today . My mom tells stories of me as a kid which to her are 'cute ' but to me sound creepy now knowing what I am . 'what will you do if I die ? ' ( who asks their kid that anyway ? ) 'I 'll just go travel the world with daddy ... or the maid will take care of me ' nonchalantly like I wont be bothered that my moms gon na die . Yeah , I never cared much . Supposedly I never cried as a kid until I saw my cousins getting all the attention in the world when they cried so I did it too for the attention . I also was never too fond of physical affection , like where my family 's from , it 's very common to greet someone and cheek kiss them or hug them , and I was always kinda cold in that regard ( why is that necessary ? ) and I remember my dad asking my mom if something was wrong with me cause I do n't like being around people that much ... . Meh ... I feel like the signs were there when I was really little but nothing concrete materialized until later . I remember when I was picked on , I was so tired of it that one day I told my sister that this girl that picks on me picked up a desk and tried to throw it at me . Boy did she get into trouble cause no one believed her when she said she did n't do that . I was like 6 then .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Since it weighs about the same , it wont register that something 's wrong . Walmart just got robbed of 240 $ . That 's 1/4 of 1k and they never said bag .

We 're telling the stewardess to not open the cockpit so there 's no risk of the cats getting in there . She stupidly decides to let the captain know about what 's going on and as she opens the door , the cat runs into the cockpit , and right under the captains feet . He 's scared of cats .

12084182,ipod,"I 've always had a Zune , I do n't know why but they always worked for me . Recently my Zune died and I figured since I want more space anyway and somehow possibly iPod 's are better ( and the Zune was discontinued ) I 'm better off with an iPod . I 'm getting pretty frustrated with it . For starters , Zune knows how to organize a library , it can detect the same artists from similar files whereas the iPod ca n't . For example , The Band and The Band , are according to the iPod a different band , even though they have the same name . Or The Band vs The band or the band or just band . It ca n't seem to tell that it 's the same thing . Also , Zune categorizes things by album artist , so if there 's a song The Band Feat . The The , it knows that the main artist due to the album artist field is The Band and sorts it accordingly , that way I do n't have a ton of compilation songs all under separate names . Another thing , I recently added a lot of random music from an old HDD , now the iPod sorted it into the library but gives me no option of seeing what was recently added . With the Zune however , I can see recently added artists and add them accordingly . With iTunes , I have to go through all my files to find the new ones and add them ( and I have over 200GB of music ) . I decided to double check all the name fields so it sorts it under one , make all mixed files sorted by genre so I do n't have to look for a ton of files at once but add by genre , but iTunes did not decide to update all this ( I did it externally ) and even when I reloaded it , it refused to update the files . What can I do ? EDIT : My library is not set to auto sync as I have two computers and originally used one to add music , but then found songs on the other one and added them manually , and that 's where this problem comes in . I ca n't sync automatically on this computer without erasing all music .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,askcarsales,"Florida . Nissan Dealership . Financing the car . Went to a dealership the other day with my boyfriend ( I got a thing in the mail saying I won something if I go to their `` new '' location . ) I won a gift card and the salesperson started to talk about cars . I am in need of a car as I am moving in with my boyfriend to save costs , and we decided to see what they would offer ( never thinking I 'd end up with a new car ) . The place was offering LIFETIME WARRANTY ! ! ! Can you believe that ? As long as they 're in business and I have a problem with my car , they will fix it . Amazing ! ( Heh ... ) The sales person gave us some really great deals on a truck ( 400 $ /mo . with 3,000/dn we really wanted and we decided to go for it . Lifetime warranty ! ! ! Once that sale was done , he offered to give us a trade-in value of my boyfriends car , and told him that if he traded it in , his current car would be paid off ( a 2012 model ) and that , that would increase his credit score , and help me ( with no credit score since I 'll be on his card , making payments ) , and that he would be paying about the same each month as he is now . The facts added up and it was a really good deal , he 'd get a car he likes for no down payment and it would help us out . We were thinking hard cause we really did n't want to spend more money , it 's already tough with the way it is , we 'd just have enough for basic spending . His car is alright , but this one was amazing and I guess in the heat of the moment ... Oh and to mention that when you buy a car , you get to spin a wheel for a prize , the first time we spun it , we got 50 $ and he said the second time , we would n't spin , but they 'd give us a cruise trip off the bat . We go to pay with the finance manager for the second car , and it turns out to be more than we expected , about 100 $ more , and we were quite irritated . We even picked the minimum for the protection plan . We go home and he starts to calculate everything , we need to come up with 2,000 in a week . We paid 1,000 , but were told we can pay the 2,000 in no later than a week . That 's what started to screw us over . We then call his parents who currently pay for his insurance , and who are in South Carolina , they say that they ca n't pay anymore , it 's too much now with 2 more cars to be added , and complicates things . We ca n't find insurance under 300 $ per month , that 's too much for us . We go back to the dealership the next day , tell them we ca n't afford the insurance , and we got screwed over by a 100 $ ( not to mention that I spent 7+ hours at the dealership the previous day ) and they say they 'll work something out for us . We said we 'd like to return the one car , cause we really ca n't afford to struggle with the payments . They give us some papers to sign for insurance , and stupidly we did n't read them through , just assumed they were paying for us , but nope , they got us insurance for a few days . The catch : We never expected his credit score to be high enough to even get the car , neither did the salesperson . My boyfriend makes car and house payments each month ( owns a house and car ) and other things . And they never asked to see proof of income , they mentioned needing it , but I guess his credit score covered it since he mentioned paying for those things . They asked what he does ( freelance work , sells stuff in his own time , not employed , full time student , as am I ) and that 's where they 're flawed , oh and not to mention that they let us out of there without us having insurance based in Florida . They said our only other option since they do n't have a return policy is to trade the car in as soon as the other payment gets cleared and get a cheaper car .

12084182,editors,"Okay , so I was n't sure how to phrase this but for my video production class we were making movies . ( [ here 's ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=nW6837VxQxc ) the last one I did , if you 're curious ) My new project is kind of a zombie movie . And when I was done filming , I noticed a feature on the camera that adds a really cool effect while filming , it seems as though it removes a few frames ( or maybe adds , though I think the previous ) and it gives this feeling of slowness , but also choppy , and it 's hard to describe , but I really liked the effect and I was wondering if anyone knew how to replicate it ? Just picture the camera jumping a few frames each time . We use Avid at school though I could n't get it to work at home ( starts up fine , and then while loading decides to crash on me ) , I downloaded Sony Vegas and I can download anything else as long as it gets the job done . Also has to be free if possible ! ! I 'll even try and get Avid working if needed . Any help would be greatly appreciated ! Or any ideas for effects .

12084182,Health,"Ok , so I 'm partially deaf . Ca n't hear 80 % on my left ear . I have what is known as glue ear , the hammer , anvil and stirrup in my ear are glued together and therefore ca n't produce any vibrations which make sound . I went for surgery about 3 years ago when I was 19 , it was horrible , I had bad doctors , and turns out they did n't do anything . They were supposed to find out what kind of brace I need put in , but then they said they still did n't know and needed to do another surgery for that and then the final one . I told my parents I did n't want to do that again . They also just were unprofessional overall , being unprepared . Now we 're gon na see different doctors , I 'm actually gon na travel out of the country to get the surgery done . I do n't trust doctors here . So I 've got some questions . What 's it like being able to hear normally ? I 've got this fear that everything will sound so loud and it 'll be scary hahaha . Also I am really into music , like I 'm gon na go study audio production hopefully , but now I ca n't cause of my ears , I need to be able to hear perfectly . So I 'm waiting to sort that first . But I 'm wondering how it 's gon na affect things . Is it weird when you hear music and hear it differently than before ? Like does it sound weird ? I know that I have to have my headphones in the right way round , otherwise music sounds weird and I hate it , cause I was used to hearing it one way . And my biggest question is about balance , since my ear has no fluids going , I have terrible balance . And I hate it , cause I love sports , but I 'm always limited . Like snowboarding . Do you think it just becomes normal , because I suddenly have fluid or it takes time to adjust and I have to work on it ? Also I get car sick cause of balance , does that go away as well ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"I made a status on Facebook and this guy commented and at first I thought he was pissed at me , but then I went to his profile and well he pretty much does all the things he complained about in his comment . So now I 'm confused . This was my status , a quote from somewhere : We live in the matrix . A chaotic reality which we try to understand and master so as to be able to control it , as well as ourselves . It is a hard job , but each and every one of us has to do it . We live in and live out the pattern that is laid down before us . Comment : We live in facebook . a social networking site where we try to understand what people are talking about when they post dumbass shit . its a hard job ignorin all these idiots that are on here especially when you cant control what they post , but to live in a world where we want to keep in touch with our loved ones we have to wade throught the sea of farmvillers , taggers and idiots that post t hings they think we care about . We do n't . you think you live in the Matrix , but the Matrix was full of robots and cool cyborg people . This is Facebook . Umm he plays games on there , tags people , and makes comments . I do n't play games , yeah I 've been doing a little too much Facebook lately , but it 's summer and I 'm bored staying over with cousins so I put statues up and song links . This was going to be my response , but I do n't want to make an enemy out of it , what do you think ? On your homepage you can remove who you see updates from . So you do n't have to see crap from me again ! : P And well when I post stuff , usually people comment on it , or like it or something so I get the impression people are interested in reading my shit . If they did n't do that then I 'd be stupid for adding more shit that no one likes or is interested in . Btw , from your profile , I can tell you 're worse than me , you tag people , same way I do , make status updates , and you play Facebook games that ( I do n't play ) that probably forces people to join something , or do something to help you out . Those personally annoy me , so I do n't do it . I do n't mind the status updates . So why complain on me when you 're no better ? Btw , if you 're bothered to go back a bit on my Facebook , you 'll see I barely use it , just now I 'm on much more cause it 's summer and I 'm bored at my cousins place and so this is where I end up at . - I hate Facebook ! I actually deleted my account a few times how annoyed and bored I got of it . But then I realized I had a few people I had no other way of staying in touch with , as sad as it is . But this really annoyed me . Why be so hypocritical ? -- -- I replied saying how he 's not any better , and asked what he meant by it , and he said he did n't direct it at me , that he was just making it as a remark in general , and we sorted things out . `` wasnt directed at u love , i liked it but i was makin a point that the world is run thru social network sites now , its sad really . just a joke tho : D an like i sed wasnt aimed at u x ''",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Paranormal,"I wanted to get some advice on this , I feel kinda weird about it but a couple of situations happened where beforehand I felt like something would happen . A premonition if you will . First time this happened was last summer , I was with my boyfriend at the time in some botanical garden , he saw a flower just randomly on it 's own by some mound and decided to go photograph it cause it was unique , anw , the point is that as he got on the soil ( which is not a firm surface and it was downhill ) I thought of offering him my hand back up as he might fall , I just pictured him slipping and falling . But then I thought , I know he wont take my hand , would I his in that situation ? He lost his grip and slipped . I was kinda shocked but did n't say a thing . About a month later , I was at a gas station pumping some air into my tires and suddenly it felt so weird like something bad was gon na happen , something felt so wrong and I pumped the tires just fine and thought , hmm , nothing wrong . Well just as I left the gas station , suddenly I hear a bang and my car broke down , some metal pipe that 's between the front tires broke . : O Again it was weird but I did n't think much about it and maybe a few weeks later I was driving down a road and noticed an odd taxi next to me and somehow I just pictured it looking through the side mirror and not seeing me due to the blind spot and just trying to switch to my lane and low and behold it happened , the driver tried to go to my lane and then suddenly saw me there and swerved back . That 's when I told people how odd it was that I felt something each time that happened . I forgot about that , and about a week ago I was up late chatting with my friend and at one point the light flickered , nothing out of the ordinary , lights do flicker right ? And it happened again later and I heard the a/c go off for a split second and thought to myself , tomorrow there will be no electricity , I bet it 's gon na run out . a little later my net went off completely , and it happened to my friend a bit earlier and I told him , somethings off , I 'm sure of it . I slept around 4am I think and I woke up to the lack of electricity , my room was boiling hot . But what I did n't know was how severe the issue was . I live in an island in Europe , and at a army base , well a naval base , some idiot decided that it 's ok to put containers full of ammunition in the sun , and those containers blew up from the pressure , and he just told army boys to spray them with water so they cool down . Of course they did n't and they were situated right next to a power generator which when they blew up , blew up as well . And now because of the lack of power , half the island ( it 's kinda small ) has only a few hours of electricity a day ( including me ) Anw , that really freaked me out and I reminded my friend of last years incidents and he thought it was a bit odd too cause I told him , there 's gon na be no electricity tomorrow . Anw , is this odd or just chance ? I just feel like I need to get in touch with a part of me that will help me channel what I 'm seeing/feeling and work on it . I first thought , well ok , I saw a taxi , I could have easily thought he might not see me cause it is possible , and it 's possible that my ex would fall cause he 's on unstable ground , and the light flickered , so maybe it 's a sign , but all the same I feel like there was a reason I felt something so strong . It just stood out . Anw , I 'm not sure if I believe in premonitions , since I 've watched far too much Charmed and I think that kinda got to me and I 'm just combining things in my environment , but I 'm open to things . I do believe in a lot of paranormal things , I 'm just not sure if I 'm really seeing things or it 's my mind putting two and two together . TLDR ; I predicted a couple of things to happen and am wondering what people think about it . Did I really have a premonition or is my mind just putting information from my surroundings together to form a vision .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AdviceAnimals,"Yeah . Another issue I see is on the opposite end of the spectrum . I had a professor who studied in the States in a top university , even worked at one and had great experience/resume . She then had family reasons to move back home and wanted a job locally . She did n't care if it paid well or was an exact fit of her previous job , she just wanted to keep teaching and be able to be near her family . Our university originally turned her down because she was 'overqualified ' . They could n't hire someone like that even if she was content with the low salary because it would look bad on their part why they would pay so little for someone who is that good at what they do . She ended up modifying her resume , cutting half of her qualifying traits out , and applying to another branch of it in a different city . They accepted her and she asked for a transfer .

But also if you think about it , sometimes you try to accomplish something for hours with no luck and then take a break and within 5 minutes you managed to figure out what you were stuck with . I used to work as a lyricist for a label briefly , and I found that when I put effort and wrote songs I thought would be big , never got far - the ones that caught my managers eye were the ones that I threw together last minute . Sometimes I had unfinished lyrics where I was n't sure how to fill in some blanks so last second I threw in random words/phrases where I was lacking and did n't feel they made sense , but to him the songs sounded magical !

We are here to provide a platform that will help you find a great opportunity and enable you to make a connection with your match , be it a host or a service provider . We are still in the early stages of project development , but are working hard to make it come to life . One of our main goals is to make this platform free for everyone . If that turns out to be impossible , and we are cornered into charging some kind of fee to cover our operating expenses , we will aim to make access fee as low as possible . We are determined , however , to grant our early adopters Premium Free Membership for life regardless of how much we may later decide to charge regular users . It 's for people that would love to travel and see new places but ca n't really afford to get a room . So you 'd just offer your skill set to a potential host and they 'd let you stay at theirs for free in exchange for helping them out with what you can offer . For example : I need someone to help me with this programming course I 've started . I ca n't seem to get a hang of it . You come along and I offer you to stay at mine in exchange for help with programming . You 've got a place to stay , food , and outings if we arrange it . It 's up to the host if they want to offer more than a place to stay and food/necessities . Discuss with them and find a suitable arrangement . Sure , you can teach programming online and get yourself a room in a hotel as you travel and work , but why not meet people along the way ?

He said , 'you do love the dick more though right ? ' trying to make a statement that I would n't be with a girl , because his dick is good enough . He said it was probably an experimental phase , I was trying things out when I was with a girl ( we did n't date , but we went all out ) and he thinks I was just feeling adventurous or whatever , but I like guys better . He said I 'm straight , cause I 'm with him , right ? So that must make me straight . I said that the same way he might look at a girl in passing and find her attractive , maybe not sexually cause he 's with me , but he will know if she 's hot or not .

So he 's okay with the LGBT community , I just do n't get why I 'm being bothered by the fact that he does n't seem to understand what I 'm like .

I said I 've liked girls since forever , I do n't remember feeling different about them since I 've liked guys . And my best friend has liked guys since he was little , like 10 even .

I do n't chose to like girls , I just see one and think 'she 's hot , and if I were a guy , I 'd probably have a boner' How do I get him to understand ?

12084182,ElectricalEngineering,"I have some old Sony stereo speakers that I got and ended up in my car a few years back and have stayed there since . Now I want to use them to power my birthday party . A friend who dj 's suggested he 'd play music if we can figure out a sound setup and throw a party in the middle of the woods . So we have the speakers from my car which are n't too bad ( in terms of loudness ) , but they just have wires at the end , like the cable sticks out of the speaker , and at the end it splits off into two separate wires ( I 'm guessing power and ground ) and then they turn into left and right when they connect to the main power of the car that the door speakers connect to . But how can I turn that wire into something more useful ? And would a generator help ? I might have an amp of sorts at home , but I 'm not sure if it works , it 's just been laying around collecting dust , some Pioneer amp that 's been in this house since my parents got it . Let me know if that 's of use and I 'll find a way to see if it works . But the amp needs powering as well , so maybe it 's not necessary if I can just plug the speakers straight to a generator without needing one . Also how much noise would a generator cause ? The speakers are n't bad but if a generator makes noise that will be problematic since they 're not party speakers per se . I just figured woods would make everything louder , but with a generator ... But if it can be kept at a distance , like really long cables away from the speakers then it should n't be a problem . And if this is not the right sub , let me know , I had no idea where to post this . tl ; dr : Have some regular stereo system speakers I would like to power in the woods .

12084182,careerguidance,"Well there 's nothing really bad about the employers themselves . The office is wow in a weird way . It 's a call center based out of a house . Right now we 're by ourselves at the night shift . But the one guy that trained us , he was here for the first week and then left to train people in another office ( different country ) but he 's super chill , like jokes around on the phone with clients , smokes weed at work , I think ( more like know as another employee that has been there longer hinted at ) he does coke as well . Tells us to swim in the house pool any time we like as well . So it 's a very weird atmosphere . We fuck around a lot , like the guy that 's been there a while , he recently got back from being at their other office in the other country and said they fuck around a lot too and barely do any work , the company is a mess and when I told him how we signed contracts the other day , he was surprised saying until recently there were n't any contracts . Another guy worked for 6 months without a contract , cash payments only but left for personal reasons . We 're basically 800+5 % . But the contract I signed says after the 3 months 'probation ' which is basically training and us being 'outsourced ' workers , we go permanent , just the 5 % and we were told it 's because of the amount of people that do n't like call center work and quit . Which did happen , out of 10 of us , only 5 of us are on the team now . Thing is after the 3 months , contract states it 's just 5 % and I do n't like that , it 's going to take me longer than 3 months to get a solid client from cold calling and getting money out of him a while longer before he decides to invest bigger money . ( We do sports betting/handicapping ) For now I 'm sticking around for the salary . Now the guy that 's been there longer said that he 's not sticking around either if he has to sign on permanently , we 're slowly piecing together how much of a scam our company is ( product wise ) and the shit they pull for evasion of things and I just do n't like it that much . It took them 2 weeks to get our contracts , we got paid for the 2 weeks , then the guy said to not date the contracts so the lawyer can date them when she gets back from holiday . We feel she might not exist and it 's a contract for us to think there 's one so we ca n't do anything but they do n't have it signed so it 's not legal in case we do try to do anything . What do I tell a new employer ? Why would I be leaving such a job ? I like the people I work with , I like the chill atmosphere , we can dress however , do whatever , I just do n't think I can handle living off just the 5 % and if something happens to them as a company because of weird practices , it 's not good for me .

12084182,cyprus,"So I got a job at a call center . First three months I get salary+5 % which is n't really going to happen unless I 'm extremely lucky and get a customer to sign up . But after the three months I sign a permanent contract ( as of now I work as an 'outsourced ' worker because of the amount of people that quit , it 's not worth it to them to do social , medical , etc . for the first 3 months if we 're going to quit fast ) but the permanent contract will not include a salary , just 5 % commission . Is that legal ? I had one co-worker tell me they worked for another place and were only paid 5 % so if this is standard practice , then I assume it 's legal , but I do know we have a minimum wage depending on industry and I ca n't imagine commission falling into that because what if you get no commission that month ? I understand why they do the first type of contract as I 've only been here 2 weeks and had 3 people quit within the second week ( first was training ) and so they do n't want to waste their time , but how can they not give us a salary after that ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,jobs,"Basically I 've been trying to find any kind of job at some point , even outside of my field just to have something going and have some income . 26 , graduated little over a year ago . I moved back in with my parents but mom has Parkinson 's and is institutionalized and dad is struggling to help her out and sister is trying to help dad sell the house and stuff so she 's moved back in as well and I do n't want him to keep having to support me and her and so on . I had an interview a while back for customer service type role that everyone told me to avoid like the plague because of what you have to deal with , but I figured anything is better than nothing . The thing is , the other week I scored a volunteer position in my field . Basically a group of people passionate about our work organize events and they do n't get paid , they just do it for the love of it , but it 's once a week at most I guess . But it 's Friday 's and Saturday 's usually . I do get to be in my field , unpaid . Which my family is okay with since I 'm getting experience . But here 's the thing , I need a job , my laptop broke down a while back and I spent months on an old computer that could barely handle 5 browser tabs open so I caved in and got a new one that I have to pay off , and I was hoping I could do some freelancing online , but not sure how predictable that is . I found out today I was offered the job , but the thing is , it 's for Australian markets and I live far from Australia so time zone means I have to work a night shift from like 1am-8am or some bullshit Monday-Friday . I can still volunteer in a way but I think having this menial job would kill any motivation for that when I get home at 5am and just want to sleep all day .

12084182,careeradvice,"So , my resume might make me out to be a bit flaky . I started one degree , a year in , transferred to another university ( the degree was really crappy , and the university too ) . The other one was better , but 3 years in I got accepted to a really good university in the States and moved there . I graduated . All 3 degrees were somewhat arts related , so nothing businesslike . The first one had a focus on advertising , but I never got to that , as the first year was very traditional arts based . I 've come to the conclusion ( long story , involving family , and me being fed up with my current situation , 26- jobless and stuck with family problems ) , that I 'd like to move out and just get any job . So I 'm trying to get into the forex/binary options/trading industry , whatever you call it . It 's huge in my country , so there 's constantly jobs available . Even though I possess a skill they always want : Languages ( I speak more than 3 fluently ) , I 'm not their ideal candidate . My social skills are not that great , and even though they hire just about anyone , ( you do n't need any skills for entry-level positions because they offer training ) , they want to see extroversion in a person . The last interview I went to , the lady asked some general questions , and even though I answered them the way she wanted , she was a bit stuck on how I have 3 artsy degrees and nothing on my resume related to their industry or business in general or customer service . I said I was looking for a long term job , but it did n't seem to help . I have a job listed on my CV , working in promotions , where I used to hand out product samples and interact with people , but I do n't think she cared for that . She pointed out how I worked as a lyricist for about 2 years , but when asked if I still do that , I said no . I regret not expounding on the interview . For lyricist I could have said that I did n't like the contract , which was true . My manager got 20 % of all profits and if I had any kind of job during that contract ( other than it ) , he got 20 % of my profits , even if the job continued when the contract expired ( what kind of bs is that ? who does that ? ) If she had known I quit not because I got bored and do that all the time , but because I was being treated unfairly , it would have been different , no ? Another thing I wish I had mentioned , though I 'm hoping you can tell me if my logic is sound , I have epilepsy that has only recently been discovered though I 've had it all my life ( a type that is n't easily noticeable ) and I might not be able to work in my field anyway if the doctors conclude that lights and sounds affect my health . So I wish when she had asked me 'what was your first job choice upon graduation , or what would you rather chose right now if given the chance ... ' that I had said I had epilepsy and could n't work in my field either way because of that , and am thus seeking work elsewhere without having to obtain another degree . Would that have helped reassure her I was n't a fight risk ? I 'm not sure how to land a job like that , since I do n't look like someone that would last long , but I really just want a job so I can move out and be on my own and not be surrounded by my toxic family . They are really starting to get on my nerves and I just want a place of my own , a stable job whatever it might be and time for myself to de-stress .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,techsupport,"Laptop , HP EliteBook 8760W A rundown of recent events : HDD crashed . Plugged another one in from a different laptop . I downloaded Windows to do a fresh install as that one had windows configured for the other laptop . Before I got to that though , the laptop suggested I do a free upgrade to Windows 10 . I accepted it and did n't realize that it had 32-bit architecture and that it would follow on to the Windows 10 installation without prompting me if I 'd like 64-bit instead . So I got 10 at 32-bit and it was sluggish so I downloaded the ISO for Windows 10 64-bit . Used some Microsoft tool for creating a bootable USB . Formatted the drive to install Windows on a blank drive without previous Windows on it . Now every time it preps Windows to install , it restarts and it gets stuck on the boot screen that says 'press esc to enter setup menu ' or whatever . If I do n't click esc right away the screen freezes and I ca n't click any button to get a response . I have no idea what to do at this point . In the installation menu for Windows it asks if I have a product key . I tried typing what came with the 32-bit windows ( going from what the properties of My Computer had displayed ) but I was missing 4 digits . So I chose 'I do n't have a product key ' thinking it 'd just know that I had Windows 10 and it was a free upgrade and register it for me . Should I find a key for it ? Would that make a difference ? I currently do not have access to any other computer other than a MacBook and I 'm not sure how helpful that is since it 's not Windows .

Windows suggests I upgrade for free to 10 , I 've heard good stuff so figured it was worth a shot . And just did the upgrade while running Windows . It installed 32-bit as apparently the Windows 7 installation on that HDD was 32-bit and it kept the architecture and did n't ask me to chose . What can I do now ? I did n't think it would just default to what I had , and honestly forgot that it might have something other than 64-bit as I got so used to most modern computers being 64-bit . I tried resetting through settings , but it told me it had an error and could n't do it . Downloaded a windows upgrade installer , but I feel it 's going to do the same thing and just install 32-bit .

Two , my middle click button on the track bar is normally for open in new tab .

I do n't know if bars and restaurants would be okay with it , I assume some would and some would n't depending on what type of establishment it is . But I 'm also applying to any job that I might be qualified for . One job I saw today over Facebook was a video presenter job . I want to write to the guy ( he says over fb is fine ) but he 'll see that my hair is blue as day . I want to mention that I can dye it black if necessary or that I am dying it black ( whichever you think might be better for me to say ) and see how it goes . But I 'm not sure how to bring it up without it being awkward conversation material . Advice ? Also , red is generally an accepted hair color , would a combination of red and black be okay ? I 'm guessing not as even though both are accepted on their own , the two would be a bit extreme , but I 'm wondering if anyone thinks that it might be okay ( like half my hair would be red and half black ) .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I come home , sleep for a few hours ( waking up naturally without an alarm clock ) , and then resume right before work for another few hours and just get up and go to work .

12084182,relationships,"So our mom has been sick for some time now . Its gotten to the point that she 's in hospice care ( refuses a nursing home ) , and she pretty much does n't move from the bed . She gets up to eat and use the bathroom ( a porta chair/toilet next to her bed ) and that 's about it . No one knows how to talk to my one sister . She blames everyone for everything and is always angry and is on drugs as she claims it 's the only thing keeping her same . She until recently took care of anything mom related , paid the hospice women , organized doctors visits and anything else needed . I 've since taken over this role as dad has deemed her unstable and he thinks it 's brought her down too much . Anyway , mom has been given another 5 years to live and she will most likely not die from the Parkinson 's but from everything else , not moving and whatever else could happen as her brain is fine . But she does have at least 5 years in her and she 's a fighter . I recently planned a trip and my sister sees my status on facebook and messages me to hold off on buying tickets as our aunt is coming on the 12th ( september , I was planning on leaving 10th but with my aunt coming I planned on 13th so I get to see her but my sister wanted me to delay it further ) Then she drops the bomb that she 's planning a family reunion as a farewell for mom . What the fuck ? A farewell ? I told my other sister who is furious as to why we are having a farewell for mom when although she 's in a bad state , she 's far from dying . I ca n't wrap my head around this . My trip was perfectly planned to fit with a break in work , going back to the country I grew up in , need to get all new documents as my bag was stolen a while back so I 'm without passport , drivers license , etc . And I have a wedding to attend . I was willing to move the departure date a few days when aunt told me she was coming but I wo n't move it a week just so I can attend a farewell for mom . I think having a farewell is absurd . I 'm gon na call dad later and let him know what she 's planning and see how he feels about it . But I do n't know what to tell her . I feel like she 'll blow it way out of proportion and act like I do n't care for mom when I moved here 6 months ago to be close to her while she 's in care . But I do n't agree in a farewell so I need to find a way to approach the situation and explain how wrong I think it is . Tl ; Dr : mom has been given at least 5 years to live but sister is planning a farewell mid September for the family to get together . I think it 's absurd .

12084182,relationships,"Maybe I 'm overreacting but sometimes her attitude really grinds my gears and we 've had issues in the past over it , but I 'm trying to deal with it so we do n't have problems . I 've known her since high school . She 's always thought of herself highly and thought everyone likes her and so on . She 's also easily hurt and I 've made her cry in the past ( and I do n't think I 've ever made anyone else cry before ... ) She never really had any friends . I was her only friend in high school bar from one guy at her school ( we went to different schools ) Then we went our separate ways for college and just saw each other over holidays . But now we 're both living in the same city . She 's been here for 2 years , and does n't really have any friends , and I moved here 6 months ago . I found a group through Facebook that get together on a bi-weekly basis to play a board game I like . I invited her the first time because I did n't want to go alone as I do n't know anyone . We met 4-5 people that day and played some board games . The next few times I went alone as she was on holidays and more people came and it turns out it 's usually a bigger group , just that day it was a few people . I met the group and we all got to know each other . It 's been more than a month since she 's been and she was in town last time so I reminded her I was going ( so she does n't get hurt I did n't invite her if she realizes I went because that 's what would usually happen and she 'd start having self destructive thoughts ) . We walk in ( it 's a small neighborhood bar , really small , and just a place for regulars to chill and have a beer ) and her first reaction is `` HEY EVERYONE , REMEMBER ME ? '' I feel kinda awkward because we walked in to part of the bar and I know for a fact that she did n't know anyone there , and they looked at her like , no , who are you ? Then 2 people she knew came over and we did some introductions with the others . And decided to play games . We played cards against humanity because there were a lot of people and everyone knows the game . At some point people were engaging in discussion about something she does n't know anything about , and she was getting frustrated that a ) she ca n't participate in discussion because it 's a foreign topic to her , and she does n't like being silent , she has the need to always be talking or center of attention and b ) the game was n't being played . But we 're not there to just play games , we 're there to socialize and if we play games , great , if not , still great , we 're enjoying ourselves . She would be like 'ahem , so yeah , let 's continue with the game , we are playing are n't we ? ' Especially if it was her turn , she 'd be like 'so yeah , it 's my turn , and I 'm gon na read my cards now ... ' And one turn I pointed out how someone went for beer and we should wait for them to get back and she 's like 'OH , someone went for beer , so I ca n't read my cards , but when they get back , it 's my turn , so I 'll read my cards , and we 'll continue with the game ' really loudly . It just felt unnatural , and she left early and made it a point to say bye to everyone and loudly point out she was leaving more than once so everyone knew and make sure they remember her . So we 're texting when she left , and I said how I think the one guy liked her ( there were two were sitting together and talking most of the night , but the other guy definitely looked like he had it in for her ) , and she 's like 'yeah , I think they both liked me , they were into me ' She 's insecure so I tell her things like how someone might have liked her . I also compliment her without reason just because she 's like 'aww , thanks , really ? You think so ? ' to help her with her self-esteem . But then with things like this she gets this attitude ... All the guys liked me , I 'm sure of it ... I 'm so amazing and pretty , they ca n't help themselves . and I just hate that attitude that she just assumes everyone is into her and all that ... Maybe they are , hey , that 's not a bad thing ... but when people talk like that and say those things ... I hate that `` all attention to me everyone ! '' It 's fine and well that it 's her thing , I do n't want to change her , but when it affects the whole situation and gives her a lack of social awareness , then I have an issue because I 'm not enjoying myself anymore . Like if we 're all enjoying a discussion and having fun , laughing , whatever , you should n't just be like 'ahem , let 's play the game please . ' We 're all clearly in the mood to talk about something for a bit before continuing . It made her look weird cause she was n't fitting in with what was going on in the moment . I do n't really know anyone in this city and she 's pretty much my only friend , so I do n't exactly want to ditch her because she 's fine when we hang 1on1 or do something else , but it 's situations like these that make it weird . I like these people and would like to become friends outside of our bi-weekly game nights so I have more people in my friend pool . But I feel like she might make the game nights weird . If I do n't invite her to game night , she 's going to get hurt , but if I do , I 'm gon na get frustrated because she ca n't be in a social space where all the attention is not on her . It 's fine if you like attention , but save it for a club or some other environment . But if we 're all having a fine time and just talking , do n't ruin it by making everyone stare at you every second ... So I do n't know . Am I overreacting ? I feel like I should just ignore it and let it play itself out and hopefully she comes to her own conclusions but all the same , I feel awkward bringing her along if she 's gon na act like that and make things flow not as seamlessly as they would otherwise . Ideas ? -- - **tl ; dr** : So , in my opinion , I feel like my friend is really awkward in public and I feel like she does n't understand social cues . If I do n't invite her out , she 'll get hurt . If I do , she 'll make things weird for everyone ( or maybe it 's in my head ) .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,badroommates,"/x/post from /r/relationships since they thought it was more suited here . So I met my ex roommate Claire while she was in a tight spot and needed a place to crash fast . At the time I lived with my ex who was away for the summer teaching a camp and I was planning on moving out . I offered her a place to stay until she finds a place . Let the adventures begin . I had another girl staying with me who was to be my roommate once I moved out of my ex 's . In the meantime I end up in a car accident whiplashed and in a neck brace unable to even lift a glass of water . My to-be roommate decided it was too much for her and bailed . Claire seemed more than willing to help me with groceries , changing , and anything else because after the accident my hands could n't even go past my hips without it being too hard and painful . I was doped up 24/7 to kill the pain . We move in and I find out that Claire is one of the most disgusting people ever . Ex . Dishes never washed , to the point of mouldy food . Shower and shave and leave hairs in bathtub because she does n't know how to get rid of them . Her room was so gross with everything all over the floor ( and in general in the apartment ) . I 'd try and clean when I was a bit better but she 'd yell that I moved such and such item and lost it and now she does n't know where it is . Anyway , she was also BPD and would not stop leaving me alone . She 'd wake up and be like 'Hey , you awake ? ' I am now ... 'Great ! I 'm making breakfast ' 'Oh , where ya headed ? Can I come with ? What are you doing ? Can I join ? Oh I do n't mind that you 're just painting , I like to watch . Oh you want to read ... Oh , we can go to a park and read together ... Oh , I 'll watch that TV show with you even though it 's linear and I do n't know the history of the show or characters ... ' We were college students and my family was in Europe while I was an international student in the States so having family help out was complicated especially since they barely saved up to get me into this college , it 's good but affording rent too and all the other stuff post-accident was really complicated . So yeah . Also , Claire is bad with money . Ca n't make money for this or that . I 'm stuck . I ca n't be rude and have her starve , I 'm human , of course I care . But I also do n't have a backbone . So I bought food for the both of us . She got a job at Macy 's temporarily . Before she got fired she bought stuff like a TV for the apartment , which we did n't need . Among other things , like a GoPro for herself and some personal items for hobbies . Then she lost the job and could n't seem to land another one . We went to food banks all the time and she 'd get angry if I did n't have time to help her with her problems , like what kind of a friend am I ? What if I have my own life to live ? Like she broke her smartphone so she could n't have a phone with Uber . I was out with a friend . She calls me asking for an Uber since she got up late to get to work ( always woke up late and was bad with time management ) and got angry when I said I was busy ( it was a date , I thought it might be urgent ) , and could n't help her . Or she 'd bang on my door when she had a morning shift ( 1 hour ride to work , so up at 6-7 or something ) and she 'd bang on my door for the Uber when she was late and be like 'Do you not want me to make rent ? ' when I say I 'm still sleeping . Stop manipulating me . I could n't get her to move out as it was a joint lease and she 'd have to sign she 's leaving . Great . I tried everything , but where would she go anyway ? Be homeless ? She was also full of suicidal threats and transgender so on hormone therapy which made her mood swings insane , I tried to deal with it because you ca n't help who you are but some days I just could n't . Anyway , at some point I count up all the money she owes me for bills . 380 $ or something like that . I 'm broke at this point too because we let this couple crash on our living room for money and found out they are known for doing that and robbing the people they stay with so they took 1k out of her student loan and 600 $ that I got paid for something . I tell her at the end that I ca n't make last months internet bill , or rather 3 bills back that I did n't pay . About 300 , and instead of her paying me the 380 that she owes for what I did pay , she can just pay that off when she gets her tax returns and I 'll forgo the rest , so I 'm not stuck trying to find 300 in a hurry . She does n't do that . I think I hit her up about it once but she said she called and they made a fuss about it being in my name or something . I was outside of the states by then and back with family as my mom is sick and I just wanted to get away from there . I notice today on my credit report that the Brighthouse internet bill has showed up ( 3 years later ? ) and it 's sitting there , and I 'm not liking it . I already have some of the medical stuff on there that I have n't paid off yet , I made arrangements for most of it but I 'm not made of money so it 's stuck . But I 'm also not liking seeing her Facebook statuses that involve her crashing from couch to couch and being kicked out for bad habits of being a roommate and having no money for food , and how no-one will hire her . What do I do at this point ? I want to bring it up somehow , let her know I understand she 's broke but she needs to understand the consequences of her actions and that she needs to work on herself . I see her making posts about how maybe this is the life she 's destined for , she 's accepted that she 'll always be couch surfing and broke and jobless or some shit I want to write a positive email to her explaining how she can change if she puts the effort and she can make better habits and inspire her , because it 's no way to live . She 's also resorted to being an activist as of late and all her posts are protesting things and Trump . So I do n't know if it 'll be worth it , but she should know that she 's affected people . She 'd message me from time to time to ask how I 'm doing and if I know anyone that can help with her activism ... and I 'm like , err ... you screwed up big-time ... I do n't know how to talk to you . Sorry for the vent , I know a lot of it is unrelated but I went through quite a bit and felt that I was driving my friends away by venting about her on a daily basis so I just bottled it in instead and shut up about it and now it 's all out here but I do n't know what to do . I do n't want her to just get away with it , but at the same time she 's struggling so much that I do n't know if I should put more pressure on her . tl ; dr : Long-ass post about roommate that was more than one can handle but I had a car accident and no-one would help me out but her , and she owes me money and I want to let her know she did n't do her part of the deal we had .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Not sure how to describe this as I do n't know mushroom terminology , but basically the center of the mushroom and what you can see in some photos laying on the ground , is what was originally on the tree for a while . Just a lump of mushroom . And one day I kicked it just to see what would happen and it fell off ( to note , the tree has broken apart about a year ago , it just snapped , and I 'm wondering if it 's the mushroom ? ) Anyway , for a while it was just that centerpiece until I kicked it off , and then within like 3-4 days of kicking it off it somehow managed to not only grow back , but grow that extra puffy bit surrounding the center ball .

12084182,techsupport,"So there 's a situation at work . My boss and supervisor are both tech stupid and I 'm the 'smart ' one when it comes to computers and internet so they always ask for my help . But I have no clue how to figure this out . Now there was another guy who came during another shift and he did some stuff , like get the email reports I mentioned above . The guy has done some weird stuff with the company so they are planning on letting him go , but for now they are slowly limiting his access to stuff . So they changed the godaddy password to the web/email they use . He came in and asked for it since he was locked out , and they said they did n't want him to have it , just them two . So then he goes 'well at least let me know what emails are being sent out each day so I can send you guys reports ' Now I work at a call center , and we ask people for emails to tell them about our company . So sometimes we get the email wrong , and I can see that in the mailbox , but I do n't have access to the other report that he supposedly has access to . Where we can see how often they 've looked at our email and if they 've clicked on our link ? He asked for a list of emails sent each day so he can send us a detailed report of each one . How can he still have access to something like that if he does n't have access to the inbox ? How can we see something like that ? I only see 'delivery status notification ' in the inbox , just saying the email has bounced back . Nothing more than that . We want to stop him from having any kind of access but would also like to have access to those reports ourselves . I do n't see anything of the sorts in the godaddy email page . Nothing in settings , anywhere . Nothing suggesting he 's getting something forwarded to him . In the old emails we used to send ( ones made by him ) I can assume he had an image in there that he would track how often it was loaded , but I 've made a new email for the company since because the old one kind of sucked and they liked mine better . The link I also added in the email is direct to site , not a tracking link . I did n't know how to do either of those so I just left it , since I figured he could find out if they checked the emails somehow .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,callcenter,"So I got this job 2 months ago . I 'm a pretty quiet person so I was surprised I got it , but I needed something until I get something in my field . Anyway , we are outbound and try and convince people to sign up with our company ( sports betting sorta ) . We trade on their behalf . Anyway , first database we had , it was full of people that were previously in that industry and was really bad as most people would just be like 'fuck off , you 're all scammers ' , or 'I do n't bet anymore ' or some shit . Really hard to find clients to give emails as they 've had bad experiences in the past . Second database we got the other day was of general people , and most do n't know what the fuck I 'm talking about . With the first database I could write extensive scripts and change my approach every time because I knew the client knew what I was on about and their tone of voice and word choices would give them away if they were really interested or trying to get rid of me . New database , I say simple things because most people are just like 'I do n't do that , I do n't know what that is , I do n't have time for that , or money etc . ' So I just briefly state that we 're an investor company and we have a free email for them if they are interested . Anyway , manager that listens to all the calls and monitors us came in today to do our monthly meeting and give paychecks and told me that our boss who watches the cameras and stuff has seen me slack off quite a bit and be lazy . And I have two weeks to improve . BUT that he personally , from listening to my calls , says that I have the potential to be better than anyone of the others in my team and that I have a knack for knowing when the client is interested and when they 're just wanting me to fuck off which is hard to do and I know how to write great scripts and rebuttals ( using the customers words against them ) . He also said that he 's heard my prank calls ( at the end of the shift everyone gives me their 'bad ' customers and I prank them from a private line that they 've won something or another and everyone makes me do it cause they think I 'm the best at it ) and he 's confused how my prank calls are so brilliant and perfect and yet my regular calls are lacking enthusiasm and I sound 'docile ' as he put it . He said I 'm really intelligent , he can see that in me but he does n't know how to motivate me . Any other employee , he can tell them exactly what to do to improve but I 'm an enigma to him and he knows I 've got tremendous potential but he ca n't figure out how to get me to pull it out of me . Honestly , it 's a really boring job , we 're doing things manually as they do n't have computers set up yet . So I have a paper sheet in front of me , dial numbers on the phone and then write feedback on the paper and it 's just so tedious . I get distracted easily and do something else other than calls . I want to push myself but I do n't know how . I lack motivation because I never saw myself doing this , I have 2 degrees and ca n't find a job in either field . Maybe because I see this as temporary it 's hard to take it more seriously . But if I can get good commission by getting a client on board and earn good money , then it 's worth it to find out how I can tap into that part of myself that 's good at this .

12084182,AndroidQuestions,"So I have an aux cable for my car and it 's making phone 's do weird things .

He told me that Android phones have this issue sometimes where the data will turn on for a split second , I wo n't see it happen because it 's so short and I 'll only get charged a cent .

12084182,rapecounseling,"Do n't really need rape counseling with this post but since relationships might not want to deal with my post , here it is . Also to state , the rape in question happened when I was 11 , I 'm 26 now . Here 's the original post I had : Why do some people think that because rape is n't so bad compared to something else , it therefore is n't so bad at all ... ? This concept just baffles me . Last night I ( 26 ) was out with some friends I 've been hanging with lately . Rick ( 19 ) , a friend of a friend that I 've known for some time , have hung out a few times lately and sometimes with his friends . I moved back home 2 months ago and did n't really have anyone to hang with so my friend suggested I hang with him since he has nothing to do either . Anna ( Rick 's gf ) is a really quiet girl , she comes out and just tags along with whatever we do . And then there 's Dave who 's also Rick 's friend . So last night we went to some exhibition , checked it out and then at 9 there was a movie and discussion thing at another place that we go to once a week and we had time to kill so we just sat somewhere and talked . Me and Rick really started disagreeing about a lot of things , but whatever , it happens , everyone 's got their opinion , until he started talking about rape . First he said how rape is n't so bad . Me and Dave lost it , 'what do you mean rape is n't so bad ? ' Anna being quiet and just absorbing everything . Rick says 'Well , compared to getting your vagina sewed shut , rape is n't so bad ' Well duhh if I had to chose between rape and my vagina sewed shut , I 'd chose rape , but in the grand scheme of things , rape is fucked up and wrong . And it should n't be said that it 's not bad . So Dave says how Rick does n't know what he 's talking about since he 's never experienced it and Rick says how he 'd rather have a rape experience , which he said was 'temporary physical trauma ' than his finger chopped off . Me and Dave said how there 's emotional trauma too , and his response was 'emotional trauma is far from physical trauma ' At this point I just lost it , and started yelling and grabbed him really hard ( he was sitting in front of me , a step below me ) and I was crying/wailing . When I finally managed to compose myself , I explained how I 'd rather have my finger chopped off than 10 years of emotional torture that I suffered , and then cried more and kept apologizing , I guess because I was embarrassed of making a scene in front of them all . Dave kept saying how I should n't be sorry , why am I sorry ? It was just so overwhelming , I thought back to all that I went through , and explained how I could n't even let someone close to me hug me for the longest time , even that was impossible for me and then we had this awkward silence for a while . No one said anything . I wanted to break the silence and say that everything was fine , but it was n't and I did n't know how . So after some time Rick asks if we should go , and we 're like , alright . He gets up , asks if I 'm okay and before I could say anything more than 'yeah ' he starts talking about something like nothing happened . I hated it . The rest of the night was fine , as usual , and I tried to act like nothing happened but driving Rick and Anna home there was this silence , and the only thing Rick said was thanks for the ride and see ya or something to that effect , I did n't really pay attention , nor did I care to . Told my best friend today who 's sorta friends with him ( well , our other best friend is close to him as a family friend so that 's how we know him ) , and he got so upset when I said I had a breakdown because of him . I did n't really tell him what happened right away just that I was angry at him and that I was over it , but when he got angry and said he was going to kill him ( figuratively ) , and I explained what happened since he asked , I realized I was n't over it and it was all coming back and I felt so uncomfortable and thought , how could someone even think something like that ? He said that he would n't know if he could be friends with him after something like that if it were him . I honestly do n't know either . I want to explain why he 's wrong , and how that affected me so he can see things differently , but I do n't know if it 's going to affect him or if I should even bother . I feel like the only way I can keep being friends is if I explain why I reacted the way I did and why I think that he 's wrong in thinking that emotional and physical trauma are separate and they are not correlated . I get that he 's entitled to his opinion , and if he 'd want to be raped over his finger chopped off , that 's fine . But to state that rape is nothing and there 's no emotional trauma involved and that it 's not correlated to physical trauma just bothers the fuck out of me . and I get that as a guy , he 's taught to repress any physical stuff and not let it get emotional and that emotional stuff might not be real , but that does n't mean he should state that it 's true for everyone . Ahh . Any advice ? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way ? My best friend agrees with me but I know that he 's also experienced rape as a kid and that he might just feel this way because he 's thinking back to his own experiences and he does n't have that whole 'you need to suppress emotions ' thing that most guys have . So I want to know if his reaction was justified , but so far Dave and my best friend think he was out of line , but somehow I feel like maybe I 'm just overreacting .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Starts itself in Artist mode , not album mode . I want to listen to a specific band , not album . Maybe the majority is the opposite , but not me . ( not too important but nice to have ) 2 . When loading said band/artist , do n't force me to pick a specific album or chose all songs . Have them all there , categorized under album , so I can just pick a song without having to make another touch to get to all the songs . 3 . When past 5-10 seconds of a song and I click the skip back button , I want to restart the song , not go to the previous one . First five seconds , fine , I 'll go to the previous one and play it again . ( this would be really handy , so used to windows programs that do that ) 4 . On the lock screen , I do n't need an extra screen with song info , only to exit that one and get to my regular lock screen and then finally get to my device , so if it has this option , I 'd like to be able to disable it so I only have one lock screen to go through . ( sometimes I need to get to my device fast ) 5 . When I pause a song and want to skip through to find another song , do n't auto play each song . I paused for a reason so I would n't hear 2 seconds of each song as passing through . Keep it paused until I press play when I reach the song of choice . ( definitely a plus )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"We dated for about 6 months , I moved in with him and then we broke up but stayed roommates for about another 6 months ( his abuse made it hard to leave ) . He 's in jail now which is why I 'm able to leave without feeling bad for hurting his feelings and ditching him when he 's all alone and depressed and you get it ... Here 's the thing , while we were dating I had a tooth problem . I was waiting on my dad to send money so I could go to the dentist ( around 3-4k for all treatments ) , but in the meantime my tooth hurt so bad one day that it was impossible to do anything from the pain . I ended up at an emergency 24 dentist and you guessed it , he charged like almost the same amount just for one tooth that was aching ( whereas I was going to get multiple teeth done for that amount at a regular dentist ) . My ex pays and says I 'll just pay him when I get the money . Then when I got the money he said it was more important to get my teeth fixed and just give him what 's left over and pay him back later since he 's okay with money and I need my teeth fixed . Note that around this time my mom had a surgery and my dad had to shell out roughly around 10k for that , so money was tight for him ( he 's also paying for my education in full which is n't too cheap ) . My ex had no problem waiting . I went away for the summer to see my family ( right after he got jailed ) and now that I 'm back , I went to see him . He knew that I had some plan of moving out but I guess he did n't realize the extent of it . First he was saying how I should stay and that he 'll tell his mom to not charge me for staying in his house ( he owns it , and I was paying him rent ) , and that I can save up to move out properly , etc ... and even saying I do n't have to pay him back since I brought up how I still owe him and I 'll do what I can to get it to him . Since then he 's called twice to talk ( threeway call with his parents ) and has I suppose noticed my stern tone and me avoiding certain topics like coming to see him and moving out . I told him that it is happening for certain and most likely middle of the month and how it 's a lot cheaper ( so I have another reason for moving out ) . Then he goes , well do n't forget to save up so you can pay me back . Ahhh ... I have no issue paying him back , I just hate how first he tries to keep me around by letting me know I do n't have to pay him and not rent , but then wants the money cause he knows when I move out I can just lose all contact with him and now I 'm forced to contact him to give the money , and he 'll want to know where I am , and I plan on changing my number which is n't going to help . What can I do ? Our relationship was pretty much him being controlling ( from my/our finances , to outings/shopping decisions ) , and possessive ( if I 'm out with friends , he 's at home sulking and wondering what I 'm up to , and why I 'm having fun while he 's depressed ) , to him saying 'I did this and that for you ( which I never asked for and even told him not to ) and you do what for me ? ' -- - **tl ; dr** : If I stay in my ex 's house , I apparently do n't have to pay rent or pay him back , but if I leave , I have to pay him back since my rent is significantly cheaper than what I was paying him . I do n't want to deal with him and his psychological ways of keeping me around .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,travel,"So my friend was looking for flights to Miami , and he did n't want to search for flights from his origin ( Georgia , Europe ) but from any other big city in Europe that would have cheap flights to Miami .

It was able to show me that flights existed but failed to load them or tell me which airport it was leaving from .

I do the calculations for footcandles Footcandles=peak candela/throw distance^2 throw distance = vertical distance^2 + horizontal distance^2 Throw distance = 28'^2 + 9'^2 = 865 so 170000/865 I get 70.40 but when I put it into vectorworks , my light is on the truss , at 30 ' , with the stage I 'm lighting 2 ' off the ground , so the light hits the focus point at 28 ' and it 's 9 ' from the truss , so the throw distance was calculated , but when I put a photometer , it gives me a candela output of 319.20 footcandles .

Graduation is only a month and a week away ( for him , not me , different degrees ) , and given the nature of the industry , we might not see each other again for years . For that reason , it is imperative that I do this now and not later . Also , I trust you will keep this private and not share this information with anyone . It 's a pretty big thing , so I do n't want anyone else in on this but you and me . So here it goes : Remember when you posted the `` Squeezing Cute Things '' article that you talked about fetishes ? Well , I have one . Do n't worry , it 's nothing kinky or disgusting or anything of that sort . It started out as a foot fetish that evolved to macrophilia . Look it up if you must , but I ai n't typing it out . Anyways , I satisfy that itch by sneakily taking pictures of girls ' feet . Apparently I 'm good at it because I have n't been caught yet , and since it 's not as intrusive as taking pictures up girls ' skirts , then there 's no real harm done . I do feel it 's somewhat intrusive , which is why I 've decided that it 's best that I go and ask instead . And that 's where YOU come in . You 're the first person I test this new idea on . I want you to come over and let me take pictures of you . It wo n't be anything weird like having you strip or anything - merely you going around my apartment doing normal things . It 's for my benefit only - it wo n't be posted on the Internet or anything of that sort . I know this may seem really weird to you and you have every reason to think that and back out if you wish . But I can assure you that it wo n't be anything outside of your comfort zone and believe me when I say it 's even weirder for me to be letting someone in on this . But like I said , I trust you enough to not go and spread the word . Please let me know if you 're willing to do this huge favor for me , and if you are , then we can arrange for you to swing by . I 'm free tomorrow ( tuesday ) ; it would be best to meet when the sun is still up , so anywhere from 12 noon to 4pm works . If you are not willing to do this , then please keep this all to yourself . Thanks in advance !

( Kathy was my roommate she was obese , in case he was into that stuff , I mentioned her ) me : Ohhh that thing hahaha Ca n't your gf do it ? haha ( he 's had a girlfriend ever since I 've known him - about 2 years ago ) him : She does n't even know about it . I plan to tell her , just not now . Right now , all that concerns you is whether or not you 're willing to do it . ( Why me ? Is he attracted to me ? Why could n't he tell his girlfriend about it ? ) me : Right now , I 'm wondering if you 're being serious or not . haha ( seriously , I was so confused with his message ) him : I would n't have revealed something so personal in jest . ( That means I 'm being serious ) But I leave it up to you to decide whether or not you want to do this . It wo n't offend me if you decline , so long as you promise to tell no one . If you accept , however , I would be eternally grateful . Me : Why me ? And you just want to take pictures of my feet or what ? him : Well I have to start doing this with SOMEbody , it might as well be with someone I trust . You seemed pretty lax about the whole fetish thing ( what does that article I posted have to do with fetishes ? Maybe I do n't remember commenting on it ) , and you 're trustworthy , so why not ? And it would n't be just feet , it would kind of be you just going about my apt . I 'd say mainly feet and face .

We decided to find someone to pay off my truck for me and then keep it . We found someone , wrote up a contract on paper , took photos of his and our ID 's and that was that . 500 $ a month . First month , late payment . Second month , late again . Third month , no payment as of yet , ( should have been on the 25th of last month ) . ( I 'm guessing using late payments as a means of buying time ) Ahhh ... Cops wont do anything , cop came over one day and we filed a complaint , said he needs to deal with the matter otherwise in 10 days it becomes theft . Then we got a call that because it was a civil matter , they ca n't do anything . But we do n't know where he is , if we did , it would be fine , but we do n't , so it 's not really a civil matter . The whole contract thing screwed us up and therefore the police wont do anything about it . We started going to all known addresses , everyone is clearly covering for him . Looked up addresses online , hired an investigator to look him up , either he does n't live at an address or no one knows where he is , or even has his number . He 's deleted his number , his dad 's deleted his number , there 's just nothing there . We ca n't reach them anymore . We received a toll a while back , showing that he was in Miami and failed to pay a toll . Investigator found us some address in Miami to check out . We ended up calling a repo service and they said they would search Miami for us so we do n't have to go down ( It 's a 4 hour drive ) The other day we noticed there was an old ad of his on craigslist that he 's selling a bed ( had his old number on it ) and I started messaging him from my email as he does n't know who I am , and from google voice , I set up a number , so he 's texting me , and setting up a meeting . During our conversations I mentioned I was moving from Miami and that I did n't have a car . and then he goes 'I work at a dealership , I can hook you up with a car ' which now makes me think he 's sold the car and that 's why he could n't have delivered it because he does n't drive a truck . We 've considered telling the repo man to say we already got the car back and he stole it again , and at that point be able to report him for theft . But I 'm sure he wont and if we get caught out , we 'll be screwed so that 's not really an option . My bf is getting really impatient , we 're trying a ping service today so they can tell us his exact location , but if that does n't work out he 's gon na just tell the cops that we got it back ourselves and he stole it .

Promises to leave her , he 's not up for it , she 's forcing him etc ... I told her to stay away , it 's bad news , he 's not gon na change . She might be pregnant , he purposefully did it and even told her and she showed me conversations where he explicitly states he wants a baby and a new life with her . I got another friend to message him and hit on him , and he took bait and talked dirty to her . I showed my friend who got super pissed and got angry at him , he 's a liar .

12084182,ADHD,"I have no idea how to go about doing this . I used to take meds back home years ago . I 've tried a few different kinds and found that Ritalin worked the best . That was in Europe .

I 'm currently studying here in the U.S. , specifically in Florida , and I 'm considering going back on my meds as I feel I 'm getting progressively worse . Also , my boyfriend is getting more and more frustrated , well observant of my situation . He always brings it up when I 'm distracted or forget to do something ( which is 90 % of the time ) since he 's the exact opposite of me , he is naturally 110 % focused and alert about everything . I frequently forget to do things he tells me to do or mess them up . Example , I often forget to put the sponge in the sink , a huge pet peeve of his as everything has to be clean and orderly , and I 'm not like that . I forget important things such as going somewhere and forgetting to bring something I needed to bring for that task such as a document . Or even simpler , putting laundry in the machine and forgetting to put detergent and washing a load without it . I 'm not focusing well in classes as well , even if they are really interesting . I also tend to be distracted so I mishear things often or do n't hear them at all when he 's speaking to me and he ends up just saying 'it 's not important ' and then does n't tell me and it gets annoying .

12084182,ADHD,"My roommate and I both have ADD . I 've had mine since I can remember and I used to take medication for it but have since stopped . When I first got off the meds , my symptoms were really bad , like I 'd forget car keys in the car door and then spend an hour looking for them only to find they 're in the door . Leave the house without half my stuff , forget that I 've done stuff so I 'd do it again or not at all thinking I have . But with time I got better at it and spoke to psychologists and learned techniques and can now more or less do most of those things fairly well . My roommate on the other hand takes some seizure meds that supposedly give her ADD according to her doctor . She is so forgetful it 's almost frustrating , I 've learned to make habits of things , like turning off the lights in the bathroom when I 'm done . She however ca n't . Every time I bring up a pet peeve like how the bathroom floor is soaked after she showers , she says that she just wont remember to clean up or dry in the bath so it does n't happen and it 's just how she is . She forgot her house keys on several occasions and was locked out . She left the stove on a few times , once I came home to the house in smoke , and she burnt my pot , which had her coffee in it . She says that there 's nothing she can do , no technique will work because her meds force her brain to act that way , it 's not a natural state therefore there 's nothing she can do to change that . I think she 's just not wanting to even try . I 'd get it if she actually tried , and then said , sorry , it 's just too hard , fine , I 'd understand , I was as bad once , and it took a lot of effort to get to where I am now , but she 's not even trying to be mindful . Do you feel there 's a difference between the two , is her state the same as mine or is it different because there 's a different cause ?

12084182,Epilepsy,"So I was reading [ this article ] ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3923147/ ) today about out of body experiences and epilepsy and it struck me as odd . A few years back , let 's say 4-5 years ago , I had a period where I 'd dream that I 'm awake and doing my morning routine , I 'd get up , take a shower , do whatever in the bathroom then get back into bed , nap a little more and then go to classes or whatever . One day by chance my friend and I discussed something and he said there 's no way I was showering at 10am as he was late to work and was up at 10am still at home . And I came to a conclusion as he mentioned that lately I had not been up at all until a certain point ( other roommate pointed it out ) that I had dreamt it all . I thought it was odd . It did n't last long though and stopped completely until recently . Now I 've graduated college 2 months ago and moved in with my mom and sister , who 's also come home to help with her as she 's old and needs care . I got her this squeaky dog toy so if she needs me from another room I can hear her ( she 's gotten real quiet and sometimes I want to watch something or she 's watching something ) and suddenly it became a trigger in my sleep . I 'd hear the squeak and know it 's her and realize I 'm dreaming but wake up and help her only to realize that I never woke up , she 'd squeak again and I 'd realize I 'm sleeping and wake up for real . Once I dreamt that she squaked , I got up , and realized she had fallen while wanting to go to the bathroom and I got her back up and went back to bed . The next day I asked her how she felt after the fall , and she goes 'what fall ? ' She never fell in the night . And now sometimes I just dream that I 'm up , helping her out , getting her breakfast and her meds ready only to have her wake me up and tell me she wants her breakfast . So I 'm wondering if it has any relation to my epilepsy or it 's random . Has anyone else had experiences like this ? I did n't even know it could relate to epilepsy until I randomly stumbled upon that article today . I have absence seizures and currently take 1000mgs of Keppra .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,Dentistry,"So about a year ago I had some major stuff done to my teeth . I went to a dentist at my moms village that was cheap and he said I had more to be done but since I was only visiting for a week he said he did the major stuff and next year I can get the rest done and he thinks it 'll be fine for a year . Now I 'm back home for the summer but in the city ( my parents have an apartment in the city and my mom has her parents summer house in a village ) . I went to a dentist my sister goes to , she says he 's great , blah blah . He looked at scans of my teeth I did before the visit , said he really liked the work the previous dentist did , and all I needed were my fillings replaced as they were reaching their expiry date and falling apart . Alright , cool . First time just bottom right side . Second time bottom left . ( two teeth each time ) . Second visit he says for the top it 's easy , he can do both sides at once with anesthetic , unlike the bottom which has to be done separately for whatever reason so I 'll only have one more visit and he 'll also give me a nightguard for my bruxism . Great ! Next visit though he only does top right . I find that odd , but maybe he was just making a remark how the top does n't need to be done separately and never intended to do both sides . Gets the imprint for my guard thing and fixes my filling a bit ( from previous visit ) as I felt my bite was a bit weird . When he did my bottom and top right side , I had no problems , even after the visit , after the anesthetic wore off , no pain . Left side though , one tooth , as he was drilling , just kept being sensitive , he said it 's probably under too much stress . So I figured , okay , that must be it . Then after the visit , it kept hurting a few nights in a row , oddly enough right as I want to sleep , so I 'd take an ibuprofen and then finally it went away but the cold issue came in . Cold water makes my left side feel weird . Sometimes it 's the bottom part , my jaw area , sometimes it 's even the top part where he did n't even do anything to my teeth . My sister schedules a visit for general cleaning and so I can ask him stuff . He cleans my teeth , massages my gums or whatever . My sister made an off comment to him how I have breath issues and maybe something 's still up , and he said the spacing between my teeth is really tight , and that 's was what caused breath because I do n't floss enough and remove the food that 's stuck there . But when we got in the car , I said how he forgot to tell me why my gums are sensitive to cold , and she said it was the teeth spacing but then I told her it only started after he worked on my bottom tooth and now I do n't know why I 'm still sensitive to it . Do I have a problem ? Or is it normal to take a bit longer for some teeth to recover from all the drilling ? I do n't get my upper gums feel sensitive too at times even though he never touched my upper teeth at all . tl ; dr : Went for change of fillings , one tooth was more sensitive than the others during filling change . Since then ( a month ago ) my whole left side has become sensitive to cold and it took a while for the pain in my tooth to subside while other teeth that had fillings had no pain afterward .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

I want to remove the unwanted tones but also want to help my hair get stronger so I can bleach it a second time in two weeks so I can add color . Can I use both ?

Third time round that I was going to change things , it told me that I was out of HDD space . So I was confused , I not only uninstalled the software but deleted any related folders under program files so I should have enough space for at least that . I ran disk cleanup and found out that 60GB was taken up by 'temporary files ' whatever that was for . Could it be the crack or did I have this problem from before ? Today I 'm low on space again , and I hardly have anything on this computer . C drive says that 5gb is free of 300 . I opened C drive , right clicked on a bunch of folders and checked the space taken up by each and when I add them up , 100GB is just in the abyss , it 's nonexistent , tried to see which folder took up so much space so I can find the culprit but 100GB is just missing somehow . All the folders add up to 200 approx . and yet when I look at the disk itself , it says that 5GB is free of 295 . So where did the other 100GB go ? I do n't get it . I checked temporary files to see if anything is there again , but nothing . Avast does n't find anything , neither does Malwarebytes . Windows 7 , 8GB RAM , i5 @ 2.60GHz",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AgingParents,"So I 've been studying abroad for the past 3 years and have come home every summer to see my family . This summer however my mom has gotten much worse . She walks with a cane and needs help getting to the bathroom most of the time . She 's very slow , speech is slow and her left hand ca n't do much . She thinks right is left and vice versa . I try and get her to do something with her left hand , like using it with the cane or picking something up with her left hand but it 's as if it 's paralyzed , she just ca n't . She forgets what she 's supposed to do with it and gets this confused look on her face and looks like she wants to cry because it 's too complicated for her . On the other hand , she 's also easily confused and set in her ways . She takes one medication that she 's supposed to slowly phase out and take another one instead . The doctor said 10mg 3x a day , then 10mg x2 a day , and then 5mg 3 times a day . That goes from 30 to 20 , to 15 . The thing is , when I put 3 x 5 today in her medicine holder , she said it was wrong , she needed just two a day . I said how it 's 3 a day but it 's a smaller dosage , resulting in a smaller overall amount of the medicine despite the increase in frequency . She got very frustrated with me , despite showing her the doctors orders , and said that I was reading it wrong but finally gave in and accepted what I said . She was on the verge of crying out of frustration because she could n't understand the situation and what I was saying was too confusing for her to comprehend . On the upside , she 's also on Prozac which makes her laugh at everything , even when I 'm telling her off for repeating things she should n't . It 's very frustrating to deal with this situation , I 'd like to help her with her hand , and my sister who was with her until I got here , said she 's trying to get her to go to physical therapy again . Any advice ? How do I stop myself from getting too frustrated , I 'm not a very patient person .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Second university lasted 3 years , pretty much so close to graduation but it felt so generalized and useless . I liked the content but it was just basics of a dozen different things . I did n't learn anything I could apply towards a specific job , I 'd need to go for a masters . Finally found my calling and attended a hybrid degree , where I graduate in under 4 years in exchange for new classes every month , it was intense but it paid off and I 'm finally graduating from something .

12084182,CasualConversation,"So , met this dude at this place I was volunteering at a while back , briefly talked , though he seemed really friendly . Girl from said place adds me on Facebook , turns out she added a lot of people , including him . Thought he was cute so added him , had an excuse to . Profile did n't seem like he was in a relationship currently , no info , but it did show that he was with this girl for years from what I gathered , but any recent activity , past month or so made him seem like he was single or broken up . About a month ago he messaged me , seemed like he wanted to have fun . So we met up , and then he never called again like he said he would to meet up , and I figured , asshole , whatever . Was n't looking for anything serious anyway cause I just got out of a 5 year relationship . Then yesterday I randomly think of him and go check his profile , and his profile pic is with his gf , the one I saw pics of before but assumed they 'd broken up . In the comments , his buddy is like , why do n't we hang anymore ? he says he 's annoyed with him for not being able to keep his mouth shut like telling gf about the hooker on his bike . Then she 's like , well it 's okay now , we were having a rough patch , I said I was fine with it . I 'm pretty sure that was me he referenced . So I wanted to post this here and ended up busy all day yesterday , and guess who happened to message me this morning ? asking if I 'm down for some fun and to chill . Not cool dude ... Also , my last message to him was kinda irritated cause we were supposed to hang the next day and he never even contacted me to at least say he was n't interested , and I blew up on him . And he had the audacity to message me again , all the while having her as his profile pic . I 'm not some desperate whore , it just gets lonely after living with someone for so long and then being all alone , and with graduation right around the corner , do n't have time for a relationship .

I do n't know if there was anything between them and that 's why she knows him , I really ca n't remember much .

12084182,Epilepsy,"Just looking for other people 's stories . Started last night . Took one dose , first three days I 'll be taking just one dose to adapt and then 2 doses a day . Woke up with swollen eyes and was too tired to get up , could n't even change my alarm , which is what I usually do if I 'm tired , set it for 5 mins later ( rare though , if I have to be up for something specific , I 'm up ) . ( had ~7 hours of sleep , not unusual but prefer 8 ) Woke up 35 mins later and got up . Went to the bathroom , stumbled a bit by the door . Maybe I 'm just so tired , maybe it 's the meds . Felt like farting later . Everyone farts , but this felt really strong , and it was ! Did n't eat anything out of the usual . Rest of the day would occasionally get knots in my stomach and feel like I might need the bathroom . Thankfully nothing happened there . Maybe it 's the meds , maybe something else . Only thing I could n't find under symptoms , I found stomach upset , but no farting . Maybe that counts . Came home , passed out , slept for a good 4 or so hours . Woke up , found my left eye to be swollen a bit . I guess I 'm a bit drowsy , but not a whole lot , just tiredness I guess . Took my next dose like 2 hours ago . I hope tomorrow 's better . Might be worse , oh well . Really do n't like this tiredness thing , my line of work requires not a lot of sleep and energy . Tomorrow night is my last night of a single dose . From then on I start morning doses too . I 'm on 500mg for starters , then it 'll keep going up until I reach my needed dose . I have staring spells , which is why I 'm taking this . At least I do n't have anger outbursts , that was my biggest worry as I irritate easily . Apparently the side effects subside within 4 weeks , get weaker so I 'm hoping that 's the case . Edit : Second day , right eye is n't swollen or even hurting to touch anymore , but left eye is swollen some more and hurts . Also itchy . Slight sore throat . Had a mild headache/earache this morning . Or , more like pressure on the head . No other symptoms , farted a bit ago , so I know that 's still ongoing , but less than before . Stomach still twists on occasion . Second Edit : So , turns out the whole eye thing was a completely separate thing . I got a [ stye ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye ) in my eye , literally right as I started taking Keppra so I assumed it was a side effect , but turns out a pore on my eyelid got blocked so that happened . And my stomach being upset was just my period happening , and I guess I did n't realize it cause I was too focused on the meds and trying to see what side effects I was getting . They probably affected how I felt too so I did n't recognize the usual symptoms .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,relationships,"So I 've got this downstairs neighbor in a wheelchair . One day me and my roommate were throwing a get-together , and not being sure how many people would show up , we decided to tell our downstairs neighbors we were having a party and if there 's any issues with noise to let us know . Both neighbors were fine , but the one in question asked for a beer . Sure , no problem . Brought him a beer and piece of cake . Another day , I 'm heading up and he calls out to me and requests my roommate , she comes down and it turns out he was hoping she knew where to get weed or wanted to split some good stuff with him . She called me over in case I knew and we ended up talking to him a bit . He used to be in a band , but had a stroke so now he 's just bedridden in his apartment . He added us on Facebook and took her number . And then the calls started . One day we went downstairs to hang , brought some drinks , talked to him , he 's cool but clearly very bored and lonely . Takes him 10 mins to get ready and up from his bed to open the door . He 's limited . Some dude comes to check up on him regularly and takes him outside in the parking lot for some air . Anyway , to cut things short , he 's called the other day to see if we could grab him some groceries when we head out . Never headed out . My roommate got annoyed that he only had her number , and bugged me to give him mine too so she 's not the only one harassed . So yesterday he called for us to get him something that he dropped . And this morning at 6:30 bright and early he called . Really ? To note , he did work in our industry , we 're both students and he has good connections , especially for me . He even knows someone that works at my university in the career development department , and wants to introduce me to them . So I feel like he 's using that as leverage to get what he needs .

Anyway , she wants me to deal with them as just the other day she went to complain how they locked the laundry room with her clothes still in it and did n't open it all weekend , and she got really mad , and thinks they wont want to do anything for her ( they do keep a sign that it closes after 5 and is n't open on weekends ) . As well as the fact that it 's the 3rd time this is happening . So I have to go and sign it . She claims it 'll only take a few seconds , but I know it 'll feel like years .

I went from getting them from ordering pizza , even if I had all possible conversation outcomes written out on paper , to dealing with most situations somewhat comfortably .

I have a full schedule at school this week , which was supposed to work in my favor , but she got mad and said that if I do n't do it , they will evict us and probably wont let her sign shit .

It 's like talking to a wall but you know it can hear you , and he liked that . But then he realized that there 's more to a relationship than that , and figured he should break it off since he was n't even sure what they were to begin with . When he said that , I was like , what ? Did you not even discuss if you were in a relationship or not ? Everyone thought that , and they always came out with us and were like a couple ... It was just a given , but I guess they never officially discussed it . Anyway , he starts to suspect that this other dude she was hanging with that he knew sorta , might have a thing for her and decided he 'd rather not know and just break it off .

But he later saw over Facebook that the dude had gone and he had invited her as well and they were tagged in photos together , that 's why she had plans already , she was doing the same thing he had asked her , but with other dude . Weird breakup cause he brought her snow in a lunchbox and left it at her door as a breakup gift , and wrote a breakup letter , which was more of him writing some abstract ideas about how he feels about her , him , their relationship , future and stuff .

Second year of show pro is amazing , you get to do all the lighting stuff , live sound , and video , and bands come in all the time and you help set up actual concerts weekly .

Then I found another place that had 2 more tires but different sizes and they said they were compatible with my car . 2 weeks later I got my dad to go with me to take my car for a check up ( thought a problem I had was the suspension as the car feels every bump and pothole on the road , but no , they said it 's fine , nothing I should worry about ) and he asked them if we should change my tires ( different place to any other that I 've been to when I got my tires ) and they said although the tires are n't of a good brand , they 're in ok shape for now so they would n't change them .

Not saying these are theirs , just giving a general statement , but these are some things that tick me off and give me a general impression about yourself and your choices growing up : If they constantly try to sound smarter than they are . If they litter and try to say that there ’ s a janitor or city worker that cleans up that mess , it ’ s their job . Basic manners . People who fuck up , and apologize by saying “ I ’ m sorry , but… ” There ’ s no but . If you are sorry , you say so , then shut up and deal with the consequences . How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them . Maybe that McDonalds worker has a degree but can ’ t find a job in it . Maybe life forced them to change course . Also , who would serve you that McDonalds if they didn ’ t ? If you have read nothing but the Bible . Big red-flag for me . Open your eyes a little . At least try and understand other people ’ s points of view . I might not have cared for the bible , and am not religious , but I don ’ t judge you for your choice , so don ’ t judge me for mine . Try and understand my point of view and know how to have a civilised conversation without getting angry because I disagree about your God . Tattoos of a person you 're in a relationship with or were in a relationship with . That 's permanent , think about it . I do not regret tattoos , and you should n't either . I had a best friend in high school . This girl was madly into him , she messed up and he could n't get over it . She decided to show her undying love for him by getting huge wings on her back ( like , whole upper back ) with some saying and his name to show that she wishes she had wings to fly to him and fly off with him . Needless to say he was n't impressed and she lost him as a friend , lover , everything . Why the fuck would you get that as a tattoo ?",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"What life path to take . Found out my health is affecting my career choice ( my degree is now practically useless ) . It ’ s not a big health issue , I can work just about anywhere else but with my degree , it ’ s impossible to find a suitable job . So now it seems I have to look for work in fields I have no knowledge about or get a regular job until I figure out what I ’ m going to do with my life . I just hope I don ’ t get sucked in to being stuck with no progress because I end up living paycheck to paycheck . I can freelance , but that 's very unpredictable . I have three other attempted degrees , so maybe I can try and finish one of those ( saves time , instead of spending another 4 in a university , since I 'm 26 and already kind of old to not have held a job in a field of study ) but that 's also time wasting . I ’ m currently back under my parents roof and daily think about how homelessness would be better than this ( we do n't get along ) and that I should just move out and figure things out . But I have nowhere to go , can ’ t drive for a while until my medical tests come back as safe to drive . So can ’ t take a car either . I think about ending it all but then I remember the things I have to look forward to . My best friend of 10 years now , is finally seeing his life looking up and it ’ s because of me among other people/things . It ’ s something that gives me hope every day , knowing I ’ m the reason he ’ s still alive and here for me . I also think about this kid I took in , who was homeless , and had nowhere to go . I saw something in him , I wanted to help him somehow . Knowing what it felt like to have nowhere to go and feel worthless was something I didn ’ t want anyone to have to experience . I gave him a place to stay for a bit , and told him to apply for jobs daily and make something of himself . Find a way to finish high school and do something more . I wonder how he is , if he ’ s okay . We lost touch but he could n't have been more grateful that I came along and gave him something , hope , a home , something to look forward to . I ’ m jealous in a way that even though he was homeless and on the street , he managed to get away from his parents and get away from the abuse and didn ’ t give in to the manipulation . I also think about how I can find someone that 'll stay with me as both a best friend and partner . I ’ ve had some odd life choices and it makes it hard to open up to people because I fear they ’ ll reject my past . I also have issues with emotional abuse , I ’ ve been dealing with it my whole life with my mom and it ’ s affected all my relationships too , I always end up with those types , and I just end up giving in to their tactics and am too nice to do anything about it . I ’ ve learned my lesson though and am not letting it get to me , but for a while I was stuck in this pattern where people would manipulate me to stay in the relationship . I don ’ t care if we lack a social life because we ’ re both struggling to make something of ourselves , I just want us to have each other and be happy . My last ex tried to kill himself because of our break-up ( manipulation tactic , not really wanting to die… ) and I still can ’ t get over that . It was so hard because I still cared about him as a person . I was supposed to fly out to visit my sister , which he knew would result in me just leaving ( he was going away for a while , and figured I ’ d move out while he ’ s gone ) . So me missing my flight to be in the hospital with him was a sign of hope that I still cared and wanted to be with him . He changed himself for the relationship , he turned into someone he wasn ’ t just to get me to like him more but that made me like him even less . And I have this constant paranoia of ending up in a relationship where the person keeps doing that . Just be yourself . I ’ m tired of people suddenly being like me because they fear I ’ ll leave them because there ’ s nothing there . Do n't suddenly read books because you think I 'll like you more for reading them . I know you hate reading them so do n't torture yourself so I can stay . It 's weird . You might try and turn into all the things I want from a partner , but it ’ ll never be real . I ’ ll always want someone who ’ s just themselves around me and I ’ m myself and we never have to hide or be fake to feel like the other person will stay . I ’ m not changing for you , and I don ’ t expect you to change for me . If you change , change for the better , make better habits , be a better person for YOU . Not for me . So I think about that . Also friendships . I ’ m so busy all the time and the friends I ’ ve had have mostly left or are busy themselves , have gone their own ways and are doing other things with their closer friends . The few friends I do have that want to hang all the time aren ’ t as intellectually stimulating as I ’ d like or are n't doing anything worthwhile . They just sit around high all day and do nothing worthwhile for the most part . I have friends I can have a good conversation with , but now that they 're working and busy , they 're always tired and weekends involve sitting in a coffee shop chatting instead of activities like camping/picnics or going out like we used to . I want to make new friends but because I get busy at times and am not sure when I ’ m free it makes it harder because I don ’ t want people to get the wrong idea that I ’ m not interested . Also I don ’ t know if I ’ m staying here for now or leaving ( I want to leave as soon as possible but I know I need a job first to save up money and get medical stuff in order , I live in a small island in the middle of nowhere and it makes it hard to do anything here , small population and all ) but if I make friends , and then have to move , it ’ ll just be so much harder . I guess I hope I find people that are as busy as me or understanding of my situation so when we do hang out , it ’ s worthwhile and we understand if one of us can ’ t . So yeah , those are some of the things I think about .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AskReddit,"I miss my dog too though he passed away last year . I was in a different country due to studies and I was always down about not being able to see him . I could n't take him with as he had health issues and was old , and probably would n't want to be in an unfamiliar environment . He was in a place for old dogs in the end because of the medical issues as my parents could n't devote the time to his health every day , kind of like an old people 's home for dogs . But his health got to the point that we had to put him down . I still remember my dads phone call to me ( who had never really been an animal person his whole life , and only got close to the dog as an effort to get close to me and fix our relationship which is nonexistent ) , telling me that he went to see him one last time and could n't do it as he thought Whiskey ( my dog ) would have hope that he was coming home . ; ( Hearing that coming from my dad of all people that I have no relationship with made it all the much harder .

12084182,AskReddit,"Also , do n't forget to be grateful to the three you 's : there 's the past you , the present you , and the future you . Be grateful to the past you for the positive things you 've done . And do favors for the future you like you would for your best friend . Not feeling so good today ? Stop a second , think of a good decision you made yesterday . Thank you younger me . Second part of the 3 me 's is you have to do your future self a favor , just like you would for your best friend ( Remember : You have got two . its future and past you ) . Tired and ca n't get yourself to stop wasting time ? Do it for your future self , I 'm going to exercise X for 17 minutes . I 'm doing this one for future me . Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfortable ? I do n't care about my present self , this one 's for my best friend , the future self . I 'm up and going for that run I kept telling myself I 'd do . Don ’ t forget to thank your old self for doing good at the end of every , single , thing . That makes your life better . The cycle of doing something for someone else ( future you ) and thanking someone for the good in your life ( past you ) is key to building gratitude and productivity . Remember to forgive yourself if you did not succeed in something . You tried hard , but you still did n't do it . Now you 're giving yourself a hard time for not doing what you need to , to be who you want to . You might give yourself a hard time for not doing something you had planned to do . Heads up Sibur , being disappointed in yourself causes you to be less productive . Tried your best to have a day where you at least got one thing done and it failed ? So what ? I forgive you previous self . I forgive you . But today ? Today is a day where I get as much done as possible to the best of my ability for future self . This one 's for you future friend . Forgiveness , use it . I forgive you . Say it out loud if you need to . It helps reinforce things . Look at yourself in the mirror , look at you as a person , and admire that reflection . Appreciate it . Phew , I wrote a lot haha . It would n't even let me post because of how much I wrote ... Just went rambling ... So this ended up as a second comment .

12084182,AskReddit,"Depression is always a bitch , but you have to try and not let it get to you . We can let it swallow us up , or get up and fight it . It 's not easy , I struggle with that same fight every day , but do n't let it get to you and give in . You broke it off so clearly you had some reasons as to why you did n't see it working out , but do n't focus on the negative , focus on the positives that you 've learned from it . Maybe it took time to realize how it was affecting you and how negative the situation really was , but whatever the reasons , do n't let them get to you . Focus on the good things you 've got going on . Instead of wallowing of what could have been , think about what can be . Right now you probably have no intention of a new relationship , but it 's good to think about what you 've learned from it . If you broke up for reasons other than infidelity , there 's something to take from it , a reason why you could n't see marriage in the future anymore . Take that and focus on what you want out of the next relationship , so you when it comes along , you realize it 's what you 've been waiting for and it does n't pass you by . Do n't let the depression swallow you so you miss out on something , but also focus on other things that are important to you right now and get them done so you can stop thinking about how badly the relationship affected you . My last relationship ended with me realizing how it just was n't meant to be in the long term , and I now know what to expect of my next one . It 's painful , but you need to find a way to let go of the pain . Avoiding pain would n't be a problem if we did it once or twice a year . But for most of us , it 's a habit we 've embedded deeply into ourselves . We barricade ourselves behind an invisible wall and do n't venture out because beyond the wall is pain . I do this all the time . But you and I both need to get the strength to move on and find the motivation to get those things done that we think about . Instead of 'I should ... ' you need to say 'I will ... ' it reinforces the thought in your head that you will get it done . You might be avoiding anything that can make you feel exposed ... Avoiding facing responsibility , you hide in your comfort zone . Most people have a faulty way of motivating themselves . They ’ re motivated to get whatever they want , because they feel they don ’ t have enough already . This feeling of lacking is powerful as a motivator , but you pay a huge price for it . That price is the ongoing feeling that there ’ s always something missing . Even if you get something you ’ ve wanted , you quickly become dissatisfied with it , which then motivates you to get something else . You can never be happy on this treadmill . Eventually , it sucks the meaning and energy out of your life . So try instead of thinking that you lack something , think of what you 've got , use that to motivate you that you 've gotten so much out of life already , and there 's so much more yet to come . Pick something you hate doing . In your case it might be any of the things you mentioned , painting your walls , washing the dog . Or maybe a phone call/email you 've been delaying or running an errand you 've been asked of . Imagine that pattern is a place you hide in . That 's your comfort zone . What does it feel like ? You probably felt you were in a safe and familiar place . Free of the pain the world brings with it . This almost completely re-creates your comfort zone , but it leaves out the final ingredient . Strange as it might seem , merely escaping pain is n't enough for us . We insist the pain be replaced with pleasure . We do this with an endless array of addictive activities : internet surfing , alcohol , drugs , the aptly named `` comfort food '' . You order out , which is more likely less healthy than cooking , you might smoke , I did and it was n't all that good for me , but for those few moments , you get relaxed and feel stress free . All these behaviors are widespread - we 're an entire culture looking for it 's comfort zone . You weave those activities into your daily routine . Some get high every evening with their friends eating pizza and might feel like they 're in an alternate universe . I will never get that , but for them it works , they take one hit and the rest of the world disappears . This alternate world , which for you is different , as is for most people , feels like a soothing , pleasurable , warm bath , as if , for a moment , you 've found your way back to the womb . These `` warm-bath '' activities just cripple us further . The more you hide in the warm bath , the less willing you become to deal with the cold shower of reality . Ask yourself what your warm bath activities are . The more frequently you indulge in them , the more likely it is that you 're using them to create a comfort zone . Here 's another exercise I 'd like for you to try : Feel yourself indulging in one or more of these behaviors . Imagine the pleasure you feel lifts you into a womb-like world . How does this world affect your sense of purpose ? Think about these things . Try and change your thought process regarding them and make yourself more productive . It takes 21 days to make a habit apparently , so take one task at a time , something you are avoiding , and get into the habit of facing it daily and forcing yourself to do it . The same way you might wake up for work or class or whatever it is that you 're doing with life , you have to face other tasks . There are days we might not want to wake up at all , and just sing 'I 'm never waking up ... ' but the reality is , we have to , reality awaits and we have to face it otherwise our problems pile up and the stack of things we have to do gets bigger and bigger and we struggle harder and harder because it seems ever more daunting . The more we put things off , the harder they become to face . Think about someone you might admire . In my example it would be Elon Musk . He 's like a modern day Tesla . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla - electric car company - was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . So no ordering out , being lazy on the couch ... ( Which makes me feel like a hypocrite as I 'm writing this , as I 'm being lazy , eating delivery from this place called Burger Lab and not doing anything productive ... aha . ) But moving on , because Elon avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . He 's like an [ Ubermensch ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ % C3 % 9Cbermensch ) in a way . Always in the news with some new crazy project , and yet finding the time to have a family . The avoider , which would be you and me in this example , only care for immediate gratification ; we take no responsibility for the future . But we need to try our hardest to find a way to . The future being the things we need to get done that we 're lazy to do . That 's why you might have regrets about your past , I know I do . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . The moment you do this , you activate a force more powerful than the force to avoid pain . ( and I 'm not talking some high above force , just something within all of us , but see it as you find fitting ) Now as an avoider , like most people , we choose avoidance instead . As a result , you don ’ t live up to your potential , never becoming fully yourself . ( Just my statements , you might feel differently about this , not meant as negative criticism , just being constructive ) Like for example , my mom was always making negative remarks to me , and I tried hard to get past them and prove her wrong , but I started to feel I did n't want to be vulnerable anymore . That turned me into a limited version of who I wanted to be . I set up walls and did n't let anyone past them , and it took a long time to get over that , and I 'm still not , but I 'm trying , and I think everyone in a similar situation should do too . Just try and tap into yourself , find a center in you , and think of what you are avoiding doing , but then start to focus on how that feels , not the action itself , but how it makes you feel , and make yourself desire that pain or whatever it might be . Try and make yourself desire the feeling that what you 're avoiding is creating . You ’ ve now taken your normal desire to avoid pain and reversed it into a desire to face it . Doing this regularly will reveal the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . That ’ s why desire is a crucial part of this . It keeps you moving toward pain . You ’ re not desiring pain because you ’ re masochistic ; you ’ re desiring pain so you can shrink it . When you become confident you can do this every time , you ’ ve mastered your fear of pain . I do n't always remember to do this , but when I do , it helps me get over a task quickly and I feel satisfied knowing I 've managed to do something I 've been slacking off about . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the endless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and fuelled your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . You had one goal and nothing was stopping you from reaching it . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Also , it 's not a bad thing to broaden your horizons and experience something new , meet new people . The salary upgrade is great , and although money ca n't necessarily buy happiness , the fact that it 's a better job , is going to work wonders for your resume . You 're unsure what might happen with your current job , with the change of management and not feeling productive or any challenge since you 're tasked with basic things and not what you really want out of your job . But you also feel like the new job might end as soon as they use you for what you 're needed for and teach their staff how to do things themselves .

12084182,callcenter,"We are not computerized yet . Everything we do is manual , old school , pen and paper . We have a printed sheet of database , we write our notes on it next to each potential clients number and then if we get an email , we write that info out on another sheet known as the 'client sheet ' and then the manager comes in , takes those sheets and sends out emails that day . But our boss/ceo said that computers should be at our desks beginning of next month , they 're just finalizing the software ( It 's custom apparently ) , and will have a screen with client name , past calls , notes on client , his info/details , I can go through past calls , see details for each one .

12084182,elonmusk,"Also , he 's one of the few rare individuals that refuses to have a limited life . He drives through tremendous amounts of pain - from rejections ( Tesla was seen as a failure at first ! ) and failures ( space-x took a while to launch successfully ) to shorter amounts of embarrassment and anxiety But he also I assume handles the small , tedious pain , required for personal discipline , forcing himself to do things we all know we should do , but do n't - like exercising and eating right and organizing things . Because he avoids nothing , he can pursue his highest aspirations . He seems more alive than the rest of us . Always in the news with some new insane project , and yet finding the time to have a family . Most of us are avoiders , we only care for immediate gratification ; and take no responsibility for the future . A sense of purpose does n't come from thinking about it . It comes from taking action that moves you towards the future . Elon has mastered the impossible , he does n't feel pain most of us do . Pain can be in the form of rejection of projects , loss of finances , etc . It manifests itself in many ways . Most of us , despite such setbacks , try to get past them , but there comes a point where we do n't want to be vulnerable anymore . And that decision makes us a limited version of who we are meant to be . Elon on the other hand has mastered facing and desiring pain . It 's not that he 's desiring having no money or his business failing , he 's facing the pain the situation creates itself . Doing this reveals the secret about pain that allows you to master it : pain is not absolute . Your experience of pain changes relative to how you react to it . When you move toward it , pain shrinks . When you move away from it , pain grows . If you flee from it , pain pursues you like a monster in a dream . If you confront the monster , it goes away . To quote Elon : '' when I was a little kid I was really scared of the dark . But then I came to understand , dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength-400 to 700 nanometers . Then I thought , well it 's really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons . Then I was n't afraid of the dark anymore after that . '' Desire is a crucial part of learning to conquer pain . It keeps one moving toward pain . He 's not desiring pain because he 's masochistic ; he 's desiring pain so he can shrink it . Think about this for a minute , think about an infant , you started life rather helplessly , yet in a remarkable short time , you moved from crawling to standing to walking . You did this despite the countless setbacks . No matter how many times you fell , you got right back up and pursued your goal of walking . Your sense of purpose in that moment was amazing . It 's a force that drives children to develop basic skills for growing up . Because it 's the same for each child , it works as a universal presence they 're not aware of . Most of us become aware of pain and start to build up walls and comfort zones . But to be truly Elon , you need to eliminate all of that fear , and just do it ! Whatever it is , face it , and work on it , no matter what others think or say or what comes your way .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past . The birds carry it , get sick and then sicken their owners . There is Chlamydia pneumoniae , and it causes a different form of pneumonia . You find this infection more often in older people . It 's not common ( and neither is psittacosis ) . There are also chlamydia eye infections , too . Chlamydia in the eye is rare in countries that have better sanitation and hygiene . But it blinds many women in Africa every year . Not that I intend to exonerate the girl myself , but I would like to note that vaginal chlamydia is often silent in women , and it can go undetected for a long time .

But kids on the other hand , draw them as they see them , for example , one image was of a family , where the father had huge hands , as in ginormous , and the mother was drawn very small in proportion to him and her mouth was nonexistent while his father had a very big one . This shows that he hits with his hands , physical abuse as well as verbal ( the big mouth ) , while the mother is small and can not do anything about it and is afraid to even speak .

One day when the grandmother was hospitalized , my older cousin decides to go give her a surprise visit . He notices she 's a little unnerved and keeps insisting he leave , the doctor will come soon or something , he notices it 's odd and sticks around . His dad shows up , he 's shocked . The guy does n't even say a word to him , completely ignores him . When my cousin says something , he 's like 'I 'll get to you later , we 'll talk after ' and he 's like wtf , and just up and leaves and it was pretty weird . What the hell people ? I 'm glad you 're okay , but that 's just messed up that your dad would just up and leave for gambling and only call when he needs money .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,getdisciplined,"Tell your mind otherwise , try and see your mind as a completely separate thing . As , not you but the voice in your head that tells you to feel and act a certain way . Tell it to fuck off and that you 're in charge now ! You have an absence of awareness of what 's going on around you , except for the thoughts that are continuously passing through your mind . It is the state of being so identified with the voices in your head , that you think you are the voices in your head . It is when we identify with this inner chatter - when we come to think of it as us - that thinking becomes compulsive . We do it all the time , ceaselessly , and the idea that we might ever enjoy a respite from thinking never occurs to us . We come to see our thinking , and our continuing to exist as people , as one and the same thing . Not being able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction . But we do n't realize this , because almost everybody is suffering from it . So it 's considered normal . The sense of self that we construct from identifying with our thoughts is what we call the 'ego ' . And by definition living in the service of the ego can never make us happy . Why can the ego never bring happiness ? Eckhart Tolle argues that the Stoics , who concluded that our judgements about the world are the source of our distress . But he takes things further , suggesting that these judgments , along with all our other thoughts , are what we take ourselves to be . We 're not only distressed by our thoughts ; we imagine that we are those thoughts . The ego that results from this identification has a life of it 's own . It sustains itself through dissatisfaction - through the friction it creates against the present moment , by opposiing itself to what 's happening , and by constantly projecting into the future , so that happiness is always some other time , never now . The ego , Tolle likes to say , thrives on drama , because compulsive thinking can sink it 's teeth into drama . The ego also thrives on focusing on the future , since it 's much easier to think compulsively about the future then about the present . ( It 's really quite tricky , when you try it , to think compulsively about now . ) If all this is correct , we have inadvertently sentenced ourselves to unhappiness . Compulsive thinking is what we take to be the core of our being - and yet conpulsive thinking relies on our feeling dissatisfied . The way out of this trap is not to stop thinking - thinking , is exceedingly useful - but to disidentify from thoughts : to stop taking your thoughts to be you , to realize , that 'you are not your mind ' . we should start using the mind as a tool , instead of letting the mind use us , which is the normal state of affairs . When Descartes said 'I think , therefore I am , ' he had not discovered 'the most fundamental truth ' , Tolle insists ; instead , he had given expression to 'the most basic error ' .

12084182,aww,"When I was a kid I was with my dad for a week alone , after much pestering ( knowing mom would disapprove ) he took me to the shelter . I guess he was hoping I 'd go for a puppy to keep me amused ( and less attention on his end ) and did not expect what would happen next . When we got there I saw this old dog just lying in the corner of his cell , all alone , no one wanted him , he was heartbroken and I was gon na be his savior ! I 'll never forget that day , they told me he was 12 years old , he was their oldest dog they had . Something about him , about his loneliness , and maybe mine too , made me realize we were the perfect match ! All the other dogs could jump around , wag their tails all they wanted , pull off those cute puppy faces , but I wanted him . We bought him everything new , collar , bowl , a chew toy , and took him home . I took him for a long walk and he fell asleep on the bed next to me . I never expected that I would wake up to him not with me anymore . For years I kept blaming myself , that I did something wrong , even though they told me it was not my fault . It was n't until I was much older that I realized that , that was probably the best day in his life , and he waited his whole life , using whatever energy he had left , hoping that someone would love him , if at least for one day , and I gave him that and he went to rest in peace . I just hate how emotional I get thinking about it , makes me cry every time .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My ex boyfriend and I would often go fishing in the afternoons , he 'd go with some friends and I 'd tag along . This one time he told me that his friend , had a friend , who knew some people on a farm and they could get us a goat and they wanted to cook it . So we 're driving in his friends car , pick his friend up and a goat , it was a Sunday ( so nothing works that day ) and as we 're driving along in the pick-up , we get pulled over . Cops are curious about the goat . They thought we stole it . Turns out the guy that hooked us up with the goat , was illegal , so he ran for his life . We were shocked and I was so freaking out we 'd go to jail or something . They had to call up the farm next day to find out if it was legally purchased . It was . So we all got let off . The guy was deported . That was the strangest thing that has ever happened to me .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

My mom told me that kids are not allowed on red ( as the carpeting was red ) and so the next hotel we went to , was the opposite , the walkways were red , and the casino areas were blue , and I remember running on the blue so that I would n't be on the red and told off . Hahaha . Then mom had to explain how this one was different . Also when you lift your tongue up there 's some black lines underneath .

12084182,AskReddit,"Okay , I see where this is going , reading most of the posts , I can tell you 're not really ready to back down from your idea of going there . I do n't know if it 's good or not as I have mixed feelings . Either way I 'd be really surprised and a little creeped out that someone got a ticket just to see me , but depending on the ex , I 'd either be okay with it or feel very uneasy about the situation and lock myself up . I know you 're not gon na back down cause you 're like me . I 've been in situations where I asked for advice and no matter how many people told me the same thing , I found counter arguments hoping they 'd change their minds and give me advice that in my head would be the ideal situation even though I knew it was n't . I would say try and contact her first cause it might creep her out that you went out of your way to find her contact info and so on ... Or if you 're planning to go there , make sure to let her know , do n't have to tell her about the ticket cause she 'll definitely get the wrong idea about you flying over just to talk about a break up that happened 1 year ago . I 'd say find a way to call her or text her . Well personally I think writings better as she has to read it all before responding and wont but in and shut you off . If you call she might put the phone down . Writing a letter is great as she has the option to chose if she 'll read it or not . If she does , make it clear that you 're over her , so she knows that you 're not wanting to meet up to get back together cause that 'll stir up old memories and make her think how you 're just gon na hurt her again . Once you 've made that clear , just tell her you 'd like to meet up , you 'll be in her area and it would really mean a lot to her or mention that you have a ticket and the relationship meant a lot to you and you thought you were doing what was for the best at the time and her parents disapproved of you and that you felt you needed some closure .

12084182,AskReddit,"That 's not bad at all . For a research paper at school I chose to study the sex trade industry . Girls as young as 11 get traded , or even younger on some occasions . Stories from survivor girls include the most gruesome shit you 'll ever read . To sum up the day of a girl working as a prostitute : Almost no sleep , drugs keep you awake , barely any food , if you do n't sleep with at least 30 men ( in some cases more ) a day , you get beaten badly , having a bad day ? Your pimp does n't care . On your period ? Lower the light so the customer does n't notice . Hungry ? Well tough luck . Absolutely horrible . One girl got forced into a marriage by a man that claimed money for her , he sold her for a couple thousand , remarried other girls in the same way . She ended up being used as a sex slave in a guys house , tied her to a wall in chains and his friends could fuck her whenever they pleased . Another girl got sold into the sex trade by a false job ad , she found her way home finally , pregnant , her dad failed to believe her and the rest of her family , they called her a slut , so she went to a family friend who offered her a job and told her it was safe , when really she just got sold into the sex trade again . If you want references let me know and I 'll find my paper and cite the sources/books I read . That 's just some of the stuff I 've read . Another unrelated story was a girl that got molested by her grandpa since she was 4 , that led her to do heavy drugs so she would n't sleep cause sleep induced dreams of him molesting her . As a rape victim myself , I do n't even want to know what that feels like for them , it 's bad enough that I occasionally have flashbacks and nightmares about it .

12084182,IAmA,"Ok , here 's my opinion as a girl : First thing , everyone 's different , but I do think you should try out different things and find what works for you . For me personally , masturbating by hand and fingering myself has never done much for me , tbh it 's probably me not wanting to invest a lot of time learning what my body likes as I know that I can easily be thrown out of the mood and then I 'll be annoyed and so I do n't bother with that . It rarely got me anywhere . What I do when I 'm in my bedroom , put some porn on and masturbate by rubbing my underwear . I also usually have daily pads in there ( but that 's usually out of habit , I always wear them and I find when I 'm doing it , it also adds pressure , without one , it 's not the same . ) So I just rub and get off . But seriously , that 's nothing compared to what happens in the shower . Just rubbing will give me a mild orgasm , and after a few times it gets weaker and then I do n't do it for a while so when I do it , it gets strong again . Maybe do n't do it for a while and then see what happens . But in the shower , it 's amazing . Take your shower head and bonus if you can change the strength and make it extra strong pressure or if you have a jet thing like in a jacuzzi . Mess around with that and see what happens , those are the best orgasms you can ever get . Just place it on your pussy and move it around and find what feels good and keep it there . Also note that if you feel like peeing , that 's normal , you do n't need to pee you 're just on the way to orgasm . And here 's something , I do n't know if it works for other girls , but I know it definitely works for me . Cold water . When I was a kid I was always the one daring to jump into the sea or the pool when it was cold , everyone else would slowly get in , putting little water on them to adapt/adjust . I would jump in and swim fast to get warm . Thought I also found out that moving my legs in cold water gave a good feeling , which I later found out was an orgasm ( kinda disturbing when I think about it now ) Anw , I used to fill up the bathtub with really freezing water and get in to feel that way . Though when I found out there were better ways to do it and learned what an orgasm is , then things changed . But if that is true to all girls , maybe try that : Fill a bathtub up to the top with cold water , freezing water will only do the trick and then get in quickly and just move your legs apart and close fast . And I 've never been able to get an orgasm through sex . I 've been with two guys , one was a virgin , and the other claimed he was good at it and whatnot , did n't do anything for me .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,funny,"I think that 's great . I really think it 's stupid how in the US you drive before you can drink . So of course a 16 year old that can drive to a party will drink and not know of the consequences . You learn to drink and what effects it has on you so then when you are able to drive , you know what your limits are . I hate when I see stupid kids here drinking and then driving cars ( I do n't know how they get access to a car as driving age is 18 here ) But I 've seen it happen at parties I 've attended . My parents were always against drinking and those things . Though I was never a crazy party type , but my best friend liked beer , so I got into drinking some of that when we were out . I know my limits now .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,relationships,"I know I 'm not him , but I 'll try and put it from his perspective , take that how you will , I know I might not even know what 's going through his head . `` It 's been years since the incident , I 'm still depressed but I manage to go on . I 'm in college for game art , I suppose that 's good , better than engineering school , that was too easy , though I suppose this is too since I 'm better than most of the other students . I 'm bored enough to join a dating site , lets message some girls to see if they want to hang . Hmm , she seems cool , she 's into games too . Maybe we can play sometime . Oh God , she 's amazing , we spent every day together this week , I have n't had so much fun in years . I 'm in Love . I told her that today , I think it might have been to sudden when I blurted it out , she looked at me funny , but hey , I ca n't help what I 'm feeling . I asked her to be my girlfriend . There 's not a day we do n't spend together , I do n't want to be around anyone else . I broke down tonight , I guess my past caught up to me . I told her about my only other girlfriend , how she was in a car crash when we were 18 , after dating for four years , and how I had to pull the plug . Nothing was the same since . I was so depressed and gained weight abnormally ( after stopping all sports that I was actively in ) , that they had to remove my stomach , I became obese , I 'm better now , but she has n't seen what I was like . I told her that she was the only thing that made me feel good anymore . She made my world . We 've been together for 3 weeks , and she 's going away to visit her family in a little over a month for 3 months . I do n't want her to go but I do n't want to be too forward to suggest to go with her . I brought it up , kinda , I do n't get why she 's being weird about it , what has she got to hide ? She got a weird message the other night from a friend back home . I could n't sleep , it was 3am and I did n't like it , but there was nothing to suggest anything weird in their conversation history . I 'm worried she 's hiding something , I should just leave this place , forget it all . I do n't want to get hurt . She 's awake and convincing me to stay , that it was a wrong message , and that there 's nothing in the history , which is true . I 'll trust her . But as I say this , I do n't trust her going home , I 'm going to go with her , I bought myself tickets , it 's two months in and I 'm spending 2k to go be with her , is n't that romantic ? I hope she thinks it 's as romantic as I do . I hope she moves in with me soon , I told her I 'd get her a cheap car from craigslist so she can drive to school since I 'm not at a walking distance from it . We 're heading back home , her lease is running up and I suggested she moves in with me . It 's been 5 months now . I 'd like her to be with me , we have n't spent a day apart except from her being 1 week home until I got there . Her roommate brings up moving with some friends so she can move in with me , perfect ! I told her she 'd be paying less rent if she stays with me , besides , her mom just had expensive surgery and her parents are probably short on money . She 's not going to be selfish and spend more money is she ? She can get a car now with that money she was meant to use for rent . I lost my income , things have been a bit tight so I 've asked her to contribute to me more than usual . But we 're a couple and we help each other right ? I helped her with her stuff when she needed it , now it 's her turn . She wants to go out often , which I think is a waste of money ( by often I mean , 2-3 times a month ) . She goes out with her friends and stays up late , like 3-4 am and I do n't know what she 's doing or if she 's alright . She texts me all the time but I feel bad to interfere with her friend time so I tell her so but she still texts me . Then I start feeling bad for her so I stop texting , but then I sulk at how she 's out having fun while I 'm home alone . But it 's okay , I make sacrifices for the relationship . She says I should go out with my friends , but why ? I 've got her , she 's all I need , I do n't need anyone else in my life , she makes me happy , my friends were there just to kill time . I was still bored , even hanging with them . She gets me , like no one else does , she makes my day , anything she does is just magical . If she were to leave , I 'd be devastated . I said the other day that I 'd probably kill myself , then I realized later that she took it the wrong way . I noticed she posted to that Reddit site she 's always on , I did n't like her post , it sounded like she was unhappy . She mentioned that it was emotional abuse , but then I told her that I did n't mean it that way , I was joking . I was n't , but I did n't want to crush her , I love her , she 's my everything . I do n't want to hurt her . She told me it was n't the same , things have changed , she has different feelings now . It crushed me , I was devastated , how could she say that ? Was what I offered her not enough ? I got her everything that she wanted , even when she told me I did n't have to , I knew she 'd want it and was just modest . We still have sex regularly , 1-2 times a day , I know she 's not always into it , but she knows it makes me happy and I know she wants to make me happy . I do n't get how she can suddenly not be into it , it 's weird . I still try hard to get her to enjoy herself and hope that she changes her mind . I ca n't take it anymore , everything 's piling on , I 've got a warrant for my arrest , I failed to mention I have some bad habits , but it 's okay , she accepts me , bad habits or not . That 's what I love about her . I told her I could n't take it , and I got some sleeping pills . I planned on doing it right at the time she leaves , oh yeah she 's flying to see her sister for a month , I feel like she ca n't take it here anymore and it 's the only reason . I told her it was selfish of her to want to just hang with her sister while I 'm here struggling with a warrant and everything turning to shit . I used to make 4k a week , and now I 've got nothing . Except the job that I got right out of college , out of 500 people applying to the same company , 80 in my city , I got the job among 6 other people . I was that lucky guy . I mean , I also have a house , of my own , my own car , smart TV , gaming computer , 5 consoles , 4 laptops , etc ... But I 'm broke , really . I have nothing , I ca n't afford to pay for things soon . And she 's leaving . She found me , paralyzed in the bed , not feeling it , and called an ambulance . I told her to go , but she could n't , she stayed by my side . I made sure my parents did n't find out , it would devastate them . I got out but realized I could n't evade my warrant for too long so I turned myself in right before she got a second ticket to just go see her parents . My parents had to find out eventually . They were more supportive than I thought , I told her to not tell them all the details of what I did , just enough . Especially not about killing myself , I ca n't have them know that . She 's gone for the summer , I ca n't call her . I used to call her daily , and she 'd brighten up my time in here . I ca n't take it , I 'm not meant for jail . She 's back now , and she came to visit me once , but seems to be busy to come again . She wants to move out . I do n't see why she should , I mean , she can stay there , and does n't even have to pay rent , my parents got it covered , I do n't want to stress her while she has school and all these other stresses moving is too much for her . I told her I 'd help her once I 'm out , I want to help her . Plus money 's tight , so she should save up while she 's here and I can help her get money and fix things . It 's official , she 's leaving and sooner than I thought . I told her to at least stay until I can get house visits once a week for 10 hours . Just to hold her and hug her and watch a movie one last time . I was hoping the distance would make the heart grow fonder . Turns out I was wrong , oh so wrong . What do ? I get out of jail , I lost the job I had for the summer , I lost my car , did n't make payments . I have the house , but it 's empty , she 's gone and I 've got nothing .

12084182,AskReddit,"When I was in high school I had some really fucked up dreams that kept recurring . I 'd watch something take place ( usually some form of abuse or a murder , or something just downright atrocious ) and I could n't do a thing to help , I 'd be there physically and talking and trying to get people to notice me but nothing happening . So a girl would be raped , and I 'm just standing there , watching and not being able to do anything . This started happening after an operation I had in which they did n't administer the anesthetic properly . I woke up after the operation to find I could n't move or talk or respond . The doctors were trying to wake me up yet I was there , trying to talk to them to tell them I was awake and I could n't do a thing . It was a horrible fear of mine and I still have n't gone for that second operation I was supposed to go for ( 5 years later ) because of that fear . The dream manifests that fear in a strange way . I have lots of recurring dreams though . The most common being where I 'm running from something or someone . Usually with someone else or a bunch of people , or occasionally on my own .

12084182,canada,"Hopefully these tragedies will shine more light on our society 's mental health problems . General knowledge about mental health is pretty distorted . A lot of people disparage anti-depressants and other pills . Well , do you know why most people turn to medication instead of counseling or talk therapy ? No , it 's not because the drug companies are pushing their products on people . It 's because counseling and talk therapy are not covered by any healthcare plan , and they cost dearly . Moreover , it 's very difficult to obtain a psychiatrist in most provinces in this country . In Ontario , you need a referral from a medical doctor ... you ca n't just book your own appointments . If you manage to get such a reference , you 'll be lucky to land one appointment every six months or so . So what ends up happening is that most people are treated for their mental health issues by their family doctors or other regular MDs . And all they can really do is prescribe drugs and encourage you to seek counseling which you ca n't afford in the first place . This is the world that people suffering from mental illnesses face .

I would suggest explaining that it was your first relationship , and you have only spoken to him twice because that 's how little he mattered , it 's merely catching up since you were important people in each others lives . The main thing I want to say is that if he disapproves , maybe an option is to invite him along , as akward as it might be , it might give him the perspective that it 's the last time you 'll ever see him and nothing 's gon na happen since you invited him along and he might either feel more trusting of you or might decide to come along for your sake , so it 's a win win sorta , if you 're okay with him being there .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"You asked for elaboration , so here goes : There 's so many things I would change . So many scenarios that could have played out differently and change my life entirely . Make more friends , real friends , stop being introverted and shy , and actually go out and meet people . Study more , get decent grades and be more directional with my life ( even though I 'm studying what I want , there 's at least 5 other things I 'd gladly be studying right now ) Tell my parents I can predict the future ( well , just over time make them realize that little things I say come true , not make a big deal of it , cause that would probably be weird and go on a grande scale ) , and make them make better choices that impacts my life . Little things , that made my life harder , just avoid them . Avoid certain people that were bad for me . Change relationships . Stop my friend from killing himself . My current boyfriend ( that I love to death ) had one girlfriend before me , and she died in a car crash . Even though it would pain me to do this , I 'd prevent that so he did n't have to suffer the way he did ( totally messed up his life , he stopped exercising , caused him to gain a lot of weight since he ate a lot and did n't burn it off , and it got so bad that he became obese and his stomach overproduced acid and it ate his stomach and they had to operate to remove it , which resulted in no stomach , he can only eat a cup worth of food for a meal . No more . ) He 's lost the weight but you can see the scars from the surgery all over . I 'm pretty sure he 'd be better off not having to experience all that , also his life was very dull before he met me . And I know he would n't be with me unless I was physically around him , and we lived countries apart , and he 'd be with her at some point so I 'd just hate to live life knowing him but not at the same time , and so on ... I 'd stop my best friend from dating the bitch he was dating for 5 years that told him that she did n't love him for the past 2 years but stayed with him cause she felt sorry for him and finally felt the courage to tell him that since they were long distance for a year . Almost killed himself over it . Stop my dog from getting run over and suffering badly after that . Assholes ( tried to break into our house , he bit the guys leg - mind you , he 's a small terrier/poodle type mix and is n't violent at all , but knows bad intentions when he sees them ) They came back a few days later and as he chased the car ( according to neighbors ) they ran at him . Complete internal bleeding and for months he could n't move an inch without pain and suffering . Find better ways to make money . I was always scheming how to make more money , but definitely make better choices there . Maybe even make something I knew would be popular ( not necessarily something big , I do n't want to alter the world that much so that the whole future changes and I do n't know a thing about it - I do want to retain at least some control of my future ) Now that I know what people think about me , perhaps change their perceptions to something better ?

The wife died of illness and the father just went deeper and deeper into religion and it 's almost as if he forgot his family existed , they were very poor too and could not afford much care for the ailing wife . So I can imagine that ate him up . He just became oblivious to things going on around him .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,IAmA,"I got into a local university despite not finishing high school ( I left one year early , also was not 18 yet ) so yeah , people overlook things . I knew someone teaching there and he said I should apply and he put things through for me .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AdviceAnimals,"Yeah , people should definitely get the benefits , I 'm from Europe where you get free medicare if you need it , and my sister lives in Canada where it 's the same . Since moving to the US I 've not adapted to the fact that if you 're sick , you 're just stuck unless you have some sort of medical insurance or the money and it 's a shame for people that ca n't afford it . I 've sprained my foot once at this place where I do my internship and my manager thought I broke it as I was in sever pain and when the medics came , they said it would be at least 500 $ to get it x-rayed and other stuff and I said I 'd just go home at that point . Do n't have that kinda money on me . Some people have it worse , and it 's a shame that they ca n't help themselves and their family .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,awwwtf,"Oh wow , I 'm so sorry for his loss . ( My original post was a joke , I do n't want her cats dead , I love animals , I just thought it was funny as it went with the site ) but yeah , it sucks that he had to lose all his pets . I assume they were his anyways ...",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AdviceAnimals,"I keep saying the same thing , so many dumb people with kids , raising stupid kids , when there are nice kids waiting to be adopted but you have to wait for 5 years before you get approved and no one wants to do that . We should automatically get a pregnancy control pill that lasts say , 5 years or something and then you get re-evaluated and then they give you another one or state that you are stable . I think they should invent something so you have to be at least 18 or something , and then you have to get approved or you wont be allowed medical benefits at a hospital . Or something ...",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AdviceAnimals,"It 's not damaging , a lot of people are like that actually . And I 'm not disagreeing with you , if you 're as dumb as them , by all means , give it up for adoption . But I want to state that if you 're sane , have the money , and the time . Keep the kid . Reason I 'm saying this is cause a friend of mine , who was in an adoption center , never got adopted , he 's studying at the same university as me and told me that at 21 , he left the adoption center as did many other kids he was with , never knowing what a home is . Had to start his own life , did n't want anything to do with the people from the adoption place , hated everyone there . He has severe hatred for his 'parents ' and why they ditched him . If he was adopted , and liked his family , I 'm sure he would n't think twice . I 'm not entirely disagreeing with you , but there are kids that do n't get adopted and there are kids that get adopted into bad families ( have a neighbor back home who committed suicide recently , I 'll never know why , but I know he was adopted into a strict family , the other neighbors would hang out with him and he had crazy curfews and punishments , he hated his home ) So yeah , it goes both ways . A good and bad thing . Oh and why is it that most guys are not into adoption ? I wish my bf was ...",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,drums,Hospitals have drum kits because it 's a way to treat stress/depression . I met someone who was a drum instructor at a hospital and he told me he teaches it to people in stressful environments and it helps get all the stress away .,Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AdviceAnimals,"Damn , how old was the kid ? It 's a really sticky situation to be in as little kids do n't generally know what they 're doing and as a parent this causes you endless rage as your kid just shattered your windshield and it ends up doing more harm than good as the parent directs all his rage onto the kid that did n't know he was doing something wrong . Unless it 's one of those kids that knows they 're being bad and does it anyway cause it 's funny or something , fuck that . Glad I 'm not a parent .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
12084182,AdviceAnimals,"One of my friends in high school had the oddest relationship with his mom . So I 'm over this one day and he starts yelling 'Where the fuck is my food you fucking bitch , I thought I told you to bring it to me an hour ago ' and I was so shocked , he was so vulgar towards her . And as I 'm telling him that he should n't be like that towards her , she comes up the stairs 'You want your food you asshole , better get that damned laundry , you retarded twat ' and that just shut me up . His dad comes home one day from being away and both of them shut up completely and acted so nice to each other 'oh you wanted that food ? Sorry I forgot it , I got distracted with the TV , coming right up ' Wow , like seriously .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

12084182,AskReddit,"When after turning a guy down , he assumes that I thought he was obsessively into me , so to make it seem less weird he brings up the fact that there 's other women he 's considering and I should reconsider as well as he likes me a little more than the others he 's currently seeing and deciding on . If you 're considering other girls , I 'm running out of there . I want to feel that you liked me , and no one else , the moment you mention that you 're dating lots of girls and deciding which one to be with , I 'm not good with that .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian
