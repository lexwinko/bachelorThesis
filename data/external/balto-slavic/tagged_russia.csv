3dom,europe,"Here is how I see this situation , wall of text incoming : \\n\\nIt seems like Putin know what he is doing and act within his usual agenda ( to restore USSR ) - but apparently there is no hope to restore USSR already ( country is stagnating and state may start to fall apart during next financial crisis ) and Putin is simply trapped : most likely he accumulated billions ( unknown seller has sold US treasuries for $ 70B in February ) in illegally \ '' earned\ '' assets which were unexpectedly returned into the country due to risk of losing them to EU/US sanctions . He is extremely high value target right now - for his own environment in the first place . If situation will start to develop into wrong direction he will be dead and his billions will be shared . The only way for him to stay alive without losing money is to create dictatorship with military discipline while maintaining popularity among lower ranks of bureaucrats ( for protection from high-ranking bureaucrats ) . In the process he has to act \ '' brave\ '' - i.e . achieve all goals population expect from him - despite them being absolutely destructive for the country and the state itself . So as a result we see Mr. Putin is turning the country into bigger and much more dangerous version of North Korea ( North Korea at least has an ideology and can be controlled by China - unlike Russian Federation ) and sending troops into Ukraine openly ( loss of Ukraine may result in massive wave o separatism within RuFed and in Putin\\ 's funerals ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

3dom,europe,"Here are speculations of educated insider.\\n\\nIf EU and US will provide slightly higher pressure ( some more sanctions + help to Georgia , Ukraine , Moldova ) - there is good chance to see the fall of Soviet Reunion before World Cup 18 . It seems Kazakhstan is already moving into this direction after recent phrase of Putin how Kazakhstan was created on a territory which never had any state on it - and Belarus is openly exploit Customs Union to bypass Kremlin\\ 's self-inflicted sanctions and organize government-sponsored \ '' contraband\ '' of forbidden products from EU into Russian Federation.\\n\\nIt\\ 's serious but it won\\'t lead to new cold *war* - just a couple *cold battles* maybe - because population of RuFed is close to boiling point ( it\\ 's obvious Kremlin has nothing to offer to develop the country - only prayers for higher prices of oil and gas and invasions into nearby countries ) , government\\ 's bankruptcy and/or severe sanctions may spark explosion of separatism . Either RuFed will remove Putin and its government from control ( and army from Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia ) or there is serious possibility for the \ '' empire\ '' to go belly up in couple years . \\n\\nI bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries , in fact [ there are already ready-to-use customs post structures *inside* RuFed ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gacjJL4WVsU ) + regions of RuFed already act as separate states , they have less integration than countries in EU and that is why Kremlin was so hysterical about Ukraine and Georgia signing association agreement with EU - because it\\ 's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within RuFed . Another example : when a citizen move between regions of RuFed she/he need passport and *visa on arrival* ( a.k.a . \ '' registracia\ '' ) which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like \ '' localized/temporary citizenship\ '' ( if you don\\'t own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have *registracia* indefinitely without consent of other tenants ) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire \ '' localized citizenship\ '' or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - I heard about case where 40,000 ( ! ) people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in Sochi ( by FSB itself , mind you ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian
