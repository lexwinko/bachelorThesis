2ntle,travel,"I 'm going to try to make an list of places that have all the stuff you mentioned that you enjoy . However , you might run into crowds , since there are a lot of people that enjoy those things as well : D Zagreb - in contrast to ancient history shared by many coastal towns , Zagreb 's is more medieval . It 's similar to Prague and Budapest in that regard . It 's not so crowded in the summer . Has lots of museums . Has a nice vista overlooking the city . Trogir - a small town near Split , really pretty and historic . Not really must-see but it 's near Split so it 's convenient . Plus , by being so underrated it 's not so crowded . It 's connected to island of Čiovo where you can find some nice beaches to unwind . Split - has an ancient Roman palace , museums and galleries . Nice vista from Marjan hill overlooking the city . The beaches in the city are okay , but the main ones are likely to be crowded . The nice , more secluded ones are usually known only to the locals . Split is a port to the ferry that will take you to Hvar - both town of Hvar and Stari Grad on island of Hvar are worth visiting . They have their bit of history ( Stari Grad is the oldest town in Croatia , dating back to ancient Greece ) , nature and good beaches . Dubrovnik - beautiful town with lots of ancient as well as recent history . Has a great view from the hill outside the town ( you can get up there by a cable car ) . Downside is that is probably the busiest town on the coast , especially if you have the 'luck ' of visiting on the same day as three cruise ships . Still worth the visit , though .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"I believe that Split merits a visit , however , it does tend to get somewhat crowded since there are tourists that are there to see Split and others that are there to catch a ferry for the islands or a bus further down south .

That would be the bus that does n't take the motorway but state roads instead . If you take a route that looks something like Zagreb - Plitvice Lakes - Zadar - Šibenik - Split you should cover the scenery and the other cities part . The trip back , from Split up north is practically the same , so you can split the stuff you want to see between coming and going . There are a couple of other national parks on the way like Krka and Brijuni so if nature floats your boat give them a go ( even if it does n't , you 'll be here for 2 weeks , you have to pass the time somehow ) . Other than that , the usual touristy stuff you 'll find in the cities and maybe some hiking , kayaking , whitewater rafting , biking , etc .

2ntle,travel,"Your schedule is tight but not necessarily too tight . If you keep on track and stay organized you should n't have any problems . Try to make both Kotor and Mostar work if you can .

It 's a long ferry ride from Split and it 's a more of a relaxing , tranquil kind of place with nothing really to see . Bring the car with you to Hvar . That way you 'll be able to easily see both Hvar and Stari Grad and check out lavender fields more inland on your own . Unless you 're Scandinavian and used to swimming in frozen lakes you 'll find the water too cold . Maybe if the weather is really warm that week give it a go in Rovinj . The water currents are weaker up north making the sea a bit warmer . Although Plitvice are becoming hugely popular , I do n't think you really need to spend the night there . Yes , there 'll probably be lots of tourists but nowhere near as in mid July so you 'll have no problem going around and seeing everything . It 's a 3 hour trip from Split so if you get up a bit earlier you can get there early enough . While Rovinj is said by many to be the most beautiful town on the coast it 's also , as Vis , more of a unwind type of place so I suggest you use it as a base for trips to other Istrian towns and maybe a trip to the wine country inland .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,travel,"I was going to say that 5 nights in Hvar is a bit too much , but I saw your explanation and that 's good enough for me . However , I really do n't know what do you plan on doing in Makarska for 2 nights , if you 're using Hvar for your chilling back and relaxation needs . Makarska is basically a place that attracts two types of tourists : a ) families with children that just want to unplug for a week and do nothing , and b ) day trippers from the surrounding area , mostly BiH . As for seeing or doing anything there really is n't anything there . So your options there are literally a ) go to the beach and b ) go to a different beach .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,travel,"Hmm , the coastal part of the country between Split and Dubrovnik is filled with towns and villages similar to Makarska - lots of nice beaches and apartments and rooms for rent , but lacking in anything that would be considered an activity .

2ntle,travel,"You can take the state roads in one direction and the motorway in the other . That way you can enjoy the scenery the state road has to offer ( especially the Split-Dubrovnik part ) and save some money on tolls . It will take longer , however .

People that say otherwise usually fall into one of these categories a ) have only been to one of the two or b ) have n't been to either one . But I wo n't press you on this one , you can do your own research . Dubrovnik is more popular with tourists because it 's more , well , touristy . Everything is laid out for you and all you have to do is to follow your tour guide . As opposed to Split where I had a tourist ask me 'where 's that palace ' while being inside it . If you do decide to stay in Split for more than a few hours make sure that the place you 'll be sleeping at provides a parking space . As velynasha said , parking in Split can get a bit tricky , especially downtown , so if your accommodations are n't in the center leave your car there and walk and/or use public transportation to go sightseeing .

2ntle,travel,"Dubrovnik is easy , as in there 's only so much you can do there so you probably wo n't miss anything . I do n't know when you 're coming or what are your interests so I 'll try to keep it as general as possible . Things to do in Dubrovnik : Wander around the old town . Get lost in the small alleys . Push through the crowds ( Dubrovnik is 1 ) the most popular tourist destination in Croatia and 2 ) a stop on almost all Mediterranean cruises so it tends to get really busy ) . Take a walk around on top of the old city walls . Take a GoT tour ( Although I do n't know if they 're worth the money . You should employ some Google Fu to find some reviews . ) Take the cable car ( or drive ) up the hill overlooking the town for a fantastic view . Explore museums , galleries , restaurants . Make sure you 've exchanged enough Kunas for souvenirs . That pretty much covers Dubrovnik . Things to do in Split : The ancient Roman palace is a great place to get lost exploring , even if you 're local . People still live in it so it does n't have that 'museum-y ' feel to it . You can basically be looking at a 1700 year old ruin , turn around a corner and find yourself in someones back yard . So that 's neat . Check out museums and galleries if that 's what you 're into . Check out the palace basements where one part of the Split Got filming took place . I 'm not sure if there are any organized Got tours in Split , but even if there are I do n't think they 're worth the money , you can check out everything on your own . Take a stroll up the Marjan hill for a great view of Split . Check out some of the restaurants ( there are a lot of great reviews online ) . Grab a drink in the evening in one of the numerous bars in the palace and mingle with the locals and other tourists . Drive up to Klis Fort where the other part of the GoT filming took place plus enjoy a really breathtaking view of Split , the islands and surrounding area . Take a day trip to Hvar if you can squeeze it in . If you 're coming here in the summer : Check out Bačvice beach which becomes a party zone in the evening . It gets crowded during the day with beach-goers . There are other okay beaches in Split , but for really good ones you need to go outside the city . Luckily you 'll have a car . I would recommend somewhere south of Omiš ( probably an hour drive in summer traffic ) . There are good beaches in small villages in that area , just follow the southbound road . You can go kayaking in Split and whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Omiš . Probably other similar activities are available that I do n't know about , Google should know better . About the border checkpoint between Croatia and B & amp ; H on the Split - Dubrovnik route , there really is n't much to it . The Bosnians often are n't even there . Usually it 's just a quick passport check , you wo n't even need to get out of the car .

2ntle,travel,"Some Croatia advice . The weather is usually nice in May but either way a week is enough to check out big ( ger ) cities and wonder a bit off the beaten path . Note that my suggestions could differ a bit from any other you may get here . That 's because May is still kinda 'off-season ' in Croatia so I took that into consideration . Seeing that you 're coming in from Italy and continuing on to Hungary , my suggested itinerary would look something like : * Istria ( Pula , Rovinj ) - cultural sightseeing . One day for both but if you 're stretched you can scrape Rovinj . It 's a nice quaint town but I found it as a unwind and relax kind of place , plus it could be dead in May so skip it if you do n't have the time . Pula is worth a visit , if only for the ancient Roman amphitheater . * Plitvice Lakes National Park - kick ass NP , basically the most universal suggestion ( besides Dubrovnik ) that anyone will give you about visiting Croatia * Zadar - a day or two . You might even come here before visiting Plitvice and using it as a base of sorts . Kornati NP is also nearby so check out if you find it worth visiting . Also Krka NP is en route when you continue down south so if that nature stuff floats your boat give it a shot . * Split - two to three days . Seeing that it 's May Split will be the liveliest city on the coast . Use the time for sightseeing and getting shitfaced . Split is also a bus and ferry hub for that part of the country so it 's convenient for island hopping and taking day trips to nearby places ( e.g . Trogir for culture/sightseeing or Omiš for whitewater rafting/rock climbing/paragliding ) . Island ( and town ) of Hvar is also advised . It 's famous for it 's nightlife but it could be dead in May . However it warrants at least a day visit . * Dubrovnik - two days . The most popular town on the coast . King 's Landing from GoT , yadda yadda , anyways you 'll want to visit . If you can squeeze it in ( ha ) go for a day trip to Mostar ( Bosnia ) . * Zagreb - two days .

Krka is the most similar to Plitvice , while Kornati is an archipelago of small islands . For scenery and old towns stick to the coast . Since you 're on a itinerary the bigger ones like Zadar , Šibenik , Split and Dubrovnik should do you just fine . Maybe throw Trogir into the mix if you find the time .

This is one of those things that 's not easily translatable and which you mostly pick up through immersion . Croatian uses `` na '' ( which would translate to `` on ( top ) '' in English ) when talking about sea , rivers , lakes , etc in similar instances . So , you would say `` Putujem na more '' ( I 'm travelling to the sea ) . `` Putujem na moru '' is still awkward as `` putujem '' would n't be used in this case but `` plovim '' ( sailing ) would . So `` Plovim na moru '' would be I 'm sailing on the sea . Commonly used is also `` Plovim po moru '' which would be more like `` I 'm sailing across the sea '' but not literally across . I 'd say that `` Plovim na moru '' gives emphasis to the sea while `` plovim po moru '' gives emphasis to the sailing . Hope this helps ! Feel free to ask anything else !

2ntle,soccer,"[ First Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=da_sLKLV97M ) [ Second Half ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ZjufkPw2wTE ) 1414 days have passed since the last Hajduk 's win over Dinamo on their own pitch . The tradition was broken by a unlikely hero - the 18 year old midfielder Mario Pašalić scored twice to bring Hajduk just 1 point behind Dinamo and keep the battle for the top going . The Croatian Derby welcomed two very different teams . Dinamo , reigning and 8 times consecutive champion with a healthy budget and new foreign players brought to qualify for yet another CL . They were knocked out in the playoff by Austria Vienna which cost the coach Krunoslav Jurčić his job . The new/old coach became Branko Ivanković , hoping his third run with Dinamo would be the charm . Hajduk , on the other hand , is on the verge of bankruptcy . The city of Split , their main shareholder , ca n't financially support the club anymore and are actively looking for buyers to take over . Accordingly , Hajduk 's squad is filled with youngsters , most of them with hardly any first league experience . The coach is Igor Tudor , former Juventus and Croatia NT CB , whose only prior experience was coaching Hajduk 's U19 team , where he got to know most of the players he 's managing now . The match was a classic Hajduk - Dinamo clash , with aggression , pace and hard challenges . The more experienced and individually better Dinamo side dominated the first half , bringing the ball in the final third with ease but lacked any creativity in front of the goal . Hajduk 's defense was under constant pressure , trying to close down Dinamo 's pacey wingers El Soudani and Fernandes . The half time score was 0-0 , but Hajduk 's game did n't give their fans much hope for the second half . However , the Split side came out of the locker rooms more energetic and filled with vigor . Although inferior to Dinamo , they seemed to want the win more than their counterparts from Zagreb . Their attitude was awarded in the 49th minute when the 18 year old youngster Mario Pašalić craftily converted a corner swung in by debutant Haris Bukva . The goal did n't seem to wake up Dinamo and their pale approach was punished after another corner in 69th minute . Same assistant , same scorer . The remainder of the match offered nothing of note . Dinamo still looked like they do n't really want to be there while Hajduk neatly defended and waited out the clock . The win brought Hajduk to 1 point behind Dinamo and keeps the dreams of bringing home the title alive in Split , although the young and inexperienced side will face many challenges throughout the season . [ I shoud point out ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=3RluzYlZUBs ) the great atmosphere [ during the match ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h3C9bZPiUhY ) . The 25,000 strong crowd carried the youngsters during the whole 90 minutes and rewarding them for the hard-fought and well deserved win .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Another difference is that with soft tips you do n't have to worry about the angle of the dart in the board ( wondering will the one under the T20 cover the bed with the flight ) as soft tips stick perpendicular to the board .

2ntle,soccer,"I started supporting Inter Milan when I was about 9-10 . Around here everyone supports Hajduk without question , it 's just something you 're born with , so a lot of people have another , usually popular European club that they support alongside . Frankly , I do n't know why I initially chose Inter . Could be the jerseys , or something equally silly , ca n't remember . But all of my friends favored more successful clubs , like Real , ManU , Milan , etc . and would tease me about my mediocre Inter practically every time we discussed football .

2ntle,soccer,"Some of you US folk can correct me if i 'm wrong , but I always thought that the popularity of the high school/college sports in the US was due to the franchises ( NFL , MLS , NBA , etc. ) . People that do n't have any major sports team near by will support their local school teams 'cause they 're accessible and can more easily identify with them on a local/state/regional basis . When you add the factor that school teams are basically the only options for kids to train a given sport ( as far as I understand , there are no off-school football , soccer , etc . teams where a kid could just show up and sign up ) , these teams are practically mini academies for those kids where they pick up necessary skills to develop their talent . In the end , I do n't think that MLS will ever get the status among the fans in as the other leagues have around the world . People there do n't have a long tradition playing/watching soccer and more importantly , they have choices . Like a lot of them . So I think it will always be a 'niche ' sport , which does n't have to be that bad , 'cause a niche in such a big country can still be pretty huge . US soccer is rapidly moving forward , but it will be more noticeable via their NT and players in Europe than by MLS . Investing in youth academies and trying to popularize it among the kids that can pick any other ( more popular , lucrative ) sport should be priority # 1",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,CrusaderKings,"Thanks for the reply ! I 'll try to get into a bit more detail , 'cause I do n't think your ( albeit very helpful ) advice covered what I was aiming at . So here goes an example ( hypothetical , derived from many of the same outcomes ) : So , I have myself a nice little kingdom . All of my vassals ( of my and other cultures ) have positive loyalty ( as in rising , if it 's not at 100 it will be in a few months ) . Usually all from traits , friendship , prestige , the usual . When their heirs inherit them they are also very loyal . It says I have a ' ( very ) honorable reputation ' . Then it starts to get boring and I decide to expand a bit . And the Pope just called to arms . Excellent ! So I swoop in , let 's say , Burgos , liberate it and sue for peace demanding to be installed as a count 'cause that 's basically the only way to drive the heathens out . They accept and I keep it as a part of my demesne or give it to some of my kin ( the end result tends to be the same ) . I go for the next Muslim county , rinse and repeat . Then I see that my reputation is all of the sudden 'tarnished ' , but I do n't think of it that much because my vassals are still loyal . Then , let 's say , a new vassal ruler really does n't like me for my traits and he 's my rival . His loyalty has a negative trend . I 'm like 'Meh , if he revolts I 'll just send the army in , take the title back and give it to some one else ' . It happens exactly like that . Now I have a 'bad ' reputation . I conquer some more heathens . My reputation is now 'very bad ' . When I hover over the loyalty percentage over any vassal I see that the negative impact of my reputation is growing . Many more vassals are starting to revolt , and to emphasize since that 's the point of my question , practically only because of my bad reputation , and I have no idea how it got that bad ( I mean I know it 's from taking all those titles , but I have n't usurped them , I gained them through war/vassalization ) . So for example , a vassal is my son ( positive loyalty from family ties and succession order ) , is my friend ( another plus something % ) , likes my traits , scrutage , etc. , but ALL of that is n't enough to balance out the negative impact of my reputation ( it got to -10 % loyalty at one point ) . Same goes for my courtiers , my stewards have been know to get so disloyal that they robbed me blind and my martials fled from battle . That 's pretty much it . I do n't know am I going the wrong way obtaining these lands ( I thought that usurping them would be the shady thing to do , and I really do n't do I 'cause there has n't been a need for it yet ) , or is there something other messing with my reputation . I ca n't see what could it be , seeing how it does n't drop when I just stay put and do n't conquer heathens or when I let vassals go when they rebel . Appreciate the help ! P.S . Ca n't tell if my English is leaving something suspended in translation , I 'll try to explain it better if it 's the case",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Parts of the body mostly targeted in football are basically the most vulnerable ones : lower legs , ankles and feet . And while they 're not so graphic , they are serious and very painful - ruptured muscles , sprains and torn ligaments . Plus , you have to take into consideration that rugby players are much more physically fit to compensate for the 'contact-ness ' of the sport , but you ca n't buff out your feet and ankles .

Although I do n't have specific info you 're looking for , like the Plitvice camp one , I can give you some general transportation info : * If you do n't have/qualify for some kind of discount , avoid using the train . It 's slow , uncomfortable ( except for the overnight one ) and overall not very cost-effective . Seeing how you ca n't get to Dubrovnik with it ( the southernmost stop is Split ) , the bus is your best bet . It 'll cost you roughly the same as the train , it will be more comfortable and faster and you 'll have a great view from Split to Dubrovnik ( make sure you sit on the right side going to Dubrovnik or left coming back ) * As far as accommodation goes , the cheapest way is sleeping in hostels . For the best deal look into reserving them early . Google it up for best deals you can find . If you 're going to stick to your itinerary , you should reserve 3 nights in Split ( as it 's a hub for Dubrovnik and Hvar ) and 2 nights in Šibenik ( it 's closer to Plitvice lakes ) * Since you have n't told us where you 're arriving from , I 'll take a shot in the dark assuming you 'll be coming in from the north ( Zagreb ) , so correct me if I 'm wrong and I 'll update you : Bus from Zagreb to Šibenik is around 150 HRK ( ~20€ ) ; from Šibenik to Split 60 HRK ( ~8€ ) ; from Split to Dubrovnik 100 HRK ( ~13€ ) .

2ntle,soccer,"sorry , no links , but as someone who 's been involved in football for all of my life , here goes : there 's no termination fee in a standard contract . so , in your exapmle , the club could keep him til the end of the contract . but that 's , as I said , in a standard contract . the better/more famous player is , he and his agent can negotiate better terms . some players have 'transfer clauses ' , for example , if the clause is 5 mil € then the club has to let the player negotiate a transfer with any club that offers a minimum 5 mil € ( Hulk had such clause at Porto for 100 mil € , but that was just a 'hands off ' signal for other clubs , they let him go to Chelsea for far less then that ) . some players have relegation clauses , saying that they 're free to leave the club if they 're relegated to a lower division ( this one is much more widespread ) . basically , it 's up to the player and his agent to negotiate as good of a deal as they can . in your expamle , the club can hold the player to the end of the contract , but clubs rarely keep disgruntled players on the squad and pay their salary just to have them mope around , so they usually agree to put them on a transfer list . however , if the club is n't respecting the terms of the contract ( usually regarding salary ) then the player can sue the club to the FA or FIFA and will usually get such contract terminated ( meaning he becomes a free player ) and the club still has to pay him what they owe . you wo n't find many links about this stuff as it 's a matter of a private contract and they do n't really let them go public . hope this helps a bit",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,soccer,"I guess you 're from US so I 'll let your compatriots give you more detailed advice . As far as coaching goes , here in Europe national football associations have coaching academies ( and you need to have a degree to coach a higher division club ) so if the USSF has it 's own academy ( or wherever you 're from ) you should really look into it . As far as experience goes , your best bet is to go to your local clubs and asking youth coaches to let you assist ( you 'll be doing this for free and just to gain some experience , noone is going to pay you at this point ) . From there on it 's only up to how much do you want it . Your lack of a professional playing career is certainly a drawback , but you can definitely overcome it with hard work . But you have to understand that , given your lack of experience and formal soccer education , it will be years before you 're given a youth team to manage ( unless you 're exceptionally talented and catch a huge lucky break ) or even put on a payroll ( so having a side job is a must ) . I hope I have n't wavered off coaching , if that 's something you 're really into and want to do , definitely go for it . Best of luck !",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,croatia,"well , the most common one here in Dalmatia is pretty simple : just cut up some prosciutto and cheese ( you can check online which of the cheeses avaliable to you suits prosciutto the best ) , maybe some tuna pate and olives . it 'll take you no time to prepare and yet will be pretty much authentic ( having croatian ingridients will be a huge plus , of course : ) ) however , these customs vary depending on the region so maybe someone here from a diferent part of croatia can give you a different suggestion . hope you have fun at the dinner party and especially when you come here",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
2ntle,croatia,"fair enough . as far as this case goes , in a nutshell , the prosecution ( and the police ) fucked up big time . they first charged the guy with misdemeanor ( no `` major '' injuries ) , then thoght they can get a criminal offense conviction just by seeing that medical report says `` dislocated '' nasal bone ( qualifies as a major injury ) and dropped the misdemeanor charge . but at the criminal trial the medical expert said it was only a `` slight '' dislocation of the nasal bone so it 's not a major injury after all . they could n't charge him for a misdemeanor againg 'cause of double jeopardy . that 's the main plot . the subplot is that the guy is a `` well respected businessman '' ( WRB ) , with obvious connections and political protection ( forget about all that independence of the judicial system thingy ) . there has been quite a few similar cases where a WRB , a politican or someone in their family would be responsible for an accident , even with fatal casualties , and got away scot-free or with a slap on the wrist . same goes for a range of other crimes **tl ; dr if you know ( or are ) the right people in croatia , you do n't need to be concerned with such technicality as the law**",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,Darts,"I 'll try to give you some answers , other redditors will surely chip in to fill the gaps I leave : 1 . My favorite practicing game is Split score . It 's somewhat easier to play on soft tip boards since they automatically count score , but it 's not any more difficult to count as any other game on a steel tip board . Here 's how it goes : Each player starts with 40 points . Each round you shoot a different number , in order : 13 , 14 , 15 , any double , 15 , 16 , 17 , any triple , 18 , 19 , 20 , bull ( 25 and 50 both count ) . Only darts in the designated number count , e.g . in second round if you hit two darts in 14 and one in 11 you only get 28 points . The twist is if you miss all three darts your overall score is halved ( you round up for odd numbers ) . The game is fun and can be pretty even matched even if the players are n't on a similar playing level since halving your score makes it easier for a weaker player to catch up to you . Also , you practice cricket numbers ( which is good since you 're playing in a cricket league ) plus doubles and triples . Other popular games are Around the world , Shanghai , etc . which other redditors can give you more info on . 2 . General consensus is that you should stick with whatever works for you . That , however , does n't mean there are n't any steps to improve your game . Check out /r/flightschool ( althought it 's a bit dead ) or google Flight School and join up . Its creator George Silberzahn provides some great tips and practicing routines . Other , more general advice is the usual - keep your body steady and move only your arm , follow through , focus on your target , etc . 3 . Yeah , substantial pointing in cricket is considered poor sportsmanship . Now , what 's the threshold ? Well , that 's kinda subjective and different people may give you different opinions on it . My rule of thumb is that if my opponent ca n't catch up to me with 3 darts , any additional scoring is unnecessary . In friendly bar games where nothing is on the line , I usually score just enough to have more points than my opponent ; sometimes not even that .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,travel,"Maybe I 'm a bit biased ( being a native and all ) but Croatia could hit all of the points on your backpacking checklist . It 's definitely cheaper than all the other countries you 're considering . There a direct cheap flights from London to several touristy locations here . There are plenty of hostels and backpackers , do a bit of google-fu about 'Croatia backpacking ' to find other people 's experiences and advice . We have a lot of Aussie backpackers here so you 'll have no problem meeting new people ( Aussies being outgoing and English speaking as they are ) , esp . in hostels . We have great seafood here but a variety of other kind as well . Not what you would exactly call 'ethnic ' , but seeing how Croatia was under the influence ( lol ) of various nations through the ages , that has reflected in the cuisine as well . So you 'll find a mix of Italian , Slavic , and Turkish , with more German and Hungarian if you wander to the northern parts of the country . The same applies to the other aspects of the culture and architecture . Croatia had a turbulent history since well before it even became a country so there are plenty of sights to see , museums to visit etc . Nightlife is great in the more touristy cities while outdoorsy and off-the-beaten-path stuff is found a bit off the major tourist hot spots ( as one would expect ) . As far as safety goes , Croatia is basically as safe as it gets in Europe . With minuscule violent crime rates the only thing one should keep an eye out for ( esp . during the tourist season ) is an occasional pickpocket . For example , two girls going back to a hostel in the wee hours really do n't have anything to worry about .

Remember , it 's off-season so you can forget about the famous Hvar nightlife ( which really is bitchin ' in the summer ) . * I would chop one day from Dubrovnik in favor of Split so it 's two days each . Three days in Dubrovnik may be a bit much . I 've managed to catch all the sites and museums in a day during the high season so two days should be fine while taking it easy and maybe taking that day trip to Montenegro . Split , being the bigger city and all , can give you more options . Not just considering nightlife . You can always hop to Trogir , a beautiful quaint town near Split , or visit ancient ruins of Salona or go whitewater rafting or rock climbing in Omiš . * Be careful around Easter . As my fellow redditors at /r/croatia already told you , the ferries are sparser but still run . Some museums might be closed .

2ntle,Darts,"As I see it , the main allure of tungsten darts is that they 're heavier so you can have a smaller ( thinner ) dart which helps with grouping while keeping the weight the same . They 're also much tougher ( my last set came with a lifetime guarantee ) . Sometimes it 's tough to get used to to thinner darts , as thicker brass and bronze ones provide a better grip ( at least for me ) . So , if you 're happy with your bronze set and do n't feel any significant advantage in tungsten ( give 'em a try ) then stick with bronze at least for now .

2ntle,explainlikeimfive,"It 's going to be difficult to ELI5 such a complex question , especially without starting flame wars in comments like they always happen when such subject is brought up , but I 'll give it a shot . I 'm going to skip a lot of history here , because I think that 'ancient hatred ' argument is silly and not valid . Croats and Serbs were neighbors for a long time , and despite being in different empires/kingdoms their culture and language was very similar . The main thing that divided them was religion . Due to historical circumstances Croats are Roman Catholic and Serbs are Orthodox . When national movements started sweeping Europe in 19th century , religion was a major part of national identity . That , among other things , was basis in differentiating yourself from other nations . Seeing how Croats and Serbs were similar , religion played a major part in building their respective national identities . By the end of WWI , it was becoming obvious that Austro-Hungarian Empire was going to collapse . Croats , being under foreign rule since 1102 wanted to score a better deal . Realizing that they 're too small to be on their own ( since the bigger surrounding nations could chop them up ) decided to enter a union with Serbs and Slovenes , thinking that they 'll finally be equals between their similar ( 'brotherly ' ) Slavic neighbors . However , that Union soon turned into a monarchy with a Serbian king . Power struggles began and Croats found themselves once again oppressed by a bigger nation . This is the real beginning of the 'conflict ' between Croats and Serbs that will define their history later on . WWII came , Nazis rolled in , broke up the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and installed 'independent ' ( puppet ) states Croatia and Serbia . In Croatia , the power went to the Ustaše , a radical fascist party similar to Nazis . They set up labor and concentration camps and prosecuted and killed thousands of Serbs , Jews , Gypsies and uncooperative Croats . The hatred between the nations grew . In the meantime , opposing forces were Chetiniks , ruthless Serbian militia loyal to the King trying to create Greater Serbia ( often slaughtering civilians which , of course , created even a bigger wedge between the nations ) and coumminst Partisans , composed of all nationalities from the area . The anti-fascist Partisans eventually won and a communist federation Yugoslavia was formed . Charismatic leader Tito did his best to keep nationalistic tensions in check . And they were for 40 or so years . Now , to explain why Croatia decided to break from Yugoslavia in early 90s would take too long , but lets just say it was a mix of economical , political and nationalistic reasons . Serbia tried to forcefully keep them from leaving because , to put it simply , they were the dominating force in Yugoslavia at the time and Croatia was one of the most economically advanced states . When Croatia declared independence , a lot of Serbs living in Croatia were afraid that the genocide from WWII was going to repeat and rebelled . So Croatia found itself fighting Serbian insurgents and the official Yugoslav Army . Cue some more nationalistic tensions . There were war crimes on all sides which , again , just fueled the hatred further . Nowadays , you 'll find people in both countries with various opinions . Some keep deep hatred . Some just resentment . Others do n't really care .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

2ntle,AdviceAnimals,"East European here . Here 's my reasoning about racism in EE : People here were n't exposed to different cultures and races as much as Western Europe and the Americas were . WE had colonialism and the Americas had slavery , and they had time to progress from racism to tolerance and acceptance . EE started to 'get in touch ' with different races basically since the fall of the iron curtain . 23 years ago . So this part of the world is on a tolerance crash course of sorts . It will take time . Look how long it took for the US and WE and there 's still room for improvement there . Also , it does n't help that EE is extremely racially homogeneous and thus has exposure to other races mostly via tourism . It 's easier to overcome racism if you have people of other races living in your community , sharing the same problems , living similar lives right in front of you . Majority of people in EE live in non-touristy areas and probably wo n't see someone of a different race in person their whole lives . That 's not helpful . What 's helpful is technologically infused globalization that exposes younger generations to different cultures . Things are getting better . It wo n't happen overnight .

2ntle,croatia,"I have n't been down under myself but a couple of my best friends have and I can give you their opinions . They say that the mindset of Croatian immigrants in Australia ( and NZ , where they also traveled ) is stuck in the time frame of when they first emigrated . They do n't see Croatia and everything about it as it is today ( which is admittedly difficult if you do n't live here ) but as it was when they left . So , for instance , people that emigrated during the Yugoslavia were either yugo-nostalgic or , if they were more on the nationalistic side , were still ranting on about Yugoslavian secret service , Croatian struggle and so on . The people that emigrated because of the war in the 90s were almost all pretty far right nationalists , identifying with the Ustasha regime , blindly hating Serbs , etc . It 's like they did n't have any closure and the war is still going on in their minds ( there a lot of people like that here , mind you ) . On the other hand they said that the Australian Croats they met were all friendly ( at least towards them ) . Most of them were hard working and almost all were business owners , so I guess entrepreneurship is something that they have in common . They talked about how they teach their children to love and respect their Croatian heritage . They met a couple of 3rd generation guys that were crazy about Hajduk , getting up in the middle of night to watch matches and stuff like that , without ever going to the homeland . I just threw words at the keyboard as I remembered , I hope everything is relatively understandable .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

Also , he gave his best to keep ethnic tensions in check . This came as a blessing to Bosnian muslims , as they were n't recognized as a nation before , and were hogged by both Croats and Serbs , calling them either Muslim Croats or Muslim Serbs . Tito brought stability to a historically very volatile region and a sense of national identity to Bosnia . On the other hand , Croats are not his biggest fans . They hold him responsible for ( post ) WWII war crimes against Croats , persecution of nationalistic-minded Croats during Yugoslavia and Serbo-centralistic policies .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

305-1468,mechanicalpencils,"I have one in 0,7 . With it 's minimal styling it 's a very good looking pencil . One piece metal body , besides looking cool makes this pencil very robust . In fact it 's proven to be indestructible if you retract the lead sleeve . Even the cap is carved from one piece of steel ( as opposed to sheet metal forming ) , and engraved . Color is beautiful ( mine is blue ) and very durable . Makes a nice loud click . Grip on this paint is actually quite good despite not having knurled surface or whatever . I also removed the otherwise nice looking and sturdy clip , it looks better like that in my opinion . Hexagonal shape means it wo n't roll around . Disadvantages are top heaviness , and the impossibility of disassembly . Also the fact that the cone is a bit longer then on other pencils , so I sometimes find myself holding the pencil by the cone instead of the body , which is difficult and makes the pencil slip , but I tend to hold pens close to the tip so YMMW . For work or lot of writing I prefer a drafting pencil , but this one is the best for lying around on the desk when you need to write a note or whatever , and you 're not afraid if you accidentally sweep it across the room . EDIT : ( after reading comments ) The front does not move back and forth on mine . I probably have an older model since the sleeve is retractable . It does rattle a bit .

305-1468,BuyItForLife,"It really depends on what you want to measure . If you are measuring plastic parts , you need accuracy of ±0,01 to ±0,05 mm , and you can buy a caliper like [ this ] ( http : //www.insize.com/products/tools/pdf/caliper/1205.pdf ) . It 's rated ±0,03 mm ( about 1/3 width of a leaf of paper ) , but mine is actually accurate within ±0.01 mm . I use that at work and it performs great . It cost about 15 € . Used on plastic it shows the exact same value as a digital 10x more expensive Mitutoyo . It 's made of milled , engraved , thick stainless steel . It will also last longer than the Mitutoyo since it has no display or batteries . OTOH , if you have to measure high precision metal parts made with tight tolerances , you need a more precise caliper *and a micrometer* ( because calipers are not really that precise , after all , you must press on stuff using your shaky , variable hand ) , and many have recommended a lot of good calipers for that . TL ; DR : you can get a BIFL caliper for 15 € , the one for 150 € will of course be BIFL , but will also have ( slightly ) better precision .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
305-1468,BuyItForLife,"Micrometer is an order of magnitude more precise , but slow to work with . And they are usually made with much smaller range . If you would use it often , I would definitely recommend a Mitutoyo micrometer instead of a cheap one . Unlike the calipers , there is a big noticeable difference in quality with these .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian
