3Fyr,skyrim,"[ Video1 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=btOb2XqnNTw ) We ’ re starting the new year with a all-new Skyrim modding interview . This time around we ’ re talking to Will Willson , part of the Dark Creations team . A post-grad student in the UK , Will is an integral part of DC ’ s ambitious project known as “ Beyond Skyrim ” . What ’ s the mod all about ? Find out below… **Can you give a general overview of Beyond Skyrim and where the mod project currently stands ? ** Beyond Skyrim is a series of interlinking mods which will ultimately allow players to visit other areas of Tamriel within the Skyrim engine . Assets for each new region are being painstakingly created from scratch , including architecture , creatures , weapons , landscapes , textures and objects created by our artists and modelers . We pride ourselves on our fidelity to Elder Scrolls lore , and our ultimate aim is to create a player experience which will fit together seamlessly with Skyrim itself , allowing players to continue their existing character ’ s adventures in other lands , or perhaps even sidestep Skyrim ’ s story entirely and experience what the rest of Tamriel has to offer . [ Image1 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uVzSmEa.jpg ) We have made three years of progress towards this goal , though of course there remain many challenges ahead . When we started back in 2011 , we had little more than ideas and determination . While similar mods had been conceptualized and even released for previous Elder Scrolls games , we ’ re in uncharted territory for Skyrim . As we move into 2015 , we have built up a well-developed and cohesive community dedicated to our goals , in which our veteran members can actively train newcomers and continue to grow the project . Both our technical and artistic foundations are now firm and we are working hard to implement the quests , characters and stories that will bring this expanding world to life . **The project seems pretty ambitious… how much time is being put into the project ? ** It ’ s difficult to give a precise estimate , since our community depends entirely on volunteers working in their free time , which is of course a variable commodity . As a result of this a degree of membership “ cycling ” is necessary , as different individuals become able to contribute more or less , depending on their other commitments . At the last count , Beyond Skyrim had more than 50 active members , although the amount of hours each of those can contribute will continuously change based on their personal circumstances . Some members can work only a few hours a week , while others put in almost as much time as a job . At a minimum , thousands of hours have collectively been put into the project so far . We ’ ve become increasingly adept at managing and coordinating a highly flexible membership base . It ’ s necessary to break down some tasks like landscaping regions into smaller units , which can be worked on by individuals as they become available . We ’ ve found that taking many very small steps produces the most consistent rate of progress overall . **On your FAQ , you mention the project includes several modding teams – care to give any shoutouts ? ** The two largest groups within Beyond Skyrim are currently the teams working on Cyrodiil and High Rock . They are the oldest and most developed of the projects , and the closest to producing release-quality content . Cyrodiil in particular has gained a reputation for attracting high-caliber 3D artists eager to create their own interpretations of classic locations from Oblivion , some of which will be centre stage in what is likely to be the first Beyond Skyrim release : the region containing the Cyrodiilic city of Bruma . [ Image2 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Hrfeq1v.png ) Although much remains to be done on the asset front for High Rock , it has made great strides in landscaping , and is within sight of completing our first pass for the entire landmass of the Province . I think that it ’ s safe to say that many of the hardest challenges for both these projects have now been passed ( which of course isn ’ t to say there aren ’ t more still ahead ) . We also have teams working on Hammerfell , Morrowind and various other smaller projects , although they are currently at a less advanced stage of development . But progress has accelerated recently and we can expect to hear much more from them in the coming months . [ Image3 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/6CrDLFP.jpg ) As for individual members , there are too many , contributing in too many ways , to mention them all . But there are a few I would like to single out , not simply for their own work , but for their dedication to raising the bar of quality of Beyond Skyrim as a whole . In the field of 3D art , I should draw attention to Markus Liberty , who has constantly set new standards for himself in making architectural models , and inspired others to produce assets to match this quality . [ Image4 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/cYaHaek.jpg ) Among landscapers , we are greatly indebted to Wellpapp , not only for his phenomenal output but also for his generosity in sharing his hard-won expertise with multiple projects . [ Image5 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ZNRW8u8.jpg ) And on the soundtrack front , mention must be made of Xae and Guin , our two Lead Composers , who have forever raised our expectations for the original soundtracks that will accompany our project .

3Fyr,skyrim,"**With The Elder Scrolls Online having a more sweeping look at all of Tamriel , have you been taking any inspiration from the game for the modding project ? ** ESO has of course been a big inspiration to our project , since it filled in a lot of gaps which had previously existed in the lore . However , much of this has taken the form of backstory and helping inform the history of the regions we are making . After all , there is a gap of more than a millennium between the events of ESO and Skyrim , and cultures rarely stay static for long . There ’ s also the fact that ESO uses a different map scale to Skyrim , so we ’ ve had to be selective about what we can include . Many of our locations will take a look at the after-effects of the stories within ESO rather than directly reproducing them as they appeared in ESO . [ Image6 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/2lvKSQ9.jpg ) We ’ ve been having a lot of fun imagining ways in which the stories and characters of ESO have faded into legend with the passage of time . How biased local historians have converted the complex 2nd Era politics into fables about good and evil . Or how quests performed in ESO have cast long shadows over the intervening years that the player never intended . Skyrim players won ’ t need to have played ESO ( or Oblivion or Daggerfall for that matter ) to understand the events of Beyond Skyrim , but there will be plenty of nods and references which veterans of those games will recognize . **What other modding projects have you worked on ? ** I first caught the Elder Scrolls modding bug when contributing as a writer to Tamriel Rebuilt in 2008 . After that , I became involved in the still-ongoing Black Marsh project for Elder Scrolls 4 , where I soon found that my main talents lay more in administration . Since the Dark Creations website was founded in 2011 I ’ ve been involved in the running of the site and helping a great variety of Skyrim modding projects organize their hosting and forums . **What ’ s been your biggest challenge to date with the project ? ** Beyond Skyrim ’ s biggest challenge was , hands down , the creation of our Tamriel topographical map . This has formed the basis for the height maps on which all of our projects are built . Nothing else would have been possible without it , and it ’ s the hardest thing we ’ ve ever had to do . Although there were plenty of sources to draw on , even before the release of ESO , such as the in-game maps from Elder Scrolls II-IV — these were produced to fit wildly different scales and graphics . And of course , we wanted the end product to look as realistic as possible , which meant all the LOD at the borders joining up seamlessly . [ Image7 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/SmMHSZX.jpg ) Integrating all that information from different sources , and trying to deduce what all the rest of Tamriel would “ really ” look like at Skyrim ’ s scale , was both a technical and artistic mountain to climb . It meant figuring out ways to circumvent the hardcoded limits to the distances the game engine could render , and spending hours poring over the most obscure of Elder Scrolls lore references for clues about the landscape . On both of these fronts , we ’ re deeply indebted to a man known to us only by his username of Morcroft Darkes , who was responsible for many of the technical breakthroughs ( as well as the hard slog ) that made the final map possible . **Anything else you ’ d like to share ? New screenshots , trailers , etc ? ** Our most recent trailer ( shown at the top ) was created as a celebration of our third anniversary since the founding of Beyond Skyrim . It shows a selection of our landscapes and locations from across Tamriel , from the moors and citadels of High Rock , to the swamps of the Nibenay Valley in Cyrodiil , as well as glimpses of more exotic locations such as the Alik ’ r Desert in Hammerfell and the far eastern island nation of Roscrea . It also features footage of some of the new creatures that were custom made for Beyond Skyrim in action . A second trailer which we have also released recently , takes a more in-depth look at Country Bruma , the northernmost region of Cyrodiil , which is our current priority candidate for the first Beyond Skyrim release : [ Video2 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=c2XsmMeCS9g ) And last but not least , here are a selection of screenshots from our cutting edge work on new regions : [ Album ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/oVHhH # 0 ) **Thanks for the interview ! **",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

Using `element = array [ index ] ` you create pointer to the element , meanwhile `array [ index ] ` access array each time .
