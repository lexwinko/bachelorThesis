AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# The Carnivorous Hare ’ s-tail Cottongrass * *What is plant 's name , etymology , season for bloom ? * Ok , so… on the first glance you would call this cottongrass…but I have named it Eirophorum Dangerousus because when no one else is around these specific blades of cottongrass in front of my door get wildly unpredictable and grow sharp venomous teeth . I have not been able to show this trait to anyone yet because they seem to only do it when I ’ m on my own but I think this is my chance to show the world that this exists and needs to be taken seriously . In all respects except this one , the Eirophorum Dangerousus is equal to the hare ’ s-tail cottongrass ( Eriphorum vaginatum ) . They are native to bogs and other wetlands and grow to be about 30-60cm . The hare ’ s-tail cottongrass is a tussock-forming plant and the fruit is an achene . * *Where does it grow ? What does it look like ? Feel free to include an image ! * As far as I can tell , these plants only grow right outside my house but my hypothesis is that they exist in all appropriate climates but usually kill anyone that comes near them . * *What history does the plant have ? Who discovered it ? * This plant has probably been around for millennia because it will eat or poison anything that comes to close to it . Everyone that discovered it before me probably died from the poison . I noticed something was wrong because I kept finding corpses of rabbits and birds next to the plants but I originally thought there must be a den of some carnivorous animal close by . I was never a big fan of plants ( sorry Madam Pomfrey ) so I didn ’ t usually come too close to this particular bunch of cottongrass until one day when I was retrieving the newspaper and one of the bunch lashed out at me . Luckily , I was wearing full-body armor after a whole night of working in my laboratory . At first , I thought this was just a side effect of the chemicals I was experimenting with , but later inspections of the armor revealed significant traces of poison and I have since retrieved several samples to confirm my findings . * *What are its uses ? How were these discovered ? How does this plant help Madam Pomfrey care for her patients ? * This plant needs to be handled with extreme caution ! A steel armor needs to be worn at all times when handling this plant . However , there are uses to the plant that will be helpful in treating patients . When extracted and applied to a patient , this poison will eliminate any other poison and overpower it . With an equation I developed , the exact amount of poison can be calculated so that it overpowers most known poisons but only leaves the person with symptoms similar to the common flu for a week , which can obviously be very convenient .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species ? Hagrid used all his favorite , completely harmless animal friends , now presented in one compact species : the acromantula , the norwegian ridgeback and the three-headed dog . **Yes , you 're reading this right folks , all your favorite cuddlies at once ! ** * What is its name ? What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem . These magical researchers report back to Hagrid on a daily basis and send him monthly paintings to keep him up to date on what these cuddlies are up to . This author would not recommend keeping norwegian acrowoofs as pets unless your dwellings are inflammable but whatever floats your boat .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AccioIce25454,relationships,"I do n't really know what this falls under . Background : I 'm 19 , living with my mom , stepdad and their son in a European country where it 's customary to live with your family until you get a job . My parents got divorced when I was 2 , but I saw my dad at least once a week and I was always much closer to him than I was to my mom . I never got along with my stepdad , especially since him and my mom got a child , because he uses everything I do as a reason to mock me ( for example , if I decide not to eat dinner with them I 'm ''on a diet again '' if I do I 'm ''finally deciding to get out of my room '' if I 'm taking too long to pick what I want to eat I 'm ''picky '' if I get a good grade in school I ''have no life '' ) . He also says those things to my brother when he thinks I 'm not listening . My dad died three years ago and because I was underage , I was justified to what is basically his pension money , 800€ a month until I finish college ( so that 's about 7 years of getting it which is 67,200€ ) . This money was only mine . Because I was only 16 and very upset and did n't even want to think about anything relating to his death , I asked my mom to take care of it . We decided the money would be going to her account and be put away every month , possibly to eventually buy an apartment for when I decided to move out . After a couple of months of her getting the money , I checked in with her and she said she had n't been able to put it aside because of something urgent . After another few months , the same thing . So we decided we would buy an apartment and rent it out ( I mostly decided on it because I saw she was n't going to save the money ) . I did n't do anything then because an apartment would be more money than I was going to get in the long-term and I was grateful she decided to buy it for me . Nothing happened with the purchase of the apartment even though I repeatedly asked about it and whenever I pushed too hard , she would call me ungrateful and unloving for even thinking about doubting that she 'll do it . Meanwhile , she has used this money to remodel the kitchen and bathroom while she keeps telling me we do n't have enough money to put any of mine on the side . Fast forward to this year when I started college . Because I have to eat out due to my schedule and receive no money beside what she decides to give me , her and I decided together that 200€ a month would be enough for me to buy myself food , pay for my bus rides and be able to save a bit on the side . A month after we made that deal , I went to the ATM to withdraw my lunch money and found out it was n't there . When I confronted her about it , she said she did n't have the time to do it yet ( the whole month ) . She promised she 'd take care of it that week and also give me what she owed me from the month before . She went last Friday , decided to give me 160€ a month instead of 200€ without even checking with me , saying that if I need anything more I can just tell her every time I want to buy something , and she also did n't give me any money for last month . I have begged her to let me move out and she wo n't . She says it 's proof that I hate my family and want to destroy it like the ungrateful daughter I am . She also said that she will divorce her husband before letting me move out ( and I think she will do it ) and when I brought up the fact that she ca n't use up more than 300€ a month for me she agreed but said that after 19 years of taking care of me , she deserves to get something for her effort . I could make the money go into my account without her permission , but it would naturally make her scream at me and cry because of how much I hate her . If I moved out without her permission , I am certain that she would follow me around , wait for me at college etc and do everything she could to make me come back . There 's also the issue of her parents which already think she 's a bad mother and as she says ( and I agree with her to some extent ) would make her life miserable if I moved out . The only solution I see right now is to move to America with my long-term boyfriend . That way my family would n't be able to force me to move back with them and I would n't have to listen to them anymore . His parents that know about this situation have also offered me to stay with them until I can figure things out . Basically the only thing that 's stopping me is that I 'm currently in med school and ca n't transfer because here medicine is a study like every other , not a post-graduate study , and I do n't have a degree in anything else . As such , I would have to find a way to transfer to something else or quit school and also stop receiving my father 's pension money , which would make moving a lot more challenging . I 've also told my mom already that since I am planning on moving to America eventually , I wo n't be needing that apartment , but she 's still intent on buying it with my money . I 'm sure there 's something vital to the story I 've forgotten since this has been going on for years and years . Thank you for listening . **tl ; dr** : My dad died and my mom 's taking all the money I should be getting while also not letting me move out . I want to run away from all of my family 's bulshit and move in with my boyfriend who lives across the world .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

A lot more goes into making your biological sex than most people think ( hormones , outside sexual organs , inside sexual organs ) and sometimes those do n't all match up , though doctors at birth will usually mark you as whatever your outside organ is , or sometimes not even that - maybe you were born with both .

Our team of travel experts will then sit down with you and discuss your wishes then arrange the perfect experience – without telling you about it ! On the day of your trip , you just have to show up and hold onto the pre-prepared portkey ! Per request , one of our employees will travel to the location with you to make sure you settle in nicely ( not available for the survivalist package ) . Your accommodation will be included in the package , as will all food and drinks unless you specify otherwise . We offer a variety of customizable packages , help us choose the best fit for you ! * The standard package : Includes a week/two-week vacation for one to two people at one location put together by a team of travel experts . * The family package : Includes a family-friendly adventure that takes into account non-magic-performing travelers . * The adventure hop : Our most popular choice is a multi-destination experience that lasts between two weeks and a full month . You will be sent off to your primary destination and regularly supplied with new portkeys that will take you to another destination . The frequency of environment swaps is your choice and will determine the price of this package . * The survivalist : Our challenge is to challenge you ! This one-week experience will test your skills of survival and is only intended for the bravest of wizards and witches . Your environment will be changed multiple times by portkeys in disguise . Obviously , you could disapparate at any time but this is intended as a challenge to yourself . You will be observed to insure nothing goes wrong . Wizards and witches that make it through the week will be rewarded . *A testimony by Gilderoy Lockhart : Being the fearless adventurer I am , I of course went with the survivalist option . I requested an emphasis of monsters to see what their ‘ ’ adventure ’ ’ were really made of and test myself against them . I was faced in rapid succession with a colony of acromantulas , a horde of manticores and a hive of tarantula hawk wasps . Being as skilled as I am , I readily dispatched them . Then they threw a basilisk at me . I averted my eyes and quickly retrieved a mirror from my pocket ( I always carry a mirror ) , instantly turning the basilisk to stone with its own gaze , and returned home for my reward .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # By Thy Sparkling Brew The Triwizard contestants are always very talented witches and wizards , able to cast a variety of powerful spells , but do they have the versatility a true champion needs ? Many witches and wizards neglect one of the most useful and potent facets of magic : **Potionmaking . ** We propose to challenge the contestants with a series of four rooms , each with its own unique mini challenges designed to test more than raw power . The contestants will be allowed a 12 hour period in a private chamber stocked with potion-making ingredients and equipment to prepare ( as well as supplied with a potion bandoleer with which to carry vials ) and will be relieved of their wands immediately following their potion-making . In the process of completing the previous challenge , contestants will find themselves in possession of a piece of parchment , blank but for a picture of a potion . Upon holding this piece of parchment above a cauldron with a brewing potion , [ four additional images ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fjff1bo.jpg ) will be revealed on the parchment , each image providing a hint for one of the four rooms . The judges will be instructed to score the contestants based not on their speed of completion , but more the finesse and subtlety used in passing each obstacle . Therefore , a less straightforward path will be worth more than a more obvious one ; phasing through a wall would garner more points than knocking it over . Points will be reduced for injuries received from the various obstacles . Bonus points will be awarded for skill , imagination , and care in handling the challenges faced . & amp ; nbsp ; *The four rooms are as follows : * The **first room** consists of two chambers completely devoid of light . The antechamber is separated from the rest of the room by light-proof curtains , and has the following riddle carved on the ceiling : & amp ; nbsp ; *Go boldly forth unto the night* *Fearing not your fate ahead* *Step quickly , bravely , without fright* *If you wish to end up dead ! * *Move slowly , quietly , without noise* For sleep disturbed will cause your doom* *Should you tread with utmost poise* *You may survive to the next room . * & amp ; nbsp ; In the main chamber sleeps a mountain troll , sensitive to noise and light . Scattered across the floor are the skeletal remains of the troll 's previous meals , sure to wake him if kicked or stepped upon . Contestants objectives are to read the instructions in the antechamber , and move past the troll in the second chamber . & amp ; nbsp ; The **second room** consists of a rickety , swaying bridge over a moat of blast-ended skrewts . An enchanted wind ensures the bridge 's constant movement . Upon entry , contestants pass through a spell that completely paralyzes their legs . Upon exit , they pass through a counterspell that undoes any remaining leg paralysis . Inscribed on the wall is the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *A simple walk from door to door* *Without your legs is made a struggle . * *Will you crawl across the floor ? * *Can you do better than a muggle ? * & amp ; nbsp ; The bridge shall not at any point degrade or fall further apart except at two predetermined planks , which will immediately fall should any weight be put on them . We can not guarantee that the bridge will not at any point swing to the point of being upside down , especially given the variable intelligence of contestants . Contestants objectives are to pass from one side of the room to the other , preferably without falling into the moat . & amp ; nbsp ; The **third room** consists of a goblet on a pedestal , clearly marked with a symbol for deadly poison . It should be noted here that the supply room in which the potions are made is conspicuously absent of bezoars . Upon the wall is inscribed the following mockery : & amp ; nbsp ; *This room is easy , without malice ... * *no nasty creatures seek your death . * *Just down the contents of this chalice , * *take a step , and your last breath . * & amp ; nbsp ; The door at the other end of the room shall unlock when the final drop of the poison has been consumed , however , without some method of mitigating the poison , the contestant shall not make it more than two steps . Contestants objectives are to drink the poison , and to not die . & amp ; nbsp ; The **fourth room** consists of a gauntlet of mini-mini-challenges . The contestants must get through a relatively simple and straightforward obstacle course , with the addition of a spout of flame , continuously falling shards of razor sharp ice , and a dense cluster of Venemous Tentaculae , each of which completely obstructs a portion of the path ahead . Upon the wall is inscribed the following poem : & amp ; nbsp ; *Good work surviving , you may yet live ! * *You 've made it through the easy part . * *Three challenges this room will give . * *And not one for the weak of heart . * *Try not to burn within the heat* *If you truly be must told . * *Do n't supply a plant with meat* *And avoid bitter shards of cold . * & amp ; nbsp ; The obstacle course on its own is of a level than can be easily completed with minor to moderate athletic skill , but the specific obstacles should be expected to add some substantial difficulty . & amp ; nbsp ; EDIT : @ * # $ reddit formatting",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"# # Conservation - The pudgiemudgies & amp ; nbsp ; **Description** The pudgiemudgies are small forest creatures , not much bigger than an ant but incredibly cute . They look similar to a [ puffskein ] ( http : //www.deviantart.com/art/Puffskein-261178762 ) and are their distant relatives . However , pudgiemudgies live in groups up to 500 individuals and stay close to each other at all times . Consequentially , pudgiemudgie clans will look like a curious colorful moss patch to an uneducated witch or wizard but upon further observation it will become obvious that the ‘ ’ moss patch ’ ’ is pulsing and moving as pudgiemudgies communicate by dancing . Pudgiemudgies vary in color but one clan will always only consist of one color and all the babies born to that clan will be of that color . Scholars assume that the colors are based on their environment . Once a year , all pudgiemudgie clans of an area will congregate for a meeting and a ball . This event is known as a *kaleidoball* in scholarly circles due to the mesmerizing mixtures of different clans and their colors . & amp ; nbsp ; **Endangerment** The pudgiemudgies are pretty much defenseless and rely on their small size to evade any predators . Recently however , there has been an increase in the illegal trade of pudgiemudgies as decoration and even potion ingredients . Furthermore , due to the changes in global climate , some colors of pudgiemudgie clans are beginning to die out , most notable cobalt blue and electric orange . These two clan variations were found in colder climates and need a period of snow to continue producing offspring with their colors . When offspring of the wrong color are born in a clan , they have to find a clan with their colors , which can be a treacherous journey for a young pudgiemudgie . & amp ; nbsp ; **Protection** There have been a couple of plans made to protect this vulnerable species , including bringing up the fines for trade and possession of pudgiemudgies , and efforts to restore and protect the natural environment of the clans endangered by climate change . The most interesting of conservation plans , however , is to selectively breed pudgiemudgies in order for them to develop defensive abilities that would make them less desirable as decoration and harder to hunt , such as breathing fire and manipulating their environment . Your average wizard would be much less likely to scatter them over his Yuletide tree when doing so when doing so is likely to set that tree on fire .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

How many students do you want in your class ? ** The wizarding world is amazing and awe-inspiring but let ’ s be honest : the delay in technology can sometimes be inconvenient . There are ways in which muggles have definitely overtaken us . That ’ s why I want to not only teach young witches and wizards about the ways technology and magic can intertwine but also work with them to create new ways to improve the magical world . The new subject I am proposing will be called Wiztech and will incorporate muggle technology with magical ways or repurposing and improving it . **How long will you be a guest instructor for ? Are your classes consecutive or will you be doing various courses over the year ? Is your course a one-time exclusive ? ** I will teach students for a full year ( or maybe more if this class is successful ) . My classes will occur every week in groups of 10 to 15 witches and wizards . **What is your teaching like ? Can you share a lesson plan with us ? ** My classes will begin with a series of lectures introducing students that haven ’ t had experience with muggle technology before to the ways in which it works and ways in which it can be improved with magic . Afterwards we will begin workshops in which I will show the students how to incorporate magic and technology . The last part of our year will be spent on students working on their own projects in smaller groups . These projects will be represent the majority of the final grade in my class . **What sort of homework assignments do you plan to give our students ? ** Students will spend the first two thirds of our year together researching muggle technology and ways magic can be incorporated into it , and will be required to write essays on their findings . Homework will not be given in the last part of the year when students are working on their own project . Students can obviously spend time outside of classrooms figuring out ways to improve their project , however , students will not be permitted to work on the actual project without supervision . **Describe how you would like to begin your first class , or tell us about a previous teaching experience you are proud of . ** This will be my first time teaching a class at a school but I have taken on several young assistants in my many years of invention .

AgentSmax,Games,Yes it can . We played it on a lan party a few months ago . The problem is the maps are designed for singleplayer and it does n't work that well with more players ( although we have n't tried the later levels ) . It might be ok with two players though .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,starcraft,Indeed it is . It 's used in movies extensively .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Games,"I personally am very selective with my choice of games but I picked it up because TB , Sessler and a few of my friends said it 's a must play . And it 's now one of my favourite games of all time . You ca n't have someone tell you the story and know what it 's about . You ca n't watch a video of it and know what it 's about . Playing it is the only way . I ca n't say if you will or will not like it , but I think it 's worth playing through it either way , especially if you can pick it up in the steam holiday sale .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,technology,I 'd wager graphics designers are the ones that would n't like the yellow tint one way or another . That 's also why gunnar has a clear option .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,It might be a bluescreen .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,funny,"Kelvin is basically offset Celsius . But measuring systems do n't need to be based off of human physiology . For instance , a meter is n't based to be practical for humans but is defined by a specific constant , compared to a yard which was basically the length of a string going from the tip of some person 's nose to the end of his outstretched arm . Guess which one I feel is a better base for a measuring system ? Fahrenheit itself is actually based on freezing ( 32°F ) and boiling point ( 212°F ) of water . But I just do n't see what the purpose is . If I take a quote from calmdownpaco `` 100+ is either hot or death '' - sorry , but that 's not really specific . That , in my opinion , is just trying to put round numbers to arbitrary temperatures .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Games,"They market it as a military sandbox game . Almost every single time I watched a video about it or read an article it stated that it 's a complex game . You could also look up ArmA , ArmA 2 and even Operation Flashpoint to get an idea about how this game would work . The information is everywhere . I do n't think they have controller support enabled in beta yet . At least rebinding keys . I have n't really checked though . ArmA 2 worked fine with my 360 controller while flying aircraft . But if you want to use it for infantry gameplay , good luck with that . It 's hard to hit people with the mouse already .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,hockey,"They use kind of a light green , yes . But not as fluorescent as the olympic jerseys . For instance [ EuroBaslet 2013 ] ( http : //siol.sdn.si/sn/img/13/250/635141914055393381_eurobasket2013_3232_130907_vp.jpg ) .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,formula1,From what I read Tesla cars have maximum power at 0 rpm . I assume it 's the same here .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,In what way is it less realistic ? I really do n't see how less sim-like the game is now compared to A2 . The running seemed strange to me as well at first but I 've grown to like them now . Also the running has nothing to do with stances but rather with animations .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"Sure , with heavy gear movement would feel clunky , but I still do n't see how this relates to stances . I think you have to look at the control scheme here . Using mouse and keyboard is in no way simmilar to handling a proper rifle and making the controls sluggish as they were in A2 just feels like taking control away from the player and it is at times frustrating . Taking everything into account in the game you still have much less control than you would in real life as well as no physical feedback whatsoever . I think regarding gameplay you have to balance it fairly well between what feels good and what is `` realistic '' .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Games,The way ArmA 2 controls or the way ArmA 3 controls ? Because ArmA 3 has a completely different feeling . It 's way smoother and way more responsive . You can check out ArmA 3 alpha lite to get a taste of it . I have 3 invites to the alpha lite if you or anyone else is interested .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,funny,But that does n't matter . It 's not how applicable it is to humans . It 's about setting an absolute temperature scale . It seems to me that basing it on whether it is bad for humans has a wide margin of error which is n't really ideal .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,funny,"If we are going into specifics then you are only partially right here . From wikipedia : & gt ; Fahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724 , basing it on three reference points of temperature . In his initial scale ( which is not the final Fahrenheit scale ) , the zero point is determined by placing the thermometer in brine : he used a mixture of ice , water , and ammonium chloride , a salt , at a 1:1:1 ratio . This is a frigorific mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically : that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F ( −17.78 °C ) . The second point , at 32 degrees , was a mixture of ice and water without the ammonium chloride at a 1:1 ratio . The third point , 96 degrees , was approximately the human body temperature , then called `` blood-heat '' . Only 0°F was using salt water out of the three points . Calling me boundlessly ignorant and downvoting me ? I like how very rationally you respond to critique of ( in fact not actually your ) temperature measurement system . If I were you I 'd untwist those knickers you are wearing before replying next time .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,Cynicalbrit,Is it though ? I have n't heard anyone south of Slovenia say `` drek '' .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Cynicalbrit,That 's pretty standard it seems . It 's odd because it happens to the same degree in Slovenia as other countries but on a much smaller scale so the differences are even more visible . It 's like we have 50 languages all of them identifying as Slovene .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,technology,There are times when exactly the opposite is true . Ubisoft is a good example for it .

And that 's a plane that really does n't feel like it wants to fly .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,Tribes,"So I 've been having issues with Tribes Ascend for a while now ( last 1 or 2 patches ) . I usually have over 60fps consistently , but then I started having framedrops in intervals ( 10-20fps for about 10 seconds in 15-30 second intervals ) . It was very consistent - especially on full servers . I have tried many solutions - closing programs that could affect the performance , trying different drivers ... Nothing worked particularly well . Since it clearly was n't the graphics card lagging ( fps drop remained if I looked at the floor or at the sky ) the only possible fault is the CPU . One day I was monitoring the CPU with the task manager and came on the idea of changing the CPU core affinity . Turns out it works for me on no more or less than 4 cores . If Tribes runs on any other amount than 4 cores it starts either being jerky or has framedrop intervals . Computer specs : The laptop is an MSI GT780DXR CPU - Intel Core i7 - 2670QM Graphics card - Nvidia GTX 570m Ram - 8GB DDR3 **TL ; DR** - Tribes only likes exactly 4 cores on my pc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Second of all : You need to show people that e-sports is not just a joke and people are willing to watch it before some big sponsors come along . Third of all : There actually are a lot of big sponsors ( like siemens and intel ) that actually do support e-sports but that 's mostly the prize money . The money gathered through season tickets is what directly goes into upgrading the stream so more people could watch it without interruption and better quality , thus insuring the bigger growth of e-sports . You ca n't just throw in soccer , which has actually been an established sport for over a century .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Why drive a car ? Unless you can give something new to that , why bother ? Why play the computer ? Why do anything ? I say if you want to do it , do it . Period . I do n't see any reason why not .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"I fail to see how you could possibly know if you will appeal to a lot of people without trying . It 's not like Day [ 9 ] , Husky , djWheat or any other caster decided `` people will like me '' and started casting .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting games is n't `` talking over a game you play '' . I find people cast sc2 because they genuinely love the game and would like to try their hand at casting . From what I see in cod , there were actually vlogs with gameplay in the background . That is not casting . There is also a difference between `` need '' and `` want to '' . And you do n't know it 's going to be bad . If people do n't try we may not get good casters . You ca n't just say you will cast it in a new way if you do n't know you can pull it off . Casting style develops with experience .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Casting I would think is not talking random non-game related bullshit . Casting ( to me ) is play-by-play and analysis . Talking random shit is talking random shit . The thing is , cod community is n't really the same as SC community . From what I have seen , except for a troll here or there , the SC community is much more mature than any mainstream FPS community . The thing is , it 's always nice to see fresh talent . And if no one wants to someone who says `` uhm '' every two words , I would think they would want to improve their casting , which could only benefit the community . This may sound a bit optimistic , but I think people recognize quality .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"From what I have seen from the front page is either people wanting to learn SC , big events or some big stuff that 's good for SC , or something funny . I 'm not quite sure about the comments but I have found nothing wrong with it yet . The topics that are bad usually disappear pretty fast . Concerning the 100 people as good as Husky , It 's your problem who you would want to watch . It 's not like you 're forced to watch them . Nobody can be exactly the same as another caster . Everyone has unique properties . More options is often times good .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,Indeed . SC2 will get better in time . It 's a very young game still . Truly balancing the game takes time .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,Then you must not know who CombatEX is . The BM is not because he 's bad . Almost nobody likes CombatEX and there 's a reason for that . Just do some research . Also check out the game Chill vs CombatEX with Day [ 9 ] casting . He pretty much explains it all . http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=0dqYxpxegrk Note that the colors will be fixed a bit into the video .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,starcraft,Agreed . Warp prisms are extremely underused .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,Ah misinterpreted the topic lol . I shall delete the original post to make the topic more happy : ),Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"The stream is quite enjoyable . WhiteRa also just talked through the games at first , but the last few days he was just talking after the game . To be honest , he is playing better when he 's not talking .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,Day [ 9 ] whatever money he makes is from donations and commercials from blip.tv Sheth is an FXO pro player . I would guess Sheth makes more money than Day [ 9 ] . That 's just from what info I could gather .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,I ca n't not do that .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"I guess you have to get into a position of a casual watcher who might in fact not have a lot of insight into the game . When the commentator says it 's over I can see a lot of those extremely casual viewers turning off . That 's to say even in sports if one team is way ahead than the other broadcasters usually acknowledge that it is in fact over . In short , it most definitely depends on the situation .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Then I do n't think you fit into the description of a casual watcher . It 's not casual gamers he 's talking about it 's casual watchers . They watch for the entertainment , they do n't watch to know in how many possible ways one battle could go . And like TB said , for satisfying those not so casual watchers , who actually wa n't to watch analysis and such , there are colour commentators .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,Correct . I might have been to vague in my previous post .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,starcraft,"Blizzard is hardly owned by EA since Blizzard and Activision came together to make Activision-Blizzard . Semantics aside , if Activision affects Blizzard 's choices ( which I think is n't that far from the truth ) , then that 's just silly .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,What about Tarson ? : P,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,"Not everyone thinks like you . Most fans just watch the game and do n't care about anything strategically . In basketball they just want to watch sick moves of , let 's say , Kobe Bryant and listen to excited commentators so that they are excited , which in turn provides their entertainment . You apparently are open to learn about the game and get your entertainment out of that .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,starcraft,I 'd say it 's more likely he does it so more people would understand . If most of Ukraine also speaks Russian but most of Russia does n't speak Ukranian it makes sense to speak in Russian .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,funny,IIRC Shaggy always used `` zoinks '' .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,I 'm not an expert in this but I reckon the explosive in those grenades is only powerful enough to launch shrapnel and is n't really meant to do anything else . The shrapnel is most likely designed to penetrate and the mass of shrapnel is so little it would n't really move you a whole lot . That 's my theory .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"Though I wish it was better I would n't say it 's terrible . I find the sound assets miles better than ArmA 2 . Weapons sound like they have actual power behind them . Walking sounds are great though it seems some sounds for different materials are still missing . Helicopters could use a bit more `` punch '' if you know what I mean , but otherwise they sound great . Sounds that bother me are explosions and miniguns . Explosions sound similar to arma 2 so they might as well be placeholders . Miniguns just sound weak . And I 'd like to hear some good echo . Although I wish something like [ this ] ( http : //youtu.be/MQt1jtDBNK4 ) would be picked up by game developers already . Sound technology generally seems to be lacking in games . EDIT : Seems like I should have researched the engine problems more . Yeah , they should definitely fix those things .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I also did n't quite understand it before posting my comment due to my mistake of not checking OP 's link . To quote the description on the page : & gt ; Sound positioning is terrible , there only seems to be few different volumes of gunshots- less than 50m , 50-250 , 250+ ( anything within that range sounds exactly as loud ) , you can only hear footsteps at less than 10m , when you lean your footsteps sound 3m away etc .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"So basically I thought it was a sound assets problem , but it 's actually a sound engine problem . I do agree with that . It feels like that the sound engine really was n't the big focus point of the game or they have n't pushed out the proper one to the public yet . Hopefully it will be improved in the coming months .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I do n't know the specifics of either JSRS or the ArmA engine but I do n't see any other way to enhance awareness but through scripts/proper code . Different sound assets might come in handy under different conditions ( for instance a grenade explosion or weapons fire behind a wall ) , but most of this could be simulated via the engine should it be written to support that . I 'd probably go as far as to say that they are already working on it because the issues described in the link seem to be either a placeholder of some sort or maybe even an attempt at optimization . It 's still good to point out these issues though , just in case .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,The thing about sound is there was actually very good and promising sound technology back in the 90 's with a sound card that actually simulated sound very well with reverb and everything . I ca n't remember the name of it but I 'll try to find it . Most games used that technology back then . Why there seems to be no such thing today is iirc soundblaster bought it and pretty much scrapped it for its own inferior system .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"Okay , after a bit of a search I found [ this ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3D ) . You can find some demos on youtube showcasing the technology . Apparently I was wrong about the reverb thing . Though I recall seeing something about bouncing sound off of 3d geometry back in those days so I 'm going to look a bit farther . EDIT : [ THIS ] ( http : //toni.org/a3d/ ) was the post I remember .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,arma,"I used to want a 7.1 headset . But after trying my friend 's pair I am really not convinced . I get much better quality out of my cheaper sennheisers and positional audio works just as well . I too am very sad at how the industry neglected sound . BFBC2 still has the best modern sound technology I have experienced in a game , but that 's only one game among many .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,polandball,Maybe it 's just a posh Anglosphere .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Games,Nope . Not the android one at least . Android still has the old TwitchTV design .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Games,"On my Galaxy SIII it works but not consistently . There were many times where some resolutions just did n't work . The design is old and it does n't reflect that twitch is now only 'twitch ' and not 'TwitchTV ' . You can not login into your own account which also means no chat feature and you ca n't easily find the channels you are following . While I do n't really care about the chat functionality ( people on twitch chat are more often than not shite ) , I would quite like to have a category where I can see the channels I am following . You also can not watch twitch VODs over the app .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,Tribes,Starcraft and Brood War outside of Korea had more of a niche audience afaik . Regarding the last point I think Blizzard really hit the nail on the head with Starcraft 2 . Most of the people watching do n't actively play the game and a lot of them never even tried it . I think it 's a great example that if you go about it the right way an esport can succeed even in the non gaming audience . The only other developer that I know is esports oriented is nadeo with shootmania - and I hope more will come up . **EDIT : ** In my opinion one major thing that can really make an esport is giving the tools to the community . It 's what shootmania aims to do and it 's also why StarCraft is so succesfull competitively ( Blizzard maps usually suck ass ) .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AgentSmax,Tribes,All evidence suggests that tribes ascend is **horribly** unoptimized .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Tribes,Hmm ... I just might investigate the matter . If that 's really the cause of the problem it may explain why the problem occurs in intervals ... Good find . Although I still do n't know why only exactly 4 cores . If I put 5 it starts lagging . **EDIT : ** context,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Tribes,Quite intriguing . That makes a lot of sense .,Balto-Slavic,Slovene
AgentSmax,Tribes,It is quite possible that tribes has some weird issue . From what problems me and my friend encountered trying to play tribes I think I ca n't be surprised anymore : ) I do hope they optimize the game .

Coupled with the fact that the dog probably does n't get enough excercise , it causes this . It 's also not like animals are thinking rationally about it . And even if they would ... would it help ?

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"There are two ideas here : Free power and the Wardenclyffe tower .

Unfortunately for Tesla , his rival Marconi beat him to it by successfully transmitting morse code across the Atlantic in 1901 , before the tower was finished . The tower might have worked in the end , but money ran out and so the tower was demolished . Regarding free energy : Tesla wrote a very vague description of a machine that could extract heat from the air ( he called it sun-heat or some such ) and turn it into electricity . Nobody has been able to nail down what the machine was supposed to be , how t would work or if it 's even plausible . Tesla often made grandiose claims which were based on his sometimes pretty wacky ideas , like his wireless power transmission ones ( he believed the ground and the atmosphere were conductive and could be used as carriers for electricity .

The question then is : Is it more efficient to create high pressure gas by explosions or by boiling water ? Turns out , boiling is better . Mainly because the boiler of a power station can be very finely tuned to produce steam at a constant rate 24/7 , while gasoline engines have to be able to adapt to various operating conditions , like cold/hot weather , slow/fast speeds , low or high load ( towing ) ...

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Hate to break your bubble , but `` drone '' was a nickname used by the US air force to describe all kinds of unmanned aircraft . 1972 quote from General John Mayer , Commander in Chief of the Strategic Air Command , when asked about UAVs in Vietnam : & gt ; we let the **drone** do the high-risk flying ... the loss rate is high , but we are willing to risk more of them ... they save lives !",Balto-Slavic,Slovene
Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Lead and mercury are naturally occurring elements that are present ( in small concentrations ) in everything that comes into contact with earth . Everything we eat or drink will contain them , and so will tobacco products . It 's not really an issue , but it sounds serious , so it 's used since it 's not an outright lie . Pesticides are similar , every crop that is grown on an industrial scale will have to be sprayed with pesticides , and some small amount of that will end up inside the crop itself . Again , unless the concentrations are crazy high , it 's not an issue . There is another source of hazardous chemicals in cigarettes though , the burning itself . Cigarettes are intentionally made so that the burning of tobacco is slow and inefficient , because that makes sure that the active ingredients of tobacco ( nicotine and flavor ) do n't burn away as well . This inefficient burning can create a whole mess of basically random organic molecules ( phenol , benzene , formaldehyde ... ) , some of which can be pretty toxic . The amount of toxic chemicals that will be created is impossible to predict , but it can be a genuine hazard .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Electrical power is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current . So in order to power a 1kW device , like a hair dryer , you would need to supply it about 4,3 amperes at 230 volts ( 4,3 x 230 = ~1000 ) , OR about 9 amperes at 110 volts ( 9 x 110 = ~1000 ) . Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation . Higher voltages are also more likely to cause electrical shocks , and I believe that was the reason the US ( and some other countries ) went with a lower standard voltage .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

A delay of 80 ms is pretty low and should be good enough to play most games , except for maybe the fastest paced twitch shooters . Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transfered in a given amount of time , regardless of delay .

The wave then spreads out in a [ conical shape ] ( https : //i.stack.imgur.com/Pb5cB.jpg ) . If you are hit by the shockwave you will hear that as a `` boom '' . So : 1 : The leader does hear the boom but a little while after the other plane has passed , when the shockwave hits the leader . 2 . Same as 1 . 3 . Same as 1 & amp ; 2 . 4 . Engine noise does n't matter , only the shape of the aircraft and it 's speed matter . More smaller/pointyer/slower aircraft will make less loud booms , larger/faster ones will make a louder one .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

When this compound is reacted ( `` burned '' ) it transforms into other compounds ( water , carbon dioxide and waste products ) , whose total chemical energy is less than the energy of the fat that was reacted . The difference in energies between the reactants and the product ( called [ enthalpy ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy ) ) is the energy that can be extracted and used . This energy ( in a very roundabout way which a biologist would have to explain ) is what makes your muscles move ( kinetic energy ) and it 's what keeps your body warm ( heat energy ) . So you 're not converting matter into energy , you are changing one kind of matter into another and getting some energy out of it in the process .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

For example : A priest slipping on a banana peal is considered funny because priests are seen as cautious , reliable , inflexible people who do n't make simple mistakes like stepping on slippery trash ; when the priest slips his stature is reduced , there is a juxtaposition and this can be considered funny ( no accounting for taste , obv ) A crippled homeless woman slipping on a banana peel is n't funny .

Before you pay back , I spend as though the $ 22 is guaranteed to come , so I splurge a little . Perhaps I even take out a ( cheaper ) loan of my own ( using the $ 22 owed as collateral ) , so I can lend $ 20 to some more people and charge more interest . So far so good . The problem starts when suddenly you ca n't pay me back . I already made bets that you would pay me back ( by taking on debt of my own ) and suddenly , I find myself unable to pay back my own debt ( +interest ) . The person/bank I borrowed from could now be short of cash because of my failure to pay , and probably has debt of their own to repay , which they are unable to do .

Mars ( the most hospitable planet for humans , save for the earth ) has almost no atmosphere , no potable water ( though it might have briny water underground ) , no plant or animal life , it even lacks a magnetic field to protect it from the solar wind .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"Saying `` liberation is impossible without study of scriptures & amp ; Guru '' limits the power of the Lord 's grace-bestowal . There 's nothing limiting Him from conferring grace directly . So it is possible to get liberation without doing any meditation , study , never meeting a Guru . It can happen as a sudden descent of Lord 's Power ( śaktipāta ) : & gt ; such a being becomes spiritually illuminated and liberated on his own , relying directly on Śiva , not needing initiation or instruction from other exterior guru . This is facilitated by an intense awakening of his spiritual intuition ( pratibhā ) which immediately eliminates ignorance That being said , this is extremely rare , to the point that it 's practically best to not even consider it as an option . But it 's important to keep in mind that liberation is possible at all times since the Lord 's Freedom is unlimited and not conditioned by anything . In practice though , you will need the assistance of an external Guru and holy scriptures . But do n't give up just because a Guru has n't appeared in your life yet .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It 's hard to give a complete answer in a Reddit post , but if I had to attempt it , I would say that they are two ways in which nondualism exists . The Vedanta nondualism is nondualism *as opposed* to dualism . But when we juxtapose the two , we create another dualism . By contrast , the Śaiva nondualism is thoroughly nondualistic , which means that its nondualism *includes* dualism . A nondualism that rejects dualism is dualistic by this very rejection ; true nondualism must be able to absorb , integrate , its own opposite . To be less abstract : for instance , the relationship between the individual and God . In Śaiva advaita , they are identical . God is simply playing , willfully limiting Himself , His essence , and descending into individuality : being a mere man with all the stupidities and sufferings that this entails . This world is not an illusion , but it is an inward projection on the `` screen '' , as it were , of God-consciousness . So even maya is not merely negative and illusory , but it 's also true in a way , as it was created by God ( Śiva , which is ultimately You , Yourself - pure *I-consciousness* ) . If you 're familiar with European philosophy , the philosopher most resembling Śaiva idealism is Hegel . God , the Absolute Spirit , is involved in a kind of self-alienation , a cancellation of His simple perfection , and descends into limitation , negation ; later , he negates this negation itself , and regains his infinity ( when he recognize his true nature as the universal Self ) . So God Himself is dynamic , he is the totality , but at the same time , he projects his own opposite in order to reflect on what he is not . - The Vedanta view is more similar to Spinoza : the Absolute is a self-same Substance that is static , it 's like an absolute object that , because of being perfect , it is immovable , it does n't transform , nothing happens to it . If there is any happening , that is illusion , a mistake of perception . The Śaiva idealism would reply : but this illusion , too , is a Power of that God ! So , from my very limited and also partisan perspective , the difference is that the Śaiva nondualism is more thorough and radical .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

One interpretation states that Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir is known as Trika or Threefold System because it analyzes the nature of Śiva , Śakti and Nara . Śiva is God , and Śakti is God 's I-consciousness . Nara is man ( the human being ) . Trika teachs that Śiva , Śakti and Nara are not different from one another . In short , Man and God are one and the same . In fact , just the Supreme Self , known as Śiva in this philosophical system , is the Self of the entire universe . > 2 ) Therefore , there is no difference between Śiva ( God ) and Śakti ( God 's I-consciousness ) . God is and knows He is . There is not any difference at all . > 3 ) Śiva is a name for the static aspect of God . > 4 ) Śakti is a name for the dynamic aspect of God . > 5 ) Śiva-Śakti is Freedom Itself . > 6 ) Therefore , the human being is inherently free too . > 7 ) However , the human being experiences bondage because of `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) . > 8 ) Nevertheless , that mala is not something outside human being himself . > 9 ) God becomes `` man '' ( so to speak ; because lastly God is God and becomes nothing ) through mala ( impurity , limiting condition ) . In a word , mala arises from God . > 10 ) Śiva or God is not inactive . He has Śakti or I-consciousness . In short , He has Will , which gives rise to Knowledge and Activity . > 11 ) When a human being realizes his inherent unity with Śiva and Śakti , `` mala '' ( limiting condition ) ceases to exist completely . > 12 ) His realization puts an end to the whole `` apparent '' bondage . > 13 ) Since a human being is essentially God , manifests the entire universe around him ( maybe a `` difficult to accept '' teaching ) . > 14 ) Even though Non-dualism between God and human being is predominant in this philosophical system , all others viewpoints ( mostly dualistic ) are explained and included too . > 15 ) The universe is the playful unfoldment of God 's power . Therefore , the universe is born right now from Joy . > 16 ) Unhappiness is experienced by a human being when he becomes oblivious of his spiritual nature . > 17 ) When he remembers his spiritual nature and realizes his unity with God , unhappiness is turned into happiness . > 18 ) Mala or impurity is nothing but ignorance of one 's essential nature . > 19 ) Human mind is Śakti Herself having undergone a process of successive contractions . > 20 ) Therefore , human mind experiences complete happiness only when it merges in God . > 21 ) God is not a void , but a Self full of I-consciousness . > 22 ) He may appears to be a `` void '' because He does not contain , in His innermost nature , any objects . > 23 ) The human being must understand that his own mind is the Divine Mind having undergone a process of succesive contractions . > 24 ) Consequently , understanding of one 's mind is encouraged , not simply control of it . > 25 ) To control mind , as it were , one must firstly understand it . -- - source : http : //www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/en/trika-1-1-non-dual-shaivism-of-kashmir/496",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

AirSandFire,PureLand,"In Jōdo Shinshū at least , the answer is yes . Edit : To expand on that , I 'll quote the new book by John Paraskevopoulos , writer and Shin priest from Australia . In it , he reproduced liturgical correspondence , in one of the Q & amp ; A we find this very question : & gt ; Q : I came across a Japanese Shinshu scholar who states that *it was the Dharma-Body itself that incarnated as Dharmakara* . The identity of the Dharma-Body and Amida is thereby made explicit , and I remember you describing Amida as the 'personal ' face of the Dharma-Body . Amida is not just another Buddha and , even though all Budhas are , in essence , of the Dharma-Body , and invoking or worshipping them is , in effect , referencing the Absolute , Amida is the Supreme Buddha in Whom all other Buddhas may be subsumed . & gt ; A : Regarding your remarks about Dharmakara , *Shinran himself actually said 'Manifesting a form from this ( formless ) treasure-ocean of Suchness , calling himself Dharmakara Bodhisattva , and making the unhindered Vow as the causes , he became Amida Buddha'* . In that sense , you are quite right - Amida is more than `` just another Buddha '' but a manifestation of the wisdom and compassion inherent in ultimate reality itself . ( p166,167 , *The Unhindered Path* by John Paraskevopoulos ) -- - This idea of `` Suchness-itself-as-compassionate '' is the special mark of the Shinshu school , perhaps not found in any other PL school . I think this ... rather unconventional ... view of Amida ... was not derived from `` standard '' PL theory of the Shan-dao `` line '' , but rather comes from Shinran 's Tendai background ( he was trained as a Tendai monk ) , his thinking seems perfumed by Tiantai theories of nature-inclusion / interpenetration which allow such maneuvers . AFAIK Shinran never elaborates on this , preferring to urge his disciples to not ruminate on such questions .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Anyway , what Marx envisioned was more like a Star Trek society - but we need the *replicator* for that .

A post-scarcity society when production reaches such levels that capitalism ( and `` capitalist exploitation '' by extension ) is not possible anymore . Marx ' mistake was , as you rightly point out , that he grossly overestimated the means of production of his era - but what he anticipated might actually come true in in the next few decades .

AirSandFire,hinduism,"It only appears that way and I 'll tell you why I think that 's the case . As a non-American follower of Shaivism : 1 ) The separation between religion and philosophy is more pronounced in the West , because of historical reasons we do n't need to go into . So you wo n't include Leibniz or Hegel in the list of `` Christian philosophers '' , even though they were , and their thought contains a Christology etc . If we were to include say , a Hegel , into the umbrella `` Christian thought '' , then Christianity would suddenly become at least equal to Hinduism in philosophical depth . The trick is that in the case of Buddhism and Hinduism , many philosophers are included as religious thinkers ; while in the case of Christianity , the thinkers , even if Christian , like Hegel , philosophized about Christ , are simply considered `` philosophers who happened to be Christian '' and are n't thought of as `` Christian thought '' 2 ) American Christianity - probably here you mean the mainland Protestants - have a somehow anti-intellectual attitude towards existential questions . You know , the *Bible says it , I believes it , that settles it ! * - so when you break away from *that* , you want to go as far away from it as possible from anything related to Christianity .

Huang Po knows this of course , as he remarks elsewhere : * '' Ordinary people look to their surroundings , while followers of the Way look to Mind ; but the true Dharma is to forget them both . `` * Here `` looking to surroundings '' means being caught up in distinctions and nonduality . `` Looking to the Mind '' means overcoming dualistic distinction , refraining from dualistic distinction . `` Forgetting them both '' means seeing the non-distinction between distinction and non-distinction , between Mind and surroundings . So the quote you show is the `` second step '' to take , to see oneness in everything . But that `` oneness '' is still caught up in dualistic thinking , and it means that the mountains are something other than mountains and the rivers are something other than rivers . You can arrive at the ultimate standpoint through mere logical means like this : What 's the difference between dualistic and nondualistic thinking ? Whatever answer we may come up with , that will be already `` dualistic distinction '' . So , from the standpoint of nonduality , dualistic and nondualistic are one ; but then why refrain from dualistic thinking , if dualistic and nondualistic thinking are nondual ? The very idea of refraining from something and instead opting for something else is dualistic . Ultimately , nonduality is duality , duality is nonduality , and what is Mind ?
