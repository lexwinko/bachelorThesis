20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Maybe I went overboard a bit . Possibly fueled by decades of being unable to speak with anybody on this matter in a rational manner . I think there is a big identity crisis in Bulgaria . We dont know if we are Slavic or Turkic ( proto-Bulgarians were , 500 years of Ottoman rule and as you said a lot of resettlement ) or Thracian , etc . because the truth is we are all of them . So no we have very little in common with the Proto-Bulgarians . At this point the only thing that is left is the name . Then I remember studying in school that the major population make-up of the Balkans when the Bulgars arrived were Slavic , this is incorrect . They were definitely present but there was another bigger group which were one of the oldest European population , which have stayed in South-East Europe for thousands of years . We see most of those people in countries like Croatia , Serbia and Bulgaria . If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million natives . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I am Bulgarian . Why am I Bulgarian ? 1300+ years ago some 30 000 steppe people showed up in the general area where Bulgaria is situated now . They were the Bulgars . What they found was a bunch of unorganised Slavs and Thracian descendants numbering about 2 million people . Quickly they incorporated them within the new Bulgarian state with the Bulgars forming the ruling and military elite . Wars ensued and little by little the proto-Bulgarians either mixed in with the native inhabitants or died off in these wars . I am very inclined to believe that all Bulgars had died off ( As they were semi-nomadic warriors they comprised the biggest chunk of the army , they did not deal with other things , so when an army was destroyed a massive chunk of the Bulgar population was destroyed as well ) or mixed with the local populace beyond recognition by the time the Byzantines conquered Bulgaria some 300 years after its creation . \\n\\nSo here I am . Its 2016 some 1000 years after I believe the Bulgars in this region were no longer an ethnicity . But still our country is called Bulgaria , I call myself Bulgarian but after what ? Some word that used to mean something 1000 years ago . Why do I not call myself Byzantine ? Or Turkish ? The Ottomans formed the longest lasting government that ruled these lands . I only care about my culture and traditions because they were inherited to me the same way another culture and traditions could have been inherited to me . \\n\\nSo I realised , nationality , religion , culture and traditions . All these things are random . They should **not** be the basis of my character . They should not define me , they should not define my inspirations about the future or my interpretation of history . I realised nationality is something , used in the past to drive the masses to do what the Kings and Dictators told them to . History was changed , culture and traditions adapted , so your kid would grow up and thoughtlessly drive himself towards the trench of the enemy for this made up symbolism and made up norms . \\n\\nHow silly it is , that we divide ourselves into nation-states because 300-800-1300 years ago someone thrust a sword in the ground and said that ethnicity and culture and traditions would not grow from now on at this particular place . \\n\\nWhen it comes to having a government , I dont care if its made up by only Bulgarians . What I care is that it has the same basic principles as I do , which are equality , human and civil rights and that everybody has the liberty to pursue happiness . The same way religion was separated from the state , so should nationality .

So we cant just suddenly stop \ '' evolving\ '' because most people like the traditional ways . This is humanity . Always improve , become better to enhance your life . \\n\\nThe nation should not promote nationalism and patriotism and it is actually pitiful that our state does so aggressively , as if they are afraid our established culture and traditions are going to shift . But that is what culture is . It changes , it adapts and it grows . We are so judgemental of the Muslims in the Middle-East for standing behind their societary and cultural beliefs even though they are sexist and sometimes barbaric , but when someone tells us to re-evaluate our societary boundaries we go super defensive because \ '' dont you insult our culture\ '' and \ '' We are proud to defend the values our ancestors fought for\ '' .

Trading going North mostly ends with Romania , there is some trade with Russia and Poland but 99 % of the Russian trade goes through the Black Sea and through , you guessed it Trakia . Varna and Burgas are very important for trade , not only for tourism , so the Trakia highway is very much necessary , I assume I do not have to explain why port cities are very important to trade . Plus the Turkey Highway ( Maritsa was it ? ) connects to Trakia at about 2/3 of its length , and you even didnt dispute the importance of that trade route .

Again I do not think the government has been perfect but I think they have done very well considering what the pre-EU governments did which is close to nothing.\\n \\nI believe the Veliko Turnovo-Ruse highway will be paid for by the end of the year . \\nAh so typical , complaining there is no funding to build highways and complain when the government increased the price for the *ridiculously* cheap vignette .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I also feel like a lot of people in the EU and especially reddit are getting confused between the TPP and TTIP . I know I was . At some point there was so much negative info on the TPP that when I heard about the TTIP I thought it was a deal that stemmed from the TPP . Are people just jumping on the \ '' fuck the TTIP\ '' bandwagon without thinking ? \\n\\nI mean we definitely should be sceptical but we ought to give it a good reasonable thought before simply discarding the deal .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I was actually defending the Bulgarian Muslims .

Maybe its less lying and more him saying dumb things and then taking them back but he has one of the worst truth-o-meter ratings in politics . \\n\\n & gt ; This is why I find these remarks that he isnt serious .Because the criticism he faces amounts to little more than disdain for how he expresses himself\\n\\nAt this point nobody is not taking him seriously .

He says BS suddenly when we call him out on it we are obstructing democracy . \\n\\n & gt ; Also banning people from entering until we can review our policy is a good idea . Your only objection can be moralistic . And it would be silly because prior to 1964 America didnt allow lots of people to immigrate . Muslims were essentially on that list\\n\\nIt is not . I do not see any issues with the current system . Also a reasonable person says \ '' we need to make sure our immigration system is working fine\ '' a xenophobe says \ '' ban all Muslims\ '' .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Well the stats in Wikipedia are a bit different but yeah Bulgaria was doing well compared to the other Eastern Bloc countries .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Nobody said countries should be forced into a federal government .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I hate the idea of a nation-state and would hate to live in a ethno-segregated world . What is Bulgaria anyway ? Because 1500 years ago 30 000 Bulgarians settled and mixed in with 2 million Slavs and other ethnicities and formed the military and ruling elite of the country everybody in it will be Bulgarian forever ? Who cares what the country is called , by now it is just a relic of some name that used to mean something a thousand years ago . What matters to me is that we secure a good and equal future . I do not mind if they wrote the signs in Turkish in the Turk predominant regions . They have as much right to live in Bulgaria as we do and as human beings they have the right to be treated equally and fairly . If they become a major nationality then fuck it lets rename the country , but it is unreasonable to do it now when they are only around 12 % . Treating them as equal citizens does not mean we need to go to the other extreme and become half Turks or something.\\n I have never fought for a segregated nation-state not that you have fought for anything either . But if we go with \ '' we\ '' and \ '' them\ '' they fought for this land too and Ottoman Bulgaria is the longest governmental state that has existed in these lands .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"That is incorrect . As I said in another comment less than 100 years ago German was as dominant in the USA as English .

They were dixie . \\n\\nPolitical union did not follow the cultural union . More like they both helped eachother grow . And for the EU there already is a political union . But I dont understand why there is a necessity to create a European culture and nationality . You will still be British I will be Bulgarian . We will just have a federal government .

In Bulgaria when someone tries to correct history everybody starts raging because \ '' something something preserve our culture\ '' . Culture is culture , there is no need to divide ourselves just because there are some differences . As I said before issues only arise when you let people from 3rd world countries live the way they lived in the Middle East because its \ '' their culture\ '' .

Its just that people assume that women belonging to men , for example is part of the Middle East\\ 's culture . Just because it is so predominant in their societies it does not mean it defines their ethnicity . We had sexism in Europe too and we removed it .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Lets start with what Nationalism is . \\n\\n & gt ; Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together . \\n\\nNationalism was a well known concept before the form we are familiar with became quite popular with countries in the 19th century . Just because the \ '' nation-state\ '' in today\\ 's status did not exist back then , it doesnt mean it didnt exist . \\n\\n & gt ; The story of history is largely one group of people oppressing a weaker group of people.\\n\\nWhat were those groups made up from ? It was Jews versus Egyptians , Mongols vs Tatars , Romans vs Etruscans . Those group were made up on the basis of nationalism . Exceptions would be the Teutonic order for example , which were not a common thing . \\n\\n & gt ; The main political and governing organization up until a couple hundred years ago was multiethnic empires.\\n\\nUhm , not really , not most of then at least . You could say Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic empire but then no Slavs were ever given power in it . For a long time the empire was just called the Austrian Empire until the resurgence of ( you guessed it ) Hungarian nationalism . But it was 1 group of people from one nationality , ruling over a conquered number of peoples . \\nOttoman empire was also similar , although they were more split between religions , rather than ethnicity , but lets not kid ourselves , back then 99.9 % of an ethnicity would have the same religion so you could say that the separation of the ruling elite and commoners ( and christians as a second class citizen ) was ethnic . Small exception for the Janissaries who were conscripted from Christian societies , converted to Islam to serve the empire.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; A big reason why history has been a continual violent struggle of groups . \\n\\nGroups largely based on nationality/ethnicity , yep . Reasonably then you can make the point that if people didnt feel some sort of symbolical belonging to one group because they were born and raised in roughly the same geographical location as you there wouldnt be as many wars . **But** and this is a big but , there are many many many other reasons that war occured through history , we are talking a plethora of complicated reasons based on human nature , government types , technological levels , nationalism , etc , etc . \\n\\n & gt ; Youre comment is probably the most historically ignorant comment I\\ 've ever seen \\n\\nOh the irony . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that nations generally had self determination throughout history is ludicrous and false . \\n\\nNow this is somewhat complicated . Without efficient forms of communication , even nationalities were split up . The people that led them ( kings , emperors , etc . ) were able to then seek their own desires without caring about what the people wanted . ( Nobody knew what \ '' the people\ '' wanted , not even them ) . In the 19th century , though , when Nationalism resurged , it was much easier to develop a sort of national unity and a common goal , which in most cases was to achieve a state with a singular nationality in it being the ruling elite and lower classes . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that any significant portion of wars happened because \ '' I don\\'t like those other people\ '' is so sophomoric.\\n\\nOF course , there were many other reasons , but most of them arising from governmental and administrative regions developing from ethnic boundaries . The 100 years war wasnt started just because they hated each other . But the lower classes had no other ambition to kill the other rather than because of hate towards the other ethnic group . If a French person found themselves in an English hamlet , would he survive the night ? \\n\\n & gt ; The Austrian Hungarian empire didn\\'t start a war because they didn\\'t like Slavs . What was the spark of that war ? A member of a oppressed nation and group that lacked self determination killed the leader of the nation that was oppressing them.\\n\\nUhm yes they did . You just proved *my* point . Due to the nationalism of the Black Hand and Gavrilo Princip the spark was lit and resulted in a war , that was caused by frictions created from nationalism . If there was no Nationalism back then , the Austria-Hungarian empire would not be oppressing Slavs just because they are different ethnicity from them , the Black Hand woudnt be formed out of nationalistic necessities in the form of uniting all south Slavs , Russia wouldnt have attacked Austria-Hungary because they needed to protect their Slavic brothers , etc . The cause of the war was Nationalistic frictions in Eastern Europe and the Balkans . \\n\\nBut I am not disagreeing that Nationalism was a useful tool in the past . It was . Its just that I believe that it is not necessary anymore in the modern world and in some regions it is even being harmful . Whether or not nationalism was a thingof the past is unrelated to my main post and I dont know why I let you distract me from it .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Bro f that . Your flair reminded me of the awesome gyro I ate last summer in Halkidiki . It was like ... you know how a bad burger is like a shitty bun a piece of dry meat and some ketchup ? Well that gyro had all its ingredients melted into one piece of delicious goodness . I dont know where the bread ended and where the meat began . I still salivate thinking about it . I cant even remember exactly what was in it . Maybe some god sauce ? Is that a thing ? If it is that gyro had god sauce in every crevice not filled with that amalgamation of flavors and scents . I sat in my car next to a beach and cried while the god sauce flowed down my chin unto my chest while I was slowly and carefully enjoying that savory goodness . I could not comprehend it . My mouth was orgasming and I was contemplating the meaning of flavors and food and in that moment of sensory overload it ended . The gyro was gone . And I knew I would never experience such delight and awe in my life again . \\n\\nI ended up experiencing that every morning for the next week .

Like they are doing now with Brexit , pressuring the UK to finally invoke article 50 in order to end this period of uncertainty which is mainly hurting them . \\n\\nBut yeah , this was a nice debate , I can see me re-thinking some of the things I said , hope I managed to do the same for you .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I think that if the people want a referendum they should get one . But I just disagree that Catalonia needs to leave .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

I dont know enough about the Catalan parliament and could be wrong but I dont think it objectively shows what the people want .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Yeah you could say so . I think the fairest thing to do is let everybody choose for themselves what language they want to speak . That does not require Independence though .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"& gt ; Yes there is - there is even a lot of talks about Scotland remaining in the UK should they declare independence before Brexit\\n\\nIm guessing you meant remaining in the EU not the UK . But the situation is different here . In their referendum they were also told that they would not be allowed back into the EU immediately . Especially with the UK\\ 's veto . It was made clear that independence meant that all relations with the EU would need to be made from scratch because you cant deal with the new sovereign state with the agreements you have made with another one . Even in this case , though , Scotland wont be allowed to just re-enter the EU immediately after a Scottish Independence . It is just impossible . As I said you cant have the agreements and deals made with the UK to be binding for another country which Scotland would then be . \\n\\n & gt ; That is irrelevant - people want independence despite the fact that it may not create a better future . I surely remember what the early 90s were like in Estonia . \\n\\nHow is it irrelevant ? I think its the most important part . Only if the UK were educated enough on what they were voting they would have remained instead of voting for Brexit in order to stop Muslim immigration . Ah but did leaving the Soviets bring a better future ? Now Estonia is ways ahead of Russia . And you did have examples of how capitalism was better than socialism so you could definitely make a rational argument for leaving then . \\n\\n & gt ; If they want to , then why should there be a problem . If they don\\'t want to , then it\\ 's not our business to stop them.\\n\\nBut nobody is stopping them ! ( except maybe Spain ) There is a process that every country that wants to become a member needs to follow in order to gain membership . There are guidelines that need to be reached . Its the process that makes the EU possible that would slow Catalonia or any other nation from joining , not spite or bitterness . \\n\\n & gt ; Which is why not cooperating with their entry is why I consider it a childish reaction.\\n\\nThere would be cooperation , but how long would it take for them to land a deal ? How long will Spain be childish ? It is uncertain but only one thing is known , and it is that it wont be instantaneous\\n\\n & gt ; No - having come from a subjected nation - the problem was not only political repression , but the fact itself that it wasn\\'t \ '' our nation\ '' .\\n\\nWell that is your opinion . I personally , as long as my vote count towards the leadership and the local governance cant be bothered with the symbolism of calling that leader and governance ours . I dont see how that would make me sleep better . \\n\\n & gt ; Yet are outvoted in issues that matter to them internally . Reminds me of these Russians , who claim there should have been an all-empire/all-union referendum on whether or not Estonia should have become independendent or not.\\n\\nEvery village is outvoted as well as every person . Its the flaw of democracy , not everybody can be happy . As long as they have their local governance though , it is fair . \\n\\n & gt ; Have you considered Catalonia wants to be treated as an equal among European nations , not as a regional subject of Spain ? \\n\\nFor me its much more important to identify whether leaving or not would be better for them . What they vote is their business . I just think the question of \ '' should we\ '' needs to be raised in stead of silencing it with stuff like \ '' they have the right to be independent\ '' , everybody does , it does not mean its the right thing to do , though .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"To me if you need to force the people to speak a language in order to preserve it then you need to question whether or not it should exist . \\n\\nI cant speak for the middle two points because I dont know enough about them , but if Catalonia gains independence and loses EU membership the economic consequences will be overwhelming , destroying lives , businesses and industries .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"The EU has stated that leaving Spain would mean they would leave the EU . Not to mention the high possibility of Spain being spiteful and vetoing their entry for a long time . 10 years , I think is a reasonable amount of time . The government has to be formed with the whole administration , new foreign relations with the EU , then the EU needs to make sure that Catalonia answers to all requirements for joining , etc . Its a long process . \\n \\n & gt ; To be an independent country , duh\\n\\nNot independent , different . They already are independent . Nobody is discriminating against them , nobody has enslaved them , they have all the rights , can vote in elections can be elected to represent the people . Its not more independence than the UK \ '' gaining independence\ '' from leaving the EU . Its populist crap.\\n\\n & gt ; Necessity & gt ; complexity\\n\\nWhat necessity ? \\n\\n & gt ; Plus , the same empty argument could be said about every change on the world map.\\n\\nNot really .

I just dont understand why every time we talk about Crimea there needs to be someone who starts talking about the US invasion of Iraq that started 2004 . Nobody is criticising Russia for what they did in Chechnya in 1999 . \\n\\nAnother reason I am tired of hearing all these arguments against Russian criticism is because they are word for word with what Russia has been mind-washing its citizens through propaganda- \ '' The West are actually the bad guys , Russia is just the nice guy who is trapped in the corner and unfairly ganged up on by the evil euros.\ '' Every time we criticise Russia there isnt even an attempt to justify what Russia is doing it straight up goes to \ '' But what about Kosovo , Iraq , etc.\ '' \\n\\nWhat also never helps is that Russia seemingly doesn\\'t care for collateral damage .

A country that doesnt see peace as a priority and brain washes its citizens so they match Putin\\ 's foreign affair aspirations . \\n\\nAt this moment improving relations with Russia would mean requesting the EU remove sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea , ordering a new power plant from Russia when we already know that because of our small political power they will abuse us and price us to hell which is seen in the price of natural gas they offer- [ I think only Poland pays more than us in the EU compared to the UK which pays a fraction of the price and are much farther away than us ] ( http : //gdb.rferl.org/3DFD9930-33D5-4420-8805-7D9A0C7AE6ED_mw1024_mh1024_s.png ) . \\n\\nI am for having better relations with Russia but they need to do the first steps- Removing their soldiers from Crimea , Georgia , Eastern Ukraine .

Israel appeared out of thin air in such an illegal way that it still has unyielding enemies 70 years later and there is no end in sight to that hostility . \\n\\n2 .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Well that is a valid argument though you phrased it kind of like you don\\'t value their lives . But it is true that the rescues are driving more people to go for it but Italy and the EU don\\'t want to let those first people die as well . It is a pretty difficult situation it is not as simple as \ '' let them drown\ '' unfortunately .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Its not different in Bulgaria unfortunately . Remember what people were saying about Plevneliev or why people voted for Radev ? Most Bulgarians see Trump and Putin as the \ '' real leaders\ '' and people like Trudeau and Plevneliev as weak ones .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Bulgaria has only to gain from wavering public support for Russia .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,That sounds like a precedent for Erdogan to be jailed for 30 consecutive life sentences .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Maybe OP used r/Germany and not r/de .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,WW2 is hardly local news .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"You are the ones trying to prove to me that you are tolerant by saying \ '' look weve got Muslims already\ '' which is the equivalent of saying \ '' Im not racist , look I had a black friend in kindergarten\ '' . The reality is that Poland is extremely Islamophobic , if it wasnt you wouldnt be creating an international crisis over *nothing* because 4k migrants even when not compared to the million Ukrainians is *not news worthy* if it wasnt a matter of religious xenophobia .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,All the profit with non of the commitment .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,You know it is funny how the people the farthest away from terrorism and migrants are the most paranoid in all the polls and statistics .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,I am an anti-patriot . I believe that patriotism only serves to separate us and it also blinds people in having an accurate understanding of their country .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,r/iamverysmart much,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"They do , preferably at the local bar .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"A federal system doesnt deal with governance . It deals with bigger issues that affect us all as they are interconnected where having 1 system instead of 27 is beneficial . We are talking about Military , Foreign affairs , Trade , etc . Nobody wants to take away more it would be impractical and impossible there arent enough resources to do anything but the most necessary in Brussels .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Just the central government would have more power over the things that influence the whole union like military , finance , etc . and be more streamline with things like foreign relations and politics . The local government will keep most of its power like you wont be governed by Brussels that would be impossible . You will still elect your officials and they will still be the ones that represent you .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,We are not talking about becoming a common country but a federal system . You will remain Czech living in Czechia . The only thing that will change is more standardisation in laws and policies across the EU .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Not at all especially for countries like ours .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Anything that is happening or has happened in Poland is r/europe material .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,A separated Europe wont matter to the world in 50 years when Germany can barely keep up with the developing countries that will have 10 times the population .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"They are a country with a 300k population with an economy the size of Kosovo . They will have no influence over what happens to Europe , they will have no choice but to \ '' go with the flow\ '' and like Switzerland in WW2 their only saving grace would be that the Allies ( EU ) will save them from the bad guys in the world in a war that may not even involve soldiers but influence and political power .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I am not worried about inter-European ( excluding Russia and its neighbours ) issues in the coming century though I am certain that the status quo of friendliness will violently change in the future expedited by events like NATO and/or EU breaking up if they were to happen . But the threat I see in this century is from the outside . Like Russia or China or many of the developing countries with massive populations that just need to get an economy going to completely blast past any individual European country like Nigeria , Brasil , Indonesia , India , etc . Some of these sound laughable but lets not forget where China was not 60 not 50 but even 40 years ago . And I think that is a valid thread to peace and independence in Europe .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Magically gain the power to actually do something . The EU project is flawed because it has too many obstacles in doing anything . And people say it should have less power because of it . Oh the irony .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Aye but nobody is talking about reforming and fixing the EU . Only of dismembering it and reducing it to just an economic union .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,That is actually good for the decaying Eastern Europe . Shitty thing is that most of them lack basic education which renders them on the same level as gypsies . Another demographic we cant assimilate and make productive .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Do you really need a source for migrants rioting over not getting whatever they want ? Just check out the front page of r/Europe .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Decaying population wise : ) .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,But the advantage is that the waste can be controlled and gathered up and stored away from the environment ( if done properly of course ) . Cant do that with Coal .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Yeah and why I said \ '' in the present\ '' . I don\\'t think the technology for efficient storage of such quantities is here yet but Tesla is doing miracles in that field so who knows what we will have in 5 years .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Imo Alexander the Great is as much related to the modern nation of Greece as Spartacus is to Bulgaria .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"I like how you put the UK with Iceland because by the end of the century both countries will be insignificant islands somewhere to the east compared to the ones who will actually have a shot at seizing any such opportunity like the EU , China , India .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Because it makes me feel like less of an individual and more like an ant in a colony . It is just unreasonable to me to be proud of something you didnt contribute to , or because I was born .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,Good point .,Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
