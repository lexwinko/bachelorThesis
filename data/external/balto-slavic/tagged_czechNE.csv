3w4v,Freethought,"Disease deaths matter ? Between 50 and 60 million people die every year , according to the WHO . Only around 9 % of those deaths are related to injuries of any kind , most commonly in automotive accidents . The rest are disease related . In 2012 , for example , 68 % of worldwide deaths were caused by non-communicable disease , and 23 % by communicable disease . Both categories include large proportions of preventable cases . The most common communicable disease deaths were respiratory , HIV-related , and diarrheal , which could be reduced by vaccinations , contraceptive availability and education , and water treatment . Many noncommunicable diseases were related to tobacco and alcohol abuse , as well as poor diet . All of these could be addressed by public education and commodity taxation programs . By focusing on violent deaths , you draw attention away from effective , moderate cost ways of saving far more net lives . **EDIT : ** Evidently I should spell this out : by parroting exactly the same faulty line of logic , I thought it would become more obvious _why_ it 's a faulty line of reasoning ( `` By focusing your attention on stray animals you 're drawing attention away from homeless people ! `` , `` Why do you insist on advocating for the arts when people are starving ?

This more than anything will keep you motivated when you are using online resources - by themselves , online tools are n't enough for a lot of people . If you have a little extra money , paying a tutor for weekly lessons might help with motivation too ( partially because the financial commitment tends to be a good motivator ) , but it is n't strictly necessary .

3w4v,changemyview,"You suggest that taxpayers should not pay to alleviate the inconvenience to a party whose case , while failing the test necessary for a conviction , leaves no significant room for doubt of their guilt . It seems morally repugnant to help such a person - why should the taxpayer pay a probable criminal for their inconvenience ? However , there are a some obvious corollary cases that you do n't mention . What about a case where reasonable suspicion is established at arrest , but in trial innocence is determined beyond a reasonable doubt ? If you assert that an individual is undeserving of compensation because , although there was n't enough evidence for a conviction , it can be rationally believed that guilt is very likely , then what of the certainly innocent ? What about the probably innocent ? Why is it also acceptable to inconvenience them ? If you frame the problem not by individual cases , but statistically over many cases , could facts from this perspective sway your opinion one way or the other ? If the statistics showed that 9000 out of 10000 people acquitted were determined to be more likely innocent than not , would that be enough that you 'd be comfortable awarding them all compensation ? 9500 ? 7000 ? 2000 ? Another angle . You are given four proposals : that the state provide 1 ) no compensation in the case of reasonable suspicion at time of arrest ; 2 ) compensation equivalent the pay given jurors ; 3 ) a flat compensation per day tied to the minimum living wage that year , regardless of income ; and 4 ) a tax rebate as compensation . Would you consider only the first of these fair ? Would you suggest a fifth alternative ? Yet another consideration : suppose a person is either actually innocent or actually guilty of a concrete crime . You only know how likely a person is to fall into one of these categories . Do you feel comfortable inconveniencing a person , perhaps significantly , when your certainty is n't very high because it 's cheaper to do so ? What about discrepancies in who bears the burden of accusation ? It 's easy to demonstrate that some races bear much more of the burden than others , for example , as do certain socio-economic classes . Given that the burden is significantly unevenly borne by some , is fulfilling a social contract for order really a good enough justification ?

3w4v,ShittyPoetry,"I ’ d been talking with people I didn ’ t know In the park the other day , Chatting it up by a Redwood grove . The sky was solid gray , And we were talking about all the ways The world could be better . One woman said , “ It gets complicated , “ Taking value at its face . “ You ’ d think value was something obvious , ” Her hands were all over the place . She gestured left , then right , then left , And with frustration in her face , She sighed , “ The obvious “ Is the source of all confusion. ” Later that day , I was walking around By the pen where they keep the Bison And struck up with a rough looking man Built like Mike Tyson With a scar right down his neck , But a disarming grin . “ If you take all the little things that pile up around , “ Each little things weighs nothing at all , ” Like grains of sand ? “ Yeah , but take “ Every grain of sand on the beach in your hand , “ And you ’ ve got a problem. ” We shot shit for a good long while , Until that gray turned into graphite , And we said goodbye and walked away Into the almost night . I shivered . Left my coat somewhere , But damn , I couldn ’ t remember . Then I ran into this dude who smelled Like a broken sewer main . He offered his coat and asked for a buck , I said no , but all the same We got to talking , and for a while It felt like eternity went by . But before I escaped something happened , And his visage grew profound , Like his dirty hair was glowing From the inner peace he ’ d found , and then I remembered something dumb I had done Just a couple hours back , And in the darkening night , Not feeling quite right , I tried to stumble back To the place that I ’ d come from , But I couldn ’ t remember .

Still don ’ t know how I got back here Or what else that prophet said . I know that trip was worth it , But the message isn ’ t clear . Good thing at least some images Didn ’ t disappear .

And I 'm a classifier , and a critic , and scientist - That 's why I ’ ve put in verse a mostly rhyming taxonomic list Of all the different ways in which a poem can be terrible , And as I share these ways with you I hope it will be bearable Because , in making such a list , I may have inadvertently Created an example of a terrible soliloquy . Now , to the strictest pedant , all the ways there are are very few , Since they would say that anything is bad if you believe that ’ s true . But if we all can just agree that mode of thought ’ s erroneous We can be less postmodern and considerably less onerous . The first flaw that I can ’ t abide is formal inconsistency , Which demonstrates no forethought , or no technical ability . Sure , poems can be good and have a Leaves-of-Grass-like laxity But usually it ’ s laziness , and not poetic strategy . Now , meter - that ’ s another thing about which I ’ m a strident prude . To mix an iamb with a trochee strikes me as extremely rude ! When poets flub the rhythm like a junior high school marching band I think they should be shot , or sent a sternly worded reprimand . And why is so much poetry so bland and unoriginal ? These heartfelt bleeding notes are often trite , clichéd and pitiful . Why must there be so many little replicas of Kanye West ?

3w4v,linguistics,"Lojban is not what you imagine . The language is alien in the sense that it 's grammar is n't based on that of existing languages , but the grammar is both regular ( no exceptions ) and simple ( not many rules ) . The vocabulary is drawn from `` Mandarin , English , Russian , Hindi , Spanish , and Arabic , weighted according to the numbers of speakers , and using a phoneme-matching algorithm to assign words with the highest figures of merit relative to the six languages. '' [ [ source ] ] ( https : //mw.lojban.org/papri/me_lu_ju'i_lobypli_li'u_14_moi ) . This has the effect of making speakers of those languages , Mandarin and English especially , recognize many of the words once they get a hang of the phonetic rules . It 's also not too hard to pronounce by design . Lojban has 6 vowels and 17 consonants , picked to be distinct and allowing for some phonemic variation so people coming from different primary languages wo n't have a hard time pronouncing the words . Lojban has many interesting features that are n't very robotic . Emotion particles come to mind - simple words you can add to a sentence to let people know how you feel or how you feel about something . Another is evidential indicators , which let you concisely explain how you know something ; this lets you easily distinguish between knowing something from personal experience , vaguely remembering something , knowing something second-hand , or knowing something without evidence but with conviction .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alternative , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ? Human nature is that we tend to arrive at positions and then justify them after the fact , so it 's at least worth exploring if discomfort with the topic , rather than a utilitarian assessment , led to your original criticism .

3w4v,haskell,"I 'm a little surprised no one has mentioned Go . At OSCON this year I heard about quite a few companies that were happy with Go for large projects . Praise included the relatively small language size , ease in training new hires , good community , and excellent selection of libraries . I think it would meet all of your requirements . I 'll second Rust , but it 's a new and immature language - the community is great , but libraries are n't comprehensive yet , and idioms in the language are likely to change significantly over the next few years . It also does n't have as much industry use yet . Python is another solid , pragmatic choice , and it may serve you particularly well depending on your interests . Look at popular Python libraries and see if any of them catch your eye . It also has the best language learning resources of the three , so that 's a major plus . **EDIT : ** To keep things to the point , my number one recommendation for the original poster is Python based on their interests , professional utility , and availability of learning resources . But since there was such an ambivalent reaction to Go here ( with respect to voting - the comments have been more \*ahem\* _uniform_ ) I think a few things need to be said . Firstly , all of the criticisms made here are valid _on the level at which they criticize the language_ . But the comments , in my opinion , largely miss the point on other levels . Go might be good language to learn for a person who has only been seriously programming for nine months _and_ only deeply exposed to Haskell for several reasons . It 's important to understand that the Haskell community is an echo chamber for certain - correct , according to us - points of view . As an aspiring programmer , it 's worthwhile to be exposed to communities with different points of view and different priorities , and we should put at least some trust in the ability of a student to eventually , with experience , form their own informed opinions . Another pedagogical point : our concerns as more experienced programmers are not all the same as those of someone who has only really been programming for less than a year . Comments like `` There 's nothing you would learn from Go '' lack perspective ; the familiar ideas Go contains are the best ideas from several generations of languages , and for a new learner some of those ideas are still unfamiliar . And the specification of the language is short , which is another big win for a learner . Then there 's the straightforward tooling and a set of solid open source projects to look to for for architectural guidance . Remember , this is the _second_ language OP might be learning , not the last . You can move from Go to C easily , or with Go and Haskell you can pick up Python as the third language , or C # , or C++ ... as a student , half a year of Go programming might lead to a better jumping-off point career-wise and intellectually than many of you are acknowledging .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,UkrainianConflict,"Much of your summary is accurate : the only part I 'd contest is the `` two sides '' narrative . People in Ukraine have a wide range of views , but most have an ambivalent , stability above all perspective . A pro-EU , West-leaning bent prevails in the intellectual class , while rose-tinted nostalgia for the Soviet past is more common in ethnic Russian enclaves and the economically declining Eastern regions of the country - the two sides narrative has its roots in these biases . But a highly polarized , two-sided model of popular opinion , common as it may be in media representations , does n't match this reality very well .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,skeptic,"There are a few words in in this conversation that are confusing readers . To understand why I 'd reject what you say , we need to be clear about what you 're claiming and what I reject , so let 's work from those confusing words . & amp ; nbsp ; The first confusing word is _science_ , which is confusing because it 's polysemous . _Science_ in the current context may reasonably refer to : 1 . The _scientific method_ - A set of iterative , observation-based techniques for acquiring and updating beliefs ; 2 . _Scientific practice_ - The activities scientists actually engage in to arrive at beliefs , usually ( but not always ) by application of the scientific method ; 3 . _Scientific knowledge_ - The body of beliefs generally accepted by the scientific community , usually ( but not always ) arrived at by scientific practice . Scientific knowledge _is_ a set of beliefs . But , to pin the conversation down , we seem to be talking about the scientific method . & amp ; nbsp ; The second confusion occurs between a pair of similar verbs , _to believe_ and _to believe in_ . The verbs _to believe_ and _to believe in_ are used to convey different meanings . Commonly ( unfortunately , not consistently ) : - _To believe_ refers to a truth value judgement ( _I believe the mailman 's name is Frank_ ) . - _To believe in_ may refer to a higher-order belief , that is , a belief about a belief . This `` believing in '' can get complicated and often conceals some vagueness when you think about it more carefully . ( _I believe in the power of love , _ but usually not _I believe in the mailman , Frank._ ) There are people that _believe in_ the scientific method in the same nebulous sense that people _believe in_ karma or a higher purpose or the power of love . However , it is sufficient to believe that the scientific method satisfies certain information gathering properties ( properties that , not coincidentally , are falsifiable ) for a rational person to continue using and propagating the scientific method . No `` believing in '' is necessary at this level , except insofar as it is implied by believing that the scientific method has certain well specified properties . There are beliefs that are so fundamental as to be axiomatic ( `` I exist '' , `` there exists a fundamental reality '' , `` I have some information-preserving relationship with that fundamental reality '' , `` fundamental reality has non-random structure '' ) . There is no logical basis for truth-value determination of these `` reality axioms . '' There 's no way to test them , even in principle . Arguably , metaphysical naturalists _believe in_ these axioms as well as believing them . But these beliefs are lower-level than science in any of its senses . & amp ; nbsp ; The last confusion is around the phrase _a matter of faith_ . The classification _a matter of faith_ is being used to establish an equivalence between beliefs which I do n't think is justified , or perhaps is too vaguely specified . Stepping back to low-level beliefs , I 'd argue that accepting the reality axioms is n't a matter of faith - at least , not in the same sense that accepting divine revelation is a matter of faith ( I assume belief in divine revelation is a belief that mental forces , not reducible to natural forces and elementary particles , exist and do communicate with people to inform their beliefs about reality , and that this information is reliable in some sense ) . When I accept the reality axioms , there are different processes going on than what go on when I accept divine revelation . Defining _a matter of faith_ to include both not only stretches common usage , it also leaves a big bag of interesting processes that contribute to the acceptance of esoteric and religious beliefs either undescribed , or implies those processes are happening where they are n't . And that brings us back to the scientific method : the information-gathering efficacy of the scientific method is a consequence of these more fundamental reality axioms holding . So it 's not a matter of faith either , or even a consequence of faith . It follows from the derivability of the scientific method from the reality axioms that coherent rejections of the scientific method necessarily either involve rejecting some of those reality axioms , which can get weird , or adding new axioms , which is problematic for a slew of reasons . I 'm glossing over these arguments , but I think you get the picture . & amp ; nbsp ; I have n't presented a full argument , but I think this makes it clear what an argument against classifying the trustworthiness of the scientific method and the trustworthiness of divine revelation as both being matters of faith looks like . Ultimately , the conditions under which they both are matters of faith requires making `` faith '' mean something other than what `` faith '' is generally understood to mean or usefully defined as . There is something going on in accepting the axioms of reality , but it needs to be described separately . It is n't the same class of phenomenon .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

3w4v,nonmonogamy,"Just warning you that I have analytical tendencies . That said , here 's how I would approach your issue if it were me : **TL ; DR** You should n't feel bad because you are asking for help with a problem . That 's normal and fine and okay ! Keeping your problem , your desired outcome , and proposed solution separate in your discussion will probably make things clearer to you . By involving your partner in the discussion , you 'll feel less guilt because you wo n't be prescribing a course of action but collaborating on the health of you and your relationship . Describe your problem and desired outcome first , and let your partner suggest a solution before you suggest yours in order to get a less pre-filtered opinion and gauge his feelings . Decide what to do after that . But definitely do n't feel guilty for asking him to participate . **Long Version** You have a problem , a causal hypothesis , and a proposed solution . You also have an implied desired outcome . The thing you seem to feel guilty about is the solution part . Some or all of this analysis may seem obvious . If so , great . & gt ; I 've been really struggling with my fear and anxiety about being left behind or abandoned [ ... ] Your problem is that you are experiencing abandonment anxiety , or , to be specific , the symptoms you are bundling under this label . This is the first thing you should discuss with your partner and his wife , if you have n't already . You also have a desired outcome , which you stated as `` build [ ing ] our foundation stronger '' , but that 's more of a solution . Your real desired outcome is to experience less anxiety . & gt ; [ ... ] which is connected to an anxiety problem and a recent dip in mental health . You attribute that anxiety to two factors . The first is a change in your underlying mental health , which implies that you have experienced/are experiencing other symptoms that suggest this is the case . Your intuition about this is probably right . I 'm assuming that you are taking steps to work on this issue on your own . The second is a change in the relationship dynamic . It 's a safe bet that your abandonment issues are linked to this . However , it may be worth exploring exactly what changes have happened - is it just that he 's dating , or have other habits changed as well ? You also believe this change is a problem _because of_ the first issue . Although this seems like a reasonable assumption , it 's not the only possibility . How true this is may influence how effective a given solution is for you . In any case , you should always be sceptical of your assumptions about hidden causes , and focus more on observed effects . When evaluating solutions , a solution that will work _without assuming a cause_ is more robust . & gt ; I wanted to ask him to for a month , at most , to not pursue any new romantic relationships [ ... ] so I can examine what is bothering me and work on healthy techniques for being both a good girlfriend and a good participant in a poly relationship . This is your proposed solution ( I 'm sure you have a lot of details here you 're leaving out ) . You probably feel guilty because your solution involves a restriction on your partner , and you might be forcing or manipulating your partner into doing something he is n't comfortable with . I think you can feel less guilty by viewing this not as a final and inflexible prescription , but as a possible solution you thought up that might help you . You do n't have to feel guilty about trying to solve your problem ! You also should keep in mind that you have to trust in your partner 's agency . As long as your request is a request and not an ultimatum , your partner deserves to be able to choose to help you in this way . However , it is problematic that you are framing the conversation as the acceptance or rejection of a fully-formed proposal . Although your solution seems reasonable , the sort of solution you might come to after a discussion with your partner , it is n't the only solution . You need feedback from your partner before you can know what parameters to flex , or even if it your proposal makes sense . Maybe allow your partner ( maybe his wife too ) to propose solutions himself before you prime him with your own . Maybe his proposal will be similar to yours . Maybe it 'll be something you had n't considered . In any case , it will help you take his feelings into account . Notice the assumptions your proposal makes , though , and weigh this idea against other options that are slightly or very different . If you think you 've already done this , do it again anyway - cognitive researchers have documented that subjects almost always attach themselves to the first solution they come up with and justify its merits after the fact , so you have to spend at least some effort in trying to correct for that tendency . What are you asking him to stop doing _exactly_ ? Date , or date without your involvement ? Is there some other behavior change on his or your part that would also help ? Why a month at most ? Is it because you 're making some assumptions about his needs and feelings ? Do you already know what steps you 'll take to work on yourself and think that 's the amount of time you need ? Have you explored options that might feel uncomfortable , like breaking up and being on your own for a while ( remember , you do n't actually have to _do_ things just because you think about them ) ? Also take time to explore different rough outcomes of that month ( or whatever time period ) - your problem improves a lot , it improves a little , it stays the same , it gets worse - and what that would mean your next steps would be . It may lead you to change your strategy . Maybe `` that thing I 'd do next '' is what you should start with in the first place .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

I see the big hype fizzling in less than a decade before its life as usual , with the exception of better funding for astronomy programs . Major religions would adopt official stances on alien intelligence , many opting for flat denial , and otherwise remain unchanged except for a few new cults . Suppose the data could be interpreted as something intriguing , however - images or sound files showing aliens and their culture . Everything is much more unstable in such a case , but in some ways it would look similar . Religious opinions could be much more divisive , since denial would be a more radical and visible stance .

Pick a few catchy things to establish location , people waiting , police officers , you guys if need be , and then get on with the show . Next time you go and film an event , try and put some more effort into the interviews . Prepare questions before hand and ask questions as they come to mind . Interview each other and interview strangers both before and after the event . You can even do audio only interviews with a digital audio recorder and use that material over the footage . On that note , the audio of the event itself is probably more interesting than the music you picked . The in-camera mic is n't that great , especially in windy conditions , but even an inexpensive audio recorder with a sock will give you usable audio . Speaking of the music , you do n't need to be such a slave to the music in your editing . The footage is what 's interesting . Maybe pick shorter clips of music , mixed in with the original audio , so that you do n't feel the film has to be the same length as the track , or ditch the music entirely .

The NSA should change its policy for several reasons . One of them mentioned in the petition ( which by the way had an 800 character limit ) is that the release of these theorems and algorithms benefits academia and industry . Another argument is that broad classification is *bad* for national security . Those for which an application has not been found are especially ripe for exploration in the open sphere - and the argument that they should all be automatically labelled dangerous until proven harmless is itself dangerous . Duplicate discoveries by the agencies of other governments , also kept secret , may put our government and industry at risk for cryptographic attack . Transparency on cryptographic vulnerabilities ultimately leads to higher security . Another argument is that the NSA is losing some potential talent because there is no guarantee of recognition outside the agency . That 's not everything , and there are compelling arguments from the other side . But it is my ultimate belief that some moderate change in policy is good for national security , industry , and the scientific endeavour , and that it currently is n't on the agenda because the public does n't think about these issues very much and math does n't tend to capture the public imagination often more than anything else .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Think of this tutor in the same way you would a dance or music instructor , who can guide your child in different directions and develop ideas at her pace . Since there are n't likely to be many people experienced in this kind of role , find a math , computer science , physics , or economics graduate student at a nearby university who will be around for a few years and who seems like she/he would be a good tutor . * Do n't repeatedly tell her she 's smart or clever ! Encourage her love of math and tell her you 're proud of her when she does hard work on something , even if she does n't succeed .

All of these things can be different and contradictory , and to make sense of it all we either need rigorous definitions - in which case we are using a version of the language different from ordinary usage - or we need `` common sense '' , which is far from a rigorous or absolute quality .

Another economic crisis catapults a radicalized Svoboda and a new ultra-right party from the industrial , Russian speaking East to take over from Party of Regions dominance and create a new dichotomous party system . Svoboda pushes for a 'purely Ukrainian Ukraine ' policy that more aggressively targets the Ukrainian central dialects ( Surzhik ) for extinction and tries to place anti-Russian language laws on the books throughout the country . Russian language books are burned in some places . The attacks are clearly on not only the Russian language but also Russian ethnicity . The new right party moves for Eastern succession . Let the West rot in Europe - Crimea and the East will become their own state , possibly vying for annexation by the Russian Federation . In the East Ukrainian language textbooks are thrown out of school windows in retaliation . Meanwhile the economic crisis worsens , and as each side blames the other secession by the East and South becomes a serious political platform . At the same time pro-EU sentiments grow and lead to an election cycle dominated by right-wing Western politicians . In retaliation to the election , Crimea holds it 's own internal election and votes to secede , declaring Crimea a fully autonomous republic allied with Russia . Eastern attempts at secession are more mixed , and lead to skirmishes and conflicts . Local terrorism targets Ukranian law enforcement being ported form the West to `` keep the peace '' in the Eastern oblasts . With Crimea no longer voting , the votes swing to the West . The violence in the East mostly calms , but Ukrainian national identity is deeply wounded . Unlikely scenario , but I reached to make it happen .

He was freaking out that he was almost 50 and was the only one out of his siblings without a family . My favorite part of this story is that he said the last straw before he turned to `` dating magazines '' was when he went to a dance for singles and had to escape out of a bathroom window from a very agressive gay man . So he sent letters to all the women he was interested in and then planned his trip to meet all of them in their respective countries . The woman before he met my mom actually tried to trap him in a room when she found out there were other girls he was planning to see . I 'm glad he kept going after that because he went on to meet my mom in The Philippines . They had a connection and began dating until he brought her back to the states and got married . & gt ; & gt ; Reviewing this story now I ca n't believe I did n't think it was a mail order bride thing , for years I would deny it by saying it was a dating magazine .

It is n't , so what exactly is the point of telling us it is ? * An homage to the movie , probably the only thing it has in common . & gt ; *Tedious . That 's the word I 'd use to describe what I 've seen so far . There 's clearly some good actors on display and the storyline is alright , but for some reason I 've found the episodes so dull and slow-moving that I 've found myself zoning out and having to rewind and watch again . * Then it 's clearly not for you , I love slow pacing shows and movies . There are many fast shows and sitcoms that could be suited for you . & gt ; *Characters . The characters in the movie were brilliantly written , perfectly executed and , unlike the TV series , entirely convincing . The Coen brother 's characters suck you into the movie and deliver the perfect blend of charm , sympathy , quirkiness and darkness . The characters in the TV show are very uninteresting , with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton 's character . I feel nothing for the others . The female cop in the movie was exquisite , the female cop in the TV show is so dull I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow . The rest of the characters do n't convince me at all . I could n't care less if they all went through a woodchipper in the next episode . * You absolutely misread everything about the characters both in the movie and TV show . Just saying that the characters on the TV show are not brilliant written goes beyond me as all the main characters undergo grade A character development . & gt ; *I feel nothing for the others* & gt ; *I 've been praying for somebody to bury her under snow* You 've just contradicted yourself , you clearly do feel something for at least one character other than Billy 's . & gt ; *Hitmen . Look at this picture [ 1 ] . The top picture shows the hit men/kidnappers in Fargo the movie . They 're eerie , sleazy , menacing men who 's clumsiness gets them into to oddly hilarious situations . But the main thing is they 're convincing . They look exactly like the type of creeps who 'd offer to kidnaps someones wife or shoot someone for the right money , and then completely mess it up . Now , the hit men in the TV show do n't have any of this . First of all , one of them is deaf . Who the fuck is stupid enough to create a deaf hit man ? Think about it , he ca n't even hear himself , how 's he going to creep up on anyone ? How 's he going to know the police are on him if he ca n't hear sirens ? And the one in the beard is possibly the least convincing portrayal of a hit man I 've ever witnessed . He looks like a starbucks-drinking hipster who 'd have trouble fighting sleep , let alone killing anyone . I 'd laugh my head off if he 'd been sent to kill me . Pathetic . * That 's just a silly argument . You ca n't see into people 's heads , I bet you personally know many nice-looking people that do all kinds of nasty shit you do n't know about . And again , here 's your personal preference projecting . If you want to see something really realistic , why do n't you watch a documentary ? & gt ; *The whole Hess family . The Sam Hess character , worst acting ever ? The kids are just fucking irritating . Not funny , not smart , not clever , just cringeworthy and irritating . The wife 's character is such a cliché it 's embarrassing . * It seemed pretty solid to me and clichés exist for a reason .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

Akaforty,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Well it 's not exactly like I can work around the ME-25 to get the guitar tones of Foo Fighters or Queens of the Stone Age . The ME-25 does n't have any good preamps and when I was recording , I just stuck to bypassing and recording the raw guitar input , since applying anything from ME-25 only decreased the overall quality.Although there are some effects that do n't affect the final quality , it all seemed detrimental to me . I did some tracks ( they 're on soundcloud ) where I liked the tones , but it 's usually only compensating for something else . If I record guitars as background instruments , it works , but I want to record guitar-driven music and it 's a disaster . I thought I tried everything , I think the quality simply lacks on a multi-effect pedal . Since I ca n't record what I mean right now , I 'll try to describe my problem to you with words . When I record my guitar directly , it sounds very bland , one-dimensional and boring . This is very different to what the actual tone of the guitar is , when played on an amp . It does have that full , jazzy Les-Paul tone with great bass and just the right amount of mids and heights . This does not show on the recordings in any way and you can obviously hear the low quality of recording , even though I 'm recording at the highest setting possible on ME-25 . I just do n't think it 's possible to get rid of this plastic , artificial sound without moving on to a recording my amp with a microphone .",Balto-Slavic,Czech
