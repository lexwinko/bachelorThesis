08TangoDown08,ireland,THEY TOOK OUR JERBS !,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't think that Ireland refusing the invitation will have any tangible effect at all , beyond hardening Trump 's position towards the Irish government . I think the best approach is to go there and confront him about it , and to also appeal to the Irish Americans to put pressure on him . The Irish American lobby is still extremely powerful in the USA .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"This is a stupid idea , though . I abhor what Trump is doing but you ca n't expect to change how he thinks by ignoring him and pretending he is n't there . A better response is to go to Washington with the shamrocks as usual , and confront him about his Muslim ban . Or even better - make a speech in America to the Irish Americans denouncing it . The problem , as far as I can see it , is that Enda Kenny wo n't have the stones to do that . Either way , I do n't see how either side would benefit from snubbing Trump like this . When has he ever responded favourably , or even gracefully , to an insult ? Will it seriously make a difference or will it only create an unnecessary division between the US government and the Irish government without changing the US governments ' position one iota ?",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,pcgaming,To be honest I find that a refreshing change . We do n't need to be drip fed every little thing about the game 's current status .,Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; No . Cuba went from being one of the wealthiest Caribbean nations ( and no , Batista was not a nice person ) to a pretty mediocre one . Might have something to do with one of the most powerful countries in the world setting up a total blockade around the entirety of Cuba too . I 'm sure Castro 's communism was n't the only factor .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Well , what would 4/4 's of the way up the scale look like ? Driving Mad Max 's car with your feet while drunk and hanging out of a window ? And when does it become `` dangerous '' driving instead of careless ?",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"His car had no tax or insurance , and he also did n't have a license . He was drunk and travelling at 165km/h in an area with a 100km/h speed limit . Seems like it should be pretty high on that scale to me . And that 's before you take into consideration that the man clearly does n't give a fuck how he drives on the roads when he has 280 previous driving offences .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; To be fair , what he was saying was fairly qualified , that a mild form of torture is justifiable in certain situations ( nuclear bomb about to destroy a major city etc . ) This is wrong , though . The only thing that history has taught us about torture is that when you torture somebody , they 're likely to tell you whatever it is you want to hear , regardless of whether it 's true or not , just to end the torture . Take your nuclear bomb analogy as an example . Imagine that some government ( we 'll say the US for the sake of argument ) is torturing someone who they think may know which city is about to be targeted and when - and the man eventually has enough and tells them that the bomb will land in San Francisco at 4pm . So the US military evacuates everyone they can from San Francisco and they scramble their air force to cover the skies over it . 4pm comes , and nothing happens in San Francisco . Instead , a nuclear bomb lands in Boston at 6pm and nobody 's been evacuated .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,northernireland,"War is n't a status , it 's a word .

I live quite close to Derry and I have never heard anyone I 've ever met refer to it as Derry/Londonderry , never . In my entire life . To be honest , I could probably count on one hand the number of people I 've met who even call it Londonderry - even among Protestants it 's usually just called Derry .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The Iraq war was illegal according to the Secretary-General of the UN at the time . Chilcot stopped short of saying it was illegal but they did say that the legal basis for it was almost non existent , and that Saddam Hussein posed no significant threat to Britain or the USA - contrary to what we were being told by both governments at the time , when they were trying to gain international support for it . Also , did n't the British Attorney General think that such a war would be illegal at the time ?",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,northernireland,& gt ; Wiki is both hilarious and sad in equal measure describing Troubles incidents in their 'war ' format . If it was n't a war then what was it ?,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It 's not a joke , sadly . As someone from Donegal , if someone were speaking Ulster-Scots next to me , I would understand what they 're saying pretty easily - despite never having learned it myself . It 's a dialect , not a language . The Loyalist community feels insecure because Irish communities have the Irish language as part of their identity and they want something of their own . It 's a shame really . The Irish language should n't be an orange and green issue - it was spoken throughout the entire island at one time . It was spoken in Scotland too , where a lot of Protestant settlers came from .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,northernireland,"I doubt it would be any different , really . It would still be a power sharing executive so the DUP would still need to play their part in it - this means they get a veto on any policies they do n't like . Which is a shame if you 're someone who 's not a straight white protestant male .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I feel sorry for the people who voted to remain because they 're being dragged kicking and screaming out of the EU by people who were being so wilfully ignorant of the consequences of what they were voting for , that they ignored everyone who told them that there would be any . I do n't feel sorry for the people who refused to listen to economists , international leaders and business leaders and instead decided that it was more important to stop letting brown people into `` their '' country . It 's not as if Britain was n't warned about the consequences - they were , often and loudly .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Yes - absolutely . If I end up with a debilitating condition like alzheimer 's I 'd rather go at a time of my choosing than have those close to me watch me deteriorate into a shell of my former self .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The vote argument does n't really hold up . We have a PR system here - a metro system in Dublin is far more likely to get votes for politicians than a train line in Donegal because , as everyone loves to point out , there are more people in Dublin . The point I 'm making is there really is n't a good reason why we ca n't have multiple infrastructure projects going on around the country at the same time . In fact , it 's a far better use of taxpayers money than a lot of other things that we 've wasted it on over the years .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; Currently there is n't even demand for an hourly bus service between the two places , a train would never make back the investment Except there pretty much is an hourly bus from Letterkenny to Derry already . I still do n't understand why everyone 's getting so hot and bothered about this - it 's not as if having a railway in Donegal suddenly means we 're going to stop funding metro north or give up on providing transport to the cities . We 're not a poor country . We should be able to provide decent transport to areas outside of our capital city - our public transport system is probably one of the most underdeveloped in the EU .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,northernireland,"There 's only one TV channel that 's entirely in Irish ( TG4 ) , and as far as I know there 's also only one radio station that 's entirely in Irish too ( RTE radio na gaeltachta ) . Sure , you 'll get snippets of it here and there in the other channels , but are people really so bitter that that would bother them ? Also , correct me if I 'm wrong but I do n't believe that an Irish language act means that Irish will become compulsory in schools in Northern Ireland .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,northernireland,"The three of those are optional . That 's how it works in the Republic , pretty much . You can still avoid the language if you want to .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,northernireland,"So , you 're seriously going to sit there and tell me that the Polish language is more culturally relevant to Northern Ireland than the Irish language ? Sober up . I do n't understand why Unionists are so fucking bitter about the Irish language . It 's a language that , historically , was spoken throughout the entire island . It was even spoken in quite a few parts of Scotland - it 's a part of your culture too .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Honestly , it 's not really them we should be blaming .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yeah I think we are . As you say , we tend to be open and friendly at the beginning but it 's a two way street .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I would n't mind if they 'd kept the statue in a museum or something but I do think removing a symbol of the empire from which we 'd just been liberated from the seat of our parliament was a good idea .

I mean sure , I 'd be having a lot of sex with my 16 wives but I do n't think he was naive enough to think he 'd be able to avoid execution by the Prince-Bishop when he inevitably took back the city ?

Without the government putting the right processes in place ( language lessons etc . ) for this then it could well be a disaster for everyone involved .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,I have no problem with them - provided that they are given the opportunity and the tools to integrate properly with everyone else . We should avoid just building ghettos and filling them with refugees .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do agree that we should be inviting them here instead of vice-versa but given the reality , I do n't agree at all that having Kenny snub the invitation is the right thing to do .

08TangoDown08,northernireland,"`` Frictionless border '' and the other jargon she 's been spouting is exactly that , jargon . It does n't actually mean anything practical . The reality is that a hard border is , right now , the most likely outcome . If the UK is intent on having a complete separation with the EU then the border between Ireland and the UK can be nothing but a `` hard '' one . Northern Ireland will be hit harder by Brexit than any other part of the UK . That 's just a fact . May and the British Government do n't give a flying fuck - no matter what they say about `` frictionless borders '' being a priority .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Well , it depends on where they plan on laying down the tracks . If it 's to link Letterkenny and Derry then I do n't think it 's a waste of money at all . As someone who lives in the area , I know for a fact that there are lots of people who commute between those areas every day for work . You 're arguing that we should n't be putting a service like this in place in a sparsely populated area like this but Letterkenny and Derry are n't exactly sparsely populated . Derry has 93000 people in it - almost as big as Limerick . Letterkenny has 22000 people - bigger than Castlebar .

08TangoDown08,Sherlock,I just do n't know what kind of show the creators want this to be anymore .

08TangoDown08,pcgaming,"It 's the open world genre done right . Too many games are just `` Open World : The Game '' with the same sorts of mechanics and the same repetitive gameplay loops .

08TangoDown08,pcgaming,Agreed . You can tell how much the devs were in love with the world they were creating because everything was fleshed out - nothing about that game was half assed .

08TangoDown08,ireland,& gt ; I 'm not sure the comparison to Lemass and Collins is a valid one . How so ? I 'd say they 're both a better comparison than Mandela . Michael Collins ordered the killing of people . The Old IRA killed plenty of innocent people and he was at the core of it . Sean Lemass was allegedly a member of Collins ' `` Twelve Apostles '' - who carried out assassinations for the IRA . He also opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty with De'Valera and he fought with the anti-treaty IRA in the civil war . He was actually second in command of the group that seized the Four Courts . The civil war was arguably a more brutal and bitter conflict than the war of independence - with both sides committing atrocities against the other . Seems a bit hypocritical to judge McGuinness for his past without judging these men too .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do . I 've lived there , lots of my family members live there and I 'm in it almost every day . It annoys me how willing people in the Republic are to just ignore the North and pretend it 's just a problem for `` up there '' and not something they need to worry about . A peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland is only a good thing for the Republic - and there are plenty of people living in the North with Irish passports . We ca n't just ignore those people .

Unionists included .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Did you consider Nelson Mandela a terrorist ? Michael Collins ? What about Sean Lemass ?

08TangoDown08,ireland,They need enough seats in the assembly .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; This idea of unionist domination is also overstating things a bit . It currently would take the two main unionist parties ( that hate one another ) + two of the three unionist independents to secure a bare majority in the assembly . & gt ; As to enforced coalitions , doing away with that would n't be the worst idea . Again with some safeguards Nobody here is saying that a unionist-dominated system is going to happen - the point is that senior figures in the DUP ( including Foster ) are suggesting a return to majority rule . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with discussing how that 's a stupid idea . & gt ; As to enforced coalitions , doing away with that would n't be the worst idea . Again with some safeguards Well yeah I think most people would want to see the North end up in a situation where enforced coalitions are n't necessary - but I do n't think you could make the argument that the North 's ready for that just yet . & gt ; But in principle the DUP could be utterly smashed in the next election and still be in government . That does n't do wonders for electoral accountability True , they might lose the office of First Minister though which would really stick in their craw .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,I 'm definitely not a fan of Bertie Ahern but I do think he has a point here ( he 's more clued in about Northern Ireland than a lot of our sitting politicians in my opinion ) .

08TangoDown08,telltale,Yeah that game needs a series 2 . It 's the best telltale game I 've played .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Well , I 'd say that 's in the hands of Northern Ireland 's electorate . Maybe the loyalist community will decide to vote for more moderate politicians . The problem is that the UUP is pretty much split on those issues as well and the TUV are tiny and probably even more reprehensible than the DUP when it comes to socially progressive policies . Even if you happen to be a moderate Loyalist , there are n't a whole lot of options for you unless you vote for the Alliance party or one of the nationalist parties , and given how power sharing works I 'm not sure how much the alliance party could achieve even if they had a significant number of mla 's .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It 's the nature of power sharing in Northern Ireland though , both sides had things that they just had to grin and bear . Most of the things you 've mentioned ( gay people 's rights & amp ; abortion ) have been things that the DUP have been staunchly opposed to since their foundation . If SF made those their red line issues then they 'd never have went into government with them to begin with and who knows where the fuck we 'd be in the North now .",Romance,Native

A world where Sherlock uses cold rationality to solve crimes or a fantasy world where people can control minds ? I 'm not trying to be an ass but I just do n't understand where the show 's going . You obviously enjoyed the episode , I did n't . For a detective show , so many things were left completely unanswered . How can Eurus control minds ? If she was building this elaborate saw-like complex in which to torment or test Sherlock and Mycroft why did she try to kill them with a motion sensitive grenade ?

Especially when they were part of the problem . The cognitive dissonance that people have on this topic is nothing short of incredible to me . Constitutional politics was the only thing that could actually bring about peace in the end - but you seem to be drastically underestimating how difficult it would have been to convert an organisation as inherently violent as the IRA to politics . Adams and McGuinness could n't just get up one morning and say `` You know what , no more violence ! From now on the IRA are political '' . The IRA would have pushed back , and both of them might well have lost any influence they had with them to begin with . It took a long time because it 's not something that can be achieved overnight . & gt ; You praise their `` achievements '' . I do n't see what they 've achieved that would n't have been achieved anyway through politics and the ECHR with far less bloodshed . As far as I can see , all they did was knock a United Ireland back another hundred years . The Troubles was a completely predictable conflict . It became inevitable because of how the orange state was set up and how the majority ( Protestants ) reacted to the pretty tame demands of a minority ( Catholics ) . They reacted with violence , violence and yet more violence . To say that we could have gone from that to a power sharing government through entirely political means is revisionism at its worst . Political methods were already attempted well before the PIRA gained support - that 's what the civil rights movement was all about . It was the reaction of the Loyalist community and the RUC to that movement that led to the growth of the PIRA and the escalation of the conflict . This also began before Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness became involved with either the IRA or Sinn Fein .",Romance,Native

No ... that 's not my narrative . Not everyone in the IRA died for equality and not all of them joined because of civil rights . I did n't say that .

The civil rights marches that started to take place in the early 70 's opposing these injustices were met with state and , in particular , Loyalist violence . In one incident , entire streets of Catholic residences were burned to the ground in Belfast by armed Loyalist gangs .

Are you disputing that Loyalist gangs burned over a thousand Catholics out of their homes in Belfast and elsewhere ? Are you disputing that the PIRA therefore gained support from the Catholic community because of the latter 's treatment at the hands of their own government ? Nelson Mandela was the leader of the violent wing of the ANC ( MK ) . This group was responsible for bombings all over South Africa . These bombings often happened in public places like shopping centres , bars , bins in public streets , and inevitably led to civilian casualties . Sound familiar ?

Both organisations were willing to use extreme violence to achieve their goals - and civilians were caught in the crossfire in both instances .

I happen to think that Brexit has made unification an inevitability . Maybe not in the immediate future but to me , it just does n't make sense to have Northern Ireland outside of the EU and the Republic inside it . Something will give , I think .

With that being said , I think that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply would have been impossible without men like Adams and McGuinness . It 's pretty hard to describe the gravity of what was achieved . The IRA went from being an organisation that was violent to the core , to laying down their weapons in ceasefire , supporting the peace process and eventually decommissioning all of their weapons under international supervision . That 's no mean feat and it must have taken a lot of strongly willed people to bring that about . McGuinness was undoubtedly one of the main men in that regard , along with Adams .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"McGuinness grew up in a sectarian statelet that viewed Catholics like him as second class citizens and who responded to their demands for civil rights with extreme violence . The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit .

Also , Irish people in the mid 10 's were n't treated as second class citizens in their own country - as was the case in Northern Ireland when the PIRA began to gain support . There was nothing glamorous about the way the `` Old '' IRA fought the war of independence either . It was bloody , it was brutal and it often led to the deaths of innocent people as well as British forces . That 's how guerrilla warfare tends to go .

If everything he 's saying about Adams is true then that would be an incredibly stupid move because it would all but confirm it to the public . The point I 'm making is that it 's an allegation made by someone we do n't know anything about apart from what you heard on that programme . You 're saying it 's dumb for people to mindlessly defend Adams and it is - but it 's also dumb to completely believe what a TV programme is saying when they 've provided scant to no evidence to back it up .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,"I 'm not sure what you want me to tell you - what you 've said is right , but the prevailing attitude at the time was that France was the biggest land power in Europe . That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Agreed . The problem with trying to portray the conflict as a simple religious conflict is that it completely oversimplifies the origins of it . The conflict was political . The Orange state was segregated - one side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of influence and power over the other and they abused it . The RUC ( and later the army ) responded to peaceful Nationalist protests by beating them off the streets and Loyalist gangs burned entire communities out of their homes in Belfast . That 's why the PIRA started to grow . Nobody joined the PIRA in the early 1970 's because they were Catholic . Painting the Troubles as a purely religious conflict is revisionism at its worst . It makes it seem as if this was something that was always going to happen in the North regardless of what the political situation was .

Sovereign countries did n't invade Iraq because Hussein was a brutal dictator - he 'd been a brutal dictator for decades . We were told that the invasion was happening because Iraq had WMD 's and Chilcot has shown that the intelligence behind this claim was shaky at best ( and turned out to be false ) and that very little effort was made to try peaceful alternatives . The ramifications of this war have been colossal - without it there would likely be no ISIS and the refugee crisis would likely be much less severe , if indeed there would be one at all . It 's been the primary cause of the current situation in the Middle East . Now , none of that absolves Russia of its responsibility in Aleppo - and definitely not in Ukraine , but I just think that this whole attitude that one side is evil and the other side is not is unhelpful at best .

It 's also complete nonsense to suggest that the IRA came to the negotiating table because John Bruton had no time for them . The ceasefire was resumed because the British Government eventually decided to include SF in the peace talks if the IRA reinstated it . Which they did . It 's why Loyalists will later accuse Blair 's government of being `` Bombed back to the table '' . Either way , and to get back to the point a bit , the 1994 ceasefire pretty much ended the majority of the violence . Loyalist paramilitaries announced ceasefires shortly after it .

The GFA was n't the sole brain child of John Bruton , Bertie Ahern or anyone else . It was something that required an enormous amount of work , diplomacy and risk from all sides but mostly from the parties in N. Ireland itself . Ahern and Bruton before him might have facilitated dialogue between the conflicting sides in the North but they certainly did n't come up with the whole agreement ( and the plan to implement it ) all by themselves . Also , did n't Bruton ( while in power ) say he was fed up talking about the peace process ? I have n't heard another political leader from Ireland or Britain say that .

If you can , wonderful . I 'm happy for you . & gt ; I would further add that saying that someone who has more integrity than you is single minded and stupid is always a wining strategy ... I do n't see how anything you 've said shows you to have more integrity than me . Your argument thus far has been `` terrorists are bad '' - which is meaningless , because you know that nobody 's going to tell you they love terrorism .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; You way overreacted . If you say so . I do n't think I ever tried to imply that people who chose violence were in any way superior ( or even equal ) to those who did n't - but it 's completely disingenuous to pretend that prolonged state violence and violence from loyalist gangs against the nationalist minority was ever going to end in anything but reciprocated violence . It 's very easy to apply hindsight to the situation and say `` well non violence was clearly the better option '' . Any one of us can say that . In reality , if we 'd lived through it at the time and known or loved those who were the victims of state violence then we might well adopt a different attitude altogether .

As for SF , they 're a republican party . They 're going to oppose direct rule as vehemently as they can - it 's not particularly surprising that they 'd prefer to remain in government with the DUP than have the whole of the North governed from Westminster again .

What always irritates me about how the Troubles is talked about is how often it 's categorised as a religious conflict .

It arose from the state forces ' decision to brutally suppress civil rights marches and movements .

This helps places like Donegal that have been pretty isolated ever since partition . It also removes currency as an obstacle - the Republic no longer loses trade to the North when the sterling currency is weaker and vice versa - the economic environment is much more consistent .

There will be a significant cost to the republic if reunification happens , of that there 's no doubt , but I sincerely doubt that we would end up funding the same amount that the UK government does . Incidentally , reunification can only be a positive thing for the border communities that have been left isolated since partition .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"You 're applying your own perspective to the situation . The facts are that Adams facilitated a meeting between the Stack brothers and a senior figure in the IRA who supposedly knew who carried out their father 's murder . Adams has since stated that during the meeting he had with the Stack brothers , they provided him with the names of people they believed were involved with their father 's murder . Adams then claims to have given these names to the gardai . Stack denies that he gave Adams the names . That 's the controversy . Think of it what you will . As for me , I think it 's pretty damn unlikely that , after over 30 years in his position , Adams has suddenly decided to name names . Nobody seems to like to acknowledge the fact that if Adams did give these names himself without Stack providing them to him , then he 's likely to be in pretty big trouble - the IRA are n't likely to take kindly to it . Stack is likely to deny providing the names for the same reason . I do n't see how anyone can conclusively say who is telling the truth in this - because we have no real idea what was said at those meetings . That wo n't stop people stating opinion as fact , though !",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not being revisionist ... I 've stated facts . The truth is that most Cubans saw an increase in their quality of life since Castro came into power .

Their infant mortality rate is lower than the USA 's , their healthcare system is the envy of every other developing country in the world - they also have a better doctor to patient ratio than some western countries . Their literacy rate is approaching 100 % - which is pretty damn high even by western standards . You 've said that your cousin 's wife experienced some awful things under Castro and I 'm not denying that - but what you 're failing to understand is that for every Cuban who hated Castro and is glad to see him dead , there 's another one ( or more ) who is n't . Cuba spent the better part of 60 years under a crippling blockade by the most powerful country in the world - pretty soon after they overthrew a properly brutal dictator who made Castro look like Pope Francis . It 's too easy to say that Castro was an evil brutal dictator and just leave it at that . It 's lazy and it 's oversimplifying nearly 60 years of Cuban history .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,worldnews,I do remember reading a study that stated that about 1/3 of Seoul is within range of the North Korean artillery stationed along the DMZ - but they also supposedly have quite a large stockpile of chemical weapons . The contaminants in these chemical shells could spread a decent bit further away from where it impacted - depending on weather conditions and such . North Korea is a state that will be fighting for its own existence if war breaks out . I think it 's pretty likely that they will resort to using these kinds of weapons .

Artillery pieces that are also capable of launching chemical and biological weapons at the south too , by the way . Americans presuming that they have the right to decide the fate of a city like Seoul , or the fate of the millions of North Koreans that South Korea and China will need to house and feed when the war is over is one of the most fucked up things about all of this . Nobody else in that region wants this war to happen at all , nobody else is frothing at the mouth to get in a conflict with the North Koreans - the USA and North Korea are both unique in that respect .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"& gt ; Yeah , if Kim hits anything at all , most Americans would fully support turning North Korea into a glass desert . To be honest , I think this is a bit of a selfish mentality as far as the USA is concerned . Sure , striking Guam and killing people who live there would be awful - but if war breaks out , it wo n't be the USA who will face the worst of the consequences . It will be South Korea . Seoul , the South Korean capital , is a city of about 25 million people and it 's only 35 miles from the DMZ . North Korea has literally thousands of conventional artillery guns pointed directly at Seoul . They can kill thousands , perhaps even millions , of South Koreans without needing nuclear weapons . And that 's before you consider the fact that they can use artillery shells to deliver chemical and biological weaponry too . North Korea would definitely lose in a conflict with South Korea , the USA and Japan . But they pack a punch . And it 's South Korea who 's going to have to take that punch , and then recover enough to the point where they will need to deal with whatever comes after North Korea . Most likely , that would mean either reunification or thousands and thousands of underfed , malnourished and brainwashed North Koreans streaming into their country . All of this while rebuilding what 's left of Seoul . China 's still a huge unknown in this too .

About 20 % of British Muslims either thought the 7/7 bombings were justified or they sympathised with the attackers . More than 20 % of British Muslims want Sharia law in Britain . According to [ this ] ( http : //www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ ) pew poll , about 8 out of every 10 Muslims in Egypt and Pakistan think that stoning is an appropriate punishment for adultery .

It would still be an absolute humanitarian disaster if they managed to land even one , but it would n't take down the US government or the US military , and North Korea would quite probably still fall to the US and its allies .

Fast forward a bit and the war is going predictably well . The problem I had was that even though my warscore was more than high enough , I was n't able to demand Neumark from the Teutonics ( presumably because it was occupied by Austria and not me ) and had to wait a stupid amount of time for them to make a separate peace with Austria before I could move in and take the province for myself .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Freedom of speech means that you can voice your opinion and your views without being imprisoned or persecuted for doing so . The exception is when you are not just voicing an opinion but inciting action in other people - specifically violence or prejudice . This is hate speech , which is , as far as I know , illegal in most western countries - but I 'm open to correction on that . Also , if you 're working for a company and you say something that could be seen as homophobic or anti-semitic , then that company has every right to dismiss you from your job because they also have a right to protect their own image . In this respect , free speech does n't mean you 're always free to say whatever you want without consequence - but what it does mean is that nobody should be able to have others silenced because they find them `` offensive '' .",Romance,Native

Free speech does n't mean you 're entirely free to suffer no consequences for anything that you 'll ever say . If I incite someone to commit violence against another , then I 'm guilty of hate speech - which is a crime . Voicing your opinion and inciting action against someone else for voicing theirs is two completely different things and I 'm honestly confused as to why you 're conflating them . Demanding that I change my behaviour because of how you feel when I say something to you is making me responsible for how you feel . I can choose to be offended or I can choose not to be offended - my choice is n't the fault of any other person but me . Feelings are n't a moral currency .

Mass deporting all Muslims implies that all Muslims are our enemy and completely ignores the fact that Muslims are fighting and dying in greater numbers in the war against ISIS and other extremist groups than pretty much anyone else . ISIS wants us to see them as the legitimate voice of the Islamic world and we grant them this legitimacy if we act in this way . With all of that being said - there is a massive problem in the Islamic world and with the Islamic faith . If someone can kill dozens of innocent people and expect divine reward for doing so , and if their `` interpretation '' of the faith remains a pretty straightforward one as far as the original texts are concerned - then of course there is a massive problem within the faith . This is why this should be considered a war of ideas and this is why we need to empower moderate Muslims within the Islamic world . How do we do that ? Again , I do n't know .

I have no problem whatsoever with deporting Islamic extremists and even fundamentalists , who are a threat to our people - but when you start alienating the people who you need to win this war of ideas then you 're only making the problem worse because you immediately grant that the most extreme elements within Islam are representative of the entire group .

Because the entire region ( ie . not just Iraq ) did not become what it is today until after Saddam was deposed . The schism between Shia and Sunni has existed for literally centuries - so that has always been a destabilising factor in the region .

The IRA did n't plant bombs with the sole intention of killing as many innocents as they possibly could - evidenced by the fact that they gave any sort of warning in the first place .

SF are , by quite a margin , the biggest nationalist party in the North .

Why would Unionists be any more willing to vote for one of two parties who never even attempted to run candidates in the North ? What hope does a party like Fine Gael , who have little to no connection with Northern Ireland , have of convincing a population from there to see things their way ? Unionism is still at odds with Republicanism in the North . The only way to bridge this gap is by having Unionists and Republicans in the North working together - that 's the pre-requisite .

Northern Ireland in the late 60 's and early 70 's was basically a sectarian shithole . Catholics/Nationalists were essentially second class citizens - they did n't have the same ability to vote , most of the land/businesses were owned by Protestants who refused to hire Catholics and when the Catholic community arranged peaceful protests to oppose this situation , they were met with state violence on behalf of the RUC ( police ) and later the British army , and also violence from the Loyalist/Protestant community who started rioting at these protests and even burned entire streets of Catholics out of their homes . The British army was actually sent into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect Catholic communities from loyalist pogroms and gangs . It was within this climate that the IRA gained its support among the Catholic/Nationalist community . They promised to defend Catholic areas from Loyalist violence and to push back against the state forces . As you can imagine , this was a popular idea among Nationalists and the IRA grew in support - particularly after Bloody Sunday . Northern Ireland is a completely different place today . Organisations like the IRA simply would n't gain the support of entire communities anymore because the political climate is so drastically different .

Hume had no influence with the IRA - it was n't Hume who persuaded the IRA to do anything . It was people who held influence with the IRA , like Adams and McGuinness , who convinced them to call a ceasefire . Hume 's role was in convincing people on both sides that the conflict was pointless and in opening a dialogue with Sinn Fein that led to them putting pressure on the IRA to call a ceasefire . Hume made an immeasurable contribution to the peace process so I 'll never understand why people still try to attribute things to him that he did n't do , when his actual contributions were pretty hefty in the first place . He did n't persuade the IRA to do anything because he did n't have any influence with them to persuade them to do anything .

No one forced them to adopt the principles of medieval theocracy and try to carry them out in the 21st century . They chose to do this . While I do concede that those who actually physically formed and organised ISIS do deserve the bulk of the blame , your response seems to ignore some general facets of human nature . I 'm not viewing Arabs and Middle-Easterners as children . They are no more susceptible to falling victim to tyrannical regimes than any other group of people - hell , it was happening in Eastern Europe in the 90 's . Your assertion that everyone who is currently under the yoke of the Islamic state knowingly chose to be under that yoke is just wrong . The majority of them probably just ended up living there because of pure dumb luck when ISIS chopped up Iraq and Syria - these people just happened to be living in areas that fell into their control . The argument I was making is that ISIS and al Qaeda were both non existent in Iraq until Saddam was deposed . Now , Saddam Hussein was probably the worst dictator the world has seen since Hitler - but he was just as brutal towards Islamic extremists as he was with any other perceived threat to his power . Toppling Saddam 's regime without replacing it with a strong ( and preferably non sectarian ) government ( and also disbanding the Iraqi military ) is what allowed ISIS and al Qaeda to establish their footholds in Iraq .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,JobBridge was established in 2011 and unemployment 's been `` decreasing '' since around January of 2012 - jobbridge and schemes liked it have been contributing to the reduction of the unemployment rate since then .

They promised universal health care for everyone and this is what they 're actually giving us . Free gp care for a small minority of the population . An important minority , but a minority nonetheless . And it 's no coincidence that it 's being introduced now either with less than a year before a general election .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ireland is a country that was founded by people with blood on their hands . People who ordered deaths , atrocities , bombings , assassinations - the whole lot . People we 'll be celebrating next year , as it happens . Governments kill people , the only difference is the British government ( and other governments worldwide ) are able to do it without having the term `` terrorist '' applied to them . And yes , the Paras were n't running for any public office , but on the subject of Pat Finucane , it 's claimed that some very senior politicians in Margaret Thatcher 's government knew all about the collusion with the loyalist paramilitaries . You can debate how relevant that is to the discussion if you want but there 's no shortage of politicians on the other side of the fence who have as much , if not more , blood on their hands as Sinn Fein . We never hear as much bloviating about them , do we ? Gerry Adams has been `` playing big boy politics with the grown ups '' for a very long time now - say what you like about him but he 's considered one of the most adept politicians on the island . I do n't think even people who hate the man can deny that the Peace Process was a monumental political achievement ( probably the biggest political achievement since the foundation of the state ) - and it would never have happened without Gerry Adams .

They apologised for Bloody Sunday , but it took thirty eight years , a shambles of a report and a twelve year inquiry before they dropped their accusations that the innocent people who were killed attacked the paras first . Maybe you know more than I do , but I do n't recall the British Government ever apologising for Ballymurphy , or even acknowledging their responsibility for it for that matter . Why is n't our media focusing on getting justice for those families too ? Jean McConville 's murder was an atrocity , but why is it more important than the Ballymurphy families ? And this is the problem . There 's always another death , another atrocity and another finger pointing at the other side . The line needs to be drawn somewhere or we just keep going back and forth and the peace process will remain in an uneasy stasis forever , or break down entirely . Personally , I just think it 's deplorable that so many people on this side of the border pick and choose their atrocities because of how they feel about Gerry Adams or Sinn Fein .",Romance,Native

Quick reminder of what the `` bad old days '' were like for the ( seemingly large ) number of southerners with short memories ? Daily bomb scares - both real and hoax , public shootings , army checkpoints and thousands of dead and injured victims . And that 's only dealing with the attitude behind the remark . Now I 'll deal with the subject of it . Gerry Adams , love him or hate him , played an absolutely massive role in the peace process and in the decommissioning of the PIRA . Like it or not , the Troubles probably would n't have ended without his intervention . Now , if you can seriously believe that the peace process ( in its near-permanent state of instability ) would not be endangered if Gerry Adams ( or his family ) were to be blown up by dissidents then I 'm not sure what else to say .

EDIT : The downvotes would seem to suggest that some people disagree with my assertion . Pray tell , why is n't the peace process vital ? Or are people in the republic content to see a return to the near-biblical and archaic `` eye for an eye '' attitude that plagued the North for decades ? I know I 'm not .

So my question to you is where does it stop ? When does it stop ? When half of Northern Ireland 's in prison ? The Good Friday Agreement and the Peace Process as a whole has only been as successful as it is because both sides have made compromises . Both sides have had to make concessions and both sides have made sacrifices to keep the peace .

People on this side of the border always seem to get more riled up about what Republicans did than what the British did . How often have you heard Sinn Fein politicians being talked into making apologies for the IRA over the years ? Countless , and yet I do n't hear our government or media making a similar effort to get the British government to make their apologies .

As for the leadership , I have a certain amount of sympathy for where you 're coming from OP , I admire Adams too , and at the same time , I can understand why people would be hesitant to vote for him . But I think it 's worth remembering that Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others ( including less controversial figures like Hume and the SDLP ) are largely responsible for the adoption of the single most significant political agreement in this country since probably the foundation of the state . People should remember that when they doubt their `` competance '' , as a few people here have mentioned . I think it 's also worth remembering that there was a very good reason for Adams 's repeated denial of being a member of the IRA . He needed to hold influence with fellow politicians ( who would be infinitely less willing to negotiate with him if he admitted to being a member ) but he also needed to maintain his influence with the IRA and IRA hardliners to be able to actually bring anything meaningful to the negotiation table ( which is why he has always vocally supported them too ) .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The political motivations are obvious - Enda , Fianna Fail , Fine Gael and others have never shown any interest in these victims until now . A year before an election ( in which Sinn Fein are expected to make gains at their expense , I might add ) . Adams has spoken with the Gardai and the PSNI , I 'm fairly sure you do n't know what information was given and neither do I . But to suggest that anyone knew `` fucking everything '' about it is a massive oversimplification .

Do I think Adams is one of them ? No . If it were n't for people like Adams we 'd still be in the dark ol ' days of death and destruction , or there 'd still be a sizeable chunk of Nationalists/Catholics in the North living as second class citizens .

Either way , I 'm not trying to turn yet another thread on /r/Ireland into a political debate over the moralities of Sinn Fein , you 're not going to change your opinion because of an internet debate and nor am I - I was merely pointing out a hypocrisy that I 'd noted on `` Renua '' 's website .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It 's funny how their website states that they will consider going into government with any of the other political parties except for Sinn Fein , due to their lack of `` transparency '' . I 'm sorry ... have the past 2 coalitions been visions of transparency themselves ? The government who covertly brought the troica here and the government whose entire tenure has been wracked with scandals and incompetency ? They seem to be desperately searching for a niche to fill . With the pending downfall of Labour and the extinction of the PD 's and Greens , I suppose the next government party will need a new whipping boy .

There 's a bloody reason why people are n't arsed to learn their country 's language - and as far as I 'm concerned , putting it down to sheer laziness is an oversimplification . The fact is , the Irish language is pushed on everyone from a fairly young age , you 're made to learn it because that 's what 's required of you , not because you actually like speaking it . It takes away any real love for the language when you 're forced to do it incessantly , even if you do n't like learning off poems and stories by heart . EDIT : On top of that , you never really `` speak '' the language anyway . Aside from the stupid Leaving Cert oral , most of your time is spent learning the same sort of pseudo-academic shite that you learn off for English - the only difference being that most people are already fluent with English and it is n't as tedious .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Your words , not mine . But perhaps you need a bit of perspective . Catholics and Nationalists were second-class citizens in the North . A Catholic did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant or a Unionist in the Orange State . Hundreds and thousands of them could n't get social housing because protestants and loyalists were favoured for it before them . Civil rights marches were brutally and savagely put down by the RUC and , afterwards , the British Army . And that 's where a lot of this started . The protestors in those early days were n't actually campaigning for a united Ireland . They were marching for civil rights - and they were being tramped on by their own police force . Some of them turned to violence because they 'd reached the end of their tolerance - we can debate how right or wrong that is in a separate discussion but I do n't think it 's our place to judge people who felt they had no alternative either .

08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"Daeron II became king because he was older than Daemon Blackfyre , not solely because he was a trueborn son . Daemon had to taint Daeron 's claim by saying he was the bastard son of Aemon the Dragonknight , and not Aegon IV , in order to claim the throne . EDIT : [ Found a relevant SSM ] ( http : //www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Hornwood_Inheritance_and_the_Whents ) , there 's no right or wrong answer to this . Depending on the politics at work , a legitimized bastard can come before or after trueborn children . So , it 'd probably be down to the Northern lords themselves , and whether they decide to support Jon or Bran/Rickon .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"If Jon is legitimized , he becomes Jon Stark , and his claim on the North is stronger than Bran 's , RIckon 's , Sansa 's and Arya 's because he 's the oldest legitimate male son of Eddard Stark . If Robb did legitimize him , Jon is the heir to the North . Simple as that . I just do n't see this happening , though . Even if Jon is still alive , it 's completely against his character for him to disinherit Ned 's `` legitimate '' children from their birthright . To answer your question , no . Even if he is legitimized , he ca n't be King and LC . His oathes to the Night 's Watch forbid him from becoming King in the first place , so something will have to give . As to how powerful the North is , the answer at the moment is not very . In peacetime , the North can muster ( at the very most ) 40000 men , but it very rarely does , because the North is so vast it makes mustering their full manpower extremely difficult . Robb had 18000 troops , and most of them are either dead or scattered now . The North , militarily speaking , is n't much of a threat to the Southern Kingdoms at the moment , but it 's still strong enough to destroy them in a defensive war if a Southern army is stupid enough to attack them in the Neck .",Romance,Native

Feudal laws say that Bran is higher than Rickon in the line of succession , but I honestly ca n't see Bran ever returning from the cave of the three-eyed crow . I believe he 'll remain there , and continue doing whatever it is that Bloodraven does . Jon Snow is a bastard , and despite the many theories kicking around that he 's been legitimised by Robb , I just ca n't see it happening . Even if he has been legitimised , even if he 's survived his caeser-ing and even if he continues to ride south , it 's completely and totally against his character for him to place himself ahead of Sansa or ( fake ) Arya ( the only siblings he knows to be still alive ) in the line of succession . He might try and fight against the Boltons , but he wo n't claim Winterfell . Sansa is a woman . Should Bran , Rickon or even a legitimised Jon Snow appear , they 're all ahead of her in the line of succession . The Northerners would never support her over one of Eddard 's sons , which is why I can not see her holding the North . At least , not permanently . Arya is the least likely of the lot to inherit the North . She 's stuck with the Faceless Men , and who knows where she 'll end up after that . For these reasons , I 'm fairly certain that Rickon will eventually inherit the North . The majority of the Northern lords would n't hesitate to offer him their fealty , especially if his wolf is with him .",Romance,Native

Michael McElhatton is cold , calculating and always carries a silent threat . Perfect for Roose Bolton . Iain Glen does a superb job as Jorah Mormont . He 's got the voice that 's delivered some of the shows more memorable quotes . Stephen Dillane is a great actor , and he plays the part of Stannis excellently . The problem is how the part itself is written . They 've all but butchered his character . Catelyn is probably one of my least favourite characters in the series . Despite this Michelle Fairley was superb . I still do n't like the character , but her performance was flawless . All in all , the quality of the cast for AGOT is excellent . I ca n't really say that any character 's main faults stem from a poor performance by their actor .

When the Nationalist community began to push back against this with civil rights marches , they were violently put down by Loyalist gangs , the RUC and eventually the British Army . This led to the growth of the PIRA . In the late 60 's and early 70 's , people did n't join the IRA for religious reasons - they joined for political reasons .

08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"It 's a bit late for it now but I 'd have loved to have seen Daenerys meet Ned . She refused to see him as anything but one of the Usurper 's dogs , lumping him in with Jon Arryn , Tywin Lannister and the rest of them . Barristan tries to point out to her that Ned was known by pretty much everyone to be a man of honour , and was the most prominent voice to speak up against Tywin when he had the royal children killed . I think it would be a very interesting conversation for Dany . She never seems interested in understanding how or why so many prominent Lords decided to rebel against her family , and she has a habit of viewing these people as nothing but evil enemies . This probably stems from the years she spent listening to Viserys 's rhetoric , but I think if Dany is to succeed then she needs to understand her enemies better . If she 'd met Ned , she 'd understand that there are honourable people on both sides , and these men all see themselves as fighting for an honourable cause .",Romance,Native

I 'm no fan of partition , but it 's hard to argue against the treaty when we do n't know what the alternative would have brought . The Nationalist population in the North was absolutely shafted by the treaty and continued to be shafted ( and largely ignored by successive Irish governments ) up until the 1970 's and 1980 's . Signing the treaty brought a further 70 years of political instability and conflict to the North , and the Troubles claimed more lives than both the war of independence and the civil war .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm almost 100 % certain that the British do not commemorate Irish soldiers who died fighting against them in the 1916 rising . Are you trying to say that they do ? Commemorating Irish men who fought and died fighting with the British in WW1 is not the same thing . I also happen to think that there 's a difference between moving on from the events of a conflict and actively commemorating the soldiers of the wrinkled old Empire that you were fighting against . If you think we should be commemorating them , fair enough . I do n't think we have any obligation to . Try applying your argument to a different situation .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I know , and I think that 's regrettable - because it 's such a narrow and simplistic explanation for the conflict . In the early days , the civil rights marches that would lead to the IRA gaining support had absolutely nothing to do with a united Ireland . That did n't stop the RUC from beating their peaceful protests off the streets and it did n't stop loyalist gangs from burning catholics and nationalists out of their homes .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I ca n't give a solid answer regarding the war of independence but internment was used after the 1916 rising . There was a pretty interesting documentary on TG4 about it a while back actually , over a thousand Irishmen who fought in the rising were interned in a detention camp in Wales . Apparently that 's where Michael Collins began to gain more and more influence in the IRB . It supposedly became a training ground for would be Irish revolutionaries who would then fight in the war of independence . So , fairly safe to say that it did n't work out too well there either .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Internment was a complete and utter disaster in the North . The H Blocks became a symbol of state oppression and only helped to further the IRA 's propaganda campaign against the Orange State . It got even worse in the 80 's when prisoners had their special category status removed - that 's what led to the hunger strikes . The problem with internment is that it represents an erosion of civil liberties . In the North , thousands of people were imprisoned throughout internment and you only needed to be suspected of being associated with the IRA to end up in the maze . I do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say that a huge percentage of people who ended up in the maze were not criminals , and were not members of the IRA . As you point out , that may well have changed by the time they were released . Ireland is n't the only country in the world that has a problem with gangland crime . We do n't need to lower ourselves to removing citizen 's rights in order to deal with this problem .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yes ... because internment worked so brilliantly in the North and elsewhere . What an absolutely moronic suggestion . Can anyone think of another western nation that has decided to bring in imprisonment without trial to deal with gangland crime ? It 's completely absurd .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The actions ( or inactions ) of the British Government in the North are the reasons why the PIRA existed to begin with . They 're certainly the reasons why the PIRA gained so much support from previously moderate nationalists and catholics . The British response to peaceful civil rights marches , in which catholics were looking for equal voting rights among other things , was to beat them off the streets . When the unionists began to commit increasingly violent crimes against catholic minority communities ( Bombay Street ) , the British sent the army in to protect the catholics ( amazing how many people do n't know that ) . The army soon became worse than the RUC and we had Bloody Sunday and other atrocities as a result . I think the growth of the PIRA was a regrettable , but absolutely inevitable and predictable event given the circumstances that some catholic communities found themselves in . Violence begets violence and all that . The IRA are obviously responsible for the violent acts that they 've committed , of course they are . And the IRA committed some unspeakable acts - but they were a response to an existing situation . Instead of ceding a few basic human rights to the catholic communities , the British responded with violence , sometimes extreme violence . They also fed into the growing popularity of the IRA among nationalists by bringing in things like internment - which made them appear like monsters and gave the IRA even more of a reason to market themselves as freedom fighters .

Hume played a huge role in the peace process , but the peace process could never have happened if you did n't have people within SF and the PIRA willing to take huge risks in order to turn the PIRA away from violence . Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake . The problem is that people seem to think that it was down to Hume and the SDLP alone - when their whole contribution to the peace process centered almost entirely around involving and in many cases depending on SF and the moderate elements of the IRA to bring an end to the violence being orchestrated by the IRA .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,Music,"There 's more to it than just Catholic vs Protestant yes , of course there is .

Obviously this is a very simplistic account , but it 's the jist of what happened . Honestly I 'm more worried about how the Troubles is understood among our own people here than I am about how foreigners understand it - there 's such a lack of knowledge on the subject it 's unbelievable . For example , most Irish people do n't know that the British Army was actually sent into the North to protect the catholics/nationalists from further attacks from loyalist gangs .

Started justifying a war , drew up all my plans and recruited heavily for the initial offensive . The day arrived but there was a problem - the UK had since guaranteed Yugoslavia as well . By now I 'd joined the Axis and so I decided to declare the war anyway and drag Germany in on my side . So now I 'm at war with the UK , Australia , New Zealand , The Raj , and a few others . Anyway , the UK are currently stealing all of my colonies and Australia and New Zealand are incessantly air-striking my ports , which is irritating . Still , I feel good about this war .

08TangoDown08,ireland,They 're not appeasable but they certainly know how to take advantage of the media .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; How is it not censorship if you want the media to stop reporting further developments on a story , which may take a few days ? What if I want to know the developments and not the bare bones breaking news report ? I did n't say anything about wanting the media to not report on further developments on a story - in fact I 'd be quite happy if that was all they did . But it is n't . And you know it is n't . At best , they spend hours repeating the same headline again and again until they get a new development and at worst they speculate over the details that remain unclear . That 's not what I want , I only want to know the facts . If it 's what you want , fair enough . We 'll agree to disagree .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,But that 's a completely different argument altogether ... this has nothing to do with censorship . There 's a difference between being informed and having the same story shoved down your throat for three or four days straight - or having a story being instantly framed in one context ( a terrorist attack carried out by Islamic militants ) when it has nothing to do with it . And that 's before getting in to the ridiculous amount of time news agencies spend on delving into every aspect of the perpetrators lives .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Not sure . A quick look at the wiki page for the Iraq War puts the number of deaths due to violent actions at over 600,000 ( estimated by the Lancet survey ) - I 'd imagine Vincent 's probably including the period of violence that the Iraq war has also led to in that region . I really do n't know if that would bring the figure above 1 million , though . EDIT : Actual confirmed and documented deaths seem to be around 110,000 , so yeah , no idea where 1 million is coming from . The estimates do seem to vary by a lot though . Just googling `` casualties of the Iraq War '' brings up an ORB survey that attributes over 1 million deaths to the war .",Romance,Native

I just do n't see why I should be waking up at 3 in the morning to read an alert on my phone telling me about a terrorist attack in Florida when at the same time , 2 people died in a car accident in Letterkenny and I hear nothing about that until the next morning . It 's ridiculous . EDIT : And back to the original question a bit ... news reports really should n't focus so much on the attackers . That 's what the problem is in my opinion . There 's always long , detailed reports about who the attacker was , who they owe their allegiance to , why they do what they do , where they go for breakfast , what their favourite colour is ... the focus should be both on the victims of the attack , and on the attack itself . It should n't become an autobiography of the killer .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,I think he 's spot on here . The media just seem to be frothing at the mouth to report these attacks in the most sensationalist ways possible . You 're still more likely to die crossing the road than you are from a terrorist attack for fuck 's sake .,Romance,Native

Hume ( deservedly ) won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work - but I seriously think the role of Adams and McGuinness is incredibly overlooked by some people . Who could 've brought the IRA to a ceasefire without them ? Hume ? Not a chance .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,Attacking the Soviet Union after the end of WW2 would 've been an absolutely terrible idea . The Soviets had an incredibly massive land army at that point ( somewhere in the region of 3 to 1 versus the Allies ) and they had more tanks than any other nation . And that 's before you consider the fact that in only a couple of years they would have nuclear weapons ( something that might have happened even sooner if they were under attack ) . Churchill 's idea was rash and reckless and he did n't give a toss about the millions of people who would die as a result - that pretty much sums him up in my view .,Romance,Native

This is what he said : `` starvation of anyhow underfed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks '' . Bengal was a part of the British Empire . It 's genocide by inaction at the very least . I vehemently dislike Churchill for this and also for his abysmal record in Ireland . As an Irishman myself perhaps I 'm biased , but he 's definitely not the saint he 's often made out to be . The lengths that people go to justify some of his actions ( or inactions ) is incredible .

The party might not have taken the same positions that it has if he were not the leader . As for `` pulling numbers out their asses '' , it was FG and FF who tugged numbers out of their asses during the whole fiscal space debacle . SF were the only party to get it right .

At the same time , he could n't cut the IRA loose because he needed enough influence with them to bring them to the table . I know what you 're going to say , that was 30 years ago - but honestly the situation has n't changed all that much . If he admits **now** that he was in the IRA all along , what will that do to the already severely fragile peace-process in the North ? I think there would be a real chance that the DUP and other loyalist parties would refuse to have dialogue with Sinn Fein at all if that were the case . The current crises up there would be a fairly minor footnote compared to the catastrophy that would cause in my opinion , and I think political stability and people 's lives are more important than Adams 's political opponents being able to prove themselves right .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Resentment will never lead to lasting peace , and I think you might be overlooking the fact that SF and the PIRA were not the only obstacle . For years , the British government refused to even speak with leading nationalist politicans and they were banned from having their voices heard on public broadcasts - even in the Republic , with Section 31 . I just can not agree with the assertion that a lasting peace could 've been achieved without SF being there to bring the PIRA to the table . As far as justifying the IRA goes , I 'm not sure I 'd go that far - I would n't try to justify what they ended up as , at least . I do n't think it 's as easy to say that they were n't justified in the beginning . But I would also add that I do n't think it 's fair to judge those who decided to join them either - I personally do n't know how I 'd react to living under an oppressive government who viewed me as a second class citizen . They did despicable things , but they were a response to a pre-existing condition - and the British Army did things that were equally as bad . The US army and other armies continue to do the same in other parts of the world now , the only difference is that they are government-sanctioned actions .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not saying the SDLP did n't have a large part to play but I do think you 're overestimating it too . How could the peace process have succeeded without involving the PIRA ? How do you politically involve the PIRA without reaching out to SF ? And if you 're Adams or someone else , how do you convince the PIRA to stop the violence and come to the table ? These were some of the biggest issues faced by the peace process and most of them were overcome to some degree . But you definitely would not have had any kind of lasting peace without involving SF . The Hume-Adams dialogue did a lot more for the peace process than people seem to know .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm a huge fan of John Hume - he achieved remarkable things but he had no influence over the PIRA and realistically , people who held some level of influence over them were needed to bring them to the negotiating table . Otherwise , you 'd have one side at the table without the other . I really do think it 's unrealistic to believe that the peace process could 've went ahead without involving the PIRA or at the very least , SF . Incidentally , that was Hume 's position too . He was largely responsible for bringing SF into the fold after all . I do n't think anyone can deny the huge part Adams played in making the peace process as relatively successful as it is - whatever else you might think of the man .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't think I ever said the PIRA were anything other than a violent organisation , of course they were . They committed atrocities just like the RUC , British army and loyalists did . That 's the problem with constantly looking back in the North - everybody 's hands were dirty . I do agree that things may well have worked out better if everyone had stuck to politics , but that 's an ideal that was never going to happen - there 's no point in dwelling on it now , the reality was violent and brutal . Something had to change and eventually it did , we got the peace process . That would simply not have happened without SF and the influence some of its members had with the PIRA .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Oh for fuck 's sake . Go and read a history book , I 'm fed up explaining Northern Irish politics and history to people in /r/Ireland - so much willful ignorance . The PIRA were a symptom of a much greater problem in the North . They formed because Nationalists/Catholics were second class citizens in an Orange state during the late 60's/early 70 's . They had little to no voting powers , housing authorities routinely passed them over to favour the Protestant majority and they faced huge discrimination from the RUC - culminating in things like the Battle of the Bogside and what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was then that the British Army was sent in - to protect the Catholics . That 's why they were sent over and not many people seem to be willing to remember that now . Instead of protecting the people they were told to protect , they became the biggest problem of the lot . Bloody Sunday was n't the only failure on their list . And so , more and more people ( rightly or wrongly ) joined the PIRA . Sinn Fein emerged as the political wing of the organisation , not the other way around - as some logheads seem to be implying here . Like it or not , you would n't have a peace process without Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others . What amuses me the most about all of this is that for years , people were encouraging and pleading with the PIRA to turn to politics instead - and now that they have ( by and large ) , people are still bitching .

08TangoDown08,WTF,"Well , I 've already outlined two alternatives - just because you 've dismissed them does n't mean they did n't exist . Allowing Japan to retain the Emperor as a surrender condition is one , another one is allowing the Soviet Union to deliver the death blow to the Empire . Just because it is n't an ideal alternative does n't mean it is n't an alternative . But if you do n't think that dropping the atomic bombs was about geopolitics - even a little bit - then I do n't know what to say to you . It was about getting one up on the Soviet Union as much as it was about ending a war that was already over .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,WTF,"& gt ; I think I know which one is the best for Japan . Oh , so **that's** what the USA was concerned with was it ? Now that 's the only load of tripe on display here my friend . But , since you asked , I think it 's also worth mentioning that the Potsdam Proclamation did n't address in any way , one of the central surrender conditions for the Japenese - the retention of the emperor . There are more than a few historians who think the Japanese might 've surrendered if that assurance was given . However , that 's still only another item on the list . There are plenty of historians , critics and writers who have assessed the options available to the Allies at that point in the war - and surprisingly enough not all of them deem the atomic bomb to have been necessary . Hell , even people like Eisenhower and McArthur thought it was n't necessary . But I wo n't sit here and do your research for you , so perhaps you should head off to google .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,WTF,"It was n't a necessity . Things are never that black and white . Revisionist history tells us it was a necessity , but it 'd be refreshing for people here to actually research it more themselves . The USA had planned to invade Japan in November but the US leadership then felt that something should be done before the Soviet Union entered that theatre of war . And so , you have the atomic bombs . The Soviet Union brought forward its plans and invaded after the bomb on Hiroshima , but the Japanese then surrendered after the second one on Nagasaki . The bombs were about geopolitics , not `` ending the war '' . The war was already over . EDIT : Obviously that 's not the whole story , but it 's a part of it . And a part that nobody seems to remember in these discussions .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,WTF,"The alternative was that Japan surrenders anyway to the Soviet Union , who began their planned invasion between the dropping of the two bombs .

If your only response to ( often valid ) criticism is to put your fingers in your ears and yell `` Lalalalala ! `` , then you probably do n't have a clue what you 're talking about . Still , as I 've said , there 's as many people here who 'll criticize SF for anything and everything they do as there is people who 'll defend them for anything and everything that they **have** done . I have my reasons for voting the way I do and I 've outlined them clearly before on /r/Ireland , and I really do get tired of constantly having to repeat myself on this topic . Especially to people who have no interest in having a discussion but instead only want to argue pointlessly on the internet ( not you , but I 'm sure you wo n't need to look far to see who I 'm referring to ) .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Disproportionate downvoting ? Just how many SF supporters do you think there are on reddit ? On a daily basis there 's as many anti-SF posts made as there are pro-SF posts .

As for knowing better than to rise to the bait , I try to only make a post when I see someone posting something patently untrue or willfully ignorant . It 's not always about SF , you 'd be surprised how little many Irish people know about Northern Irish history and politics in general . I 'm not ignorant of the misgivings people have for SF and I 'm not even saying they 're wrong to have those misgivings , I 'm just fed up being told that I ca n't vote for SF and also take up a moral stance on any political issue . I 'm fed up having to constantly explain myself to an electorate who voted in successive FF governments - who were complacent in the biggest economic downturn in the history of the state . SF are far ( very far ) from perfect , but so is every other political party . I 've no problem with people being critical of them ( I 've been critical of them myself on a whole range of things ) , but I do have a problem with consistently being branded a `` shinnerbot '' every time I offer my opinion .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"What you 're describing are the reasons for the prolonged continuation of violence during the Troubles , but those are n't the reasons why they started to begin with . You 're not wrong in what you 're saying but I think we 're describing two separate things . The Troubles lasted so long because of the reasons you 're describing - the PIRA took advantage of their swell in numbers to promote their agenda , which in turn led to loyalist paramilitaries doing the same . This led to the back and forth attacks carried out by these paramilitaries as you 've described . But I still believe that the biggest reason why the Troubles started to begin with was the poor treatment of Catholics in NI .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not saying they were that simple I 'm telling you how they came about . If Catholics had the same rights as Protestants in Northern Ireland there would have been no public support for the PIRA . If you 're trying to get me to justify everything the PIRA has done then you wo n't succeed . Incidentally , the protests in the late 60 's and early 70 's had absolutely fuck all to do with a united Ireland . That 's not what gave the PIRA their support . Large numbers of people flocked to join their ranks because of how they were treated by the orange state . The IRA always stated their goal as being a united Ireland . Always . That was n't going to change simply because they had more people in the organisation or because they had more public support . Most of your questions were rhetorical , or at least the answers to them are obvious to anyone who knows anything about the Troubles . They do n't actually take away from anything I 've said .",Romance,Native

You did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant , you could n't get housing from local authorities who systematically favoured Protestants over you , you found it tougher to get a job because most business owners were Protestant and would never hire a Catholic and you could n't air your grievances in public because the RUC would come down on your protests like a ton of bricks . The British Army was sent in to protect the Catholic community in Northern Ireland after what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast .

Also , it 's very easy to hold the view that all violence is wrong and we should never hurt another person . An admirable sentiment , but life does n't always work like that . You ca n't tell me that if you were living as a catholic in West Belfast or Derry in the early 70 's , seeing your people treated as second class citizens and getting beaten off the streets ( by the `` innocent '' RUC ) for holding civil rights marches so that you can have the vote and be allocated housing like the loyalist majority , that you would n't under any circumstances join an organisation that promised to change that . EDIT : And even if you will still say that you definitely would n't , I do n't think you 're in any sort of position to judge people who would .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yes , the PIRA killed a lot of people ... please show me where I said that they did n't ? If you 're talking about civilian casualties , you 're incorrect . Loyalist paramilitaries are responsible for more civilian deaths than the PIRA . The majority of the people killed by the PIRA were members of the British Security forces .

You 're coming from an entirely different standpoint than I am . Most people on /r/Ireland are - I 'm fine with that . What I 'm not fine with is having your standpoint lorded over me as if that is the only morally correct view to have . I do n't think membership of the PIRA is a crime in and of itself - mostly because I know , and can understand , why the PIRA came about in the first place and what life was like for catholics and nationalists in the `` orange state '' . I do n't think it 's fair to judge people who were victims of state oppression , abused by the police force who were supposed to be protecting them ( RUC ) , backed into a corner and felt they had no other option . That 's wrongly assigned blame . Maybe you see things differently but that 's how I see it .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"There 's the testimony of former IRA members like Dolores Price who were against the Peace Process - and therefore had a vested interest in discrediting Gerry Adams , SF and other leaders of the Peace Process . And when I say I do n't care , I mean I do n't care if he was a member of the IRA or not . There 's nothing to gain from finding out for certain that he was n't a member , and there 's potentially a lot at stake if we find out for certain that he was . Finding out he was a member is n't exactly going to strengthen the already weakened Peace Process . The DUP were almost willing to tear it up over something we already knew was the case ( the PIRA still existing ) - there 's a pretty real chance they 'd walk out completely if Adams came out and said he was in the IRA . In short , I do n't see any advantage in finding out for sure either way . Politicians in the Republic who keep throwing accusations at Adams are doing so to further their own political agendas and not out of any sort of concern for NI or the peace process - they ignore these problems until there 's political capital to be had in paying attention to it .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,Music,So the USA was right to destroy an entire city and irradiate its soil for ( probably ) hundreds of years just to send a warning to Russia ? For something they may not do at all anyway ? Are you even reading what you 're typing ?,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,Music,Of course `` you '' had a choice ... there 's so much more to those events than what popular history dictates . There are more than a few historians who think that Russia declaring war on Japan between the dropping of the bombs was a massive reason for their surrender - and that it would 've happened anyway regardless of whether or not the bombs were used . I do n't really have the desire to debate this subject in /r/music but I really do wish people would delve a little deeper into these topics .,Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,AskReddit,"Joining the EU and joining the euro were not the same thing ... Ireland joined the EU in 1973 and we joined the euro in 2002 , that 's 29 years later . The Euro had absolutely nothing to do with Ireland becoming the highly developed country that it is now , the currency itself did n't exist until 1999 .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,Music,"Late 80 's Aerosmith was n't so bad either , Pump was excellent , and Get a Grip in the early 90 's was pretty good . Apart from that , yeah , go for the 70 's stuff .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,gallifrey,"I think Waters of Mars is actually perfect . It sums up the Doctor so wonderfully . The Doctor 's always struggled with his position in the universe and that experience taught him that he 's not infallible , or all powerful - as he was beginning to think .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Well yeah but the Alliance and Green Party MLA 's still make up only 9 out of the what ... 108 or 109 MLA 's ? The DUP have nearly 40 .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"That 's a blanket statement and I really do n't agree with it . The most conservative areas are the staunchly loyalist areas , the rest of the North is really not much more backwards than the Republic . The power structure in the North can be misleading though , I 'll grant you that . One of the downsides of power sharing is that it 's not representative ( that 's the entire point of it , but it 's not without problems ) . The DUP will pretty much always end up in power , and so will SF ( who are pushing for gay marriage to be legalised ) .",Romance,Native
