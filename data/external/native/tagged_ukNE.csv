12341,ukpolitics,"The prime minister no doubt used her visit to Saudi Arabia to desperately seek trade deals that will help cobble together a plan to combat the monumental act of self-harm that is leaving the single market . What she should have done was have a moment of conscience and think about the people of Yemen . International charities say Yemen is in the grip of a perfect storm of war , economic meltdown and humanitarian crisis . Yet while British aid is helping to save lives there , the country is being being pounded by British arms , sold to our Saudi Arabia allies , exacerbating the situation . Yemeni families face a daily nightmare of falling bombs , a critical lack of clean water and food which leaves the country teetering on the edge of famine and outbreaks of preventable conditions such as cholera and measles which are killing a child every ten minutes . This nightmare is deepened by “ widespread and systematic ” international humanitarian law violations by the Saudi coalition that have the “ potential to meet the criteria for a crime against humanity ” , according to a panel of experts set up by the United Nations . The figures are almost impossible to comprehend : 18 million people , including ten million children , need humanitarian assistance . That ’ s eight in ten people in Yemen who need humanitarian aid to survive . Britain can take credit for its leadership in providing humanitarian aid to Yemen — but ministers must also take responsibility for failing to use British influence to ensure that aid is not blocked . They have also failed to hold to account those responsible for the unrelenting attacks on civilians . Save the Children has said that the warring parties , including the Saudi-led coalition , are blocking aid as a “ weapon of war ” : detaining aid workers , bombing ports and holding up desperately needed food and medicines . Plans to attack the port of Hodeida , already damaged by Saudi bombs , risk causing a humanitarian catastrophe if steps are not taken to divert aid to other ports . Hodeida receives nearly three quarters of all imports and humanitarian assistance shipments . For a country which Britain counts as an ally to be deliberately withholding aid is bad enough but the Saudi-led coalition is also responsible for the unrelenting bombardment of Yemen ’ s towns and cities , hitting homes , destroying clinics trying to care for starving families and killing children in their classrooms . Similar crimes are undoubtedly being committed by the Houthi opposition . Deliberately withholding lifesaving aid and attacking civilians are war crimes yet in Yemen these reports are not being properly investigated and those responsible are not being held to account . To date , the government has said that the investigations , led by the Saudis themselves , are sufficient . It could not be clearer that the Saudis investigating themselves is woefully inadequate and deeply inappropriate . The case for a fully independent , international investigation into alleged war crimes , on all sides of the conflict in Yemen , is irrefutable . Yemen faces a humanitarian catastrophe . The government must stand up for international humanitarian law , halt arms sales , demand that our allies immediately allow humanitarian access and support calls for a ceasefire and a full , impartial investigation into what appear to be horrific war crimes . To leave Saudi Arabia with more credibility than her predecessors , our prime minister had to stop the flow of arms . By failing to do so , her government chose shamefully to side with Saudi Arabia , rather than hold the Saudi authorities to account on their alleged human rights abuses in Yemen . Ours is a government which has abetted a humanitarian disaster and brought further bloodshed and poverty to civilians in an already stricken land . The continued failure of the government to take action in Yemen leaves Britain ’ s reputation in the world permanently damaged .",Romance,Native

If someone who does n't communicate , but knows there place on the team because of it ( e.g . following strats instead of creating their own without telling anyone ) they can still be very helpful .

I have also won games where I was in a group of 3/4 and the randoms did n't communicate , yet we won partly because he knew what he was doing , did n't interrupt us and held his own .

So personally it does encourage me to go see a lower league team . Also I have no source for this but I think I have read somewhere before that many lower league teams do generally experience lower attendances when there is a big game at 12:45 ( a football game should n't start before 2/3 pm , but that 's another topic ) .

This means that for at least the first 2 months of matchmaking you could n't have a map selection .

30503,GlobalOffensive,"For me the one of my concerns after watching it was him mentioning some kind of play-off system . To my understanding ( I could be very wrong on this ) it is very popular with American sports to have a play-off system to win the title , and that Thorin mentioned something similar . This is something that would ruin the league for me , because what is the point of a league , where you can win every game but have an off game in the final to the 4th placed team or something ( although writing that as an arsenal fan is tempting : - ) . It takes the point of having a league away especially if all the league games are played on lan . For online leagues it makes sense to have the online finals on lan in a play-off system , however for a league on lan there is no point of having a play-off system to decide who wins .",Romance,Native

For example you can easily win every single game , but have a slight dip in form to a team that played well in the final , but nowhere near as well . I know it is like this for basically every csgo event right now , but that is because they basically have to be like that . This is because the leagues are either online , which is not a way to see who wins a large event , or that they do n't have time for a proper league system and have to use group stages instead . Just because it minimises pointless games , or is more exciting to to watch the final , does n't mean it is as fair . If a team wins it in week 8 out of 10 then chances are they deserve to win it .

Also matchmaking is not about the challenge of getting a rank , it is about how good the games are as well as how challenging the games are .

30503,GlobalOffensive,"Yes but not allowing them to get the competitive experience will deter some new players as they hear about this competitive game they want to try out , but they have to grind out a bunch of hours just to be able to play the game will deter many . I know I would 've been like that when I started playing in 2012 . I think I played a couple of matches in casual then went straight into competitive . I only got the game because I got into watching ESWC 2012 and I wanted to experience competitive myself . Granted I was put into gold nova 1 straight away presumably because I played some other pc fps games and it was before they adjusted the rank system .

If I want to play deathmatch I 'll find a community server that is better ( eg 128 tick , more players , ffa ) and if I want to play gun game I 'll find a community server because the update to the official gun game made it awful to play . And demolition can be fun to play the odd game I guess but it gets boring very fast . This is just my opinion , however you ca n't deny the fact that 90 % of players play this game for competitive . Also I still have n't made my mind up on whether I like the recent update or not , I am for the time being at least playing devils advocate .",Romance,Native

Although an official with ranks and shit 1v1 would be nice , I do know about the arena servers , which I do go on occasionally . The arena servers are more for practise whilst an official matchmaking system would be for more competitive 1v1 games as you are only playing against 1 person not a bunch of different people each round .",Romance,Native

30503,Gunners,Third keepers are usually u19/u21s players or are coming very close to retirement and are good people to keep around the club ( e.g . good personality/possibly future coach ) so I would say having an out and out third keeper does n't really exist .

I would also argue your point that they deserve the tickets more because they are prepared to pay more . Whilst this is probably true in a business standpoint , in theory they deserve the ticket just as much as any one else or some ( myself included ) will argue that the true fans that support the team week in , week out ( not saying you have to go to every game ) deserve the tickets more than someone who is prepared to pay more for a one of trip to the stadium .",Romance,Native

He does n't care as he thinks the main three parties are all the same and none of their policies will affect him in any major way , he just likes to get on with his life and not bother looking into politics because it is unlikely to affect his life drastically .

30503,soccer,"Your second point is why I disagree with video technology in most situations , like if the ref did n't call the penalty , the game carries on and anything can happen , and what if the call is made that it was n't a penalty . What do you do there , give the ball to the other team ? Well chances are they just missed the chance for a good counter attack .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"Often times teams try to take a quick set piece and are not stopped , so that line of thought is wrong . However I do agree with some of your other points on if the game has already stopped then use it , however it would have to be implemented correctly in that case as I see a lot of room for error , by making things drag out much longer and needed . And there is another issue of teams possibly forcing the video decision to be made by deliberately stopping the play . This does already happen to some extent and it is not always bad however in many cases I think it can be , although that 's a complicated one .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I see your point , however the ref would be more inclined to call a penalty knowing that it can be reviewed after . Then what happens if it turns out not to be a penalty . Like a said in me previous comment there is a high chance that the other team could 've had a counter attack when instead they will just have a free kick which is a much slower build up than a possible quick counter . Or what if the team the penalty was called for but in the end disallowed , what if they were still in possession of the ball and ended up getting a corner or something . As it stands now refs do n't play advantage in the box , so if that does n't change then we could have an issue of the attacking team losing possession due to the ref incorrectly calling a penalty .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I sort of agree with you . Especially for checking if a goal was offside or not , however as the other person who replied to you said it would n't work for checking penalty calls . I am not against using technology to make calls , however I believe it has to be done correct and not affect the games flow in anyway what so ever . Goal line technology is a good example of this .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I agree with your reasoning , however if that is the case , I can easily see refs being more harsh with penalty calls as they know it can be reviewed . Then if that 's the case more issues are caused , I explained in more detail why in another of my comments if you are interested in seeing why .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I have to agree with everything you said there , especially the bit about many calls being subjective .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I agree with there being less diving . So it becomes a debate of would you rather have more stoppages and disrupt the flow in some situations or less diving and more correct decisions ( sometimes there is never a correct decision ) .

30503,technology,"I think your analogy is valid and creates a good point .

Maybe I got my other comment wrong and he was chatting bollocks , I do n't know . But I just think his point was n't too outrageous and did n't need a snarky comment in return .

Also many penalty calls are subjective so a video ref wo n't work , my other arguements are in other comments I have recently posted .",Romance,Native
30503,GlobalOffensive,I liked it before when there was an option to mute the other team . Why should normal people have to adept to those that whinge and ca n't type a command in ?

For example if the team acted like complete arses I would be more motivated to play well against them and form a temporary rivalry . On the other hand if the other team are quite nice and we had a good conversation then I find the game more enjoyable and you respect the opponent more . Either way I see a benefit . I just think the game is a bit more bland now . PS you may find this a bit cuntish bit I did enjoy playing the following in warm up now and then .
