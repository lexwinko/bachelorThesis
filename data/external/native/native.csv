ADizzy7,europe,"Your points on the refugee convention are interesting and I thank you for that info . I would like to point out that throughout my comments I have not suggested that Australia simply opens its borders . I believe we do need to have a tough immigration policy because , yes , people do die at sea trying to come to Australia , and also , lets be honest , if we did let everyone in , many many many people would come because Australia is amazing ( most of the time ) . \\n\\nHowever , I think we can agree that the current conditions refugees are kept in are unacceptable , and the political language and policy used against refugees by BOTH major Australian parties is deplorable . For example , they are not referred to as \ '' asylum seekers\ '' or \ '' refugees\ '' , but as \ '' illegal maritime arrivals\ '' ... . My opinion is , we can do better . We can deter refugees while still allowing open and honest journalism , without major human rights organisations accusing the govt . of torture , without keeping children locked up and witness to and victims of abuse . \\n\\nThis situation goes back a long way , I don\\'t know if you know about the Children Overboard scandal , where the government lied and said refugees threw their own children into the ocean so that they would be rescued by the navy , and then used that lie to their own political gain.\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Overboard_affair\\nSo you\\ 'll have to excuse me if I don\\'t trust our government to treat these people with decency.\\n\\nThis is a very nuanced situation , and one that 100 % needs changing . \\nI\\ 've said it already , but its not black and white . It\\ 's not no refugees or all refugees , there is a middle ground that needs to be sought.\\n\\nI think at this point we will probably just keep going in circles , we obviously disagree , which is fine . Thanks for the interesting debate .",Romance,Native
ADizzy7,europe,"But you\\ 've still failed to provide a reason as to what benefit they would have from reporting torture . Not a hypothetical situation , any sources ? Anyone else suggesting the UN is telling lies ? I\\ 've given you a link in which the Prime Minister ( whose policy this is ) has even admitted to bad conditions . Now he hasn\\'t called it torture for obvious reasons , but if you can look at reports from the UN , Amnesty International etc and think \ '' oh it\\ 's just all politics\ '' then I don\\'t know what else to say .",Romance,Native
ADizzy7,europe,"Again , the report of torture comes from\\nthe UN . Not some Australian guy with family in Afghanistan who he wants to come and join him . THE UNITED NATIONS .",Romance,Native
ADizzy7,europe,"At what point did I say we should let the refugees who \ '' skip the queue\ '' in ? I didn\\'t . I simply said the way they are treated now is insane . Priority should be given to refugees in camps , and those who come by legal means ( but that\\ 's not to say those coming by boat may not be legitimate refugees ) . \\n\\nThe world is not black and white . It\\ 's not either- let them all in OR lock them up indefinitely . There is a middle ground , and that\\ 's where Australia\\ 's policy needs some serious changes . \\n\\nEDIT- I should also point out that out current system costs SO much money . More money is spent on asylum seekers held in offshore detention than it would cost to house them in Australia . Here are some articles : \\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-14/cost-of-offshore-processing-united-nations-fact-check/6609764\\n\\nhttp : //www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-09/dunlop-accepting-refugees-makes-the-most-economic-sense/6761770\\n\\n ( an older article but interesting all the same ) http : //oppenheimer.mcgill.ca/A-Price-Too-High-the-cost-of ? lang=fr\\n\\nhttp : //www.amnesty.org.au/resources/activist/Handling_Objections_About_Asylum_Seekers.pdf\\n\\n^^^ this article in particular is a good read . \\n & gt ; But isn\u2019t offshore processing cost effective ? \\nThe Commission of Audit found that it costs more than $ 430,000 to detain an asylum seeker in offshore detention for a year ( or about $ 1200 per day ) . It is estimated to cost less than $ 100,000 a year to hold an asylum seeker in community detention and less than $ 50,000 to host them on a bridging visa . This means **offshore detention is more than eight times more expensive than onshore alternatives** , and asylum seeker policy costs , including offshore detention , are forecast to exceed $ 10bn over the course of the current government.\\n\\n",Romance,Native
ADizzy7,europe,"Again , my qualm with the policy is not that it doesn\\'t \ '' work\ '' ( debatable considering the cost etc ) but I suppose it comes down to whether or not you think breaking the UN convention on human rights is okay because it \ '' works\ '' . \\n\\nEdit to include a source : \\nhttp : //hrlc.org.au/un-finds-australias-treatment-of-asylum-seekers-violates-the-convention-against-torture/",Romance,Native

As i always say when this page is linked , I do not condone the actions of the British in India , however in your own linked article it goes on further to discuss ALL causes of the famine , not just it was the British\\ ' fault , but the inability of the national Indian government to implement coherent policy . \\n\\nFrom the Wiki Page : \\n\\n\ '' Whatever the cause of the famine , deaths could only be prevented by supplies of food from elsewhere in India . This was not forthcoming\ '' \\n\\n\ '' In 1942 , with the permission of the central government , trade barriers were introduced by the democratically elected Provincial governments . The politicians and civil servants of surplus provinces like the Punjab introduced regulations to prevent grain leaving their provinces for the famine areas of Bengal , Madras and Cochin . There was the desire to see that , first , local populations and , second , the populations of neighbouring provinces were well fed , partly to prevent civil unrest.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' even when the Government of India decreed that there should be free trade in grain , politicians , civil servants , local government officers and police obstructed the movement of grain to famine areas\ '' \\n\\n\ '' Eventually there was a clear threat by the Government of India to force the elected governments to provide grain , when the new Viceroy , Archibald Wavell , who was a successful general , was about to take office . For the first time substantial quantities of grain started to move to Bengal\ '' \\n\\nEven if the British were able to assist : \\n\\n\ '' Any imports would have had to come from Australia , North America or South America . Some supplies from Australia entered the region . The main constraint was shipping . The Battle of the Atlantic was at its peak from mid-1942 to mid-1943 , with submarine wolf packs sinking so many ships that the Allies were on the verge of defeat , so shipping could not be spared for India\ '' \\n\\nIt is worth remembering that at this time , Britain was at war with the Nazi\\ 's , their presence in Asia had been greatly reduced and India was largely in control of its affairs . As i said previously , some British policies helped contribute to the Famine , but it was not the only cause and people need to recognise this when they continue to link to this wiki page . \\n\\nAs i said , I am not condoning British actions , I just wish that when we discuss issues and provide evidence to back our claims , that we discuss all factors in the conversation .",Romance,Native

Ax_Dk,europe,"The Famine of 1943 can not just be summed up in one nice little paragraph that says \ '' Britain Bad , India Suffer\ '' . \\n\\nThere are so many reasons for this famine not just that Churchill diverted grain for troops . You also need to look at this from a whole of India situation . \\n\\nCertain areas of India were not producing enough food to feed their populations and were reliant on imports of grains and rice from Burma ( also a british territory ) . \\n\\nWhen Burma fell to the Japanese , this import source was gone . \\n\\nIndian states had a large degree of self governance at this stage and rather than ensure that food was made available to Bengal etc by sending food from states with surplus as they had done in previous decades , they decided to implement price controls etc to try and solve the issue - something that had not previously been tried in India . These price controls meant that states that had surplus food were not willing to send this food to these provinces as farmers would make losses and profits may be released outside of their states . \\n\\nThe failure is the inability to get Indian States to work together for the good of the larger nation , rather than the recently democratic states within India - politicians in these states now felt the need to show that they were standing up for locals first . \\n\\nSo really , if this article was looking to tell a complete story it should expand these subsections . \\n\\nThe British had largely handed power over to the Indian Government and didn\\'t have their hands on their day to day \ '' levers\ '' of running India . \\n\\nI am not saying that this is not the responsibility of the British to fix , but I am sick and tired of the Bengal Famine being bought up as a prime example of how the British Empire failed and as such - should be considered 100 % horrible . Authors always actively ignore the circumstances and go with the revisionist narrative and ignore the fact that India had achieved a level of self governance at this stage sufficient to handle this issue themselves . \\n\\nIf this had happened in 1843 then it would have been 100 % Britain\\ 's mistake .

Ax_Dk,europe,"Trigger Alert : S\u00f8nderjyde ( Synnejyde ) \\n\\nThe constitution of 1849 is the result of a new king Frederick VII coming to power after his father Christian VIII passed away . He was a more liberal king and agreed that Denmark should have a more liberal constitution similar to Norways and so ended the absolute power of the king of Denmark . \\n\\nNow this constitution is a great thing , but also helped break Denmark up further . Danes believed that the extra rights that the Constitution of 1849 should apply to all Danes ( Denmark Proper , Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg ) . Schlesvig Holstein and Lauenberg were in personal union with the Danish king , so not part of Denmark proper , but had large Danish populations , majorities in some areas , minorities in others . Based on the fact that Schlesvig was perceived to be majority Danish , the constitution intergrated Schlesvig into Denmark proper\\n\\nThe majority germans in Holstein and Lauenberg believed that schlesvig should be in union with them and so fought against the Danish king . Denmark won the first Schlesvig war in 1851 , but lost the second in 1864 , resulting in the loss of Schlesvig , Holstein and Lauenberg , as well as the region of southern Denmark ( S\u00f8nderjylland , Synnejylland ) .\\n\\nSo the constitution was good , but indirectly led to the loss of 1/3 of Danish territory and 56 years in exile for my ancestors , who only returned to Denmark in 1920.\\n\\n",Romance,Native

What this means is that , whereas ( for example ) a Typhoon pilot either has to rely on the target data his computers or an ally has supplied , or to look down on his console to task a pod to zoom in on it , an F-35 pilot can target a contact in the same manner as the Typhoon pilot and the F-35 will automatically provide him with zoomed in TV / IR video footage , synthetic aperture radar scans , etc . \\n\\nIn providing CAS , this is an important distinction as it allows you to maintain flight attitude to keep your flying situational awareness , while allowing you to look through your jet to see exactly what is happening on the ground and to confirm or alter directions provided by ground forces.\\n\\nIn the air , it also means that if you wanted to , you could trigger a video portal showing stabilised video of an enemy fighter .

You can absolutely guarantee that it will *not* be invested in the most efficient way from a social , environmental , sustainable , or long-term point-of-view.\\n\\nThis ROI maximisation is not the same as overall value maximisation .

It\\ 's a pretty accurate representation of the failures of the Kuznetsov\\ 's current deployment as well as the ships infamously trouble-plagued lifespan and the crippling deficiencies of STOBAR carriers in general.\\n\\nThe Kuznetov was designed to use VSTOL fighters , but the Russian aerospace industry was unable to produce a capable VSTOL fighter in numbers due to technical inability and budgetary failures , so they jerry-rigged land based fighters to operate off of it , with very marginal performance as a result . \\n\\n & gt ; True it wasn\\'t designed for \\'strike missions\\ ' to some extent , but that doesn\\'t mean its ineffectual there.\\n\\nEvidence indicates otherwise .

The Soviet Union was a much bigger factor in defeating the \ '' fascists\ '' than the USA . That\\ 's not me defending one ideology over the other , it\\ 's me stating a simple fact . By the time the Normandy landings came around , it was already clear that the Third Reich were going to lose the war because they\\ 'd already suffered crippling losses to the Soviets in the east ( Stalingrad and Kursk to name the two biggest ) . The only thing that wasn\\'t clear was how long it was going to take to defeat them and how many were going to die until that point was reached.\\n\\nThe Soviets wanted the western allies to open a western front from pretty much the moment Hitler invaded them . They\\ 'd been fighting the Axis since 1941 and the USA didn\\'t actually join the war in Europe until 1944 at Normandy.\\n\\nOf course , there\\ 's more to it than this - but it\\ 's far too simplistic to say that it was \ '' Free Secular Western Capitalism\ '' that defeated fascism , because that\\ 's patently untrue .

AnDaghdha,europe,"& gt ; This comes from the fact that the \ '' neutral\ '' countries nonetheless benefit from the alliance , while not bearing any cost .

Especially an alliance with a country like America which has been persistently at war with multiple countries and seems to view it as a way to gain favour rather than a last resort . Just because they aren\\'t seeking to relabel the countries they invade or overthrow as the \ '' United States of America\ '' on the map , it does not justify their actions . Even more so when they act undemocratically and on the impulses of their leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's just not true . NATO was becoming almost obsolete , until Putin started his funtiems in the neighborhood . He dragged NATO screaming and kicking back to Cold War . But , hey , such politicians like to have a clear enemy to scare their public with.\\n\\nTo claim NATO is a force for good because Russia is not is deceptive . Both sides act in their own interests . NATO has been acting with disregard since its inception . As has Russia . Putin merely initiated a new theatre in the shit slinging . Neither side is fully at fault . Russia and NATO will always be reacting to what the other side does . I do know however that Russia won\\'t stop doing shit so long as NATO is breathing down its neck and aggravating it . And if you corner a dog , it will bite back.\\n\\nAt the end of the day , my opinion on NATO is mine own ( although I know many share it ) . I don\\'t have to defend my country\\ 's neutrality .

AnExplosiveMonkey,europe,"& gt ; 1 ) You\\ 're presuming that gay people want to get married though . I\\ 'm unsure why gay people would want to get married anymore than straight people , and the latter have been increasingly looking down on marriage - especially the youth.\\n\\nAlready answered \ '' Tax credits , adoption rights , inheritance , next of kin , visitation rights , etc.\ '' \\n\\n & gt ; 2 ) civil unions and cohabitation are valid forms of marriage that don\\'t require the government to tell religions what to do ; the majority of Hindu/Buddhist Asia has split the idea of marriage and legal-marriage.\\n\\nRight , again , you can make a perfectly valid argument against the government being involved in marriage at all , but until the day when that gets resolved , do you propose just leaving out gay people altogether ? Also , do you acknowledge that cohabitation is less than marriage ? \\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) You\\ 're presuming that government has a right to say what a church can do . The definition of marriage can vary from organisation to organisation . If a priest doesn\\'t want to marry a homosexual couple , then why should he be forced to ? \\n\\nWhere ? Where did I do this ? Show me.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying a priest should be forced to do anything . I\\ 'm saying if the priest is *also* willing , where is the problem ? \\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) And you\\ 're focusing on Christianity .

There are many differences between the two . That is not up for debate . \\n\\nHere\\ 's a sample \\n\\n & gt ; And yet some very important inequalities remain . For example , Civil Partnership : \\n\\n - does not permit children to have a legally recognised relationship with their parents - only the biological one . This causes all sorts of practical problems for hundreds of families with schools and hospitals as well as around guardianship , access and custody . In the worst case , it could mean that a child is taken away from a parent and put into care on the death of the biological parent.\\n\\n - does not recognise same sex couples\\ ' rights to many social supports that may be needed in hardship situations and may literally leave a loved one out in the cold.\\n\\n - defines the home of civil partners as a \ '' shared home\ '' , rather than a \ '' family home\ '' , as is the case for married couples . This has implications for the protection of dependent children living in this home and also means a lack of protection for civil partners who are deserted.\\n\\n [ Here ] ( http : //www.marriagequality.ie/marriageaudit/full-list ) \\ 's the full list of 160 differences\\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) If a priest is willing to , but the organisation he works for doesn\\'t , surely he needs to change organisations ? Or lobby the organisatin for support ? It doesn\\'t require government intervention.\\n\\nAgain , I really don\\'t see how we\\ 're disagreeing here . My point is that if priest and church want to do it , they can . If they don\\'t want to , they don\\'t have to . Nobody\\ 's religious freedom is being infringed upon , *despite* your earlier claim that it was\\n\\n & gt ; The alternative argument is , why are you forcing religions to do something and causing so much controversy , rather than allowing freedom of religion\\n\\nWhere is the government intervening in the Church ? It\\ 's intervening with marriage yes , but that is no longer solely the Church\\ 's domain.\\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) Then it\\ 's a Christian issue . It\\ 's nothing to do with gay rights . If Christianity didn\\'t exist , marriage may not even be a thing , let alone gay marriage.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not really sure what your point is ?

Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\\n\\n & gt ; **5 . Rampant Sexism** - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid . Divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\\n\\n & gt ; **6 . Controlled Mass Media** - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . Censorship , especially in war time , is very common.\\n\\n & gt ; **7 . Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\\n8 . Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed\\nto the government\\ 's policies or actions.\\n\\n & gt ; **9 . Corporate Power is Protected** - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\\n\\n & gt ; **10 . Labor Power is Suppressed** - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed.\\n\\n & gt ; **11 . Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested . Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\\n\\n & gt ; **12 . Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\\n\\n & gt ; **13 . Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; **14 . Fraudulent Elections** - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham . Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates , use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and manipulation of the media . Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections .",Romance,Native

For $ 10,000 , someone who was otherwise stateless could become a Tongan Protected Person ( T.P.P . ) and carry a Tonga passport , which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except Tonga , where a T.P.P . was forbidden to settle.\\n\\nWhen some countries rejected the validity of these passports , the King was informed and a new Tongan passport went on sale for $ 20,000 ( or $ 35,000 for a family of four ) . This gave the holder Tongan nationality and a right to settle . South Africans and Libyans as well as hundreds of Hong Kong Chinese were quick to snap up these passports . Imelda Marcos bought one , and in the process became a Tongan citizen . In the past seven years this has produced $ 30 million for Tonga as well as a constitutional crisis . Angry Tongans demonstrated their opposition to the sale of Tongan nationality , called for limitations on the King\\ 's powers ( he was the one to approve the whole thing ) and demanded to know what had happened to the money.\ '' \\n\\nhttp : //www.nytimes.com/1992/06/07/magazine/in-the-court-of-the-king-of-tonga.html ? pagewanted=all & amp ; src=pm",Romance,Native

Now , if you\\ 're looking for the closest approximation of what that deal would look like , look to Canada or South Korea . \ '' But 7 years ! ! Hur Dur ! \ '' All other countries that have gone for a free trade deal have been negotiating from a blank slate . The UK is already compliment with all EU regulations , we\\ 'd just be negotiating on which parts to drop which will take far less time that Canada did.\\n\\nNow , as for why the EU would give us a good deal . Now , I expect you think they\\ 'll try to screw us over to stop others leaving I.e . the abusive partner theory . I disagree with this because you have to think about what will happen in the future . Let\\ 's assume they\\ 're deliberately harsh . Now , if the UK does badly , everyone will blame it on not getting a good deal . Now , while this will certainly discourage other members from leaving , it will leave the EU wit a hostile reputation . Other countries will be less inclined to join the EU , rather they\\ 'd just try for trade deals than locking themselves into a partnership they know they can never leave . \\n\\nConversely , if the UK sees good economic growth , even with a shitty deal with the EU , it will spell the end of the EU . All countries will see the UK thriving outside the unions , even with harsh penalties . This will open the flood gates . The more that leave , the less the bad deal matters as all newly independent countries will trade with each other as well . If that happened , the EU would probably not survive for many years after . Not something the EU wants.\\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about what will happen if they give the UK a good deal . If they give a good deal , and yet the UK does badly , it will send a message to everyone in Europe that membership of the EU is by far in a way the best thing for their economies . All countries in it will give up on the idea of leaving , seeing the economic benefit of staying . Countries not yet in the EU will make it a priority to join , so they can also get the economic boost it provides . All in all , if the UK gets a good deal but fails , it will ensure the further if the EU for decades to come . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about if the UK gets a good deal and also has good economic growth . People will see it as a country doing well , with most of that success based on the free trade deal they got , this reflects well on both parties involved . Now , some countries in the EU will see this as a reason to also leave , however , the EU has several ways to discourage them this way . They can say the UK only got a good trade deal because of it\\ 's large economy , something that would not be afforded to the smaller states . In the case of larger countries like France , they can say the UK is only doing well because it never had to float its own currency after exit , playing up fears amongst eurozone countries that it would be impossible for them to exit the EU because of the Euro . Now , his isn\\'t a perfect way to keep members , but it certainly gives the EU more room to manoeuvre.\\n\\nTLDR : If the EU gives the UK a bad deal , at best the EU will have a hostile reputation and find it much harder to attract new members , at worst , it will lead to the break up of the EU within a few years . If they give the UK a good deal , best case they secure the future of the EU for decades , worth case they have to work hard to stop any further members leaving , but the eurozone members will be easy to keep in the fold . I think in the grand scheme of things , they\\ 'll come down on giving us a good deal .",Romance,Native

12ToneRow,europe,"& gt ; Um , that wasn\\'t Colonialism . At all.\\n\\nFunny , I don\\'t remember saying that it was.\\n\\n & gt ; Firstly , Mongol \ '' rule\ '' in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute . They didn\\'t settle and they never went further West than & gt ; Hungary . They were far too busy fighting themselves.\\n\\nThey were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe . \\n\\n & gt ; Seondly , the Muslims did not colonize Iberia . They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates . There\\ 's a & gt ; distinct difference between conquering with migration , and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the & gt ; overlord , regardless of the conditions of the native population . The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval & gt ; Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.\\n\\nSo numerous slave raids , land grabs , and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods ? Are you saying that they didn\\'t exploit us economically ? \\n\\n & gt ; Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination ? \\n\\nWhat\\ 's funny is the fact that they\\ 're not . They have benefited from their ancestors\\ ' enslavement . They enjoy the same rights as whites do , and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action . They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards . \\n\\n & gt ; To make it simple for you , problems such as wanton corruption , abysmal education , wars , ethnic conflict , and wealth leaving the country are & gt ; extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism , and American neocolonialism during the Cold War . \\n\\nSorry to say , but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history . It\\ 's not the white man\\ 's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape . Not being able to read doesn\\'t cause someone to burn their neighbors alive . \\n\\n & gt ; On top of this , what you are saying is amount to victim blaming , it\\ 's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern & gt ; themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so , and this is directly contradictory to the right of & gt ; self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \\n\\nAnd we did allow them to govern themselves . Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn\\'t obligate us to let them all come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources , and it is in the name of these corporate & gt ; interests that many European interventions have been made , the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.\\n\\nAnd ? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it . If those nations want restitution , they should get it from the companies that exploited them . And again , it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place . \\n\\n & gt ; For an indefinite period of time . We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations , when those problems have been solved & gt ; and we show genuine good will to act in their interests instead of our own , when it comes to the problems in the region , then we can start talking & gt ; about absolving ourselves . In historical terms , this was yesterday.\\n\\nHow about those that exploited Europe then ? Should we continue to make them pay for their past sins indefinitely ? The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid . Some countries I\\ 'm sure , only remain solvent because of the aid we give . Where would you draw the line ? \\n\\n & gt ; Again , the nations are , as these are the same nations today that existed then , only in a more evolved ( or devolved , depending on where you & gt ; stand ) state .

No one is making them accept such working conditions . If someone is , it certainly isn\\'t your average Brit . \\n\\n & gt ; No , the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust , but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the & gt ; people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation . \\n\\nBut Germany wasn\\'t responsible for the establishment of Israel , which impacted the people already living there . \\n\\n\\n\\n",Romance,Native

Due to the fact those people had then been living there for a sum total of 700 years , would you call that economic exploitation , & gt ; or just simply the spoils of war ? \\n\\nYou\\ 're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others . It suits your argument to do so . I don\\'t fault you for that . Interestingly enough , your point about the Reconquista seems to indicate that you think we are even with the muslims . Good , then we don\\'t owe them anything . \\n\\n & gt ; Actual foreign direct investment as opposed to simply handing over a few billion to a government as long as they tow your line , because make & gt ; no mistake that aid money doesn\\'t go to all post-colonial states , just the ones that do what we like.\\n\\nWe could go back to giving them nothing if you like . I\\ 'd certainly like that . \\n\\n & gt ; You should pick up a history book sometime , it might fix that problem of yours.\\n\\nSub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans , Arabs , and Europeans . Maybe you could enlighten me.\\n\\n & gt ; Do you think that the blacks have twice the unemployment simply because they\\ 're lazy and like living off welfare ? Or maybe it\\ 's because & gt ; there\\ 's fuck all educational investment in working class areas . \\n\\nI guess white people don\\'t belong to the working class , right ? Your insults aside , there are many ways one could explain black unemployment numbers . One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with some imaginary inter-generational post traumatic stress . That\\ 's one of the more outlandish explanations for black Americans\\ ' over-representation in violent crime and under-representation in higher education.\\n\\n & gt ; For example , it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests . So , yes , the state does endorse this . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.\\n\\n & gt ; The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief . The thief has all of your shit but you still want him & gt ; to get the fuck out of your house . At the end of it all you have nothing left . Is it your fault ? \\n\\nInfrastructure , education , modern medicine , and a written language in some cases . We gave these things to the colonized . I\\ 'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.\\n\\n & gt ; The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state , which the state benefited from and as such , successive generations of & gt ; people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.\\n\\nWhere does the state get its money ? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution ? That\\ 's my point . Generations today shouldn\\'t be made to suffer for sins of the past . \\n\\n & gt ; Are you some sort of Libertarian that believes everyone can quit a job and move on with their lives ? \\n\\nPeople do it all the time . They weigh the risks and take their chances where they might have more opportunity . Many third world immigrants come to Europe with nothing . Many come illegally . If they can just quit their countries and move to Europe , they can certainly quit a job and move on with their lives.\\n\\nI doubt many of these people care about colonialism . They\\ 've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want . If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners , why don\\'t you do the \\'tolerant\\ ' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis ? Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections ? The possibilities for saying , \ '' We\\ 're sorry\ '' are endless.\\n\\n",Romance,Native

19djafoij02,AskEurope,"[ Does this work ? ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Rhodesia ) \\n\\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the Rhodesian Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a first past the post principle . At some stages , however , there were two-member constituencies , and in the early years there were some appointed members . The 1961 constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\\n\\nAt the time of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence , Rhodesia\\ 's amended 1961 constitution ( which was annexed to the UDI ) provided for an Officer Administering the Government , to be appointed by the British Sovereign ( or by the parliament if the Queen made no appointment ) , with political power residing with the unicameral Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nUnder the 1961 constitution , the Rhodesian Assembly had 65 elected members : 50 constituency members and 15 district members . The voter rolls had education , property and income qualifications . The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95 % of its members were white and 5 % were black or Asian . The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90 % of its members were black and 10 % were white or Asian . The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll . Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts , but for elections in the constituencies , the B roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total , and for elections in the districts , the A roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total . This procedure was known as \\'cross-voting\\ ' . In practice , the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\\n\\nThe 1962 general election was a watershed for the country , since it resulted in the election of a Rhodesian Front government led by Winston Field that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia . The defeated United Federal Party led by Edgar Whitehead had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\\n\\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969 . It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided . African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register , and those that had registered not to vote . Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote , and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25 % .\\n\\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution . This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic , following a referendum result in favour in 1969 . Under this new constitution , there was a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected Senate , and a directly elected House of Assembly , in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the 1961 constitution . The new office of president was a ceremonial post , with executive power remaining with the Prime Minister.\\n\\nThe 1969 constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly . The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans . The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll , and 8 B roll seats . It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached . In addition to the B roll seats , the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members . The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly , with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well . These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.\\n\\nThe new constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms . The concept of \ '' separate development\ '' for blacks and whites was written into that constitution . The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted . This last feature underpinned the concept of \\'equal partnership between black and white\\ ' as an alternative to majority rule . However , the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely , if not for ever . White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance , given enough time . [ 1 ] \\n\\n\\n",Romance,Native

It\\ 's also interesting to see that while nearly all of the districts with high GINI coefficients are represented in Congress by left-liberal Democrats , the districts with higher GINI coefficients don\\'t seem to be politically correlated.\\n\\nThe district with the lowest GINI is VA-11 , which contains the wealthy Washington DC suburbs of Fairfax County and eastern Prince William County south to Dumfries . It is represented by a centrist Democrat.\\n\\nThe district with the 2nd lowest GINI is MN-06 , which covers the wealthy exurbs northwest of Minneapolis , the city and suburbs of St . Cloud , and the rural counties connecting and surrounding the two population centers . This district was represented by ultra-right Tea Party Republican Michelle Bachmann until last year.\\n\\nThe district with the 3rd lowest GINI coefficent is NY-02 . This district covers Long Island and contains southern Nassau County east of Brookyn and southwestern Suffolk County . These suburbs of New York City are prosperous , but not as wealthy as the Hamptons further east ( this is district NY-01 ) . This district is represented by Republican Peter King , who is moderate on economic and social issues but is also one of the biggest foreign policy \ '' Hawks\ '' in Washington.\\n\\nMy own district , VA-05 , is one of the outliers in that it\\ 's a primarily rural district , but it has the 85th highest GINI coefficent .
