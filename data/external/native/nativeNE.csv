03801,soccer,"In Australian rules football a few years ago diving became quite an issue . It got a lot of attention because a lot of people who follow and play the game like to think of it as a tough sport where anything like diving is a disgrace to the game , to the point where if you spent more than a few seconds on the ground , you 'd want to be going off on a stretcher otherwise you 're a softcock . Anyway , there is a 'push in the back ' rule where , strangely enough , if someone pushes you in the back you get a free kick . As the game has evolved into a fully fledged elite sport , some players began to go to ground at the slightest touch to their back to win a free kick and often a shot at goal . The league 's solution to the problem was not to punish the diving , but to make the rule black and white that any contact to the back would be punished with a free kick . At first there was a bit of outrage from supporters saying the rule was soft and too hard on defenders , but eventually they became used to expecting free kicks being paid for contact that once may not have been punished . More importantly , players soon came to learn that they had to learn to defend without making any contact to the back , and so play has now evolved so that it is no longer an issue . So whilst there was for a little while a rise in the number of 'push in the back ' decisions initially , and groaning from supporters when it happened , players eventually adapted and that rate is back to normal , and diving is no longer an issue .",Romance,Native
03801,soccer,"Yeah I 'm not saying the rule change could directly be transferred to another sport , because the issue , whilst related , is not the same . Goals are far more frequent in AFL and free kicks are taken from where they occur , not a penalty spot , so are less of a sure thing . My point is that a carefully considered rule change could help fix the problem .",Romance,Native

Generally Fleet Carriers are the best but need a complement of air craft built for them as well.They have much greater range than any other ship and can support land operations with their aircraft whilst other capital ships can only bombard a province adjacent to the sea . I believe battle cruisers are as fast as carriers with close the same firepower as a battleship , but do n't have as much Armour .

1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,"On the face of it , the remarks made by Iranian President Hassan Rohani during a meeting with senior editors from media organizations on Friday should not have come as a surprise . `` I do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria , '' he said , seemingly contradicting a flurry of reports in recent weeks that Moscow and Tehran were tightly coordinated over the deployment of Russian forces in Latakia , Syria . After Rohani 's unclear statements , Putin 's laconic affirmative to the question posed to him by interviewer Charlie Rose whether his country sent its troops to prevent Bashar Assad 's downfall ( `` You 're right , '' Putin replied ) , was nearly refreshing in its simplicity . We ca n't , of course , accept Putin 's and Rohani 's statements at face value . However , they do show that , despite reports of Iran 's Quds Force commander General Qassem Suleimani 's visit to Moscow and the Fox News report on Friday that Russia and Iran are coordinating actions in Syria from Baghdad , reports by Western journalists stationed in Tehran and Damascus , that Russia 's latest maneuvers `` surprised '' the Iranian leadership and were n't to its liking , were fairly reliable . So far , Russia and Iran were considered to be allies , sharing the common goal of keeping Assad in power . Both supplied arms , lines of credit and military advice to the Syrian regime , with Russia also putting up a diplomatic umbrella by using its UN Security Council veto to prevent anti-Assad resolutions . Iran , through Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militias , supplied manpower to replenish the Syrian army 's thinning ranks . The abrupt entry of the Russian expeditionary force has tilted the scales in the Assad coalition : Russia turned from a distant supporter to an active participant on the ground , becoming overnight a much more influential factor , in a way which made her different interest in the survival of the Damascus regime plainly evident . For the leaders of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran , keeping Syria on the Shi'ite axis as a link to their proxy in Lebanon , Hezbollah , was almost an existential need . Without Syria , Iran 's regional influence and its ability to control what is happening in Lebanon – to direct , arm and maintain Hezbollah as a central force – would have been crippled . For Putin , however , leaving Assad to his fate would have , at worst , lost the Kremlin some of its prestige . The Russian president 's decision to take a chance and invest resources in Syria after all was primarily driven by a desire to take advantage of the vacuum created by U.S. inaction in the Middle East . Putin seeks to create leverage that would allow Russia to regain the place it lost in the international arena in the wake of last year 's invasion of Ukraine . Syria , Assad and Iran 's interests have now become hostages to Putin 's geopolitical goals . The Russian president could decide , for example , as he apparently already agreed to at his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week , to coordinate his steps with Israel as well and to permit the Israeli air force to continue to fly over Syria and attack Hezbollah weapon convoys ( as foreign reports claim Israel has already done in recent years ) . With the consent of Europe and the United States , he could force elections on Assad as well as cooperation with members of the opposition , including those who oppose Iranian involvement in Syria . Putin could decide that it would be better for Russia to involve Iran ’ s Sunni rivals – Saudi Arabia and Egypt – in a future solution to the civil war . Moreover , at any stage , he could also decide to bring the Russian forces home with their gear . Unlike Russia ’ s support for separatists in Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , there is no Russian national yearning for Syrian land in Aleppo and Homs province . In the event of a deal in which Russia would receive Western recognition for a portion of its aspirations in former Soviet areas in return for cooperation in finding a long-term solution in Syria that might stop the flow of refugees to Europe , and maybe even allow their return home , Putin would not hesitate to abandon the Iranians . Another angle in the relationship between Russia and Iran can be currently seen through the eyes of the masses of Syrian refugees flooding European highways . Among them are a considerable number of citizens who are actually from areas and population groups that support Assad . They recount that they decided to leave because they came to the conclusion that even if the Assad regime survives , it will only be as an Iranian satellite - an alternative that in their view , as secular Syrians , is not much more appealing than being ruled by Islamic State . The entry of Russia into the region raises the prospect that areas in Syria that remain under the Assad 's control , or anyone who would replace him , could actually end up under Russian influence , rather than an Iranian Shi ’ ite province . In Western eyes , that may not be such a great deal , but for many Syrians , it would be a lot preferable than the other options .",Romance,Native

Especially when they were part of the problem . The cognitive dissonance that people have on this topic is nothing short of incredible to me . Constitutional politics was the only thing that could actually bring about peace in the end - but you seem to be drastically underestimating how difficult it would have been to convert an organisation as inherently violent as the IRA to politics . Adams and McGuinness could n't just get up one morning and say `` You know what , no more violence ! From now on the IRA are political '' . The IRA would have pushed back , and both of them might well have lost any influence they had with them to begin with . It took a long time because it 's not something that can be achieved overnight . & gt ; You praise their `` achievements '' . I do n't see what they 've achieved that would n't have been achieved anyway through politics and the ECHR with far less bloodshed . As far as I can see , all they did was knock a United Ireland back another hundred years . The Troubles was a completely predictable conflict . It became inevitable because of how the orange state was set up and how the majority ( Protestants ) reacted to the pretty tame demands of a minority ( Catholics ) . They reacted with violence , violence and yet more violence . To say that we could have gone from that to a power sharing government through entirely political means is revisionism at its worst . Political methods were already attempted well before the PIRA gained support - that 's what the civil rights movement was all about . It was the reaction of the Loyalist community and the RUC to that movement that led to the growth of the PIRA and the escalation of the conflict . This also began before Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness became involved with either the IRA or Sinn Fein .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The `` Orange State '' - or Northern Ireland as it existed from the mid 60 's until the 70 's when direct rule was imposed , was a hugely sectarian state .

The civil rights marches that started to take place in the early 70 's opposing these injustices were met with state and , in particular , Loyalist violence . In one incident , entire streets of Catholic residences were burned to the ground in Belfast by armed Loyalist gangs .

The PIRA in Northern Ireland were a reaction to a pre-existing situation . Catholics and Nationalists were , in effect , second class citizens . They organised peaceful civil rights marches to oppose this and the response of the good , non-terrorist police force of the Northern Irish statelet was to beat these marches off the streets . The response of the loyalist community was to orchestrate what can only be called pogroms against Catholic communities in Belfast . This is the environment that the PIRA grew out of .

Are you disputing the assertion that Catholics in the late 60 's and early 70 's were treated with discrimination by the government in Northern Ireland ? Are you disputing that their attempts at civil right 's marches were met with violence on the part of the RUC and state forces ? Are you disputing that Loyalist gangs burned over a thousand Catholics out of their homes in Belfast and elsewhere ? Are you disputing that the PIRA therefore gained support from the Catholic community because of the latter 's treatment at the hands of their own government ? Nelson Mandela was the leader of the violent wing of the ANC ( MK ) . This group was responsible for bombings all over South Africa . These bombings often happened in public places like shopping centres , bars , bins in public streets , and inevitably led to civilian casualties . Sound familiar ? Mandela is ( rightly in my opinion ) remembered for his role in ending Apartheid and his role in promoting peace in South Africa .

Now , I 'm not trying to make these attacks any more palatable and I 'm not trying to justify them - but what I am saying is that you need to have a special kind of wilful ignorance to pretend that the people who joined the `` Old '' IRA were morally superior to people like McGuinness who joined the PIRA in the late 60 's . Both organisations were willing to use extreme violence to achieve their goals - and civilians were caught in the crossfire in both instances . More notable , in my opinion , is the actions of McGuinness after he left the IRA . He turned himself away from violence and he also turned others away from it with him .

The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit . Northern Ireland is a better place today because they managed to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Plenty of men go down the violent path and never turn back . McGuinness not only turned back from it himself , but he turned others back from it along with him .",Romance,Native

I 'm not going to sit here and try to defend planting bombs in public areas because that 's indefensible . But it seems to me that if your sole objective is to kill civilians then it seems odd that you would give warnings before you do so . That was my point . & gt ; This is splitting hairs - he was very likely to have been involved in several bombings , and was even briefly arrested for being near bomb parts .

As I see it though , you 'd need to be equally magnanimous to assume that Mandela did n't know about the pub bombings , car bombings and street bombings that MK were carrying out . Pretending that the IRA targeted civilians when they planted bombs in public areas but that MK were only targeting industry and economy when they did it is ... well , ridiculous - especially when the IRA gave warnings before their bombs and MK did n't ( as far as I 'm aware , correct me if I 'm wrong ) . Also , McGuinness was n't second in command of the IRA overall - he was second in command of the IRA 's operation in Derry at the time of Bloody Sunday .

Mandela 's an example of someone who completely supported using violence to achieve political change , only to change in his later years ( but not a whole lot as that article I linked shows ) .

You can tack on `` according to Sinn Fein supporters '' all you like but it does n't diminish the fact that there was little to no public support for armed rebellion in the Republic until the British were foolish enough to execute the leaders of the 1916 Rising . Also , Irish people in the mid 10 's were n't treated as second class citizens in their own country - as was the case in Northern Ireland when the PIRA began to gain support . There was nothing glamorous about the way the `` Old '' IRA fought the war of independence either . It was bloody , it was brutal and it often led to the deaths of innocent people as well as British forces . That 's how guerrilla warfare tends to go .

Your point about the government is n't exactly accurate either . Look up the Arms Crisis . Two cabinet members ( Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney ) attempted to smuggle arms to the PIRA in the North .

Gandhi was born into a completely different system . You ca n't just transplant him from India to Northern Ireland and expect him to turn out the same way . Also , Gandhi made frequent use of Hunger Strikes to get his point across - I do n't think I need to remind you of what happened when republicans tried the same . The Hindu religion also heavily influenced Gandhi and how he interacted with the Indian population . Religion in Northern Ireland was the exact opposite of a unifying factor .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,worldnews,For people outside of Ireland and the UK who may be curious - Northern Ireland has a devolved government with a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister who are essentially Northern Ireland 's co-equal leaders . They 're the leaders of the biggest Nationalist party ( Sinn Fein ) and Loyalist party ( the DUP ) respectively . McGuinness resigning essentially means that Arlene Foster 's position as the First Minister is rendered null and void too .

Do you think he 'd be immediately assassinated after calling out Gerry Adams ? If everything he 's saying about Adams is true then that would be an incredibly stupid move because it would all but confirm it to the public . The point I 'm making is that it 's an allegation made by someone we do n't know anything about apart from what you heard on that programme . You 're saying it 's dumb for people to mindlessly defend Adams and it is - but it 's also dumb to completely believe what a TV programme is saying when they 've provided scant to no evidence to back it up .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,"I 'm not sure what you want me to tell you - what you 've said is right , but the prevailing attitude at the time was that France was the biggest land power in Europe . That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Agreed . The problem with trying to portray the conflict as a simple religious conflict is that it completely oversimplifies the origins of it . The conflict was political . The Orange state was segregated - one side ( Loyalists/Protestants ) had a disproportionate amount of influence and power over the other and they abused it . The RUC ( and later the army ) responded to peaceful Nationalist protests by beating them off the streets and Loyalist gangs burned entire communities out of their homes in Belfast . That 's why the PIRA started to grow . Nobody joined the PIRA in the early 1970 's because they were Catholic . Painting the Troubles as a purely religious conflict is revisionism at its worst . It makes it seem as if this was something that was always going to happen in the North regardless of what the political situation was .

We were told that the invasion was happening because Iraq had WMD 's and Chilcot has shown that the intelligence behind this claim was shaky at best ( and turned out to be false ) and that very little effort was made to try peaceful alternatives . The ramifications of this war have been colossal - without it there would likely be no ISIS and the refugee crisis would likely be much less severe , if indeed there would be one at all . It 's been the primary cause of the current situation in the Middle East . Now , none of that absolves Russia of its responsibility in Aleppo - and definitely not in Ukraine , but I just think that this whole attitude that one side is evil and the other side is not is unhelpful at best .

Do you seriously think you 'll be saving any money if the USC is scrapped ? It 'll be collected somewhere . The USC is a tax that 's based on income which means people who earn less pay less .

08TangoDown08,ireland,My point is that I do n't think there 's anyone actively refusing to work because of the USC .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ah now , you 're being even more revisionist . The ceasefire broke down mostly because the British Government were refusing to allow Sinn Fein to take part in peace talks unless the PIRA completely decommissioned all of its arms . John Major 's government was depending on unionists to keep its majority so they refused to back down from that position . It 's also complete nonsense to suggest that the IRA came to the negotiating table because John Bruton had no time for them . The ceasefire was resumed because the British Government eventually decided to include SF in the peace talks if the IRA reinstated it . Which they did . It 's why Loyalists will later accuse Blair 's government of being `` Bombed back to the table '' . Either way , and to get back to the point a bit , the 1994 ceasefire pretty much ended the majority of the violence . Loyalist paramilitaries announced ceasefires shortly after it .

The GFA was n't the sole brain child of John Bruton , Bertie Ahern or anyone else . It was something that required an enormous amount of work , diplomacy and risk from all sides but mostly from the parties in N. Ireland itself . Ahern and Bruton before him might have facilitated dialogue between the conflicting sides in the North but they certainly did n't come up with the whole agreement ( and the plan to implement it ) all by themselves . Also , did n't Bruton ( while in power ) say he was fed up talking about the peace process ? I have n't heard another political leader from Ireland or Britain say that .

It 's very easy to apply hindsight to the situation and say `` well non violence was clearly the better option '' . Any one of us can say that .

As for SF , they 're a republican party . They 're going to oppose direct rule as vehemently as they can - it 's not particularly surprising that they 'd prefer to remain in government with the DUP than have the whole of the North governed from Westminster again .

It arose from the state forces ' decision to brutally suppress civil rights marches and movements .

This helps places like Donegal that have been pretty isolated ever since partition . It also removes currency as an obstacle - the Republic no longer loses trade to the North when the sterling currency is weaker and vice versa - the economic environment is much more consistent .

There will be a significant cost to the republic if reunification happens , of that there 's no doubt , but I sincerely doubt that we would end up funding the same amount that the UK government does . Incidentally , reunification can only be a positive thing for the border communities that have been left isolated since partition . It would create a consistent economic situation across the 32 counties . It might cost us in the short term but in the long term , cities like Derry and Belfast can only bring economic benefits to the country as time goes on .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,worldnews,I do remember reading a study that stated that about 1/3 of Seoul is within range of the North Korean artillery stationed along the DMZ - but they also supposedly have quite a large stockpile of chemical weapons . The contaminants in these chemical shells could spread a decent bit further away from where it impacted - depending on weather conditions and such . North Korea is a state that will be fighting for its own existence if war breaks out . I think it 's pretty likely that they will resort to using these kinds of weapons . They do n't need to worry about the opinions of the rest of the world because the rest of the world already thinks they 're a mental dictatorship .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,worldnews,"This is such a misguided point of view that I really do n't know where to begin . What will you say to the 25 million people living in Seoul , which is 35 miles from the DMZ and has in or around 10,000 North Korean artillery pieces pointed directly at it ? Artillery pieces that are also capable of launching chemical and biological weapons at the south too , by the way . Americans presuming that they have the right to decide the fate of a city like Seoul , or the fate of the millions of North Koreans that South Korea and China will need to house and feed when the war is over is one of the most fucked up things about all of this . Nobody else in that region wants this war to happen at all , nobody else is frothing at the mouth to get in a conflict with the North Koreans - the USA and North Korea are both unique in that respect . If a war happens , it will be because of the tension between the USA and North Korea .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"& gt ; Yeah , if Kim hits anything at all , most Americans would fully support turning North Korea into a glass desert . To be honest , I think this is a bit of a selfish mentality as far as the USA is concerned . Sure , striking Guam and killing people who live there would be awful - but if war breaks out , it wo n't be the USA who will face the worst of the consequences . It will be South Korea . Seoul , the South Korean capital , is a city of about 25 million people and it 's only 35 miles from the DMZ . North Korea has literally thousands of conventional artillery guns pointed directly at Seoul . They can kill thousands , perhaps even millions , of South Koreans without needing nuclear weapons . And that 's before you consider the fact that they can use artillery shells to deliver chemical and biological weaponry too . North Korea would definitely lose in a conflict with South Korea , the USA and Japan . But they pack a punch . And it 's South Korea who 's going to have to take that punch , and then recover enough to the point where they will need to deal with whatever comes after North Korea . Most likely , that would mean either reunification or thousands and thousands of underfed , malnourished and brainwashed North Koreans streaming into their country . All of this while rebuilding what 's left of Seoul . China 's still a huge unknown in this too . If they decide to intervene on the side of the North as they did in the first Korean war , then it 's likely to end the same way it did then and we 're all back to square one - thousands of deaths later .",Romance,Native

A big issue is the number of Muslims who hold similar beliefs to extremists but are not willing to carry out an attack .

About 20 % of British Muslims either thought the 7/7 bombings were justified or they sympathised with the attackers . More than 20 % of British Muslims want Sharia law in Britain . According to [ this ] ( http : //www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ ) pew poll , about 8 out of every 10 Muslims in Egypt and Pakistan think that stoning is an appropriate punishment for adultery . You can also clearly see the very high percentage of Muslims who support the death penalty for apostasy . More and more polls from across the Islamic world show the same thing - very high levels of support for these kinds of beliefs . This is a very complicated issue and there are no easy solutions - but we need to be honest about what the problems are . These toxic beliefs , and the readiness with which many Muslims adopt them , are a very big part of the problem .

It would still be an absolute humanitarian disaster if they managed to land even one , but it would n't take down the US government or the US military , and North Korea would quite probably still fall to the US and its allies .

Unfortunately , Austria moved in with a much larger force and somehow control of the siege switched to them . When the siege was over , Neumark was occupied by Austria and not me . Fast forward a bit and the war is going predictably well . The problem I had was that even though my warscore was more than high enough , I was n't able to demand Neumark from the Teutonics ( presumably because it was occupied by Austria and not me ) and had to wait a stupid amount of time for them to make a separate peace with Austria before I could move in and take the province for myself .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Freedom of speech means that you can voice your opinion and your views without being imprisoned or persecuted for doing so . The exception is when you are not just voicing an opinion but inciting action in other people - specifically violence or prejudice . This is hate speech , which is , as far as I know , illegal in most western countries - but I 'm open to correction on that . Also , if you 're working for a company and you say something that could be seen as homophobic or anti-semitic , then that company has every right to dismiss you from your job because they also have a right to protect their own image . In this respect , free speech does n't mean you 're always free to say whatever you want without consequence - but what it does mean is that nobody should be able to have others silenced because they find them `` offensive '' .",Romance,Native

Free speech does n't mean you 're entirely free to suffer no consequences for anything that you 'll ever say . If I incite someone to commit violence against another , then I 'm guilty of hate speech - which is a crime . Voicing your opinion and inciting action against someone else for voicing theirs is two completely different things and I 'm honestly confused as to why you 're conflating them . Demanding that I change my behaviour because of how you feel when I say something to you is making me responsible for how you feel . I can choose to be offended or I can choose not to be offended - my choice is n't the fault of any other person but me . Feelings are n't a moral currency .

The very real danger here is that those with this knowledge are getting older and they will eventually die , taking everything they know with them .

With all of that being said - there is a massive problem in the Islamic world and with the Islamic faith . If someone can kill dozens of innocent people and expect divine reward for doing so , and if their `` interpretation '' of the faith remains a pretty straightforward one as far as the original texts are concerned - then of course there is a massive problem within the faith . This is why this should be considered a war of ideas and this is why we need to empower moderate Muslims within the Islamic world . How do we do that ? Again , I do n't know .

The i7 's are a bit different because if you 're someone who cares about having extremely high fps over anything else , then you 're obviously going to go with a 7700k .

Because the entire region ( ie . not just Iraq ) did not become what it is today until after Saddam was deposed . The schism between Shia and Sunni has existed for literally centuries - so that has always been a destabilising factor in the region .

There are many in the north who would never vote for them Well sure , but to me that 's a separate argument to saying that SF need to `` disband '' and that FG or FF need to take their place . SF are , by quite a margin , the biggest nationalist party in the North . They represent a large number of Nationalists - they 're already key participants in power sharing so to me it seems inevitable that they need to be key participants in showing Unionists that a United Ireland is a place in which they are welcome .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,This is one of the most depressing songs I 've ever heard .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yeah , because neither FF nor FG have any history of violently opposing British rule in Ireland ( /s ) . Unionists were convinced enough to go into power sharing with Sinn Fein . It 's people with your mentality that are the obstacles in this . We 're not living in the 1980 's anymore . Why would Unionists be any more willing to vote for one of two parties who never even attempted to run candidates in the North ? What hope does a party like Fine Gael , who have little to no connection with Northern Ireland , have of convincing a population from there to see things their way ? Unionism is still at odds with Republicanism in the North . The only way to bridge this gap is by having Unionists and Republicans in the North working together - that 's the pre-requisite . Sinn Fein have a large majority among the Nationalist community so the onus is arguably on them to convince Unionists that their vision for a united Ireland is one that includes them .",Romance,Native

Well , I do n't know the man so I ca n't say I know what his character 's like .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"& gt ; I really hope this does n't trigger a resurgence of the IRA . The last thing the UK needs is a repeat of The Troubles . Unlikely . Northern Ireland in the late 60 's and early 70 's was basically a sectarian shithole . Catholics/Nationalists were essentially second class citizens - they did n't have the same ability to vote , most of the land/businesses were owned by Protestants who refused to hire Catholics and when the Catholic community arranged peaceful protests to oppose this situation , they were met with state violence on behalf of the RUC ( police ) and later the British army , and also violence from the Loyalist/Protestant community who started rioting at these protests and even burned entire streets of Catholics out of their homes . The British army was actually sent into Northern Ireland in 1969 to protect Catholic communities from loyalist pogroms and gangs . It was within this climate that the IRA gained its support among the Catholic/Nationalist community . They promised to defend Catholic areas from Loyalist violence and to push back against the state forces . As you can imagine , this was a popular idea among Nationalists and the IRA grew in support - particularly after Bloody Sunday . Northern Ireland is a completely different place today . Organisations like the IRA simply would n't gain the support of entire communities anymore because the political climate is so drastically different . Put simply , most people have no reason to resort to or justify violent acts anymore .",Romance,Native

Catholics are n't second class citizens anymore and they are n't having their peaceful protests being met with state violence - so there would be literally no public support for them today . It 's more likely that the smaller dissident groups may become more active - but nothing like there was during the Troubles .

That 's a bit presumptuous of you - not all of us are mouth-breathing idiots , we just do n't like seeing our national flag being burned as part of a celebration . You did n't really address my point either , you just waved it away with `` not all of them do it '' . It might not be a part of the marches but it 's a part of almost every bonfire that happens in Belfast and around the North . The point is that there is enough of them doing it to indicate that it 's considered an acceptable way to express their culture . I 've never seen a unionist leader directly ask them to stop burning flags - maybe you have , but I have n't . The problem I have with this celebration is that it 's carried out in a deliberately triumphalist and antagonistic way . You did n't answer my two biggest questions so I 'll ask them again . Why do they need to burn tricolours to express their culture ? Why do they need to march through predominantly nationalist areas ? If they just built bonfires and kept their marches to areas less likely to generate conflicts , then I 'd have absolutely no problem with what they 're doing .

This is a group of grown adults who are under the impression that this is a legitimate way to express their `` culture '' . And yet , republicans are often described as the confrontational ones . There is nothing in the republican calendar that even compares with the twelfth . Irish people do n't get together on a specific day every single year and burn union flags or effigies of UK or loyalist leaders . It 's deliberately antagonistic .

There 's been numerous accusations of collusion between the British state and the UDA . Most of these groups have called a ceasefire on their activities .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"& gt ; There is this unbearable tendency in the west today to treat Arabs like children who can never act but can only react to what the western adults do -- naked , brown children running around without any agency whatsoever . & gt ; This is absurd , and if this were a western organization they would never be shielded from responsibility this way . & gt ; They are adults , responsible for their own choices and actions . No one forced them to adopt the principles of medieval theocracy and try to carry them out in the 21st century . They chose to do this . While I do concede that those who actually physically formed and organised ISIS do deserve the bulk of the blame , your response seems to ignore some general facets of human nature . I 'm not viewing Arabs and Middle-Easterners as children . They are no more susceptible to falling victim to tyrannical regimes than any other group of people - hell , it was happening in Eastern Europe in the 90 's . Your assertion that everyone who is currently under the yoke of the Islamic state knowingly chose to be under that yoke is just wrong . The majority of them probably just ended up living there because of pure dumb luck when ISIS chopped up Iraq and Syria - these people just happened to be living in areas that fell into their control . The argument I was making is that ISIS and al Qaeda were both non existent in Iraq until Saddam was deposed . Now , Saddam Hussein was probably the worst dictator the world has seen since Hitler - but he was just as brutal towards Islamic extremists as he was with any other perceived threat to his power . Toppling Saddam 's regime without replacing it with a strong ( and preferably non sectarian ) government ( and also disbanding the Iraqi military ) is what allowed ISIS and al Qaeda to establish their footholds in Iraq .",Romance,Native

They promised universal health care for everyone and this is what they 're actually giving us . Free gp care for a small minority of the population . An important minority , but a minority nonetheless . And it 's no coincidence that it 's being introduced now either with less than a year before a general election .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ireland is a country that was founded by people with blood on their hands . People who ordered deaths , atrocities , bombings , assassinations - the whole lot . People we 'll be celebrating next year , as it happens . Governments kill people , the only difference is the British government ( and other governments worldwide ) are able to do it without having the term `` terrorist '' applied to them . And yes , the Paras were n't running for any public office , but on the subject of Pat Finucane , it 's claimed that some very senior politicians in Margaret Thatcher 's government knew all about the collusion with the loyalist paramilitaries . You can debate how relevant that is to the discussion if you want but there 's no shortage of politicians on the other side of the fence who have as much , if not more , blood on their hands as Sinn Fein . We never hear as much bloviating about them , do we ? Gerry Adams has been `` playing big boy politics with the grown ups '' for a very long time now - say what you like about him but he 's considered one of the most adept politicians on the island . I do n't think even people who hate the man can deny that the Peace Process was a monumental political achievement ( probably the biggest political achievement since the foundation of the state ) - and it would never have happened without Gerry Adams .

They apologised for Bloody Sunday , but it took thirty eight years , a shambles of a report and a twelve year inquiry before they dropped their accusations that the innocent people who were killed attacked the paras first . Maybe you know more than I do , but I do n't recall the British Government ever apologising for Ballymurphy , or even acknowledging their responsibility for it for that matter . Why is n't our media focusing on getting justice for those families too ? Jean McConville 's murder was an atrocity , but why is it more important than the Ballymurphy families ? And this is the problem . There 's always another death , another atrocity and another finger pointing at the other side . The line needs to be drawn somewhere or we just keep going back and forth and the peace process will remain in an uneasy stasis forever , or break down entirely . Personally , I just think it 's deplorable that so many people on this side of the border pick and choose their atrocities because of how they feel about Gerry Adams or Sinn Fein .",Romance,Native

Quick reminder of what the `` bad old days '' were like for the ( seemingly large ) number of southerners with short memories ? Daily bomb scares - both real and hoax , public shootings , army checkpoints and thousands of dead and injured victims . And that 's only dealing with the attitude behind the remark . Now I 'll deal with the subject of it . Gerry Adams , love him or hate him , played an absolutely massive role in the peace process and in the decommissioning of the PIRA . Like it or not , the Troubles probably would n't have ended without his intervention . Now , if you can seriously believe that the peace process ( in its near-permanent state of instability ) would not be endangered if Gerry Adams ( or his family ) were to be blown up by dissidents then I 'm not sure what else to say .

08TangoDown08,ireland,Oh do n't give me that shite . European countries having to put up with economic hardships due to an influx of immigrants is nothing compared to the hell that some of those people have come through . Get down from your ivory tower .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Fuck off . People in Ireland are infinitely better off than these people - the biggest thing we 're concerned about at the moment is the bloody SiteServ scandal . You and people with your attitude are a bloody wart on the face of Ireland . Irish people emigrated everywhere looking for a better life and now you want to slam the door in the face of people trying to do the same . Well , fuck you .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"With any luck , back into the fiery chasm from whence they came .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Well , I certainly do n't see much difference . FG have only really continued FF 's policies after all .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"If you 're going to consider the IRA as war criminals then you need to extend that same description to members of the British Army , the RUC , the loyalist paramilitaries like the UDA and the UVF and maybe even people who incited so much violence like Paisley and others . So my question to you is where does it stop ? When does it stop ? When half of Northern Ireland 's in prison ? The Good Friday Agreement and the Peace Process as a whole has only been as successful as it is because both sides have made compromises . Both sides have had to make concessions and both sides have made sacrifices to keep the peace . Continually digging up stuff and pointing the finger at only one side ( as happens all the time in the Republic ) is not going to help anything in the slightest . It will only make things worse .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"So how do you define a war , then ? Is it exclusively when two countries fight with large , equally matched armies on each others terms ? The Viet Cong fought a Guerrilla campaign yet I assume you consider that a war simply because more people died in it ? You 're being ridiculous . And I do n't think you should underestimate the British Empire 's willingness to kill a shit ton of people just to assert themselves . It would hardly be the first time . It would n't even be the first time in Ireland . EDIT : And they tried their best with the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries - let 's not forget those lovely people .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't disagree with you on the Pat Finucane issue and I do n't think any right-minded person would - Sinn Fein ( and really every political entity in the North ) should be pushing for more there . And yes , I 'm sure your second point rings true for certain people too , but I 'm still having trouble seeing where this relates to the `` dishonorable silence '' from the British government on charges of collusion . People on this side of the border always seem to get more riled up about what Republicans did than what the British did . How often have you heard Sinn Fein politicians being talked into making apologies for the IRA over the years ? Countless , and yet I do n't hear our government or media making a similar effort to get the British government to make their apologies . EDIT : I mean , it took 38 years , one sham report and one twelve-year inquiry to even get them to apologise for Bloody Sunday for christ sake .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It never ceases to amaze me how issues like these inevitably end up turning into debates on the morality and responsibility of Republicans . This was an article on the collusion between NI security forces and loyalist paramilitaries . The RUC were the police force of the Orange state , their job was to protect everyone who lived there , and instead they took a side . The responsibility for that resides with them , and them alone . Now , you could perhaps argue that Sinn Fein and Republicans are n't vocal enough on this subject , but that seems to contradict what you 've said at the end of your post . They 're trying to make political capital out of it , and yet they 're not pressing it ?",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,A lot of our growth figures include the growth of large US multinationals that do n't actually contribute financially to the State in any meaningful way ( the jury 's still out on whether the `` fixed '' loophole will change that ) . Our unenemployment figures are massaged by schemes like Jobridge that give people an extra twenty quid on their dole - I think these things really need to be taken with a pinch of salt .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I am , yes . But then I 've been voting for them for the past few years . Sinn Fein have the largest political presence in my county ( Donegal ) , and they 've put a lot more effort into my area than any of the other parties . Probably not saying much but there we are . As for the leadership , I have a certain amount of sympathy for where you 're coming from OP , I admire Adams too , and at the same time , I can understand why people would be hesitant to vote for him . But I think it 's worth remembering that Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others ( including less controversial figures like Hume and the SDLP ) are largely responsible for the adoption of the single most significant political agreement in this country since probably the foundation of the state . People should remember that when they doubt their `` competance '' , as a few people here have mentioned . I think it 's also worth remembering that there was a very good reason for Adams 's repeated denial of being a member of the IRA . He needed to hold influence with fellow politicians ( who would be infinitely less willing to negotiate with him if he admitted to being a member ) but he also needed to maintain his influence with the IRA and IRA hardliners to be able to actually bring anything meaningful to the negotiation table ( which is why he has always vocally supported them too ) . He needed a hand in each basket , as it were .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,There 's as much evidence to show that he did n't as there is to show that he did . Just because you say something over and over again does n't mean it 's true . You have no insider knowledge on the affair and you 're only showing your bias when you keep repeating yourself .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"The political motivations are obvious - Enda , Fianna Fail , Fine Gael and others have never shown any interest in these victims until now . A year before an election ( in which Sinn Fein are expected to make gains at their expense , I might add ) . Adams has spoken with the Gardai and the PSNI , I 'm fairly sure you do n't know what information was given and neither do I . But to suggest that anyone knew `` fucking everything '' about it is a massive oversimplification . You might as well say that every successive Taoiseach and Church leader knew about every single abuse case in the Catholic institutions in this country in the past seventy years or so . You 're being absurd .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,I recently learned that the word Tory ( as in the Tories in the UK ) [ is derived from the Irish word tóraidhe . ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory # History_of_the_term ) I think it 's pretty interesting that the term has stuck to them the way it has - especially when you consider the meaning !,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Oh , grow up . I really hate the self-serving snobbery that so many people here in the republic have when they refer to Sinn Fein and Republicans . This is old ground , but I 'll humour you . Yes , the IRA did some terrible things and yes , horrible people associated themselves with the organisation and republicanism . Do I think Adams is one of them ? No . If it were n't for people like Adams we 'd still be in the dark ol ' days of death and destruction , or there 'd still be a sizeable chunk of Nationalists/Catholics in the North living as second class citizens . Perhaps if everyone on this side of the border got as riled up about that at the time as they do about republicans now , we could have avoided a lot of the shit that we had to wade through hmm ?",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Myself ? I honestly do n't care if he was in the IRA or not , but I know there 's plenty of people who do - that 's their prerogative . But to answer your question , I do n't know . I do n't think anyone could answer that but Adams himself - and since a lot of people would n't be satisifed with his answers ( regardless of if they happened to be true or false ) , then it 's a dead horse that always seems to be getting beaten .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I was talking about the previous government , the current government is the one I was referring to when I mentioned the scandals and incompetency . The bailout was covered on the front page yes , but only after it had happened - did you forget the fact that the government lied about meeting with the troica or did you choose to ignore it ? Either way , I 'm not trying to turn yet another thread on /r/Ireland into a political debate over the moralities of Sinn Fein , you 're not going to change your opinion because of an internet debate and nor am I - I was merely pointing out a hypocrisy that I 'd noted on `` Renua '' 's website .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"It 's funny how their website states that they will consider going into government with any of the other political parties except for Sinn Fein , due to their lack of `` transparency '' . I 'm sorry ... have the past 2 coalitions been visions of transparency themselves ? The government who covertly brought the troica here and the government whose entire tenure has been wracked with scandals and incompetency ? They seem to be desperately searching for a niche to fill . With the pending downfall of Labour and the extinction of the PD 's and Greens , I suppose the next government party will need a new whipping boy . Also , what about this gem of a quote from their website : `` Those who are not self reliant will be imprisoned rather than released by a life on welfare . '' I understand it 's not to be taken literally , but still !",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Renua ? What the fuck does that mean ?,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"So ... the Irish government are `` others '' , in your view ? It 's not as if I 'm blaming a foreign country for our problems - I 'm blaming our government for it . And that 's more than fair , if you ask me . You 're treating the symptom as if it were the cause . There 's a bloody reason why people are n't arsed to learn their country 's language - and as far as I 'm concerned , putting it down to sheer laziness is an oversimplification . The fact is , the Irish language is pushed on everyone from a fairly young age , you 're made to learn it because that 's what 's required of you , not because you actually like speaking it . It takes away any real love for the language when you 're forced to do it incessantly , even if you do n't like learning off poems and stories by heart . EDIT : On top of that , you never really `` speak '' the language anyway . Aside from the stupid Leaving Cert oral , most of your time is spent learning the same sort of pseudo-academic shite that you learn off for English - the only difference being that most people are already fluent with English and it is n't as tedious .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yeah fair point , it 's been neglected by every government in recent memory . I still think the buck stops with the government in power though . I absolutely hate the fact that I spent about thirteen years of my life learning a language that I 'm still terrible at . What I hate even more is the fact that the way it 's taught makes it extremely tedious for most students to learn , who will then lose any interest in pursuing it when they get older . Kenny 's right about one thing , it 's our national language - but it 's to his ( and every Taoiseach and government in recent memory 's ) shame that the majority of people in Ireland are in the same position as Mick Wallace .",Romance,Native

If he was a member of the IRA then people need to remember that there was a reason he did n't come out and admit to it like McGuinness did , one that was n't just limited to saving face . He needed to be in a position to negotiate with politicians and government officials who would be a lot less willing to interact with him if he had publicly admitted to being an IRA member , and he also needed to have some influence with IRA hardliners to be able to bring anything to the negotiating table .

08TangoDown08,ireland,How 's it a strawman ? Seems to me that the point I 'm making is more than relevant to the discussion ...,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Your words , not mine . But perhaps you need a bit of perspective . Catholics and Nationalists were second-class citizens in the North . A Catholic did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant or a Unionist in the Orange State . Hundreds and thousands of them could n't get social housing because protestants and loyalists were favoured for it before them . Civil rights marches were brutally and savagely put down by the RUC and , afterwards , the British Army . And that 's where a lot of this started . The protestors in those early days were n't actually campaigning for a united Ireland . They were marching for civil rights - and they were being tramped on by their own police force . Some of them turned to violence because they 'd reached the end of their tolerance - we can debate how right or wrong that is in a separate discussion but I do n't think it 's our place to judge people who felt they had no alternative either . While obviously not on the same scale as apartheid in South Africa , I do n't think anyone can argue that there are n't a few massive similarities . It 's probably worth pointing out that the UK also supported the apartheid regimes in South Africa , too .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"Daeron II became king because he was older than Daemon Blackfyre , not solely because he was a trueborn son . Daemon had to taint Daeron 's claim by saying he was the bastard son of Aemon the Dragonknight , and not Aegon IV , in order to claim the throne . EDIT : [ Found a relevant SSM ] ( http : //www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Hornwood_Inheritance_and_the_Whents ) , there 's no right or wrong answer to this . Depending on the politics at work , a legitimized bastard can come before or after trueborn children . So , it 'd probably be down to the Northern lords themselves , and whether they decide to support Jon or Bran/Rickon .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,asoiaf,"If Jon is legitimized , he becomes Jon Stark , and his claim on the North is stronger than Bran 's , RIckon 's , Sansa 's and Arya 's because he 's the oldest legitimate male son of Eddard Stark . If Robb did legitimize him , Jon is the heir to the North . Simple as that . I just do n't see this happening , though . Even if Jon is still alive , it 's completely against his character for him to disinherit Ned 's `` legitimate '' children from their birthright . To answer your question , no . Even if he is legitimized , he ca n't be King and LC . His oathes to the Night 's Watch forbid him from becoming King in the first place , so something will have to give . As to how powerful the North is , the answer at the moment is not very . In peacetime , the North can muster ( at the very most ) 40000 men , but it very rarely does , because the North is so vast it makes mustering their full manpower extremely difficult . Robb had 18000 troops , and most of them are either dead or scattered now . The North , militarily speaking , is n't much of a threat to the Southern Kingdoms at the moment , but it 's still strong enough to destroy them in a defensive war if a Southern army is stupid enough to attack them in the Neck .",Romance,Native

Feudal laws say that Bran is higher than Rickon in the line of succession , but I honestly ca n't see Bran ever returning from the cave of the three-eyed crow . I believe he 'll remain there , and continue doing whatever it is that Bloodraven does . Jon Snow is a bastard , and despite the many theories kicking around that he 's been legitimised by Robb , I just ca n't see it happening . Even if he has been legitimised , even if he 's survived his caeser-ing and even if he continues to ride south , it 's completely and totally against his character for him to place himself ahead of Sansa or ( fake ) Arya ( the only siblings he knows to be still alive ) in the line of succession . He might try and fight against the Boltons , but he wo n't claim Winterfell . Sansa is a woman . Should Bran , Rickon or even a legitimised Jon Snow appear , they 're all ahead of her in the line of succession . The Northerners would never support her over one of Eddard 's sons , which is why I can not see her holding the North . At least , not permanently . Arya is the least likely of the lot to inherit the North . She 's stuck with the Faceless Men , and who knows where she 'll end up after that . For these reasons , I 'm fairly certain that Rickon will eventually inherit the North .

Michael McElhatton is cold , calculating and always carries a silent threat . Perfect for Roose Bolton . Iain Glen does a superb job as Jorah Mormont . He 's got the voice that 's delivered some of the shows more memorable quotes . Stephen Dillane is a great actor , and he plays the part of Stannis excellently . The problem is how the part itself is written . They 've all but butchered his character . Catelyn is probably one of my least favourite characters in the series . Despite this Michelle Fairley was superb . I still do n't like the character , but her performance was flawless . All in all , the quality of the cast for AGOT is excellent . I ca n't really say that any character 's main faults stem from a poor performance by their actor .

When the Nationalist community began to push back against this with civil rights marches , they were violently put down by Loyalist gangs , the RUC and eventually the British Army . This led to the growth of the PIRA . In the late 60 's and early 70 's , people did n't join the IRA for religious reasons - they joined for political reasons .

There was absolutely no way in hell that the Irish negotiating team was going to come away with 32 counties , no matter who was sent . Collins was placed in an impossible situation - he was a military man , being sent to negotiate with political powerhouses like David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill . I 'm no fan of partition , but it 's hard to argue against the treaty when we do n't know what the alternative would have brought . The Nationalist population in the North was absolutely shafted by the treaty and continued to be shafted ( and largely ignored by successive Irish governments ) up until the 1970 's and 1980 's . Signing the treaty brought a further 70 years of political instability and conflict to the North , and the Troubles claimed more lives than both the war of independence and the civil war . What was the alternative to that ? We can only speculate ... but either way there would probably have been bloodshed .",Romance,Native

He also has a deplorable record in Ireland . And as an Irishman myself , I find it difficult to stomach the fact that Churchill 's virtues are endlessly praised and his many , many failings ( and frequent bouts of bigotry ) are brushed under the rug .

The British Empire had no shortage of contemporary critics either - internal and external . You seem to be implying that orchestrated famines , forced relocations , concentration camps and other atrocities carried out under colonialism were so commonplace and everyday that everybody was completely fine with it until the modern era , and that all of this outrage over it is simply applied retrospectively . That 's just patently untrue and I think you know it is . The point I am making is one that falls largely in line with the point the author of the article was making .

You 're right , Churchill is celebrated for his actions during WW2 - I 've said as much , and that 's exactly my point . You never hear about the rest of it .

You 'll never hear anyone talk about what Churchill 's racist view of the American Indians and Australian aborigines were for example .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm almost 100 % certain that the British do not commemorate Irish soldiers who died fighting against them in the 1916 rising . Are you trying to say that they do ? Commemorating Irish men who fought and died fighting with the British in WW1 is not the same thing . I also happen to think that there 's a difference between moving on from the events of a conflict and actively commemorating the soldiers of the wrinkled old Empire that you were fighting against . If you think we should be commemorating them , fair enough . I do n't think we have any obligation to . Try applying your argument to a different situation . For Britain to have a healthy relationship with Germany , they should commemorate the soldiers who died fighting for the Nazis along with their own ? America should commemorate dead Japanese servicemen ? Serbia should commemorate soldiers who died fighting for the Austro-Hungarian Empire ? Come on . You know that 's nonsense .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I think we 're talking about two different things here . The British military was always going to reply no matter where or when the conflict began - that still does n't mean that we have any obligation to commemorate soldiers who fought for an empire that has a history of oppressing our country . I have nothing against people who do wish to commemorate them , because I understand that they 're probably doing so out of respect for the dead on both sides . That 's fine .

I recognise that the British royals ( Charles in particular ) also had to overcome their own misgivings , but I think you 're being a being a bit unfair here . I think that their city mayors also laid wreaths to commemorate British soldiers who died fighting in the world wars .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"I know , and I think that 's regrettable - because it 's such a narrow and simplistic explanation for the conflict . In the early days , the civil rights marches that would lead to the IRA gaining support had absolutely nothing to do with a united Ireland . That did n't stop the RUC from beating their peaceful protests off the streets and it did n't stop loyalist gangs from burning catholics and nationalists out of their homes .

You 'd be amazed how many people do n't know that - they assume that the British army was sent in to fight the IRA .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I ca n't give a solid answer regarding the war of independence but internment was used after the 1916 rising . There was a pretty interesting documentary on TG4 about it a while back actually , over a thousand Irishmen who fought in the rising were interned in a detention camp in Wales . Apparently that 's where Michael Collins began to gain more and more influence in the IRB . It supposedly became a training ground for would be Irish revolutionaries who would then fight in the war of independence . So , fairly safe to say that it did n't work out too well there either .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Internment was a complete and utter disaster in the North . The H Blocks became a symbol of state oppression and only helped to further the IRA 's propaganda campaign against the Orange State . It got even worse in the 80 's when prisoners had their special category status removed - that 's what led to the hunger strikes . The problem with internment is that it represents an erosion of civil liberties . In the North , thousands of people were imprisoned throughout internment and you only needed to be suspected of being associated with the IRA to end up in the maze . I do n't think it 's an exaggeration to say that a huge percentage of people who ended up in the maze were not criminals , and were not members of the IRA . As you point out , that may well have changed by the time they were released . Ireland is n't the only country in the world that has a problem with gangland crime . We do n't need to lower ourselves to removing citizen 's rights in order to deal with this problem .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yes ... because internment worked so brilliantly in the North and elsewhere . What an absolutely moronic suggestion . Can anyone think of another western nation that has decided to bring in imprisonment without trial to deal with gangland crime ? It 's completely absurd . Why do n't we start by upping the Garda numbers , making sure they 're properly equipped and then attempting to deal with the massive income inequality that plagues Dublin 's north inner city ? Or , do what Portugal did and decriminalise drugs for those possessing up to a ten day 's supply . Seems to be working alright for them .",Romance,Native

You 're still trapped within this mentality that the PIRA and SF were the same entity - that became less and less true the longer the Troubles went on . You also still seem to think that they 're still the same entity , even post GFA - which is ridiculous . You 're judging modern-day SF by the actions of the PIRA 20 , 30 and 40 years ago . Why do n't we just take this a step further and judge FF , FG and Labour by the actions of the old IRB ? Or the Blueshirts ? You 're trying to say that modern day SF supporters do n't want to talk about it - that 's not the problem . That 's all I ever seem to talk about here - the problem is that that 's all the other political parties ever want to talk about . Where was that concern when it was actually happening ?

This is what happens when you pick a side - you force everyone else to pick a side too and whataboutery is what you get . I really wish you 'd stop trying to portray people who voted for SF as being in some way supportive of atrocities that happened 40 years ago .

But to try to imply that the entire SF political party and those who support it are in some way responsible for that is disgusting . And it needs to stop . To answer your question a bit more directly , no . I still think that people and media outlets who consistently use this as a political football do n't actually give a shit about the Disappeared - or any of the other victims of the IRA .

People were always trying to get them to turn to politics , and if they did n't have a political wing then it would have been immeasurably more difficult to turn them away from violence through political means .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"The actions ( or inactions ) of the British Government in the North are the reasons why the PIRA existed to begin with . They 're certainly the reasons why the PIRA gained so much support from previously moderate nationalists and catholics . The British response to peaceful civil rights marches , in which catholics were looking for equal voting rights among other things , was to beat them off the streets . When the unionists began to commit increasingly violent crimes against catholic minority communities ( Bombay Street ) , the British sent the army in to protect the catholics ( amazing how many people do n't know that ) . The army soon became worse than the RUC and we had Bloody Sunday and other atrocities as a result . I think the growth of the PIRA was a regrettable , but absolutely inevitable and predictable event given the circumstances that some catholic communities found themselves in . Violence begets violence and all that . The IRA are obviously responsible for the violent acts that they 've committed , of course they are . And the IRA committed some unspeakable acts - but they were a response to an existing situation . Instead of ceding a few basic human rights to the catholic communities , the British responded with violence , sometimes extreme violence . They also fed into the growing popularity of the IRA among nationalists by bringing in things like internment - which made them appear like monsters and gave the IRA even more of a reason to market themselves as freedom fighters .

Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake .

08TangoDown08,Music,"There 's more to it than just Catholic vs Protestant yes , of course there is .

Obviously this is a very simplistic account , but it 's the jist of what happened . Honestly I 'm more worried about how the Troubles is understood among our own people here than I am about how foreigners understand it - there 's such a lack of knowledge on the subject it 's unbelievable . For example , most Irish people do n't know that the British Army was actually sent into the North to protect the catholics/nationalists from further attacks from loyalist gangs .

It 's ridiculous . EDIT : And back to the original question a bit ... news reports really should n't focus so much on the attackers . That 's what the problem is in my opinion . There 's always long , detailed reports about who the attacker was , who they owe their allegiance to , why they do what they do , where they go for breakfast , what their favourite colour is ... the focus should be both on the victims of the attack , and on the attack itself . It should n't become an autobiography of the killer .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,I think he 's spot on here . The media just seem to be frothing at the mouth to report these attacks in the most sensationalist ways possible . You 're still more likely to die crossing the road than you are from a terrorist attack for fuck 's sake .,Romance,Native

His role was pivotal - but it depended entirely on the ability of SF to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Hume ( deservedly ) won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work - but I seriously think the role of Adams and McGuinness is incredibly overlooked by some people . Who could 've brought the IRA to a ceasefire without them ? Hume ? Not a chance . There could 've been 50 John Humes at work in the North , but without having people there who were willing to quite literally risk their own lives to bring the IRA to the table , the violence would not have ended .",Romance,Native

Now , because they 've adopted a system that evens the playing field , I 'm supposed to think they 're the antichrist and hop on the `` Dublin are saving the game '' bandwagon ? Spare me the shite .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,Attacking the Soviet Union after the end of WW2 would 've been an absolutely terrible idea . The Soviets had an incredibly massive land army at that point ( somewhere in the region of 3 to 1 versus the Allies ) and they had more tanks than any other nation . And that 's before you consider the fact that in only a couple of years they would have nuclear weapons ( something that might have happened even sooner if they were under attack ) . Churchill 's idea was rash and reckless and he did n't give a toss about the millions of people who would die as a result - that pretty much sums him up in my view .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,todayilearned,"Whether he did it on purpose or not is up for debate . He did however have the ability and the opportunity to if not end the famine , then lessen its severity . He did n't . He refused to send or release any British ships to send food to those who were starving . This is what he said : `` starvation of anyhow underfed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks '' . Bengal was a part of the British Empire . It 's genocide by inaction at the very least . I vehemently dislike Churchill for this and also for his abysmal record in Ireland . As an Irishman myself perhaps I 'm biased , but he 's definitely not the saint he 's often made out to be . The lengths that people go to justify some of his actions ( or inactions ) is incredible . I do n't want to overlook his role in helping Britain survive in WW2 because he was crucial to that - but that does n't erase his many flaws either .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"& gt ; I wo n't consider SF until Adams is gone and they stop pulling numbers out their asses . I do n't understand this viewpoint at all and there 's so many people in Ireland spouting it . Gerry Adams has led SF since 1983 . He 's as big of a reason for their rise in politics in the Republic as any other . If your only reason for not voting SF is because he 's there then it just seems hypocritical to me . The party might not have taken the same positions that it has if he were not the leader . As for `` pulling numbers out their asses '' , it was FG and FF who tugged numbers out of their asses during the whole fiscal space debacle . SF were the only party to get it right . AFAIK they were also the first party to make a point of having all of their budget submissions costed by the Department of Finance . Someone can correct me if I 'm wrong on that .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,Exactly . Honestly if news agencies did nothing but report the bare facts in the aftermath of these attacks then I think we would n't have this problem . The problem is that 24 hour news coverage just is n't compatible with that kind of reporting .,Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,Of course it 's a problem - but there 's no justification for the amount of incessant media attention it gets 24 hours a day .

If the government/eircom were ever properly serious about it they 'd only need to bring the fibre cables as far as a big town and then cover the surrounding area through a transmitter ( something similar to what Imagine are doing ) .

At the same time , he could n't cut the IRA loose because he needed enough influence with them to bring them to the table . I know what you 're going to say , that was 30 years ago - but honestly the situation has n't changed all that much . If he admits **now** that he was in the IRA all along , what will that do to the already severely fragile peace-process in the North ? I think there would be a real chance that the DUP and other loyalist parties would refuse to have dialogue with Sinn Fein at all if that were the case . The current crises up there would be a fairly minor footnote compared to the catastrophy that would cause in my opinion , and I think political stability and people 's lives are more important than Adams 's political opponents being able to prove themselves right .

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Resentment will never lead to lasting peace , and I think you might be overlooking the fact that SF and the PIRA were not the only obstacle . For years , the British government refused to even speak with leading nationalist politicans and they were banned from having their voices heard on public broadcasts - even in the Republic , with Section 31 . I just can not agree with the assertion that a lasting peace could 've been achieved without SF being there to bring the PIRA to the table . As far as justifying the IRA goes , I 'm not sure I 'd go that far - I would n't try to justify what they ended up as , at least . I do n't think it 's as easy to say that they were n't justified in the beginning . But I would also add that I do n't think it 's fair to judge those who decided to join them either - I personally do n't know how I 'd react to living under an oppressive government who viewed me as a second class citizen . They did despicable things , but they were a response to a pre-existing condition - and the British Army did things that were equally as bad . The US army and other armies continue to do the same in other parts of the world now , the only difference is that they are government-sanctioned actions .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm not saying the SDLP did n't have a large part to play but I do think you 're overestimating it too . How could the peace process have succeeded without involving the PIRA ? How do you politically involve the PIRA without reaching out to SF ? And if you 're Adams or someone else , how do you convince the PIRA to stop the violence and come to the table ? These were some of the biggest issues faced by the peace process and most of them were overcome to some degree . But you definitely would not have had any kind of lasting peace without involving SF . The Hume-Adams dialogue did a lot more for the peace process than people seem to know .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I 'm a huge fan of John Hume - he achieved remarkable things but he had no influence over the PIRA and realistically , people who held some level of influence over them were needed to bring them to the negotiating table . Otherwise , you 'd have one side at the table without the other . I really do think it 's unrealistic to believe that the peace process could 've went ahead without involving the PIRA or at the very least , SF . Incidentally , that was Hume 's position too . He was largely responsible for bringing SF into the fold after all . I do n't think anyone can deny the huge part Adams played in making the peace process as relatively successful as it is - whatever else you might think of the man .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"I do n't think I ever said the PIRA were anything other than a violent organisation , of course they were . They committed atrocities just like the RUC , British army and loyalists did . That 's the problem with constantly looking back in the North - everybody 's hands were dirty . I do agree that things may well have worked out better if everyone had stuck to politics , but that 's an ideal that was never going to happen - there 's no point in dwelling on it now , the reality was violent and brutal . Something had to change and eventually it did , we got the peace process . That would simply not have happened without SF and the influence some of its members had with the PIRA .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Oh for fuck 's sake . Go and read a history book , I 'm fed up explaining Northern Irish politics and history to people in /r/Ireland - so much willful ignorance . The PIRA were a symptom of a much greater problem in the North . They formed because Nationalists/Catholics were second class citizens in an Orange state during the late 60's/early 70 's . They had little to no voting powers , housing authorities routinely passed them over to favour the Protestant majority and they faced huge discrimination from the RUC - culminating in things like the Battle of the Bogside and what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was then that the British Army was sent in - to protect the Catholics . That 's why they were sent over and not many people seem to be willing to remember that now . Instead of protecting the people they were told to protect , they became the biggest problem of the lot . Bloody Sunday was n't the only failure on their list . And so , more and more people ( rightly or wrongly ) joined the PIRA . Sinn Fein emerged as the political wing of the organisation , not the other way around - as some logheads seem to be implying here . Like it or not , you would n't have a peace process without Gerry Adams , Martin McGuinness and others . What amuses me the most about all of this is that for years , people were encouraging and pleading with the PIRA to turn to politics instead - and now that they have ( by and large ) , people are still bitching .

Allowing Japan to retain the Emperor as a surrender condition is one , another one is allowing the Soviet Union to deliver the death blow to the Empire . Just because it is n't an ideal alternative does n't mean it is n't an alternative . But if you do n't think that dropping the atomic bombs was about geopolitics - even a little bit - then I do n't know what to say to you . It was about getting one up on the Soviet Union as much as it was about ending a war that was already over .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,WTF,"& gt ; I think I know which one is the best for Japan . Oh , so **that's** what the USA was concerned with was it ? Now that 's the only load of tripe on display here my friend . But , since you asked , I think it 's also worth mentioning that the Potsdam Proclamation did n't address in any way , one of the central surrender conditions for the Japenese - the retention of the emperor . There are more than a few historians who think the Japanese might 've surrendered if that assurance was given . However , that 's still only another item on the list . There are plenty of historians , critics and writers who have assessed the options available to the Allies at that point in the war - and surprisingly enough not all of them deem the atomic bomb to have been necessary . Hell , even people like Eisenhower and McArthur thought it was n't necessary . But I wo n't sit here and do your research for you , so perhaps you should head off to google .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,WTF,"It was n't a necessity . Things are never that black and white . Revisionist history tells us it was a necessity , but it 'd be refreshing for people here to actually research it more themselves . The USA had planned to invade Japan in November but the US leadership then felt that something should be done before the Soviet Union entered that theatre of war . And so , you have the atomic bombs . The Soviet Union brought forward its plans and invaded after the bomb on Hiroshima , but the Japanese then surrendered after the second one on Nagasaki . The bombs were about geopolitics , not `` ending the war '' . The war was already over . EDIT : Obviously that 's not the whole story , but it 's a part of it .

08TangoDown08,WTF,"The alternative was that Japan surrenders anyway to the Soviet Union , who began their planned invasion between the dropping of the two bombs .

If Catholics had the same rights as Protestants in Northern Ireland there would have been no public support for the PIRA . If you 're trying to get me to justify everything the PIRA has done then you wo n't succeed . Incidentally , the protests in the late 60 's and early 70 's had absolutely fuck all to do with a united Ireland . That 's not what gave the PIRA their support . Large numbers of people flocked to join their ranks because of how they were treated by the orange state . The IRA always stated their goal as being a united Ireland . Always . That was n't going to change simply because they had more people in the organisation or because they had more public support . Most of your questions were rhetorical , or at least the answers to them are obvious to anyone who knows anything about the Troubles . They do n't actually take away from anything I 've said .",Romance,Native

Life as a Catholic in Northern Ireland in the 60 's and 70 's was the life of a second-class citizen . You did n't have the same voting rights as a Protestant , you could n't get housing from local authorities who systematically favoured Protestants over you , you found it tougher to get a job because most business owners were Protestant and would never hire a Catholic and you could n't air your grievances in public because the RUC would come down on your protests like a ton of bricks . The British Army was sent in to protect the Catholic community in Northern Ireland after what were essentially pogroms against them in Belfast . It was the treatment of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland that fuelled the whole conflict .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,ireland,"Seems right enough , most estimates I 've read put the PIRA 's civilian murders between 600 and 700 ( I actually think it 's slightly over 700 . 720 or there abouts ) .

Also , it 's very easy to hold the view that all violence is wrong and we should never hurt another person . An admirable sentiment , but life does n't always work like that . You ca n't tell me that if you were living as a catholic in West Belfast or Derry in the early 70 's , seeing your people treated as second class citizens and getting beaten off the streets ( by the `` innocent '' RUC ) for holding civil rights marches so that you can have the vote and be allocated housing like the loyalist majority , that you would n't under any circumstances join an organisation that promised to change that . EDIT : And even if you will still say that you definitely would n't , I do n't think you 're in any sort of position to judge people who would .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Yes , the PIRA killed a lot of people ... please show me where I said that they did n't ? If you 're talking about civilian casualties , you 're incorrect . Loyalist paramilitaries are responsible for more civilian deaths than the PIRA . The majority of the people killed by the PIRA were members of the British Security forces . You can argue about how right or wrong that is but they did n't target civilians to the same extent as Loyalist paramilitaries .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"Ugh , you people are exhausting . Fine , let 's consider it your way then .

You 're coming from an entirely different standpoint than I am . Most people on /r/Ireland are - I 'm fine with that . What I 'm not fine with is having your standpoint lorded over me as if that is the only morally correct view to have . I do n't think membership of the PIRA is a crime in and of itself - mostly because I know , and can understand , why the PIRA came about in the first place and what life was like for catholics and nationalists in the `` orange state '' . I do n't think it 's fair to judge people who were victims of state oppression , abused by the police force who were supposed to be protecting them ( RUC ) , backed into a corner and felt they had no other option . That 's wrongly assigned blame . Maybe you see things differently but that 's how I see it .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,ireland,"There 's the testimony of former IRA members like Dolores Price who were against the Peace Process - and therefore had a vested interest in discrediting Gerry Adams , SF and other leaders of the Peace Process .

There 's nothing to gain from finding out for certain that he was n't a member , and there 's potentially a lot at stake if we find out for certain that he was . Finding out he was a member is n't exactly going to strengthen the already weakened Peace Process . The DUP were almost willing to tear it up over something we already knew was the case ( the PIRA still existing ) - there 's a pretty real chance they 'd walk out completely if Adams came out and said he was in the IRA . In short , I do n't see any advantage in finding out for sure either way . Politicians in the Republic who keep throwing accusations at Adams are doing so to further their own political agendas and not out of any sort of concern for NI or the peace process - they ignore these problems until there 's political capital to be had in paying attention to it .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,science,So you 're suggesting his comment was along the lines of `` I wish other people would pay more for this thing ! It 's ridiculous how little other people are spending on this thing ! '' Did I get that right ? Because to me that sounds like a great way to look outraged about something without actually having to personally do anything .,Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"So 29 billion is ridiculous , and we should force other people to pay more for this research ? How much more money should be spent ? Who should decide how the money is spent ? How will they ensure the money is effectively spent ? Would you personally force other people to pay for this ? Because I am assuming you are talking about using the force of government to take money from some people and give it to researchers . If you would n't personally force people to pay for this , why does it become okay for others to do it on your behalf ? Perhaps things like funding this research ( which some of us consider important , and some of us do not consider important ) should be achieved in a non-coercive way . I 'm sure many people would chip in money to support this , and we would n't have to worry about the resentment and politics of people who do n't want to pay . Personally I would donate to this . But from what I can see , the vast majority of replies to my comment are suggesting funding this through taxation . And taxation removes choice from the equation . And I really resent being forced to pay for things . I 'm sure you do too . Do you like having to fund the trillion-dollar military-industrial complex ? Let 's work towards achieving important things without forcing each other to foot the bill . Perhaps then we would n't have to worry so much about who 's vying for the Whitehouse every four years .",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"I 'd be happier with a system where we personally get to decide where our tax dollars go . I think it would definitely be a step in the right direction . Personally I would n't allocate a quarter of my spending to the military-industrial complex ! I like science , so having the choice to spend money on projects like fusion research would be very cool . The choice is important . Without choice we have no freedom .",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"How do you know ? I mean , I 'd love for fusion to be viable , and it certainly looks like it could be , but how much of other people 's money are you willing to risk on this ? How much research pans out , and how much is a dead-end ? Are you personally willing to force other people to pay for this ? And if you 're not , what makes it okay to have others enforce this in your behalf ? Perhaps we could find ways of achieving important things without resorting to coercion ? And maybe the very act of having to convince rather than coerce will lead to better outcomes ?",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"Is fusion research a guaranteed win ? Is it a problem that can be solved by pouring more money and resources into it ? How much money will it take ? Are you willing to find that amount by forcing others to keep paying for it until we achieve success ? What about people who are too old to reap the benefits ? Should they be forced to pay ? What about people who do n't want to pay ? Will you force them ? What about those of us who do not wish to be forced to pay ? Will you make them submit , with violence if necessary ? What about the man who will not submit , even when violence is brought to bear ? Will you advocate for his death ? Because that is how violent situations ultimately end , is n't it ? Is n't it really `` submit or die '' ?

It is not just the abusers who have mistreated you . Many others are complicit and turned a blind eye . I 'm really really sorry about that . Realizing this as you mature into an adult can give you new insight , and it becomes enraging as you realize how little others cared . Which leads to ... Two : as you mature into an adult , you are now able to fight back . Your body and your mind now knows your capacity to fight and to win . These motherfuckers can not get away with it anymore . When we are young and abused it is much safer to suppress our anger . It is too dangerous to act upon our rage and to fight back , so we squash our anger to protect ourselves . But now that you are literally able to smash these cunts to a pulp , your mind is letting go of some of the suppression of anger . You are feeling this anger now , and a deep part of you wants to act on your anger to protect yourself and those you care about . You want justice , and you can now fight for it . You 've already been to years of counseling , well done . I would definitely recommend continuing that and talking to a therapist . In university they offer it for free , usually .

Yet proponents of socialized medicine insist that a single-payer health care system is the only way to solve the structural problems of the U.S. health care system . They conve- niently ignore or explain away the flaws of sin- gle-payer systems , arguing that we could design a better system and spend more money than Britain and Canada , thus getting better results . But the failures of socialized medicine are evident in every country that implements it , and there is no reason to believe that a sin- gle-payer system in the United States would be any different . Advocates of national health insurance would do well to look at how coun- tries like Germany , Sweden , and Australia are choosing free-market reforms to alleviate the problems of their national health systems . Through painful experience , many of the countries that once heralded the benefits of government control have learned that the best remedy for their countries ’ health care crises is not increasing government power , but increas- ing patient power instead .",Romance,Native

[ The book is free here . ] ( http : //m.freedomainradio.com/ ) & gt ; Imagine a world without government – this thought exercise seems impossible for many , because the power and reach of state monopolies is so omnipresent in our lives . However , there is no rational , economic or moral reason to assume that governments are necessary for the provision of roads , healthcare , charity , dispute resolution , courts , policing , national defense , jails – or any of the other services currently monopolized by the state . & gt ; Governments are extremely dangerous , responsible for over 250 million deaths in the 20th century alone – if it is possible to run a society without a government , surely this is something that we must strive towards as a species . & gt ; Practical Anarchy makes strong case for the private – that is to say voluntary – provision for public services .

123xyz123xyz,HomeworkHelp,"Decrease all taxes so the consumers have more money to spend . But your professor probably does n't want to hear that . Your professor probably wants to hear this : - increase taxes on wheat submarket for biofuel , which will disincentivize usage of wheat for biofuel , thus increasing supply of wheat for wheat submarkets that deal in wheat food products and cattle feed . This increased supply will decrease prices for consumers . - allocate revenue from biofuel taxes to spend on wheat farmer subsidies , which encourages the growth of supply of wheat , which decreases price of wheat . But this is short-sighted thinking ( even though it is probably what your prof wants to hear ) . Here are some negative effects : - local biofuel businesses now have less money , and may have to lay off employees and forgo spending on capital investment . - businesses reliant on biofuel will have to absorb price increases ( possibly laying off workers or forgoing capital investment as well ) or use a biofuel alternative to remain competitive , further hurting the biofuel market . - wheat farmers are now receiving subsidies to increase production of wheat , which messes up market signals . ( Do consumers actually want more wheat ? No . Or else they 'd have started buying more wheat . ) This injection of money encourages malinvestment across the wheat farming sector ( farmers buying tractors they did n't need in free market conditions , farmers purchasing more land to plant more wheat , things like that ) . - Because consumers did n't actually want more wheat , this oversupply of wheat will displace other products ( quite literally if it 's going in silos that would have housed other grain ) . It may be used in the production of new products in other markets , displacing existing products e.g . wheat-derived sugar becomes cheap enough to compete with cane sugar , putting the squeeze on the sugar cane industry . - Fortunately wheat can be stored indefinitely . But meat can not . The lower cost of wheat-based cattle-feed will encourage the overproduction of meat . Some of this meat will spoil . Taking from some people so that you can give to others always has negative consequences . There are alternate methods for solving this problem that do not wreak havoc on the markets , and on people 's lives . Off the top of my head , the government could reduce taxes on futures trading to encourage speculation on the future price of wheat . This will smooth out price fluctuations , preventing nasty surprises to poor people who subsist on bread .",Romance,Native

The Fed does a poor job of this because of insider manipulation , a lack of information , and downright incompetence . The Fed does n't fail if they do n't satisfy market demands , but a business would . So deregulate it , privatize it , and let the market determine how money should work .

The situation is kinda similar to what happened with Bernie . Ron Paul had massive popular support but got screwed by the party insiders . So now we have our chance to rebuild the party , and Trump has a wider appeal than Ron Paul while not being as ideologically consistent . So we 're taking our chances and clawing the power away from the insiders . Not enough people will get behind the Libertarian party because they see it as a wasted vote . One last thing : the disdain for `` cucks '' is a powerful sea-change in the political landscape . Conservatives are sick of having to support ineffectual politicians . Having someone who will stick to their guns and get us the change we want while not taking any bullshit is a very refreshing sight .

One is Alicia Ortega and the other is Nuria Piera , Nuria is Dominican Republic 's Alex Jones.. She 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate José Francisco Peña Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly Peña Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press Peña Gomez vudú ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... . Menendez and Melgen were accused in Dominican Republic of fraud by selling x-ray machines to the government and the corrupt DR supreme Court let them go ... FUCK THE ELITES ! ! ! !

It 's theorized by Francis , Walker , et al . that the evolutionary purpose of this was for tribal cohesion when engaging in combat and wartime customs , e.g . intimidating war-dances such as the haka performed by Polynesian peoples . So what you described as seeing `` the intelligence and willpower drain from their eyes '' is a real neuro-physiological phenomenon . Creepy stuff !

123xyz123xyz,Anarcho_Capitalism,"A right is something we would consider enforceable with violence , E.g . I have the right to my property , and if you steal it , I can enforce my right to my property with violence ( taking it back or forcing you to give it back ) . This example is a negative right , or the right to be free from coercion . The problem with rights is the conception of positive rights , aka obligations to someone else 's property or labor . A right to someone else 's property or labor should only exist when both parties have agreed to it . The one exception being raising kids , since kids ca n't agree to being raised , so the creation of a child must put a positive obligation on the parent . Any other positive obligation must necessitate a violation of someone 's negative rights , E.g . your right to healthcare violates my property rights , since taxation is theft and I have n't agreed to it . So positive rights violate negative rights , which logically negates them . We are left with negative rights as being the only legitimate kind of rights . But honestly , if someone is drowning I doubt no one would help . That would be a total dick move . If it was my kid that drowned and someone could have helped , I would be so enraged . I do n't see how this creates a positive obligation on the part of a bystander , but it should be a rule in any civilized society . If you do n't help people when you easily could have , then we wo n't have anything to do with you . This does n't give anyone the right to attack or steal from the cowardly bystander , but we do n't have to interact with him or help him . We never had that obligation to begin with . This is how a real `` social contract '' should work . Not with forced obligations , but with the understanding that you can be ostracized at any time , so do n't be a dick .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"I think this is mostly it . But the majority of families still have a subtext of emotional manipulation and physical threats lurking in their relationships , with these patterns having formed deep in early childhood . The majority of parents still spank their children . Children grow up funneled into the public school system , and see bullying with mostly empty rhetoric opposing it . Politicians and the media lie repetitively . So most people are programmed by milder forms of manipulation than an outright narcissist would inflict , but still , they are programmed . To highlight this , imagine the response you ( or any child ) would get if you protested going to school . Not many parents would take you seriously , and even good parents would listen to your complaints , but then convince you that you must go , eventually turning you against your own feelings . It is an extremely rare parent that truly cares what their child thinks and feels . So when these programmed people -- and lets not kid ourselves , most people are programmed unless they have gone through a journey of rigorous self-knowledge -- when these people encounter a master manipulator at the height of their skills , their response is an unconscious allegiance to power rather than to virtue or principle or love . A peacefully raised person on the other hand , will immediately see through the strange display that a narcissist puts on . This is because the peacefully raised individual is in tune with their natural thoughts and emotions . Also , consider the world of politics today . All of these politicians are master manipulators , and yet the majority of people will go out and support one or the other candidate .

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude . Tl ; dr there have always been political movements advocating `` freedom to '' and `` freedom from '' , or equality vs liberty .",Romance,Native

But there are a lot of poor people that still will not be able to afford to own their own home . The entire burden of this is now placed on that group of poor people .

123xyz123xyz,newzealand,"Landlords have economies of scale , which owner-occupiers do not . Why would owner-occupiers be more economically efficient ? Rental property tends to have denser populations than owner-occupier property , which makes it more economically efficient . You 'd require quite high rental-property taxes to get renters to decide to switch to buying a home . But there will always be people who can not afford to be owner-operators , so they are stuck with increased rents . And would n't there be now be an incentive for lower value property to be used for rentals , since lower value means lower property taxes ? So now the poor people stuck renting have to live in industrial slums . I do n't see this tax being a win for anyone , except those who own low value property -- and that 's only compared to everyone else who has to bear the costs by either changing their living situation , or by paying more rent . Edit : also , as I said in another comment , mortgage rates will increase as the demand for home loans increases with more people flooding the home-owner market . This does n't help anyone . And the Reserve bank would probably respond to those higher rates by lowering the OCR to bring bank interest rates back down , which will artificially stimulate the rest of the economy by encouraging businesses to invest more , when in reality the economic environment does not ( can not ) support more investment . This will lead to riskier investment projects getting green lit , and contribute further to economic instability .

They do n't care about how you think and feel , it 's always about them . I 'm sorry that you had to find out about this while still being stuck in it . I did n't realize it until I was 21 . As for advice ... are you in immediate harm ? Your dad threatened to beat you , but do you think he would go through with it ? If you do n't think he would , my advice would be to try to fly under the radar , disconnect from your parents as much as you can , and do n't let them mess with your head too much . Hanging out with friends as much as you can . Time away from the house . Go to the library . Try to keep decent grades , though I know it 's tough when you 're dealing with this shit . Definitely try to get a job . Having your own money really helps foster your independence . If you are certain that violence will occur , I 'd tell as many trusted adults as you can .

123xyz123xyz,DecidingToBeBetter,"& gt ; Forgiving unrepentant people is perhaps the most critical portion . I 've heard this usage of the word `` forgive '' before , but it is not the common usage . When people think of forgiveness , they imagine getting back together , hugging , and saying `` I forgive you ! '' The word is also used in another context : to forgive a debt . We know what this means . It is an allowance of previously unallowable behavior . & gt ; Consider this : If a person is unrepentant , do you really think they have a single care about whether or not you forgive them ? Do you really think that by refusing to forgive them , it somehow does you any good ? I know they care . Everyone cares about how they are viewed . If bad people were called out and shunned , rather than having their shitty behavior swept under the rug , we would be living in a much better world : a world where even narcissists tried to be good people because they would suffer the consequences otherwise . A world where people do n't turn away and look embarrassed when a child is being mistreated . I am angry when I see these bad things happen . If only more of us were , perhaps we could end the cycle . It seems to me that the people eager to preach forgiveness are the ones that would gain most from it . It validates their decisions to forgive bad people , and it validates bad behavior from bad people . When I think back on how my dad treated me , I feel angry . I was not treated respectfully . I can not will the anger away , that would be a self manipulation and a denial of my true feelings . But I am free from him now . The wounded child within me has regained trust in the world , and most importantly : the wounded child trusts me to keep him safe . And I will . That means no abusers . That means no `` letting it slide '' . That means hearing his pains and concerns , and taking them seriously . That is healing . I think we are talking about the same thing , but you are using the language of enablement when you call this process `` forgiveness '' . I would urge you to find a better word , mainly to aid in clarifying the problem to those of us who are less versed in the subject . Perhaps `` coming to terms with it '' . What are your thoughts ?",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"Happy to help . If you do have to continue to see your dad , try to engage in `` safe '' activities and conversations . I remember my dad and I used to go to the movies a lot together . It was a great way to kill time without having to deal with him that much . Or sitting on the couch watching TV with him . At least then he thinks he 's getting time with you , and you get to remain somewhat distant . It would be best if you were n't forced to see him , though ... It is hard having to fake it , especially when you 've snapped out of the daze of illusion . The inside of my head used to physically hurt when I was around my parents . It was hard to think clearly . Something you might need to be more aware of is your relationship with your mom . You seem to have already figured her out pretty well , but I can imagine it would be easy to see her as the good parent when compared to your dad . Remember : she chose your dad . Again , I 'm really sorry that this has fallen on your young shoulders . It should n't be this way . Edit : Some advice for you regarding your mom . You feel controlled by her and want some freedom . Practical stuff here : do you own a bike ? Can you bike into the city , or visit friends that way ? That way you will be less reliant on her to get to places . How about friends ? Can they pick you up and take you places ? Is money a concern ? Can you get a job anyplace ? Maybe even mowing lawns ? If she wo n't let you do stuff , perhaps arrange things with other people first , then tell your mom she has to cancel on them over the phone . Her having to show her control over you with a third party watching might make her think twice . That 's all I got for now . Take care bud .",Romance,Native

12341,ukpolitics,"The prime minister no doubt used her visit to Saudi Arabia to desperately seek trade deals that will help cobble together a plan to combat the monumental act of self-harm that is leaving the single market . What she should have done was have a moment of conscience and think about the people of Yemen . International charities say Yemen is in the grip of a perfect storm of war , economic meltdown and humanitarian crisis . Yet while British aid is helping to save lives there , the country is being being pounded by British arms , sold to our Saudi Arabia allies , exacerbating the situation . Yemeni families face a daily nightmare of falling bombs , a critical lack of clean water and food which leaves the country teetering on the edge of famine and outbreaks of preventable conditions such as cholera and measles which are killing a child every ten minutes . This nightmare is deepened by “ widespread and systematic ” international humanitarian law violations by the Saudi coalition that have the “ potential to meet the criteria for a crime against humanity ” , according to a panel of experts set up by the United Nations . The figures are almost impossible to comprehend : 18 million people , including ten million children , need humanitarian assistance . That ’ s eight in ten people in Yemen who need humanitarian aid to survive . Britain can take credit for its leadership in providing humanitarian aid to Yemen — but ministers must also take responsibility for failing to use British influence to ensure that aid is not blocked . They have also failed to hold to account those responsible for the unrelenting attacks on civilians . Save the Children has said that the warring parties , including the Saudi-led coalition , are blocking aid as a “ weapon of war ” : detaining aid workers , bombing ports and holding up desperately needed food and medicines . Plans to attack the port of Hodeida , already damaged by Saudi bombs , risk causing a humanitarian catastrophe if steps are not taken to divert aid to other ports . Hodeida receives nearly three quarters of all imports and humanitarian assistance shipments . For a country which Britain counts as an ally to be deliberately withholding aid is bad enough but the Saudi-led coalition is also responsible for the unrelenting bombardment of Yemen ’ s towns and cities , hitting homes , destroying clinics trying to care for starving families and killing children in their classrooms . Similar crimes are undoubtedly being committed by the Houthi opposition . Deliberately withholding lifesaving aid and attacking civilians are war crimes yet in Yemen these reports are not being properly investigated and those responsible are not being held to account . To date , the government has said that the investigations , led by the Saudis themselves , are sufficient . It could not be clearer that the Saudis investigating themselves is woefully inadequate and deeply inappropriate . The case for a fully independent , international investigation into alleged war crimes , on all sides of the conflict in Yemen , is irrefutable . Yemen faces a humanitarian catastrophe . The government must stand up for international humanitarian law , halt arms sales , demand that our allies immediately allow humanitarian access and support calls for a ceasefire and a full , impartial investigation into what appear to be horrific war crimes . To leave Saudi Arabia with more credibility than her predecessors , our prime minister had to stop the flow of arms . By failing to do so , her government chose shamefully to side with Saudi Arabia , rather than hold the Saudi authorities to account on their alleged human rights abuses in Yemen . Ours is a government which has abetted a humanitarian disaster and brought further bloodshed and poverty to civilians in an already stricken land . The continued failure of the government to take action in Yemen leaves Britain ’ s reputation in the world permanently damaged .",Romance,Native

Personally I 'm not happy at all because I live very close to Kneller Hall ( I can see part of it from my bedroom ) . That along with the rugby stadia , makes the area much more interesting imo , so I 'm livid that they want to sell off the grade 2 listed building .",Romance,Native
30503,london,"Whilst that probably is the case , I just think it makes the area better and more interesting , e.g . just appreciating it whenever I walk past it . However I 'm not fully clued up on how much of a grade 2 listed building can be changed . So if the exterior is n't to be changed at all with little changes to the surrounding areas , then I guess it would be a decent compromise .",Romance,Native

30503,GlobalOffensive,"And it is for that reason why I do n't think vac bans should be permanent , but rather last 2/3 years . This is because I think a ban should be long enough to ruin someone 's career but give them a second chance .",Romance,Native

30503,GlobalOffensive,"If you play the game properly , e.g . not trolling , holding angles correctly , decent aim , playing around your team ( e.g . not over stacking a site ) . You can have someone that communicates , but also plays like an idiot , which personally annoys me a lot more . If someone who does n't communicate , but knows there place on the team because of it ( e.g . following strats instead of creating their own without telling anyone ) they can still be very helpful . Also if you ca n't communicate with your team mates it does n't mean you ca n't listen to what they say , although that does n't remove the language barrier .",Romance,Native
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Your second point seems a bit arbitrary . Anyway I have 1.5k hrs on the game , most of them with mates . However I have played a few albeit not many games by myself with little communication ( I usually give up communicating after a few rounds if no one else is ) , which we have won because we all played smart and knew what we were doing . I have also won games where I was in a group of 3/4 and the randoms did n't communicate , yet we won partly because he knew what he was doing , did n't interrupt us and held his own . Do you know that matchmaking ( which is what we are talking about right now ) is n't the highest level of cs and that not everyone needs to act like they are a professional playing the game in optimal conditions . What is hard to grasp around that .",Romance,Native
30503,GlobalOffensive,"Bloody hell , we are talking about matchmaking not bloody professional games . Do pro players search for a game with randoms and that is their team for the tournament , no you mong . Matchmaking is a completely different level , where you can play your best and not communicate . Do you expect 5 randoms on matchmaking to have pre set strats and anti strats like pros do , of course you bloody do n't . Your delusional if you believe you can use professional teams as an example for how matchmaking should be set out .",Romance,Native
30503,GlobalOffensive,"I usually play with mates , however on the off chance I do n't , I always use my microphone , unless as stated no one else does in like 4/5 rounds then I give up .

30503,unitedkingdom,"Part of the reason why commercial TV in the UK is n't as bad as the US is because the BBC holds the other providers to a higher standard .

Also whilst I would like the BBC to continue , even as a media tax or something , for some reason I do n't see it happening , especially not in its current form . I do n't think it will disappear completely , however I can see certain parts of the BBC being cut , if the licence were to go .

30503,todayilearned,"With talking about the UK , whilst there has n't been any official research on it to my knowledge either , I still think it is quite effective . Part of that is anecdotally as I support arsenal , and I go to nearly every home game , but I also support AFC Wimbledon as a second team , and I do often go to see them play when Arsenal have a small away game . So personally it does encourage me to go see a lower league team . Also I have no source for this but I think I have read somewhere before that many lower league teams do generally experience lower attendances when there is a big game at 12:45 ( a football game should n't start before 2/3 pm , but that 's another topic ) . Again I have no source on this , but it does seem believable and I have heard it said a few times before .",Romance,Native

This means that for at least the first 2 months of matchmaking you could n't have a map selection .

Also if you decided you wanted to play another map that was n't inferno but was still decent you would have to search for all the defuse maps . And oh bollocks I 'm now playing a match on Aztec .

30503,GlobalOffensive,"For me the one of my concerns after watching it was him mentioning some kind of play-off system . To my understanding ( I could be very wrong on this ) it is very popular with American sports to have a play-off system to win the title , and that Thorin mentioned something similar . This is something that would ruin the league for me , because what is the point of a league , where you can win every game but have an off game in the final to the 4th placed team or something ( although writing that as an arsenal fan is tempting : - ) . It takes the point of having a league away especially if all the league games are played on lan . For online leagues it makes sense to have the online finals on lan in a play-off system , however for a league on lan there is no point of having a play-off system to decide who wins .",Romance,Native

30503,GlobalOffensive,"But there is a much higher chance that the best team wo n't win . For example you can easily win every single game , but have a slight dip in form to a team that played well in the final , but nowhere near as well . I know it is like this for basically every csgo event right now , but that is because they basically have to be like that . This is because the leagues are either online , which is not a way to see who wins a large event , or that they do n't have time for a proper league system and have to use group stages instead . Just because it minimises pointless games , or is more exciting to to watch the final , does n't mean it is as fair . If a team wins it in week 8 out of 10 then chances are they deserve to win it .

Also matchmaking is not about the challenge of getting a rank , it is about how good the games are as well as how challenging the games are . I am a bit biased , as I still think the matchmaking ranks are pretty worthless and do n't represent much . Also at the start of matchmaking you could n't even have a map selection .

30503,hearthstone,I might be biased because I enjoy playing combo decks but I also enjoy playing against them as well . Especially freeze mage which I have never played myself .

I think the lower tier behind the goal will have a better atmosphere but those tickets will sell faster as they are released first ( I assume for a match like this they will only open the upper tier when the lower tier gets close to selling out ) , the ones left will probably be for the very front where the view might not be as good . This is mainly speculation , I went last year ( AFC Wimbledon fan ) so it is based off my patchy memory and general experience at football matches , I just thought it might be helpful because you mentioned in another comment you want the 'full experience ' , any seat you get will still be good though , just some slight differences .",Romance,Native

Its like when in football , when a team finishes mid table and has nothing to play for at the end of the season , they do usually play worse , as there is no incentive for them to play well .

Although you did n't say this , but I feel like a lot of people want every kind of deck and class to have a counter to everything , which I disagree with .

I only got the game because I got into watching ESWC 2012 and I wanted to experience competitive myself . Granted I was put into gold nova 1 straight away presumably because I played some other pc fps games and it was before they adjusted the rank system .

If I want to play deathmatch I 'll find a community server that is better ( eg 128 tick , more players , ffa ) and if I want to play gun game I 'll find a community server because the update to the official gun game made it awful to play . And demolition can be fun to play the odd game I guess but it gets boring very fast . This is just my opinion , however you ca n't deny the fact that 90 % of players play this game for competitive .

Although an official with ranks and shit 1v1 would be nice , I do know about the arena servers , which I do go on occasionally .

30503,soccer,"Your second point is why I disagree with video technology in most situations , like if the ref did n't call the penalty , the game carries on and anything can happen , and what if the call is made that it was n't a penalty . What do you do there , give the ball to the other team ? Well chances are they just missed the chance for a good counter attack .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"Often times teams try to take a quick set piece and are not stopped , so that line of thought is wrong . However I do agree with some of your other points on if the game has already stopped then use it , however it would have to be implemented correctly in that case as I see a lot of room for error , by making things drag out much longer and needed . And there is another issue of teams possibly forcing the video decision to be made by deliberately stopping the play . This does already happen to some extent and it is not always bad however in many cases I think it can be , although that 's a complicated one .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I see your point , however the ref would be more inclined to call a penalty knowing that it can be reviewed after . Then what happens if it turns out not to be a penalty . Like a said in me previous comment there is a high chance that the other team could 've had a counter attack when instead they will just have a free kick which is a much slower build up than a possible quick counter . Or what if the team the penalty was called for but in the end disallowed , what if they were still in possession of the ball and ended up getting a corner or something . As it stands now refs do n't play advantage in the box , so if that does n't change then we could have an issue of the attacking team losing possession due to the ref incorrectly calling a penalty .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I sort of agree with you . Especially for checking if a goal was offside or not , however as the other person who replied to you said it would n't work for checking penalty calls . I am not against using technology to make calls , however I believe it has to be done correct and not affect the games flow in anyway what so ever . Goal line technology is a good example of this .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I agree with your reasoning , however if that is the case , I can easily see refs being more harsh with penalty calls as they know it can be reviewed . Then if that 's the case more issues are caused , I explained in more detail why in another of my comments if you are interested in seeing why .",Romance,Native
30503,soccer,"I have to agree with everything you said there , especially the bit about many calls being subjective .",Romance,Native

30503,technology,"I think your analogy is valid and creates a good point .

Maybe I got my other comment wrong and he was chatting bollocks , I do n't know . But I just think his point was n't too outrageous and did n't need a snarky comment in return .

If you do n't mind so I do n't have to copy something out again go onto my profile , control f penalty and read what I have said , maybe read the context for a better idea what I was referring to . Also many penalty calls are subjective so a video ref wo n't work , my other arguements are in other comments I have recently posted .",Romance,Native

For example if the team acted like complete arses I would be more motivated to play well against them and form a temporary rivalry . On the other hand if the other team are quite nice and we had a good conversation then I find the game more enjoyable and you respect the opponent more . Either way I see a benefit .

I would n't worry about the consequences of what happens after , either . If you end up having to take another person 's life in self defense , whatever legal troubles come afterward are a far sight better than being dead , I 'd say .

Even if he had calmly stated , `` I 'm carrying a concealed weapon and I 'm about to draw it and aim it at you , menacingly , but I do n't intend to shoot you , '' you still could n't be reasonably sure he did n't intend to shoot you anyway . Regardless of your answer to the question I posed , you 'd be better served learning how to deescalate situations like that in the future . Your intuition lead you to believe this man was going to be a threat based on his demeanor , so getting defensive and telling him to get off of the property was n't the best way to handle that situation .

( no green +30 like others ) . Right now , that stat is maxed out . Now on the after , the star converted amount is 5 stars +3 . Ace gives additional +2 . So the max for any stat is now 10/10 ( vs. 100/100 or 50/50 , etc. ) . So what was a max stat , is now only 80 % ( 5+3/10 ) .

006007,Warthunder,"As frustrating as bombers are to take down , proper interception tactics would ease a lot of it . What I witness in SB matches , and what I admittedly do myself , is not take the necessary time to setup proper intercepts . So you get these lazy attacks where you 're relative speed is hardly any faster , or you 're just coming right up behind them , and just sitting in their gun sights . Getting shot down this way is proper . You fly poorly , you perform poorly . That said , there should be a couple of changes that could be made to SB bombers to make them less gamey . One is to require manual inputs to the bomb sight for altitude and speed , no more automatic computing . You should n't be able to jink in your B-17 to dodge a fighter , then level off and 5 seconds later drop bombs with pinpoint precision . Bombers should need to commit more wholly to the bomb run . I get that the bomber and pilot are two separate people , and conceivably they could do these things simultaneously IRL , but this is a reasonable balancing move . The other , and probably harder to code , change should be that AI does not shoot while within clouds . I understand why bombers choose to fly in clouds , but you should n't get to take advantage of not being seen , while simultaneously reaping the benefits of being able to `` see '' the enemy on account of your AI . Especially when it only take a few well places bullets to set a fighter alight and end their mission .",Romance,Native
006007,Warthunder,"That 's a fair point . I mostly play in Tier IV where a spaded German fighter has the ability to get up and intercept in time . I imagine this is a harder thing to accomplish in Tier III or below . I do n't think there 's going to be any magic bullet with the way the game is setup right now . You can increase HP of targets to force bombers to loiter longer , but then that puts nations like Germany and the Soviet Union at a disadvantage with their lower bomb loads . You could make the maps bigger , to provide more time for intercept , but then it becomes impossible to patrol the whole front line . I honestly wish there was side-wide voice chat in SB . Coordinated attacks on bombers would do wonders ...",Romance,Native

006007,Warthunder,"There 's the old saying , `` Speed is life and altitude is life insurance . '' This applies to the SB game mode most of all . On maps where it 's not low overcast , you 'll want to climb up to at least 3km , preferably 4km . That way you can dive in on people and have enough speed to break away and you also reduce the chances of getting bounced , yourself . Another piece of advice I have is to not over commit to an enemy . You may get so excited chasing someone down who you have the advantage on that you spend too much time trying to finish the job . Gunnery is much more difficult locked inside a cockpit , so until you 're more proficient , just make one pass and then break away . If it 's 3 on 1 or something , though , then go hog wild . Finally , check your six and check it often . Really , until you 're fully engaged , there 's no such thing as checking your six too often .",Romance,Native

Acceleration is good and it has enough dive performance to keep up with most of what you come against . [ SB ] Absolutely my favorite plane to use so far , no question . I have n't unlocked the D-9 or D-12 , which I 'm betting will be similar , but as compared to everything leading up to it in the German tree , just fantastic . That giant Jumo 213 engine really lets you dictate the terms your fights . Its firepower in SB is more than adequate . My favorite quality , shared among all the FW series , is the visibility . I have n't flown other nations ' aircraft of similar tier to compare , but it 's a stark contrast to the very limited FOV one gets in a 109 cockpit . The only thing I do n't trust it for in SB is energy fighting on the deck . It can hold its own against most enemies for a few turns , but it quickly sheds its energy and you have to be very conscious of your maneuvers to not get taken down . I also echo Maxrdt 's concerns over its quickness to overheat . You tend to get enough time to WEP climb to target and engage for a few passes before the Orange temps arrive . I find myself having to disengage in extended fights to cool the engine as you really need to be running throttle at 100 % when you 're in the fight . You definitely have to be careful when in extended fights to keep your engine temps low enough so you 've time to cut and run if you find yourself at a disadvantage . Overall I 'm very pleased with the Fw-190 D-13 and feel my money was well spent .",Romance,Native

006007,Warthunder,"I agree with most of these , except the no mouse aim and no air start . Using the mouse to aim is fine , but it should be represented with iron sights or whatever sight each bomber had . Joysticks do n't lend themselves to the fine motor control required for aiming a weapons like that . A first person perspective is honestly what 's needed , even if it 's just a little hash mark in the center of the screen . Bombers need an air start . A delayed spawn is a good idea ( from another comment ) and so is spawning further behind the lines . The maps are just too small and even the super props ca n't get to altitude in time to stop the B-29 horde that is anything vs. America . If the defenders had enough time to climb and get a modest altitude advantage before the bombers could get to the first targets , I feel like that alone would improve the gameplay significantly .",Romance,Native
006007,Warthunder,"It can be when flying late Tier IV or early Tier V when America is in the rotation . Some days it 's not so bad , but last night was particularly rife with bomber spam . The maps are generally too small to allow whoever is defending against the Americans to get altitude and defend before the bases are all destroyed . B-17s and B-24s are n't so bad , but 2 B-29s with the default bomb load can completely bomb out the bases and airfield in one run . On the flip side , when you 're flying American , you 're usually at a 2-1 or worse Fighter v. Fighter disadvantage , so if your bombers ca n't get the job done taking out the targets you 're going to lose by virtue of being outnumbered . I do n't know of any other team that suffers from this at those tiers .

It seems like it 's goal is to keep the living players 1 to 1 , which I can understand . If you were the one who joined and it added you in one at a time , or added as many enemy aircraft as allies , you 'd have a situation where you 're taking off into a 2 to 1 disadvantage or worse and that would be even more frustrating . What I do n't like is doing all the work to bring a match to a close , only to have it underdone by JiP .
