08TangoDown08,europe,"I know what you mean but healthcare \ '' insurance\ '' is a misleading term really .

Also , \ '' going along like they were before\ '' doesn\\'t necessarily mean that people are fine with the result . It just means that they\\ 've accepted that it\\ 's happening .",Romance,Native

The UK\\ 's way out is less easy to spot - they need to negotiate trade deals with every major economy themselves now if they leave the EU , and this can and probably will take many years .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; I think if you\\ 'd asked the people , who had actually been under the two regimes by then ( Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania ) they would mostly choose Nazi Germany . I know , shatters that Soviet-apologist world view ... \\n\\nJesus Christ how often do I need to say \ '' I\\ 'm not defending the Soviet Union\ '' for you people to stop acting as if I\\ 'm an apologist for them ? \\n\\nYou seem to be on the exact opposite side of the spectrum - thinking that they\\ 're the root and cause of all evils .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"That depends on what you mean by \ '' over\ '' it . I grew up in the North and I now live in the Republic . I\\ 'm around a lot of conflicting views and opinions . Have we stopped stupidly killing each other over it ? For the most part , yes . Has it been forgotten ? Absolutely not.\\n\\nAs a person , I think the Queen is exemplary . The reluctance is because I don\\'t particularly care for the position she holds or what it used to represent . I do appreciate that she uses her position in a responsible way and has , in her own right , contributed immensely to the peace process . I\\ 'm glad of it , the Troubles were a stupid waste of human life and their legacy continues to haunt certain communities to this day . I don\\'t want to see those days again , so I for one whole-heartedly welcome these developments . I hope to see much more co-operation between Ireland and the UK , we\\ 're neighbours for chrissake .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"The instances in which the USA and the UK use their militaries to preserve stability in independent countries is cancelled out ( at best ) and eclipsed ( at worst ) by the instances in which they\\ 've destroyed the stability in countries and sometimes entire sub-continents - as can be seen in the Middle East right now.\\n\\nIreland is an independent member of both the EU and the UN - I very much hope that my likewise-connected neighbours aren\\'t in the \ '' mood to invade us\ '' , as you put it . They\\ 'd be breaking almost every international law if they did ( not that those count for much to the US or the UK - if they want to invade something they\\ 'll go right ahead and do it anyway I suppose ) .\\n\\nStability is needed , but you should probably look at what\\ 's making those regions unstable to begin with . My country is \ '' in a pretty good spot\ '' because of its location in some respects yes , but also because we enjoy a better relationship with our British neighbours now than we have for hundreds of years - mostly because they\\ 've stopped trying to invade us.\\n\\nEDIT : Downvoted hmm ? I\\ 'll gladly answer any disagreements that people have with what I\\ 've said - provided that they actually put them out there instead of mindlessly clicking the downvote button because I might\\ 've offended them , probably by criticising their mighty country\\ 's all-powerful and unassailable military .",Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; If they were relative non-issues , the EU would have been happy to grant some exceptions for us . But no , apparently they are really really really important issues ! \\n\\nWhy the hell should anyone in Europe need to make an exception for the UK ? It was your decision to leave and you knew the risks . Stop looking for everyone else in Europe to make compromises for you .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; Human rights as such is an eurocentric concept . It is not an universal truth and applying them to people who have denied human rights to millions is simply not fair.\\n & gt ; ... you\\ 're slipping down to the same level as them\\n & gt ; I have always considered \ '' slipping down to their level\ '' to be a ridiculous argument . Did those people who hung Mussolini do the same things he did ? On the same scale ? Were the Nuremberg trials held by Nazis to judge other Nazis ? Because it was a kangaroo court.\\n\\nHow in the hell is it a eurocentric concept ? What does that even mean ? \\n\\nThe argument isn\\'t whether executing Mussolini is the same as what he did to victims of his regime - because of course it isn\\'t . The point being made is that you either stand for the principals of democracy or you don\\'t . The right to a fair trial is one of those principals and it\\ 's a principal that you don\\'t choose to apply on a case by case basis . Mussolini would have undoubtedly met with the same well-deserved fate , but that\\ 's not really the point .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; He couldn\\'t be the epitome of Free Secular Western Capitalism which defeated the fascists , because that would go against your narrative , right ? \\n\\nNice narrative , but I really wish people would stop pretending that it was the USA who defeated Nazi Germany . The Soviet Union was a much bigger factor in defeating the \ '' fascists\ '' than the USA . That\\ 's not me defending one ideology over the other , it\\ 's me stating a simple fact . By the time the Normandy landings came around , it was already clear that the Third Reich were going to lose the war because they\\ 'd already suffered crippling losses to the Soviets in the east ( Stalingrad and Kursk to name the two biggest ) . The only thing that wasn\\'t clear was how long it was going to take to defeat them and how many were going to die until that point was reached.\\n\\nThe Soviets wanted the western allies to open a western front from pretty much the moment Hitler invaded them . They\\ 'd been fighting the Axis since 1941 and the USA didn\\'t actually join the war in Europe until 1944 at Normandy.\\n\\nOf course , there\\ 's more to it than this - but it\\ 's far too simplistic to say that it was \ '' Free Secular Western Capitalism\ '' that defeated fascism , because that\\ 's patently untrue . The Soviet Union was a communist regime and they contributed as much , if not more , to the defeat of fascism than their western allies did .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"It\\ 's no longer the \ '' vast majority\ '' . The demographics of Northern Ireland have changed quite a bit from how they were 20 or 30 years ago.\\n\\nBut yes , still the majority .

08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; \ '' the British army were morally repugnant for shooting civilians . The IRA are noble and brave for killing civilians.\ '' \\n\\nMaybe the British army\\ 's role in Northern Ireland should be treated with as much disdain as the IRA\\ 's then . People in the UK tend to talk about what happened in Northern Ireland as if it was so simple that it could be boiled down to the good guys ( British soldiers ) vs bad guys ( the IRA ) .\\n\\nIt really wasn\\'t that simple , and if you can\\'t accept that fact then you\\ 're probably not equipped to talk about the subject in a serious way .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,The Republic then needs to call a referendum of its own on whether or not to accept Northern Ireland . If that passes then Northern Ireland joins the Republic of Ireland .,Romance,Native

08TangoDown08,europe,"& gt ; Ahahhaa giving fucking warnings , how fucking valiant , how noble.\\n & gt ; The IRA gave warnings before the Warrington bombs , still blew up 2 innocent kids.\\n & gt ; And before you say , I do make a distinction between the IRA of the Easter Rising and the IRA of the 70s/80s/90s.\\n\\nI mean , if you\\ 're interested in whataboutery then I could point to any number of atrocities committed by the British army or by Loyalist paramilitaries - but I don\\'t see how that would be in any way helpful . There is no \ '' good\ '' side as far as the Troubles is concerned and , likewise , there is no \ '' evil\ '' side . Evil acts were committed by all sides , but that\\ 's what war does . I don\\'t think anyone joined the IRA with the specific intent to blow up two little kids - and equally , I don\\'t think anyone joined the British army with the specific intent to open fire on a crowd of unarmed civilians.\\n\\nWar and conflict desensitises people . That was as true in Northern Ireland as it was anywhere else in the world .",Romance,Native
08TangoDown08,europe,"Maybe . It\\ 's either that or you\\ 're just not willing to entertain anything that doesn\\'t line up with your own particular opinion.\\n\\nThe history of the Troubles can\\'t just be boiled down into something as simple as \ '' the IRA were all bloodthirsty terrorists and the poor British soldiers were the good guys who went off to fight them\ '' . Both sides are guilty of some pretty despicable things.\\n\\nWithout people like Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams though , how do you bring an organisation as violent as the IRA to a ceasefire ? How do you convince them to not only stop shooting their weapons but to have them all destroyed under international supervision ? How do you do that without the assistance of people with influence over the IRA ?",Romance,Native

Especially an alliance with a country like America which has been persistently at war with multiple countries and seems to view it as a way to gain favour rather than a last resort . Just because they aren\\'t seeking to relabel the countries they invade or overthrow as the \ '' United States of America\ '' on the map , it does not justify their actions .

AnExplosiveMonkey,europe,"& gt ; 1 ) You\\ 're presuming that gay people want to get married though .

Also , do you acknowledge that cohabitation is less than marriage ? \\n\\n & gt ; 3 ) You\\ 're presuming that government has a right to say what a church can do . The definition of marriage can vary from organisation to organisation . If a priest doesn\\'t want to marry a homosexual couple , then why should he be forced to ? \\n\\nWhere ? Where did I do this ? Show me.\\n\\nI\\ 'm not saying a priest should be forced to do anything . I\\ 'm saying if the priest is *also* willing , where is the problem ? \\n\\n & gt ; 4 ) And you\\ 're focusing on Christianity .

Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Germany ) , Mussolini ( Italy ) , Franco ( Spain ) , Suharto ( Indonesia ) and several Latin American regimes . Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each : \\n\\n & gt ; **1 . Powerful and Continuing Nationalism** - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . Flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\\n\\n & gt ; **2 . Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights** - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \ '' need.\ '' The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc.\\n\\n & gt ; **3 . Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause** - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists , terrorists , etc.\\n \\n & gt ; **4 . Supremacy of the Military** - Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\\n\\n & gt ; **5 . Rampant Sexism** - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid . Divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\\n\\n & gt ; **6 . Controlled Mass Media** - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . Censorship , especially in war time , is very common.\\n\\n & gt ; **7 . Obsession with National Security** - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\\n8 . Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed\\nto the government\\ 's policies or actions.\\n\\n & gt ; **9 . Corporate Power is Protected** - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\\n\\n & gt ; **10 . Labor Power is Suppressed** - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed.\\n\\n & gt ; **11 . Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts** - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested . Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\\n\\n & gt ; **12 . Obsession with Crime and Punishment** - Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\\n\\n & gt ; **13 . Rampant Cronyism and Corruption** - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\\n\\n & gt ; **14 . Fraudulent Elections** - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham . Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates , use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and manipulation of the media . Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections .",Romance,Native

AstroAgama,europe,"Paywall , text : \\n\\n & gt ; European leaders are preparing to recognise the potential for a united Ireland\u201d within the EU , confirming that Northern Ireland would seamlessly rejoin the bloc after Brexit in the event of a vote for Irish reunification . In a step that may stoke concerns in Britain that Brexit could hasten the fragmentation of the UK , diplomats are planning to ask leaders of the EU\u2019s 27 post-Brexit member countries to endorse the idea in a summit on Saturday . It would allow the province to follow the example of German reunification in 1990 and reflect the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , which ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland . The agreement allows a referendum on reuniting Ireland where there is reason to believe a majority in the province is in favour.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Britain and Ireland are committed to upholding the Good Friday Agreement as co-guarantors . But the increased talk of Irish reunification will reinforce the fears of those in Britain who believe & gt ; Brexit will bolster those championing a UK break-up . Nicola Sturgeon , Scotland\u2019s first minister , has already called for a Scottish independence referendum within two years , as Britain\u2019s departure from the union is finalised . Saturday\u2019s gathering in Brussels will mark the formal adoption of EU guidelines for Brexit talks with the UK , staking out a tough opening stance with a common front on issues such as Gibraltar , ? & gt ; Northern Ireland and the rights of EU migrants.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Britain on Thursday not to harbour illusions about the bloc\u2019s resolve . \u201cI have to put it in such clear terms because unfortunately I have the feeling that some in Britain still have illusions , \u201d Ms Merkel told the Bundestag . \u201cBut that would be a waste of time.\u201d No final decision has been taken on a specific text on Irish unity . It would be part of accompanying documents to the guidelines for Saturday\u2019s summit , because it is seen as a clarification of law rather than something to be negotiated in Europe\u2019s talks with Britain.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Officials warned that a reference to the idea could still be excluded because of the acute sensitivity around independence questions in Scotland and Catalonia in Spain . EU27 ambassadors were first told of the plan at a meeting on Wednesday but Donald Tusk , European Council president , has yet to share a text , which was suggested by Dublin . Enda Kenny has pushed for a \u201cunited Ireland\u201d reference in the final Brexit treaty that will confirm the UK\u2019s exit , but an EU statement at the outset of talks would be seen as a diplomatic coup as he prepares to step down as taoiseach \u2014 prime minister \u2014 after six years . Advocates of the reference to Northern Ireland and reunification say the reference simply reflects the Good Friday pact , signed long before Brexit was anticipated . But it would still send a powerful signal at a sensitive moment in the politics of the island.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Under pressure to hand power to a younger generation , Mr Kenny has said he will make his intentions for his political future clear once the \u201cground rules for Brexit\u201d are set . This has fuelled expectations that he will step down within weeks , setting in motion a contest for the leadership of his centre-right Fine Gael party . Ireland is the most exposed of the EU\u2019s remaining member states to Brexit . Dublin is desperate to avoid a clean break between the UK and the EU , which could severely damage Irish-British trade that runs to \u20ac1.2bn a week . But it also wants to be seen to play a full part in the negotiations on the EU side . \u201cWe will not be a proxy for the British in the exit negotiations , \u201d Irish foreign minister Charlie Flanagan told the Financial Times in an interview .",Romance,Native

AtomicKoala,europe,"Hmmm . While I have no doubt that Russia is quite often malicious , this article appears to be quite sensationalist .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"It\\ 's in our self interest to ensure stability in our neighbourhood . We also have a responsibility to enforce international law and to protect people where we can . With Syria we generally went \ '' too difficult , not worth it\ '' , which is fair enough . But it means we have to deal with the aftermath if we weren\\'t willing to make the regime to compromise by force . Most refugees have fled the regime .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,You want to involve ... non-Europeans ? \\n\\nBlasphemy !,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"& gt ; I support the idea of a ( con- ) federate Europe.\\n\\nI would argue that much of the problems of Europe stem for its confederate nature . States have too much power , it should be the people who have the power .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"When they stop entertaining us evidently.\\n\\nAlso beheading , how liberal .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Indeed , what Brevik did looks far more like terrorism than what happened in London ( although both certainly instilled some level of terror , Ut\u00f8ya really shook me more so than what happened a few days ago ) .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Reading about Ukraine is always depressing . A country with so much potential , yet it has barely gotten back to where it was 22 years ago . So much corruption , poverty , depression . Being a reporter there must be crushing .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,Sure my post was pretty vague I suppose !,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"And the Catholic churches , judging by here .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,I think Canadians should be a lot more concerned about all the radicalised American nationalists across the border than Clinton .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,I would rather people engage in peaceful protest than what seems to be somewhat recreational rioting.\\n\\nEffective peaceful protest usually gets better results than destroying the products of human labour .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,& gt ; Triggered\\n\\nEh ? \\n\\nAnd these people said they were born in Romania . Bear in mind all these people would be & gt ; 20 .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Well we could quarantine every village . This was a regulatory , and human failure that could have happened in Mauritius just as easily as in the Union .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"How much money did the rest of Europe contribute to Germany ? Bare in mind the DDR was far , far worse off than NI .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"I think in all fairness , in 2010 or so our TVs were flooded with images of rioting Greeks . The killing of those bank workers in that arson still lingers in many memories .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Well , we need more Swiss posters ! You guys seem to be quite rare : )",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,When did that become the case ?,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,Uh ... I got offered 40Mb/s with free British Isles calls for *just* \u20ac55.\\n\\nSuck it mainlanders.\\n\\n^^Please ^^help,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Oh well I pay for 3Mb/s at the moment ( for like \u20ac40 a month with included calls ) , but get 6Mb/s ( yay ... ) .\\n\\nAre you in America at the moment ?",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,Israel criticised ? OMG ANTISEMITE.\\n\\nAll people like you do is disrespect those who suffer from genuine anti-Semitism .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Well either way , it is my fault for starting it .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,& gt ; We can\\'t tolerate intolerance . We can\\'t fight those people with love or soap bubbles or \ '' humanity\ '' .\\n\\nSure . And I support the fight - from drones to trainers to special forces.\\n\\nHowever that 13 year old had no real agency compared to the people who brought him there - this is like saying \ '' good riddance\ '' to some Hitler Youth roped into defending Berlin . Brainwashed with no choice .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Good example of why we need more cooperation between EU navies.\\n\\nThe US has a good strategy . Design a decent attack submarine , build twenty . We design a mediocre one , plan to build five , end up with one and the scrapped hulls of three.\\n\\nAlso , this is basically a cost overrun rather than a \u20ac500 million waste .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,Why would eurobonds and such cost that much ?,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,I would imagine that a unanimous decision to implement some sort of centralised European taxation ( perhaps on carbon as Schauble wisely proposed ) for a 5-7 year basis that could be used to increase structural funding and such could get around this . \\n\\nThis would also compensate the likes of Estonia if Greece gets more interest rate cuts and maturity extensions which do not contravene the law apparently .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Burkinis , not burkas . Burkas are banned .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Lidl is pretty decent quality all the same . Aldi is a bit better though , in my opinion .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,Indeed . If we want to make war unthinkable for the Baltic states we need to have the military force to protect them .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Jesus , what business does a metro company have telling people to not do that ? No reason unless they are causing disruption or trouble which is hardly the case .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Ah here , we have a budget deficit of 8 % right now . Sure , 30 % of our national debt is banking related at this stage , and the situation is shite . And thus we can say that 30 % of our interest payments would be due to bailing out the banks.\\n\\nHowever the majority of our deficit is to pay for our healthcare , our education , our safety . Why ? Because for ten years , we taxed too little and spent too much . Every other country has a property tax , and its removal by Jack Lynch was one of the worst taxation decisions made . Stamp duty is far more unfair , and the situation became ludicrous .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,& gt ; The EU is an American designed Soviet Union.\\n\\nDamn I thought you were a troll then I saw all your positive karma .,Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Not really , but the nature of US politics makes lobbying easy , and the Jewish lobby is both very strong , effective , and pro-Israel .",Romance,Native
AtomicKoala,europe,"Not as well known sadly , ask around , everyone will know of the Jews ( and rightfully so ) , while much less will know of the others .",Romance,Native
