03801,soccer,"In Australian rules football a few years ago diving became quite an issue . It got a lot of attention because a lot of people who follow and play the game like to think of it as a tough sport where anything like diving is a disgrace to the game , to the point where if you spent more than a few seconds on the ground , you 'd want to be going off on a stretcher otherwise you 're a softcock . Anyway , there is a 'push in the back ' rule where , strangely enough , if someone pushes you in the back you get a free kick . As the game has evolved into a fully fledged elite sport , some players began to go to ground at the slightest touch to their back to win a free kick and often a shot at goal . The league 's solution to the problem was not to punish the diving , but to make the rule black and white that any contact to the back would be punished with a free kick . At first there was a bit of outrage from supporters saying the rule was soft and too hard on defenders , but eventually they became used to expecting free kicks being paid for contact that once may not have been punished . More importantly , players soon came to learn that they had to learn to defend without making any contact to the back , and so play has now evolved so that it is no longer an issue . So whilst there was for a little while a rise in the number of 'push in the back ' decisions initially , and groaning from supporters when it happened , players eventually adapted and that rate is back to normal , and diving is no longer an issue .",Romance,Native
03801,soccer,"Yeah I 'm not saying the rule change could directly be transferred to another sport , because the issue , whilst related , is not the same . Goals are far more frequent in AFL and free kicks are taken from where they occur , not a penalty spot , so are less of a sure thing . My point is that a carefully considered rule change could help fix the problem .",Romance,Native

Generally Fleet Carriers are the best but need a complement of air craft built for them as well.They have much greater range than any other ship and can support land operations with their aircraft whilst other capital ships can only bombard a province adjacent to the sea . I believe battle cruisers are as fast as carriers with close the same firepower as a battleship , but do n't have as much Armour .

1337Bolshevik,syriancivilwar,"On the face of it , the remarks made by Iranian President Hassan Rohani during a meeting with senior editors from media organizations on Friday should not have come as a surprise . `` I do not see a coalition between Iran and Russia on fighting terrorism in Syria , '' he said , seemingly contradicting a flurry of reports in recent weeks that Moscow and Tehran were tightly coordinated over the deployment of Russian forces in Latakia , Syria . After Rohani 's unclear statements , Putin 's laconic affirmative to the question posed to him by interviewer Charlie Rose whether his country sent its troops to prevent Bashar Assad 's downfall ( `` You 're right , '' Putin replied ) , was nearly refreshing in its simplicity . We ca n't , of course , accept Putin 's and Rohani 's statements at face value . However , they do show that , despite reports of Iran 's Quds Force commander General Qassem Suleimani 's visit to Moscow and the Fox News report on Friday that Russia and Iran are coordinating actions in Syria from Baghdad , reports by Western journalists stationed in Tehran and Damascus , that Russia 's latest maneuvers `` surprised '' the Iranian leadership and were n't to its liking , were fairly reliable . So far , Russia and Iran were considered to be allies , sharing the common goal of keeping Assad in power . Both supplied arms , lines of credit and military advice to the Syrian regime , with Russia also putting up a diplomatic umbrella by using its UN Security Council veto to prevent anti-Assad resolutions . Iran , through Hezbollah and other Shi'ite militias , supplied manpower to replenish the Syrian army 's thinning ranks . The abrupt entry of the Russian expeditionary force has tilted the scales in the Assad coalition : Russia turned from a distant supporter to an active participant on the ground , becoming overnight a much more influential factor , in a way which made her different interest in the survival of the Damascus regime plainly evident . For the leaders of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran , keeping Syria on the Shi'ite axis as a link to their proxy in Lebanon , Hezbollah , was almost an existential need . Without Syria , Iran 's regional influence and its ability to control what is happening in Lebanon – to direct , arm and maintain Hezbollah as a central force – would have been crippled . For Putin , however , leaving Assad to his fate would have , at worst , lost the Kremlin some of its prestige . The Russian president 's decision to take a chance and invest resources in Syria after all was primarily driven by a desire to take advantage of the vacuum created by U.S. inaction in the Middle East . Putin seeks to create leverage that would allow Russia to regain the place it lost in the international arena in the wake of last year 's invasion of Ukraine . Syria , Assad and Iran 's interests have now become hostages to Putin 's geopolitical goals . The Russian president could decide , for example , as he apparently already agreed to at his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week , to coordinate his steps with Israel as well and to permit the Israeli air force to continue to fly over Syria and attack Hezbollah weapon convoys ( as foreign reports claim Israel has already done in recent years ) . With the consent of Europe and the United States , he could force elections on Assad as well as cooperation with members of the opposition , including those who oppose Iranian involvement in Syria . Putin could decide that it would be better for Russia to involve Iran ’ s Sunni rivals – Saudi Arabia and Egypt – in a future solution to the civil war . Moreover , at any stage , he could also decide to bring the Russian forces home with their gear . Unlike Russia ’ s support for separatists in Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , there is no Russian national yearning for Syrian land in Aleppo and Homs province . In the event of a deal in which Russia would receive Western recognition for a portion of its aspirations in former Soviet areas in return for cooperation in finding a long-term solution in Syria that might stop the flow of refugees to Europe , and maybe even allow their return home , Putin would not hesitate to abandon the Iranians . Another angle in the relationship between Russia and Iran can be currently seen through the eyes of the masses of Syrian refugees flooding European highways . Among them are a considerable number of citizens who are actually from areas and population groups that support Assad . They recount that they decided to leave because they came to the conclusion that even if the Assad regime survives , it will only be as an Iranian satellite - an alternative that in their view , as secular Syrians , is not much more appealing than being ruled by Islamic State . The entry of Russia into the region raises the prospect that areas in Syria that remain under the Assad 's control , or anyone who would replace him , could actually end up under Russian influence , rather than an Iranian Shi ’ ite province . In Western eyes , that may not be such a great deal , but for many Syrians , it would be a lot preferable than the other options .",Romance,Native
