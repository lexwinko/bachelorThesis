0zymandiasss,europe,"Firstly , there have not been \ '' 3 models\ '' for Brexit put forward , it\\ 's the Remain camp that keeps trying to box the Leave camp into rigid constraints of pre existing deal . The UK can and will get it\\ 's own separate , unique deal that does not include free movement of people in any form . Now , if you\\ 're looking for the closest approximation of what that deal would look like , look to Canada or South Korea . \ '' But 7 years ! ! Hur Dur ! \ '' All other countries that have gone for a free trade deal have been negotiating from a blank slate . The UK is already compliment with all EU regulations , we\\ 'd just be negotiating on which parts to drop which will take far less time that Canada did.\\n\\nNow , as for why the EU would give us a good deal . Now , I expect you think they\\ 'll try to screw us over to stop others leaving I.e . the abusive partner theory . I disagree with this because you have to think about what will happen in the future . Let\\ 's assume they\\ 're deliberately harsh . Now , if the UK does badly , everyone will blame it on not getting a good deal . Now , while this will certainly discourage other members from leaving , it will leave the EU wit a hostile reputation . Other countries will be less inclined to join the EU , rather they\\ 'd just try for trade deals than locking themselves into a partnership they know they can never leave . \\n\\nConversely , if the UK sees good economic growth , even with a shitty deal with the EU , it will spell the end of the EU . All countries will see the UK thriving outside the unions , even with harsh penalties . This will open the flood gates . The more that leave , the less the bad deal matters as all newly independent countries will trade with each other as well . If that happened , the EU would probably not survive for many years after . Not something the EU wants.\\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about what will happen if they give the UK a good deal . If they give a good deal , and yet the UK does badly , it will send a message to everyone in Europe that membership of the EU is by far in a way the best thing for their economies . All countries in it will give up on the idea of leaving , seeing the economic benefit of staying . Countries not yet in the EU will make it a priority to join , so they can also get the economic boost it provides . All in all , if the UK gets a good deal but fails , it will ensure the further if the EU for decades to come . \\n\\nNow let\\ 's think about if the UK gets a good deal and also has good economic growth . People will see it as a country doing well , with most of that success based on the free trade deal they got , this reflects well on both parties involved . Now , some countries in the EU will see this as a reason to also leave , however , the EU has several ways to discourage them this way . They can say the UK only got a good trade deal because of it\\ 's large economy , something that would not be afforded to the smaller states . In the case of larger countries like France , they can say the UK is only doing well because it never had to float its own currency after exit , playing up fears amongst eurozone countries that it would be impossible for them to exit the EU because of the Euro . Now , his isn\\'t a perfect way to keep members , but it certainly gives the EU more room to manoeuvre.\\n\\nTLDR : If the EU gives the UK a bad deal , at best the EU will have a hostile reputation and find it much harder to attract new members , at worst , it will lead to the break up of the EU within a few years . If they give the UK a good deal , best case they secure the future of the EU for decades , worth case they have to work hard to stop any further members leaving , but the eurozone members will be easy to keep in the fold . I think in the grand scheme of things , they\\ 'll come down on giving us a good deal .",Romance,Native
