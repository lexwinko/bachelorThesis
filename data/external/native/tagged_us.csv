12ToneRow,europe,Universal suffrage was a terrible idea .,Romance,Native
12ToneRow,europe,"& gt ; Um , that wasn\\'t Colonialism . At all.\\n\\nFunny , I don\\'t remember saying that it was.\\n\\n & gt ; Firstly , Mongol \ '' rule\ '' in Europe was mostly confined to raids and demanding tribute . They didn\\'t settle and they never went further West than & gt ; Hungary . They were far too busy fighting themselves.\\n\\nThey were responsible for bringing the plague to Europe . \\n\\n & gt ; Seondly , the Muslims did not colonize Iberia . They migrated and settled in the region and created their own sultanates and caliphates . There\\ 's a & gt ; distinct difference between conquering with migration , and colonialism where the only goal is to strip the region of resources useful to the & gt ; overlord , regardless of the conditions of the native population . The conflict between warring Kingdoms of roughly equal capability in the Medieval & gt ; Era is supremely different to the domination of less civilized nations later on.\\n\\nSo numerous slave raids , land grabs , and centuries of foreign occupation were all just quaint settlements in our neighborhoods ? Are you saying that they didn\\'t exploit us economically ? \\n\\n & gt ; Are you one of those Americans that claims that blacks today are not suffering at all from the effects of past American discrimination ? \\n\\nWhat\\ 's funny is the fact that they\\ 're not . They have benefited from their ancestors\\ ' enslavement . They enjoy the same rights as whites do , and they get a leg up in education and the job market through affirmative action . They get to enjoy the conveniences of the western world while their relatives in Africa have drastically lower living standards . \\n\\n & gt ; To make it simple for you , problems such as wanton corruption , abysmal education , wars , ethnic conflict , and wealth leaving the country are & gt ; extremely present issues that are resultant of European colonialism , and American neocolonialism during the Cold War . \\n\\nSorry to say , but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history . It\\ 's not the white man\\ 's fault that they slaughter each other and commit mass indiscriminate rape . Not being able to read doesn\\'t cause someone to burn their neighbors alive . \\n\\n & gt ; On top of this , what you are saying is amount to victim blaming , it\\ 's arrogant to the extreme to assume people should not want to govern & gt ; themselves because their colonial overlords are handicapping them in their ability to do so , and this is directly contradictory to the right of & gt ; self-determination as granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \\n\\nAnd we did allow them to govern themselves . Just because their standard of living fell post-colonialism doesn\\'t obligate us to let them all come to Europe.\\n\\n & gt ; It is a reality that corporations of various national origins are exploiting Africa for its natural resources , and it is in the name of these corporate & gt ; interests that many European interventions have been made , the most classic example being the Secession of Katanga in 1960.\\n\\nAnd ? This exploitation is not endorsed by the European governments nor is the general population responsible for it . If those nations want restitution , they should get it from the companies that exploited them . And again , it is the leadership of these exploited places that allows it to happen in the first place . \\n\\n & gt ; For an indefinite period of time . We are the root cause for many of the problems plaguing these nations , when those problems have been solved & gt ; and we show genuine good will to act in their interests instead of our own , when it comes to the problems in the region , then we can start talking & gt ; about absolving ourselves . In historical terms , this was yesterday.\\n\\nHow about those that exploited Europe then ? Should we continue to make them pay for their past sins indefinitely ? The west already supplies most of these nations with food/monetary aid . Some countries I\\ 'm sure , only remain solvent because of the aid we give . Where would you draw the line ? \\n\\n & gt ; Again , the nations are , as these are the same nations today that existed then , only in a more evolved ( or devolved , depending on where you & gt ; stand ) state . The United Kingdom is the British Empire . Portugal is Portugal and Belgium is Belgium.\\n\\nA nation is it\\ 's people . And these people have nothing to do with the sins of the past . Who\\ 's really bearing the cost of making amends ? It\\ 's not \ '' nations\ '' . It\\ 's people.\\n\\n & gt ; One would think that\\ 's not really the fault of the consumer , but the utter indifference amongst the general population as to the origin of their & gt ; goods would , indeed , make us partially responsible . \\n\\nIt takes two to tango . No one is making them accept such working conditions . If someone is , it certainly isn\\'t your average Brit . \\n\\n & gt ; No , the people of Germany should not feel any specific guilt about the Holocaust , but the nation of Germany should remember its obligations to the & gt ; people which it has effected - namely the Jews and the Arabs who have been displaced in order to make space for a Jewish nation . \\n\\nBut Germany wasn\\'t responsible for the establishment of Israel , which impacted the people already living there . \\n\\n\\n\\n",Romance,Native
12ToneRow,europe,"On your first 4 points ( to save some space ) : We weren\\'t only talking about colonialism . You suggested that we have these obligations to foreigners for ALL the sins we committed . Not just colonialism . \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm saying it\\ 's nothing compared to Colonialism . Slavery was a two way street , Christians sold captured Muslims into slavery during the & gt ; Reconquista . Due to the fact those people had then been living there for a sum total of 700 years , would you call that economic exploitation , & gt ; or just simply the spoils of war ? \\n\\nYou\\ 're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others . It suits your argument to do so . I don\\'t fault you for that . Interestingly enough , your point about the Reconquista seems to indicate that you think we are even with the muslims . Good , then we don\\'t owe them anything . \\n\\n & gt ; Actual foreign direct investment as opposed to simply handing over a few billion to a government as long as they tow your line , because make & gt ; no mistake that aid money doesn\\'t go to all post-colonial states , just the ones that do what we like.\\n\\nWe could go back to giving them nothing if you like . I\\ 'd certainly like that . \\n\\n & gt ; You should pick up a history book sometime , it might fix that problem of yours.\\n\\nSub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans , Arabs , and Europeans . Maybe you could enlighten me.\\n\\n & gt ; Do you think that the blacks have twice the unemployment simply because they\\ 're lazy and like living off welfare ? Or maybe it\\ 's because & gt ; there\\ 's fuck all educational investment in working class areas . \\n\\nI guess white people don\\'t belong to the working class , right ? Your insults aside , there are many ways one could explain black unemployment numbers . One thing I do know is that it has nothing to do with some imaginary inter-generational post traumatic stress . That\\ 's one of the more outlandish explanations for black Americans\\ ' over-representation in violent crime and under-representation in higher education.\\n\\n & gt ; For example , it was the Belgium Army fighting in the Congo on the behalf of corporate interests . So , yes , the state does endorse this . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.\\n\\n & gt ; The relationship between the colonized and the colonials is like a home owner and a thief . The thief has all of your shit but you still want him & gt ; to get the fuck out of your house . At the end of it all you have nothing left . Is it your fault ? \\n\\nInfrastructure , education , modern medicine , and a written language in some cases . We gave these things to the colonized . I\\ 'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.\\n\\n & gt ; The wealth they took went into the state and matters of the state , which the state benefited from and as such , successive generations of & gt ; people living in that state benefit from that same exploitation.\\n\\nWhere does the state get its money ? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution ? That\\ 's my point . Generations today shouldn\\'t be made to suffer for sins of the past . \\n\\n & gt ; Are you some sort of Libertarian that believes everyone can quit a job and move on with their lives ? \\n\\nPeople do it all the time . They weigh the risks and take their chances where they might have more opportunity . Many third world immigrants come to Europe with nothing . Many come illegally . If they can just quit their countries and move to Europe , they can certainly quit a job and move on with their lives.\\n\\nI doubt many of these people care about colonialism . They\\ 've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want . If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners , why don\\'t you do the \\'tolerant\\ ' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis ? Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections ? The possibilities for saying , \ '' We\\ 're sorry\ '' are endless.\\n\\n",Romance,Native

19djafoij02,AskEurope,"[ Does this work ? ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Rhodesia ) \\n\\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the Rhodesian Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a first past the post principle . At some stages , however , there were two-member constituencies , and in the early years there were some appointed members . The 1961 constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\\n\\nAt the time of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence , Rhodesia\\ 's amended 1961 constitution ( which was annexed to the UDI ) provided for an Officer Administering the Government , to be appointed by the British Sovereign ( or by the parliament if the Queen made no appointment ) , with political power residing with the unicameral Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nUnder the 1961 constitution , the Rhodesian Assembly had 65 elected members : 50 constituency members and 15 district members . The voter rolls had education , property and income qualifications . The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95 % of its members were white and 5 % were black or Asian . The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90 % of its members were black and 10 % were white or Asian . The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll . Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts , but for elections in the constituencies , the B roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total , and for elections in the districts , the A roll vote was capped at 20 % of the total . This procedure was known as \\'cross-voting\\ ' . In practice , the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\\n\\nThe 1962 general election was a watershed for the country , since it resulted in the election of a Rhodesian Front government led by Winston Field that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia . The defeated United Federal Party led by Edgar Whitehead had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\\n\\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969 . It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided . African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register , and those that had registered not to vote . Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote , and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25 % .\\n\\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution . This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic , following a referendum result in favour in 1969 . Under this new constitution , there was a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected Senate , and a directly elected House of Assembly , in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the 1961 constitution . The new office of president was a ceremonial post , with executive power remaining with the Prime Minister.\\n\\nThe 1969 constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly . The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans . The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll , and 8 B roll seats . It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached . In addition to the B roll seats , the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members . The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly , with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well . These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.\\n\\nThe new constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms . The concept of \ '' separate development\ '' for blacks and whites was written into that constitution . The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted . This last feature underpinned the concept of \\'equal partnership between black and white\\ ' as an alternative to majority rule . However , the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely , if not for ever . White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance , given enough time . [ 1 ] \\n\\n\\n",Romance,Native

If you\\ 're familiar with where each of those districts is located , you notice a pattern that districts with the highest GINI coefficient are almost entirely urban , while the districts with the lowest GINI coefficients are either rural areas , or wealthy suburbs . It\\ 's also interesting to see that while nearly all of the districts with high GINI coefficients are represented in Congress by left-liberal Democrats , the districts with higher GINI coefficients don\\'t seem to be politically correlated.\\n\\nThe district with the lowest GINI is VA-11 , which contains the wealthy Washington DC suburbs of Fairfax County and eastern Prince William County south to Dumfries . It is represented by a centrist Democrat.\\n\\nThe district with the 2nd lowest GINI is MN-06 , which covers the wealthy exurbs northwest of Minneapolis , the city and suburbs of St . Cloud , and the rural counties connecting and surrounding the two population centers . This district was represented by ultra-right Tea Party Republican Michelle Bachmann until last year.\\n\\nThe district with the 3rd lowest GINI coefficent is NY-02 . This district covers Long Island and contains southern Nassau County east of Brookyn and southwestern Suffolk County . These suburbs of New York City are prosperous , but not as wealthy as the Hamptons further east ( this is district NY-01 ) . This district is represented by Republican Peter King , who is moderate on economic and social issues but is also one of the biggest foreign policy \ '' Hawks\ '' in Washington.\\n\\nMy own district , VA-05 , is one of the outliers in that it\\ 's a primarily rural district , but it has the 85th highest GINI coefficent . This district was gerrymandered to include the city of Charlottesville and its\\ ' surrounding suburbs in Albemarle County , while the rest of the district is quite rural . The city has a lot of really poor , primarily black residents , as well as the prosperous neighborhoods surrounding the University of Virginia and the central business district .

You should read the book \ '' The World and a Very Small Place in Africa\ '' by Donald R. Wright . It\\ 's about the history of Gambia which includes colonization by the British Empire . The British didn\\'t always support every one of their colonies and commonwealth countries , most often they will take more than they give back .

It is a mutual defense treaty , but all these countries just putz around saying who gives a shit I can\\'t be punished for it and the other countries protect me . If that isn\\'t selfish freeloading I don\\'t know if anything is.\\n\\nYou have a country like Spain that says fuck it and cut their military more and more , but then they cry about taking care of illegal immigrants from Africa . Why should anyone in EU care when Spain proves very effectively that they don\\'t give a shit about anything that happens in Eastern Europe ? It is only \ '' team\ '' when it is asking for everyone else to help you.\\n\\nBy the way . That crisis affects Americans , too . I didn\\'t realize a crisis that also happens in USA is a good excuse to say we don\\'t want to spend on defense , let American tax payers take care of it for us so we can have other things we want .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,WWII being used as an excuse for free loading on budgets in 2014.\\n\\nK.\\n\\nWhere are these war torn areas in Western Europe ? Why are countries that were behind the iron curtain able to meet the AGREED UPON goal ?,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,And how would writing off all of Europe help USA ? That would mean one country owning the whole continent . Leaving an alliance also is an excellent way to lose influence . Taking your ball and going home doesn\\'t improve anything.\\n\\nIf anything USA has the most to complain about in regards to NATO . It wouldn\\'t be \ '' an Anglo club\ '' if everyone weren\\'t such cheap bastards that freeload with pride . The exceptions to this prove the rule .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Simple , a big army kept them honest in Germany during Cold War . A big army would have kept them out of Ukraine and Georgia and would kick them out of Moldova .

4ringcircus,europe,I do agree with you but give credit where it is due . I think Poland and Greece pay their share and all of the Baltics are either projected to hit 2 % or are already there .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,And then what ? Internal passports restricting their travel ? They would be able to move anywhere they wanted and like all immigrants would form ghettos because they would be most comfortable around each other .,Romance,Native

4ringcircus,europe,I completely missed that .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Well , in that case , it would be with a sub or ICBM . At that point , tactical or strategic is just a matter of size . It wouldn\\'t be used in a \ '' battlefield\ '' setting which is the intent of tactical nukes . Russia has tons of ICBMs and a huge fleet of subs from soviet days that can launch nukes as well . You would need A LOT of missiles in order to guarantee a likelihood of stopping the attack . Plus subs introduce a real wild card . It is basically impossible to stop sub attacks.\\n\\nThey even have bombers that can drop nukes , but that is more risky . Nowadays they are mostly used for dick waving by violating NATO/EU airspace .",Romance,Native

4ringcircus,europe,How convenient .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,They don\\'t need to invade Germany . They work the edges and weaken the EU politically in the meantime because their main rival is EU not the USA . EU has a much bigger effect on Russia economically and politically versus the USA . The last thing they need is a strong EU . That is why they invaded Ukraine multiple times . They take full advantage of funding opposition parties and \ '' protecting Russians\ '' around Europe .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Russia can\\'t do shit . If they did that , they would only be guaranteeing their own destruction . You don\\'t earn \ '' respect\ '' through nukes . You earn it by giving respect to your neighbors . That is why countries run from Russia at first opportunity into the arms of USA and EU and NATO .",Romance,Native

They have a right to prosperity . EU has more to offer them.\\n\\nFuck this apologizing . I don\\'t care about their motives . Stop invading Europe . They operate as though they are a vast WNP pure and no one may dare touch the USSR that still exists in their mind and they are so confused why Warsaw pact countries prefer the West.\\n\\nEdit : yes you are lying .

4ringcircus,europe,What does ISIS have to do with the other rebel groups ? They are different groups . USA is already saying that they would do that .

4ringcircus,europe,I am curious . Are there any maps that break down all these \ '' countries\ '' you speak of ? I thought Russians were an ethnic majority all over Russia including even the far reaches of Siberia . Aren\\'t nukes also located all over Russia ?

4ringcircus,europe,I guess that would be a nicer way of stating \ '' doesn\\'t know shit\ '' outside of their country .

4ringcircus,europe,"Russia alone has murdered journalists in triple digits just under the reign of Putin . Keep saying USA and Russia are equivalent . It makes you look very reasonable . Clinton never said Putin was running death camps . Your article showed her making specific comparisons that preceded the beginning of WWII which all of USA and EU is very much not in favor of reliving and how she wanted a diplomatic solution created as quickly as possible.\\n\\nHow does this compare to daily accusations of people and governments being fascists ? RT is state run media and the shit they say is getting closer and closer to North Korean state media with every passing week . The lies never end . That isn\\'t \ '' opinion\ '' either . There are flat out objective lies and throwing around conspiracy theories to try to fool idiots with what is obviously being done by Russian government.\\n\\nJust visit /r/Russia they are Russians themselves who are biased towards Russia and even they call out the bullshit being done by Russian government . And no , Snowden being wanted for espionage where he will get a TRIAL which he very clearly was doing as a government employee does not equal murdered journalists in the triple digits .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Yeah I was just going by what I knew on USA . Like I know all eos vehicles are made in Portugal . Lambo is same company anyway . So many brands fall under VW . They are massive . Pretty sure the factory is near Lisbon .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,The poor pay higher rates based on income . They are the worst possible tax . Consumption taxes reward hiding sales .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,No one considers Canada a resource colony one trick pony economy .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Well I simply asked for your opinion . Obviously cuts had to happen no matter what . Maintaining prior budgets with the reduced tax revenue would have been a disaster long term .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Are you telling me they aren\\'t accusing Estonia of fascism when they use fake pictures and make references to Hitler youth clubs and making heroes of war criminals ? Are you serious ? ! You are also completely wrong on \ '' mandatory Catholic Church\ '' . You are pulling facts out of your ass and using it to justify fascist accusations like they are a normal every day conversation . What do you even mean , most fascist states ? Just how many fascist states do you think there are ?",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,OK. How is Estonia fascist ? How is Estonia raising fascist boy groups ? Just one of many accusations leveled by Russian government .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Well Putin has no right to complain when he has the same behavior . However Russia calling everything fascist around them is a damn joke . That is a blatant lie and absurd .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"This is the official statement from Russia . Specific accusations that Estonia glorifies Nazi propaganda and war criminals . There is nothing vague . But I know , Amerikkka is the WORST.\\n\\nhttp : //rusemb.ee/news/pressreleases/12-08-2014/",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Yeah exactly , but you know I am just a stupid American as usual on this sub . American flag is automatic downvotes even if I say something that is obviously true .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,You realize how large China is as is ? And how expansive Siberia is ? Siberia is also filled with wealth when it comes to resources.\\n\\nIf China is so rich they can tell the rest of the world to fuck off there is no way to influence the government to get them to change into acting more western like Japan and South Korea .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Google is Western propaganda though . I am sure we can find some zero hedge blog post exclaiming how the West is about to collapse in a few weeks so all these numbers will be pointless anyway .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Russia would absolutely use nukes if they thought their existence was about to be wrote away . Plus you would then create a China so powerful it would be stronger than the rest of the world combined .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,What a shit website . I thought they only cared about USA . I am glad they can spread their freak wing politics worldwide .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Good God , no . You want Russia to have real reason to feel threatened ?",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"As soon as he stops invading countries under the pretense of protecting ethnic groups the comparisons will stop . Simple enough , no ? Also there is a difference between comments on the internet and the official statements of a government . Or is Putin and a reddit user held to same standards ?",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Not butmad at all .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,There are small businesses everywhere .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Yeah because that is unique to Greece and USA . Check a mirror .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I guess Kosovo exports the color gray .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Not everything is tanks . There are also salaries . Cutting pay and workers can cause a contraction of the economy and lower tax revenue .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,What are you trying to say with this comment ? That USA should already have giant death robots ?,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Too little and too late .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Is this news that has people from UK and Netherlands angry actually news ? None of this is a surprise . You have a bunch of people acting like they are punished when all of this was agreed to a long time ago . This is all just an adjustment from measuring figures .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Who the hell would make fun of Poland ? They are tough as hell and the rest of Europe disgraced them .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Should have treated us better then . Abuse begets abuse .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"And when pictures are provided , they are fake . It is always the same story with Russian apologists . Russia has been shooting artillery into Ukraine with visual proof and you have Putin bootlickers constantly coming up with excuses for why Putin is causing war in Ukraine . The journalists saw it with their own eyes . Are you calling them liars ? Of course you are . Everyone lies except for Putin . I would be scared myself considering how often Russians kill journalists.\\n\\nProve Estonia celebrate SS heroes .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Ignorance of the law is never a defense .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Cough Estonia Cough.\\n\\nThe guardian article said they saw military crosses the border themselves .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Believe me , there is still a ton of tax evasion in the USA . Especially when it comes to business income . So much goes uncollected .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Yeah , I was agreeing . No arguments here .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"I never said I wanted war with China in the first place . China gets along with USA much better than Russia and USA.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to comment on how I feel about Chinese tourists , because I have no idea how to phrase my disgust without coming across as incredibly racist . Chinese immigrants though are all pretty cool people that I\\ 've come across . That is a biased group though since they are choosing to emigrate to a Western country.\\n\\nAlso , the people are \ '' content\ '' with Chinese government only because life is improving . The government has to keep providing that or shit will hit the fan . That is one tall order for them . Good luck trying to take away freedoms from places like Hong Kong after they already have a taste of Western life .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Oh , I thought they froze assets as well . My mistake . Aren\\'t selective tariffs imposed on countries due to trade wars considered \ '' sanctions\ '' ?",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Oh . You just are hardly the first to mention the flag . To get news from Europe and opinions in general as an actual answer since you asked . I thought you were just trying to be a dick . Sorry about that .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Easy shot . I\\ 'm not even remotely \ '' butmad\ '' .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Amazing what happens when foreign armies enter a country on multiple fronts and sit on your border .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Do Western countries have brainwashed drones ? Absolutely . But that isn\\'t from a concerted effort of government programming . Governments aren\\'t able to pull it off because they lack control . But yeah there is always a large group of people that have confirmation bias and just want to listen to people that say things they want to hear . Just look at Fox News on a regular basis.\\n\\nThe \ '' West\ '' however is objectively better than Russia in every possible metric . There is nothing better about Russia than EU or USA ESPECIALLY the media . The \ '' West\ '' also isn\\'t some monolithic bloc of countries . These are a huge varied group of countries that literally span the entire globe and have a huge range of cultures and languages and traditions . Some people would not want to live in the USA and that is perfectly fine and there is lots of things you can criticize about the USA and I might agree with those statements right along with you , but there is plenty of other places that are also considered the West . That is also why I think the What About Amerikkka defense is patently absurd.\\n\\nActually scratch that , for your own benefit , please don\\'t watch Fox News .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,What is wrong with defense spending ? There are lots of benefits . Outrageous is suggesting the norm should be the counties that refuse to spend what they promise to spend .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I never said sanctions were \ '' punitive\ '' . I simply said they are hit with sanctions at the end of the case to make up for it . Could be tariffs or seized assets or whatever it takes to make up for past damages if they can\\'t resolve issue peacefully beforehand and the country is found guilty .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I just kind of prefer being too big to be fucked with so that no one is stupid enough to go to war with USA . It is much preferable to a country thinking they have a shot and gambling on winning and leading to millions of dead people .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Easy shot , picking on RT . An easy target .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,This is just sad all around .,Romance,Native

4ringcircus,europe,"Well , if they were smart they would have already realized the superiority of Lisbon long ago.\\n\\nI also sincerely doubt that stat . Guaranteed there are three cities in Spain bigger than Porto .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I honestly thought you were serious until I saw it was you saying it .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I know they sometimes write articles that are perfectly fine . I however am not reading anything from a website that uses Nazis as a quick and easy way to describe non Russian citizens without any irony .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,He was shadow banned on a prior account . Pure conspiratard in action .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Russia armed those rebels ams there was ethnic cleansing . They are never a majority in the buffer zone until they forced people out through war.\\n\\nJust ignore the common denominator of Russia keeping puppets all over the border for very obvious reasons .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,I think it helps all the countries as a whole . I am not interested in tearing into UK regardless of tax havens or whatever . I am simply stating that the biggest failure is of politicians to act like any of this is a surprise . None of it is .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,To piss you off . Why are you on my American internet ? Take your xenophobic bullshit elsewhere .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,NAFTA is already a huge boon to Mexico as it is by having Mexico receive a surplus of money direct from USA . That is a horrible comparison . Shared currency requires a fiscal union in order to work properly .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Still not West enough .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Those are just Portuguese with an accent liberating algarve from eurofags .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Eurozone is a weak fiscal union . Compare it to a legit union like Germany or USA .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,USA was all over the world causing trouble during the Cold War .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Hi , shadow !",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,We are using trash blogs now for sources ?,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Seriously ? Of all places ?,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,"Ha , ok , fair enough .",Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Let Russia fuck with actual American interests and see how divided it is when it goes into revenge mode .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Your comments are a cancer risk .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,There are plenty of issues and they are all naturally related in some way . Europe clearly has to end up deciding if EU is a failed experiment or a work in progress . I hope for the latter .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Which is stupid from the get go . They treat the EU like a hostage negotiation . They could easily team up with France because they share common goals .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,So is pretending like both sides are balanced and equally right and wrong regardless of how extreme one position is.\\n\\nPosition one : I believe you are kind of invading my country.\\nPosition two : Everyone is Nazis.\\n\\nPretty much balanced .,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,Yes because the main goal of Russia foreign policy is sovereignty for smaller nations . Enjoy the third world conditions with your pals in Best Korea,Romance,Native
4ringcircus,europe,My opinions have been formed by journalists that have nothing to do with Ukraine government . Maybe one century Russia will have journalists in their country as well .,Romance,Native
