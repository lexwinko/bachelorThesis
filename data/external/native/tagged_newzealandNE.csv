123xyz123xyz,DecidingToBeBetter,"Hey dude , sorry to hear about your family situation . Even though it may seem like a cultural issue , I think the ways that parents treat their children are personal decisions , and not something that should get the `` culture '' excuse . I 'm sure there are some really nice Chinese parents , and they chose to act that way . If your parents really wanted to change and treat you with more empathy , do you think they could ? If the answer is yes , then why have n't they changed yet ? And if you do n't think they can change , then do you really want to put up with that behavior for the rest of your life ? You might find this sub enlightening : /r/raisedbynarcissists/ I 'm not saying your mother is a narcissist , but if she wo n't treat you better when you are clearly hurting , then it might be worth learning about other people 's experiences of similar situations . You deserve to be treated well . I hope this helps : )",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,science,So you 're suggesting his comment was along the lines of `` I wish other people would pay more for this thing !

123xyz123xyz,science,"So 29 billion is ridiculous , and we should force other people to pay more for this research ? How much more money should be spent ? Who should decide how the money is spent ? How will they ensure the money is effectively spent ? Would you personally force other people to pay for this ? Because I am assuming you are talking about using the force of government to take money from some people and give it to researchers . If you would n't personally force people to pay for this , why does it become okay for others to do it on your behalf ? Perhaps things like funding this research ( which some of us consider important , and some of us do not consider important ) should be achieved in a non-coercive way . I 'm sure many people would chip in money to support this , and we would n't have to worry about the resentment and politics of people who do n't want to pay . Personally I would donate to this . But from what I can see , the vast majority of replies to my comment are suggesting funding this through taxation . And taxation removes choice from the equation . And I really resent being forced to pay for things . I 'm sure you do too . Do you like having to fund the trillion-dollar military-industrial complex ? Let 's work towards achieving important things without forcing each other to foot the bill . Perhaps then we would n't have to worry so much about who 's vying for the Whitehouse every four years .",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"I 'd be happier with a system where we personally get to decide where our tax dollars go . I think it would definitely be a step in the right direction .

123xyz123xyz,science,"How do you know ? I mean , I 'd love for fusion to be viable , and it certainly looks like it could be , but how much of other people 's money are you willing to risk on this ?

And maybe the very act of having to convince rather than coerce will lead to better outcomes ?",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,science,"Is fusion research a guaranteed win ? Is it a problem that can be solved by pouring more money and resources into it ? How much money will it take ? Are you willing to find that amount by forcing others to keep paying for it until we achieve success ? What about people who are too old to reap the benefits ? Should they be forced to pay ? What about people who do n't want to pay ? Will you force them ? What about those of us who do not wish to be forced to pay ? Will you make them submit , with violence if necessary ? What about the man who will not submit , even when violence is brought to bear ? Will you advocate for his death ? Because that is how violent situations ultimately end , is n't it ? Is n't it really `` submit or die '' ?

It is not just the abusers who have mistreated you . Many others are complicit and turned a blind eye . I 'm really really sorry about that . Realizing this as you mature into an adult can give you new insight , and it becomes enraging as you realize how little others cared . Which leads to ... Two : as you mature into an adult , you are now able to fight back . Your body and your mind now knows your capacity to fight and to win . These motherfuckers can not get away with it anymore . When we are young and abused it is much safer to suppress our anger . It is too dangerous to act upon our rage and to fight back , so we squash our anger to protect ourselves . But now that you are literally able to smash these cunts to a pulp , your mind is letting go of some of the suppression of anger . You are feeling this anger now , and a deep part of you wants to act on your anger to protect yourself and those you care about . You want justice , and you can now fight for it . You 've already been to years of counseling , well done . I would definitely recommend continuing that and talking to a therapist . In university they offer it for free , usually .

123xyz123xyz,worldnews,"There are 115 reliable sources cited in the paper . You would know that if you even skimmed it . Try to keep an open mind when it comes to important issues . & gt ; The realities of national health insurance documented in this paper—waiting lines , rationing , lack of cutting-edge medical tech- nology , restricted access to the latest pre- scription drugs , inequitable distribution of care—are not accidental . Such problems flow inexorably from the fact that politicians and bureaucrats—not patients and doctors—are given the authority to allocate limited health care resources . Yet proponents of socialized medicine insist that a single-payer health care system is the only way to solve the structural problems of the U.S. health care system . They conve- niently ignore or explain away the flaws of sin- gle-payer systems , arguing that we could design a better system and spend more money than Britain and Canada , thus getting better results . But the failures of socialized medicine are evident in every country that implements it , and there is no reason to believe that a sin- gle-payer system in the United States would be any different . Advocates of national health insurance would do well to look at how coun- tries like Germany , Sweden , and Australia are choosing free-market reforms to alleviate the problems of their national health systems . Through painful experience , many of the countries that once heralded the benefits of government control have learned that the best remedy for their countries ’ health care crises is not increasing government power , but increas- ing patient power instead .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Stefan Molyneux also wrote a book about this titled Practical Anarchy . [ The book is free here . ] ( http : //m.freedomainradio.com/ ) & gt ; Imagine a world without government – this thought exercise seems impossible for many , because the power and reach of state monopolies is so omnipresent in our lives . However , there is no rational , economic or moral reason to assume that governments are necessary for the provision of roads , healthcare , charity , dispute resolution , courts , policing , national defense , jails – or any of the other services currently monopolized by the state . & gt ; Governments are extremely dangerous , responsible for over 250 million deaths in the 20th century alone – if it is possible to run a society without a government , surely this is something that we must strive towards as a species . & gt ; Practical Anarchy makes strong case for the private – that is to say voluntary – provision for public services . It reveals the idea of government as a dangerous and unnecessary anachronism , and points the way towards a peaceful and voluntary future for mankind .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,HomeworkHelp,"Decrease all taxes so the consumers have more money to spend . But your professor probably does n't want to hear that . Your professor probably wants to hear this : - increase taxes on wheat submarket for biofuel , which will disincentivize usage of wheat for biofuel , thus increasing supply of wheat for wheat submarkets that deal in wheat food products and cattle feed . This increased supply will decrease prices for consumers . - allocate revenue from biofuel taxes to spend on wheat farmer subsidies , which encourages the growth of supply of wheat , which decreases price of wheat . But this is short-sighted thinking ( even though it is probably what your prof wants to hear ) . Here are some negative effects : - local biofuel businesses now have less money , and may have to lay off employees and forgo spending on capital investment . - businesses reliant on biofuel will have to absorb price increases ( possibly laying off workers or forgoing capital investment as well ) or use a biofuel alternative to remain competitive , further hurting the biofuel market . - wheat farmers are now receiving subsidies to increase production of wheat , which messes up market signals . ( Do consumers actually want more wheat ? No . Or else they 'd have started buying more wheat . ) This injection of money encourages malinvestment across the wheat farming sector ( farmers buying tractors they did n't need in free market conditions , farmers purchasing more land to plant more wheat , things like that ) . - Because consumers did n't actually want more wheat , this oversupply of wheat will displace other products ( quite literally if it 's going in silos that would have housed other grain ) . It may be used in the production of new products in other markets , displacing existing products e.g . wheat-derived sugar becomes cheap enough to compete with cane sugar , putting the squeeze on the sugar cane industry . - Fortunately wheat can be stored indefinitely . But meat can not . The lower cost of wheat-based cattle-feed will encourage the overproduction of meat . Some of this meat will spoil . Taking from some people so that you can give to others always has negative consequences . There are alternate methods for solving this problem that do not wreak havoc on the markets , and on people 's lives . Off the top of my head , the government could reduce taxes on futures trading to encourage speculation on the future price of wheat . This will smooth out price fluctuations , preventing nasty surprises to poor people who subsist on bread .",Romance,Native

One last thing : the disdain for `` cucks '' is a powerful sea-change in the political landscape . Conservatives are sick of having to support ineffectual politicians .

One is Alicia Ortega and the other is Nuria Piera , Nuria is Dominican Republic 's Alex Jones.. She 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate José Francisco Peña Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly Peña Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press Peña Gomez vudú ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... .

It 's theorized by Francis , Walker , et al . that the evolutionary purpose of this was for tribal cohesion when engaging in combat and wartime customs , e.g . intimidating war-dances such as the haka performed by Polynesian peoples . So what you described as seeing `` the intelligence and willpower drain from their eyes '' is a real neuro-physiological phenomenon . Creepy stuff !

123xyz123xyz,Anarcho_Capitalism,"A right is something we would consider enforceable with violence , E.g . I have the right to my property , and if you steal it , I can enforce my right to my property with violence ( taking it back or forcing you to give it back ) . This example is a negative right , or the right to be free from coercion . The problem with rights is the conception of positive rights , aka obligations to someone else 's property or labor . A right to someone else 's property or labor should only exist when both parties have agreed to it . The one exception being raising kids , since kids ca n't agree to being raised , so the creation of a child must put a positive obligation on the parent . Any other positive obligation must necessitate a violation of someone 's negative rights , E.g . your right to healthcare violates my property rights , since taxation is theft and I have n't agreed to it . So positive rights violate negative rights , which logically negates them . We are left with negative rights as being the only legitimate kind of rights . But honestly , if someone is drowning I doubt no one would help . That would be a total dick move . If it was my kid that drowned and someone could have helped , I would be so enraged . I do n't see how this creates a positive obligation on the part of a bystander , but it should be a rule in any civilized society . If you do n't help people when you easily could have , then we wo n't have anything to do with you . This does n't give anyone the right to attack or steal from the cowardly bystander , but we do n't have to interact with him or help him . We never had that obligation to begin with . This is how a real `` social contract '' should work . Not with forced obligations , but with the understanding that you can be ostracized at any time , so do n't be a dick .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"I think this is mostly it . But the majority of families still have a subtext of emotional manipulation and physical threats lurking in their relationships , with these patterns having formed deep in early childhood . The majority of parents still spank their children . Children grow up funneled into the public school system , and see bullying with mostly empty rhetoric opposing it . Politicians and the media lie repetitively . So most people are programmed by milder forms of manipulation than an outright narcissist would inflict , but still , they are programmed . To highlight this , imagine the response you ( or any child ) would get if you protested going to school . Not many parents would take you seriously , and even good parents would listen to your complaints , but then convince you that you must go , eventually turning you against your own feelings . It is an extremely rare parent that truly cares what their child thinks and feels . So when these programmed people -- and lets not kid ourselves , most people are programmed unless they have gone through a journey of rigorous self-knowledge -- when these people encounter a master manipulator at the height of their skills , their response is an unconscious allegiance to power rather than to virtue or principle or love . A peacefully raised person on the other hand , will immediately see through the strange display that a narcissist puts on . This is because the peacefully raised individual is in tune with their natural thoughts and emotions . Also , consider the world of politics today . All of these politicians are master manipulators , and yet the majority of people will go out and support one or the other candidate . It takes a fair amount of self-knowledge to act in a non-conditioned way .

( It 's not the same if they were drafted , which is war slavery , and I 'm very sorry to anyone who had to go through that ) . If Americans wanted to defend America , why not join the coast guard ? Or why not stock up weapons and train with their local militia ? Or even if they wanted to fight in foreign wars , why not fight as volunteers alongside those foreign militaries ? [ ( Which has been a viable option for a long time . ) ] ( http : //foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/02/is-it-legal-for-americans-to-fight-in-another-countrys-army/ ) The American government 's foreign adventures of the past century have violated the constitution , **which every american soldier swore an oath to uphold** , and have resulted in all kinds of terrible geopolitical blow-back . [ `` Just following orders '' is not an excuse . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders # Nuremberg_Trials_after_World_War_II ) If individual Americans and the American government stayed true to their noble values as enshrined in the founding documents , some of the following catastrophes would never have occurred : * [ Communism would never have gained a foothold . ] ( http : //www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-11/guest-post-if-only-us-had-stayed-out-world-war-i ) Germany and France would have been stuck in a stalemate in WWI if the American government did n't intervene to pick the winning side . The German government sent in black ops revolutionaries ( led by Lenin ) to stir up chaos in Russia so they at least might have some hope fighting the western allies without having to worry about the Russians . This resulted in the creation of the USSR , when previously there had NEVER been a communist state . * [ Nazism and the holocaust would never have happened . ] ( http : //www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-11/guest-post-if-only-us-had-stayed-out-world-war-i ) The rise of the National-Socialist German Workers Party was a direct response to the TERRIBLE conditions forced upon the Germans when they lost WWI . There may have been a totally different kind of Europe if the people had been allowed to feel the ridiculously meaningless loss of life of WWI without any clear victory , without any resentment over being `` cheated out of victory '' on the German side , and without any false sense of righteous victory on the part of the French and other allies . A stalemate may have been the very best thing to allow the European people to throw off the yoke of monarchy and empire , and turn west toward the ideals of the American republic . * [ Arbitrarily dividing up the middle east , causing strife for a century . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioning_of_the_Ottoman_Empire ) The Ottoman Empire was on the verge of collapse , [ but this would have happened much differently ] ( http : //www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx ? pageID=238 & amp ; nID=79948 & amp ; NewsCatID=359 ) [ without foreign intervention ; ] ( http : //elitedaily.com/news/politics/collapse-ottoman-empire-explains-middle-east-today-wwi-100-years-later/689667/ ) specifically interventions from the British and French , [ who had decided to draw lines on maps where none had existed previously . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_of_the_Sykes % E2 % 80 % 93Picot_Agreement ) The British and French would never have had the ability to exert power like this if WWI had fizzled out without American intervention . & gt ; The West has continued to approach the Middle East in a very shortsighted manner , choosing allies based on what is profitable , rather than what is right . * [ The creation of North Korea . ] ( https : //news.google.com/newspapers ? nid=1144 & amp ; dat=19510509 & amp ; id=-UIbAAAAIBAJ & amp ; sjid=c00EAAAAIBAJ & amp ; pg=1605,3789762 & amp ; hl=en ) The war in Korea was a `` police action '' to stop the spread of communism , but Korea would have gone through the liberalization that communist China has experienced and continues to experience . Fortunately South Korea is now a bastion of freedom and economic growth , but North Korea is the total opposite ; it is essentially one large prison camp . [ Instead of picking winners and losers , how about letting nations determine their own destiny ? ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination # The_UN_Charter ) * Iran would have been a liberal nation today [ if it were n't for the CIA installing their guy as leader , which prompted the 1979 revolution ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d % 27 % C3 % A9tat ) and helped legitimize fundamentalism in the region . Iranian women went from wearing miniskirts to burkas in under a generation . * Iraq ( the jewel of the middle east , with hospitals and universities that were world-class ) [ has had over 600 thousand people killed as a direct result of the 2003 war ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_surveys_of_Iraq_War_casualties ) - [ which was started on completely fabricated pretenses ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_uranium_forgeries ) - and has been utterly ruined , [ even down to the genetic level thanks to depleted uranium shells . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depleted_uranium # Iraqi_population ) This , along with the destabilization of Syria , has given us ISIS , and further radicalized regular Muslims against the west . Sadly most people have drunk the Kool aid regarding national security . You want ISIS ? You want Nazis ? You want Ruskies with nukeskies ? No more world policing ! [ All of these revolutions have spread as a reaction to foreign meddling . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_ ( intelligence ) ) AND I 'M SEEN AS A FAR-LEFT KOOK FOR SAYING THESE THINGS ! The anti-war left EVAPORATED as soon as they got their guy Obama into the Whitehouse . As far as I see it , [ being anti-war is as freedom-loving and as patriotic as Thomas Jefferson . ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_non-interventionism # No_entangling_alliances_.2819th_century.29 ) & gt ; President Thomas Jefferson extended Washington 's ideas about foreign policy in his March 4 , 1801 inaugural address .

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude . Tl ; dr there have always been political movements advocating `` freedom to '' and `` freedom from '' , or equality vs liberty .",Romance,Native

123xyz123xyz,newzealand,"Landlords have economies of scale , which owner-occupiers do not . Why would owner-occupiers be more economically efficient ? Rental property tends to have denser populations than owner-occupier property , which makes it more economically efficient . You 'd require quite high rental-property taxes to get renters to decide to switch to buying a home . But there will always be people who can not afford to be owner-operators , so they are stuck with increased rents . And would n't there be now be an incentive for lower value property to be used for rentals , since lower value means lower property taxes ? So now the poor people stuck renting have to live in industrial slums . I do n't see this tax being a win for anyone , except those who own low value property -- and that 's only compared to everyone else who has to bear the costs by either changing their living situation , or by paying more rent . Edit : also , as I said in another comment , mortgage rates will increase as the demand for home loans increases with more people flooding the home-owner market . This does n't help anyone . And the Reserve bank would probably respond to those higher rates by lowering the OCR to bring bank interest rates back down , which will artificially stimulate the rest of the economy by encouraging businesses to invest more , when in reality the economic environment does not ( can not ) support more investment . This will lead to riskier investment projects getting green lit , and contribute further to economic instability .

They do n't care about how you think and feel , it 's always about them . I 'm sorry that you had to find out about this while still being stuck in it . I did n't realize it until I was 21 . As for advice ... are you in immediate harm ? Your dad threatened to beat you , but do you think he would go through with it ? If you do n't think he would , my advice would be to try to fly under the radar , disconnect from your parents as much as you can , and do n't let them mess with your head too much . Hanging out with friends as much as you can . Time away from the house . Go to the library . Try to keep decent grades , though I know it 's tough when you 're dealing with this shit . Definitely try to get a job . Having your own money really helps foster your independence . If you are certain that violence will occur , I 'd tell as many trusted adults as you can .

123xyz123xyz,DecidingToBeBetter,"& gt ; Forgiving unrepentant people is perhaps the most critical portion . I 've heard this usage of the word `` forgive '' before , but it is not the common usage . When people think of forgiveness , they imagine getting back together , hugging , and saying `` I forgive you ! '' The word is also used in another context : to forgive a debt . We know what this means . It is an allowance of previously unallowable behavior . & gt ; Consider this : If a person is unrepentant , do you really think they have a single care about whether or not you forgive them ? Do you really think that by refusing to forgive them , it somehow does you any good ? I know they care . Everyone cares about how they are viewed . If bad people were called out and shunned , rather than having their shitty behavior swept under the rug , we would be living in a much better world : a world where even narcissists tried to be good people because they would suffer the consequences otherwise . A world where people do n't turn away and look embarrassed when a child is being mistreated . I am angry when I see these bad things happen . If only more of us were , perhaps we could end the cycle . It seems to me that the people eager to preach forgiveness are the ones that would gain most from it . It validates their decisions to forgive bad people , and it validates bad behavior from bad people . When I think back on how my dad treated me , I feel angry . I was not treated respectfully . I can not will the anger away , that would be a self manipulation and a denial of my true feelings . But I am free from him now . The wounded child within me has regained trust in the world , and most importantly : the wounded child trusts me to keep him safe . And I will . That means no abusers . That means no `` letting it slide '' . That means hearing his pains and concerns , and taking them seriously . That is healing . I think we are talking about the same thing , but you are using the language of enablement when you call this process `` forgiveness '' . I would urge you to find a better word , mainly to aid in clarifying the problem to those of us who are less versed in the subject . Perhaps `` coming to terms with it '' . What are your thoughts ?",Romance,Native
123xyz123xyz,raisedbynarcissists,"Happy to help . If you do have to continue to see your dad , try to engage in `` safe '' activities and conversations . I remember my dad and I used to go to the movies a lot together . It was a great way to kill time without having to deal with him that much . Or sitting on the couch watching TV with him . At least then he thinks he 's getting time with you , and you get to remain somewhat distant . It would be best if you were n't forced to see him , though ... It is hard having to fake it , especially when you 've snapped out of the daze of illusion . The inside of my head used to physically hurt when I was around my parents . It was hard to think clearly . Something you might need to be more aware of is your relationship with your mom . You seem to have already figured her out pretty well , but I can imagine it would be easy to see her as the good parent when compared to your dad . Remember : she chose your dad . Again , I 'm really sorry that this has fallen on your young shoulders . It should n't be this way . Edit : Some advice for you regarding your mom . You feel controlled by her and want some freedom . Practical stuff here : do you own a bike ? Can you bike into the city , or visit friends that way ? That way you will be less reliant on her to get to places . How about friends ? Can they pick you up and take you places ? Is money a concern ? Can you get a job anyplace ? Maybe even mowing lawns ? If she wo n't let you do stuff , perhaps arrange things with other people first , then tell your mom she has to cancel on them over the phone . Her having to show her control over you with a third party watching might make her think twice . That 's all I got for now . Take care bud .",Romance,Native
