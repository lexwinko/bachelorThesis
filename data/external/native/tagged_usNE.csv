006007,guns,"I do n't think the question you should necessarily be wrestling with is whether or not you should have carried that night , the question you should be asking yourself is , given appropriate justification , are you will to end the life of another person in defense of your own ? Simple enough question , but probably not so simple to answer . If you are , then carry as you see fit . If you are n't , do n't . I would n't worry about the consequences of what happens after , either . If you end up having to take another person 's life in self defense , whatever legal troubles come afterward are a far sight better than being dead , I 'd say . You can think about all the what-ifs you like , but you ca n't ever reasonably know that the person on the other end of the barrel is n't going to pull the trigger . Even if he had calmly stated , `` I 'm carrying a concealed weapon and I 'm about to draw it and aim it at you , menacingly , but I do n't intend to shoot you , '' you still could n't be reasonably sure he did n't intend to shoot you anyway . Regardless of your answer to the question I posed , you 'd be better served learning how to deescalate situations like that in the future . Your intuition lead you to believe this man was going to be a threat based on his demeanor , so getting defensive and telling him to get off of the property was n't the best way to handle that situation . Apologizing for upsetting him ( regardless of whether you were at fault ) and asking how you could help in a calm and courteous manner would have been better . If he is n't capable of being reasoned with , then you 'd just end up in the same situation anyway , but at the very least you gave him the opportunity to calm down . Deescalation is your best defense in these situations , whether the aggressor is armed or not . The firearm is always the last resort .",Romance,Native

I find I know how to penetrate most tanks , even IS-2s , but I ca n't get OHKs . If I get the drop on someone I have to choose to 1 ) Take out the driver or 2 ) Take out the gunner . The former is nice because they ca n't run , but then their gunner is fine and it typically results in a OHK on me for my troubles . The latter is the safer option , but the pathetic load times on Tigers and Panthers means they 're in cover before I can send the follow up shot . Also , German turret rings and breeches are made of moldy fucking bread that go black if your crew sneezes . What 's the secret ? What are we missing ?

006007,Warthunder,"For a point of reference , take a look at the last stat on the before/after . Notice how before it 's 100/100 and a stat that Expert/Ace has no bearing on ? ( no green +30 like others ) . Right now , that stat is maxed out . Now on the after , the star converted amount is 5 stars +3 . Ace gives additional +2 . So the max for any stat is now 10/10 ( vs. 100/100 or 50/50 , etc. ) . So what was a max stat , is now only 80 % ( 5+3/10 ) . In order to get the last 20 % ( which was already earned ) a player is going to need to pay for it , or spend an incredible amount of time earning it .

006007,Warthunder,"As frustrating as bombers are to take down , proper interception tactics would ease a lot of it . What I witness in SB matches , and what I admittedly do myself , is not take the necessary time to setup proper intercepts . So you get these lazy attacks where you 're relative speed is hardly any faster , or you 're just coming right up behind them , and just sitting in their gun sights . Getting shot down this way is proper . You fly poorly , you perform poorly . That said , there should be a couple of changes that could be made to SB bombers to make them less gamey . One is to require manual inputs to the bomb sight for altitude and speed , no more automatic computing . You should n't be able to jink in your B-17 to dodge a fighter , then level off and 5 seconds later drop bombs with pinpoint precision . Bombers should need to commit more wholly to the bomb run . I get that the bomber and pilot are two separate people , and conceivably they could do these things simultaneously IRL , but this is a reasonable balancing move . The other , and probably harder to code , change should be that AI does not shoot while within clouds . I understand why bombers choose to fly in clouds , but you should n't get to take advantage of not being seen , while simultaneously reaping the benefits of being able to `` see '' the enemy on account of your AI . Especially when it only take a few well places bullets to set a fighter alight and end their mission .",Romance,Native
006007,Warthunder,"That 's a fair point . I mostly play in Tier IV where a spaded German fighter has the ability to get up and intercept in time . I imagine this is a harder thing to accomplish in Tier III or below . I do n't think there 's going to be any magic bullet with the way the game is setup right now . You can increase HP of targets to force bombers to loiter longer , but then that puts nations like Germany and the Soviet Union at a disadvantage with their lower bomb loads . You could make the maps bigger , to provide more time for intercept , but then it becomes impossible to patrol the whole front line . I honestly wish there was side-wide voice chat in SB . Coordinated attacks on bombers would do wonders ...",Romance,Native

006007,Warthunder,"There 's the old saying , `` Speed is life and altitude is life insurance . '' This applies to the SB game mode most of all . On maps where it 's not low overcast , you 'll want to climb up to at least 3km , preferably 4km . That way you can dive in on people and have enough speed to break away and you also reduce the chances of getting bounced , yourself . Another piece of advice I have is to not over commit to an enemy . You may get so excited chasing someone down who you have the advantage on that you spend too much time trying to finish the job . Gunnery is much more difficult locked inside a cockpit , so until you 're more proficient , just make one pass and then break away . If it 's 3 on 1 or something , though , then go hog wild . Finally , check your six and check it often . Really , until you 're fully engaged , there 's no such thing as checking your six too often .",Romance,Native

006007,Warthunder,"[ AB ] I thoroughly enjoy using the D-13 in Arcade . It climbs like it 's never heard of gravity , has plenty of maneuverability , and the 3 mg151/20s make for a decent firepower package whether you 're up against fighters or bombers . It gets sluggish in turn speed at lower speeds ( as with most late war German birds ) , but the roll rate helps give you options . Acceleration is good and it has enough dive performance to keep up with most of what you come against . [ SB ] Absolutely my favorite plane to use so far , no question . I have n't unlocked the D-9 or D-12 , which I 'm betting will be similar , but as compared to everything leading up to it in the German tree , just fantastic . That giant Jumo 213 engine really lets you dictate the terms your fights . Its firepower in SB is more than adequate . My favorite quality , shared among all the FW series , is the visibility . I have n't flown other nations ' aircraft of similar tier to compare , but it 's a stark contrast to the very limited FOV one gets in a 109 cockpit . The only thing I do n't trust it for in SB is energy fighting on the deck . It can hold its own against most enemies for a few turns , but it quickly sheds its energy and you have to be very conscious of your maneuvers to not get taken down . I also echo Maxrdt 's concerns over its quickness to overheat . You tend to get enough time to WEP climb to target and engage for a few passes before the Orange temps arrive . I find myself having to disengage in extended fights to cool the engine as you really need to be running throttle at 100 % when you 're in the fight . You definitely have to be careful when in extended fights to keep your engine temps low enough so you 've time to cut and run if you find yourself at a disadvantage . Overall I 'm very pleased with the Fw-190 D-13 and feel my money was well spent .",Romance,Native

A first person perspective is honestly what 's needed , even if it 's just a little hash mark in the center of the screen . Bombers need an air start .

The maps are just too small and even the super props ca n't get to altitude in time to stop the B-29 horde that is anything vs. America .

B-17s and B-24s are n't so bad , but 2 B-29s with the default bomb load can completely bomb out the bases and airfield in one run . On the flip side , when you 're flying American , you 're usually at a 2-1 or worse Fighter v.
