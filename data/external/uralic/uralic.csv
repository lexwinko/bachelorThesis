The content of that law is simply bad and of no use , but at least it\\ 's SOMETHING and makes a point . The awful thing is that when the parliament was discussing the law , I found out that a lot of my friends are flaming idiots , who think that allowing two gay men to legalise their partnership will make it possible for them to adopt random children at their will ( really , I don\\'t get the concept ) . They have a bunch of other hilarious opinions . And of course - gay women is a whole different story ... There is a movement here called Perekonna ja Traditsiooni Kaitseks ( bad translation : To Protect Family and Tradition ) . The opponents to that wierd organisation always emphasize that our traditional families don\\'t need protection , but that doesn\\'t seem to come accross.\\n\\nI know that people should know better and not be idiots , but still I want to clarify the reasons why being gay is well ... frowned upon . The Soviet Union banned gays . They were jailed and sometimes killed . My granny was quite a party animal in her time and knew lots of famous people in Estonia . She also knew that many of them were gay . She was ok with it , but most people weren\\'t as it was a crime and the one\\ 's that were suspected being gay , were actors , artists and singers that had it better than the common factory workers.\\n\\nAfter the soviet regime fell \ '' gay\ '' was not a hot topic . We had some more pressing matters . It wasn\\'t illegal to be gay , but 50 years of the regime had done it\\ 's job brainwashing several generations . Today it\\ 's safe to say that the one\\ 's against gay marriage are mostly older people remembering the Soviet times and poorly educated young people that have not been taught to think for themselves . I don\\'t want to excuse the homophobia here . I just wanted to state the reasons that most people have.\\n\\nEdit : I forgot to point out that the surveys showed what we all suspected - our local Russian community is by far more against gay marriage than Estonians .

No country will trust the treaty and that\\ 'll be the end of it.\\n\\nOkay , so we just create a new one . League of Nations - & gt ; United Nations .

Everybody knows what\\ 's going on in Ukraine , did you ever hear a NATO member saying something like : \ '' Huh , maybe Russians tell the truth , nothing it\\ 's going on there ? \ '' \\n\\nCountries are members of NATO . Countries don\\'t always take official positions on everything . Sometimes it\\ 's convenient for them not to say anything at all - just like when they divided Europe after World War 2 and left a whole bunch of nation states under Russian control . End result is that those countries had half a century of falling behind.\\n\\nIn the media it will definitely *not* be a clear-cut case .

But for big countries like Germany etc - sure , I agree with you . Also speaking of history : \\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama\\n\\nUS defeates the professional army of Panama ( which they actually helped to train etc ) in a month , losing 23 men.\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait\\n\\nIraq steamrolls the professional military of Kuwait and occupies the country in 2 days.\\n\\n & gt ; I agree but still if we invest in Defense our army won\\'t become that much more than it already is\\n\\nBy that I mostly meant that the main players ( Germany & amp ; France mainly ) of Europe should do that . And it\\ 's fine if you have a small military , because during wartime it will function as part of coalition forces.\\n",Uralic,Estonian

As for smaller countries - nobody expects you to have an army of hundreds of thousands . So what you can do is minmax for maximum efficiency and continue co-operating through NATO . Strategic-level stuff isn\\'t something you should worry about anyway ( unless Germans decide to invade you again ) because that\\ 's the task of by relevant NATO planning groups.\\n\\n Although strategic stuff is often hindered by the attitude of Western Europe : \\n & gt ; Attempts by General John Craddock to push through defence planning for the Baltic were stymied by German-led opposition in western Europe , anxious to avoid upsetting the Kremlin.\\n\\nAlso that cancerous attitude the is main reason why there really hasn\\'t been large-scale exercises of moving equipment , troops etc . ( Russia does that regularly , btw ) despite logistics being a critical part of warfare.\\n\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Which is exactly why a European Army would be a good idea in my POV.\\n\\nConscription army can still be pretty good , look at Israel or Finland . Their militaries are very good & amp ; competent for small countries . As for Baltics - conscription is probably the only choice due to our location . Also if there\\ 's support from NATO - no EU army is needed .

This is intellectually dishonest thinking.\\n\\nYes , we can all yammer on about the marketplace of ideas and demonstrate how the US doesn\\'t ban Nazi rhetoric and consequently has no giant Nazi problem , because the ideas themselves are unappealing to most Americans.\\n\\nBut this doesn\\'t mean that all ideas are the same , or all populations are the same . Fundamentalist Islam is not interested in winning the hearts and minds of the native populations of Western countries . It is aimed at cultural minorities within those countries , to prevent them from assimilating . It is virulent tribalism that by design rejects debate and pluralism . When you criticize its ideas , you end up with a knife in your chest or zealots with automatic weapons screaming Allahu Akbar as they gun you down.\\n\\nIt\\ 's even immunized against internal reform - to criticize a fellow Muslim\\ 's interpretation of their religion is explicitly prohibited.\\n\\nWhen middle class British teenagers are convinced by the rhetoric of ISIS to abandon their homes and go to a despotic state in an abhorrent war zone in order to become the submissive brides of holy warriors , then it should be clear to everyone that we can\\'t treat this ideology as just another idea to be debated . This idea needs to be rooted out , with the threat of violence ( law enforcement ) if necessary.\\n\\n\ '' Radical\ '' Islam is basically Islamism - the doctrine that secular order should be replaced with a theocracy .

That does not mean there\\ 's a slippery slope to banning every other unpleasant ideology - just this particular one , and any others that may prove to be as dangerous to free society and human civilization . The threshold for banning forms of speech is and should remain incredibly high . But to demand that there should be no threshold , even in the face of homegrown suicidal mass murderers produced by an ideology completely in opposition to every value that our civilization is built upon - that is utter lunacy . It is refusing to puncture your body to excise a malignant tumor.\\n\\nIf your country was in a conventional war with a neighbor , would you think it appropriate to preserve absolute free speech by allowing the enemy to set up recruitment camps inside your country ?

Clifford_Banes,europe,"But the whole point is that immigration itself is not the problem , but immigration from places with a culture that\\ 's incompatible with the host country.\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention that many Dutch people of Moroccan decent have integrated just fine\\n\\nMost immigrants integrate \ '' just fine\ '' because they kind of have to . They need jobs and they need human interaction . So if there\\ 's a handful of people from Country X , then they\\ 'll have to get a job alongside the native population , and their friends will have to come from the native population.\\n\\nThe bigger the difference in culture , the bigger the culture shock for the immigrant , but the onus to deal with that has always been on the immigrant . They have to adapt to the culture of the host country.\\n\\nAs soon as the immigrant population from their country of origin hits critical mass and becomes an enclave , they no longer have to deal with the culture shock at all . They don\\'t need to assimilate or integrate or adapt , because they get all their social needs filled by their compatriots . Add to that an overly generous welfare state and they don\\'t even need to integrate into the workforce and interact with locals there.\\n\\nThis is only problematic for some countries of origin . Chinese immigrants have tended to form enclaves and resist integration . But I highly doubt Wilders would give two shits about a Chinatown popping up in Amsterdam . Because Chinese culture is largely compatible with Dutch culture . There are no Chinese morality police vigilantes roaming the streets of any Western country . They stopped practicing misogynistic ritual mutilation ( foot binding ) a century ago.\\n\\nPlease stop using the word \ '' racism\ '' to refer to opposition to particular cultures . \ '' Racism\ '' means the belief that certain groups of people are biologically inferior to others . People who believe that exist , and they are dangerous . Their form of racism should be opposed , but if you define that word to mean \ '' anyone who is not an enthusiastic believer in universal multiculturalism\ '' , it becomes toothless.\\n\\nI do not want mass immigration of Muslims in my country because I think Islam is a horrendous ideology completely at odds with the values of liberalism that our societies are based on . I specifically say \ '' Muslims\ '' , because the fact is that their religion is such a totalitarian force in their lives that this is their self-professed primary identity . Before ethnicity , before nationality , they are Muslim . It is an inextricably political religion that has a proscribed scriptural duty to enforce theocracy . There is no \ '' render unto Caesar\ '' in Islam . And because of this , if they don\\'t culturally integrate , they will never politically integrate.\\n\\nI actually do want immigration as a whole . More people from a diverse selection of cultures will enrich my own . I want my country to be less uniformly white ( which is a result of not ever being a colonial power , not xenophobia ) . But I don\\'t want a single person in my country who could realistically be convinced to join ISIS . Anyone whose worldview offers a path to see that perfect distillation of evil as anything but repugnant is a danger.\\n\\nAs to Wilders , it takes a special kind of willful misreading to construe his comment as a call to ethnic cleansing . I never understood lumping him in with Jobbik and Le Pen , and it really strikes me as a political hatchet job to paint him as some sort of \ '' far right\ '' lunatic . He doesn\\'t fit .

A youth riot broke out that spread to Tallinn center region . Again because censorship denied something and the Soviet regime was partly blamed but it again showed that people were kind of being allowed to riot and Moscow didn\u00b4t really heavily crack down on such events.\\n\\nPoliticians used these events as kind of \ '' independence polls\ '' and seeing how many are singing along , well even coming to such events was a good sign . Obviously the main deal was done by our politicians of that time that took the move , declared independence , seeked contacts from foreign people and played a \ '' nothing at all going on in Estonia\ '' game with Moscow .

So a lot of infrastructure around the country tbh.\\n\\n2 ) Economic difference , we still have a lot of catching up to do , Portugal and Greece are closeby but 70 years is 70 years , its hard to make it up in ~25 years , where the first 5 years you are even worse off than you were before as a fresh re-independent country.\\n\\n3 ) Mentality , some statistics still show us as what we were , ex-commie block , we perform usually as top 3 best in whatever category but we still are in that group . Last thing I viewed was something about female to male ratio in jobs , were we were top 2 when compared to old block countries.\\n\\n4 ) Nation itself , like it or not we have 1/3rd to 1/6th ( depends on your definition ) of Russian first generation or second generation badly bubbled people here and it will take time to assimilate into a one united nation with common ideas . Some people have hammer and cycle flags with Putin shirts ( unironic ) who speak no words of Estonian while the other guy might be some former Werchmaht fighter drafted into the army and still alive and kicking at 85 , such people I doubt will see eye to eye - ever . I once drew a comparison of it being like a mild Palestine/Iran over here when the \ '' right\ '' people meet.\\n\\nStill having said that semi-bad stuff we do have made immense progress in 25 years . A lot of right choice by our early politicians in terms of long term policies . Also closeness to rich countries like the Nordic block is a very nice payoff . More so the 0,5-1,5h distance between Helsinki and Tallinn has allowed for fast idea exchange and a slight boost in catching up.\\n\\nWe have stagnated in recent years ( as has Europe and somewhat Sweden/Finland ) but as such a small economy we can\u00b4t expect to do well when other partners aren\u00b4t . Still our \ '' bad\ '' currently is a small growth so it isn\u00b4t technically that bad at all.\\n\\nWhen we look at Sweden or Finland we cry out of our predicament , when we look at other Soviet block countries we cry out of joy seeing we should not complain that much .

This is for average salaries though that are around 900 eur.\\n\\nWe have entered some kind of second stage as a country/population as we are slowly creeping up on \ '' west Europes\ '' slower runners as are Portugal , Greece and a few others in terms of living standards/economy so we have all these \ '' new\ '' problems as \ '' is the wage increasing too rapidly ? \ '' and \ '' are we going to see somekind of bubble burst in terms of some pricing not catching up\ '' , \ '' is our country still good for investors if we keep growing in terms of taxes ? \ '' . Our minimum for example is being increased by 40 eur each year . It used to be 355 in 2014 , last year it was 390 , now its 430 . Next year 470 so this benefits the \ '' small guy\ '' the most . So it shows the general \ '' slow progression\ '' we are witnessing.\\n\\nFor being a small nation we actually do need just 1 startup to succeed and stay in Estonia for our entire nation to tigerleap in terms of economy . This is our current \ '' country mission\ '' . Before it was the unoriginal \ '' get into NATO , EU , Euro\ '' deal.\\n\\nI find it interesting that our government itself is kind of trying to be a startup with many interesting ideas as is selling ID cards to foreigners in trade of a easy way to do business through our legislation . Also the whole X-road program of allowing all kinds of ideas to link up with the government . Just picture a country establishing a linux server and actually allowing everyone into it who has an idea , to data with legal binding force .\\n\\nIt is however a fairly common opinion that the country is being built up in the correct way . We have our taxes in order , we have our economic discipline and our only gripe is that our economy is growing slow . This is a big fault of ours we can\\'t fix though as losing a chunk of Russian market and the general European growth affects our markets quite badly . Second fault is our population growing old so at some point we will reach a tipping point of social taxes vs taxpayers , it will be interesting to see how it will be solved.\\n\\nEconomy while \ '' growing\ '' , more importantly is not in any way in the negatives for a while so the growth is constant for the forseeable future , much easier to plan ahead a steady economy if you aren\\'t flip flopping around on the scale . In terms of investment we aren\\'t the cheapest anymore and even Lithuania has a lot of startups there , I think even Google went with Lithuania ? Too lazy to Google right now . People friendliness , lets just say we save up on friendliness so in close quarters with closer people we burst out but in general we are \ '' nordic cold\ '' , we do have more European \ '' keep smile\ '' relations though with each year and younger people are in the \ '' Youtube\ '' generation so they kind of are more open.\\n\\nFood in general is shit . We eat peasant grub to this day , potatoes , macaroni , chicken , pork etc . With a touch of more veganism and common sense of cutting back on sugar , oily foods etc ( at least in my social group ) . We are known to eat unhealthy fatty food though.\\n\\nWe are in demand of skilled labour with mostly in IT markets ( and I have seen plenty of foreigners in IT firms ) , if you average the costs of living you can live pretty well with what they offer . Around 2000-3000eur wages ( someone can correct me on this ) afaik.\\n\\nI would conclude and say we are the jack-of-all nations currently .

Dicios,europe,"I think the most interesting thing that was kind of mentioned already was the mentality.\\n\\nMy parents for example and as I have seen and heard , parents of others who lived in the communist era are somewhat more introverted and \ '' broken\ '' I would say . During the time of the system people had more taboo topics ( even if it was work , money etc related ) , more pessimism , less control of their lives ( houses were given , jobs were more or less streamlined though schools etc ) . So this created mental complexes.\\n\\nIf I compare how I talk with my sister and how my mother talks with my grandmother then there is a very certain \ '' hush hush\ '' kind of situation on certain topics . People don\\'t like to talk.\\n\\nNow it\\ 's a dog eat dog world . Again if I compare to what I have seen imho there aren\\'t any more taboo about life questions , people slam questions right in front of you be it money , living conditons , future plans etc . As the world is more open you are made to grow a thicker skin or get stuck in the cogwheels of capitalism at some level.\\n\\nI do feel there is a split of \ '' communist thinking\ '' when I look at my parents and an open market capitalist world . Maybe it is the society as a whole as the facebook generation kind of makes every person a product , we all have become walking CV\\'s.\\n\\nAs for a realistic result of those 70 years , economy and systems . Governance systems were set in stone and they were hard to restructure . You still hear from one institution or another how the basic idea how something works is still from the Communist era , not that surprising considering Communism collapsed only ~1988-1991 but I would consider it a bad thing seeing how corruption seeped in , in such a large system as USSR was.\\n\\nEconomy suffered because again , such a large system , does not govern everything correctly . As a independent unit Estonia knows their own shortcoming and investment needs . Before it was made to address the needs of Moscow first , discussion of what Estonian USSR went through them , not through ... Estonia . Somewhat similar problem with the EU but currently this is the block with the best structure , transparency and ability to stay less corrupt on average so more money finds it way to where it should be.\\n\\nBut hey , let bygones be bygones , I guess our generations life isn\\'t the worst ( yet ) .

Baltic people were often not trusted to fight near their own homeland though as they might try to escape the army or get conflicted views assaulting their own cities.\\n\\n4 ) Refugees sometimes formed batallions in foreign countries to fight from other Allied sides .

Dicios,europe,"& gt ; A question for you , if I may -- do the Russians have a sense of cultural superiority w.r.t the Estonians ? I agree with you that people who are comfortable in their enclaves do not have a pressing need to integrate ( in fact , the world outside the enclave becomes a \ '' scary\ '' prospect ) but is there an element of \ '' our culture/language is superior to that of the locals\ '' ? Or are you on pretty even footing ? \\n\\nI\\ 'm sure a Russian Estonian can answer it better but we are pretty much on equal footing.\\n\\nThere are a small percentage , with sometimes loud voices who wants to deport every Russian back if they say anything negative about Estonia or them and those who want back the \ '' good old Soviet times\ '' when Russians still had an empire or blame every personal fault on the Estonian government . So both sides have the obvious , unstable ... I guess , people.\\n\\nRussian speakers simply have a strong enough culture to draw from right next to them . The biggest stepping stone for everyone is language , Estonians mostly learn Russian but that quality isn\\'t good at all . Same way Russians do learn Estonian , probably better than Estonians Russian , but even for them its hard enough with pure classroom knowledge to come into Estonian groups.\\n\\nMore importantly I think Estonians don\\'t have a realistic inferiority complex . A country of about a million managing to regain independence through a history of different rulers , also the fairly recent loss of the Russian Soviet empire , is something that lifts most of the peoples spirits . Even if some Russians do feel superior there are enough Estonians who probably boast just as much.\\n\\nI do think most Russian Estonians are trying to find their role in society as they aren\\'t fully Russian and they aren\\'t fully Estonian so each of them has to find their comfortable zone of how much of their home brought up culture they want in their life and how much of \ '' Estonian side\ '' they want to experience . Choices like \ '' Do I put my kid in a Russian or Estonian speaking kindergarten ? \ '' is something that come up for Russian Estonians and not the other way around . Also mixed families where kids often speak fluently Estonian and Russian have something of a conundrum from what speaking school to what working environment.\\n\\nSo I guess yes , the knowledge that there is a 140 million big state and even bigger cultural sphere of Russian speakers is something that holds Estonian Russians back knowing they are having to learn the ways of something that was just some decades ago their small territory , perhaps deep inside somewhat demeaning I guess ( and unique when it comes to immigration problems ) but its not superiority per say . More of a sad predicament they find themselves in and having to adjust quickly within same generations.\\n\\nI do think it is still early and a 30 % minority does not go away in 25-30 years .

Usually , as logical , its some sort of Estonian address and as they don\\'t need to hide it its easier to verify if it is indeed where the packet got sent . If a diverse range of locations where used and all the traffic nodes of various companies can confirm a inflow of traffic through their servers it can be again physically verified that the traffic indeed came from multiple sources and not some uber hacker sending a lot of information about all the votes from one place . These things can be traced , its usually a question of \ '' how long it takes\ '' .\\n\\nWe still have that diverseness as people use different locations and their imprint of connecting and sending that packet gets left in the log .

In Europe , you\\ 're called a \ '' foreigner\ '' even if you\\ 're a 3rd generation immigrant , born and raised in Europe . If you\\ 're German , you understand who the word \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' applies to . My Turkish friends who are very secular , open minded , speak perfect Germans are still referred to as \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' by people like me.\\n\\nBut the US is a very different country . Every American is basically a new age immigrant . Only in US a question like \ '' Where are your roots ? \ '' is common enough to get an answer \ '' Originally part Irish , part Scottish\ '' etc etc.\\n\\nThere is no real \ '' American\ '' besides the Indian tribes.\\n\\nEuropean countries are old enough with indigenous populations that people have a picture of an average Swede or Brit , or German . Obviously a third generation Turk will stand out.\\n\\nYou are somehow trying to \ '' wish away\ '' the differences between origins and citizens.\\n\\nIn US from the get go ( besides Indians who sardonically got wiped away by the immigrants ... ) . US has no real first timers alive , everyone is simply a citizen . In Europe things are a tiny bit complicated and you can\\'t simply do away with thousands of years of history . There is a heavy percentage of citizens who also have their origins in that place for hundreds or even thousands of years by some bloodline . Old habits and traditions are slow to fade away and you are asking the near impossible . Again US had a very different start.\\n",Uralic,Estonian
Dicios,europe,"Integration services are horrible , otherwise integration would be successful . There are no people that can not be integrated even if they don\\'t want to . Integration is a natural process and is not something you can fight if the host country is open to having you.\\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\\nNope , nope no no no and NO.\\n\\nThis is the rose tinted glasses way of integration , this is the Disney movie integration . This is the children PG13 integration . You are basically saying \ '' it simply happens\ '' .\\n\\nEstonia has had a culturally different community for ages . We are a good \ '' testtube\ '' of a country with a large minority . \\n\\nEstonian Russians and Estonians still live in two different worlds . Different tv channels , different languages , you can even tell apart different clothe styles and hairstyles that Russian kids have and Estonian kids have.\\n\\nYes there are free state ( and thereby tax funded ) Russian language schools that also teach Estonian heavily and yes there are all kinds of projects done on media landscape or \ '' cooperative\ '' type of projects . Problem is they don\\'t work . If they feel comfortable ( as most Russians do feel ) they don\\'t see a need to change anything , they have Russian schools , Russian friends , Russian tv channels , all state sites have Russian versions etc etc . \\n\\nThey don\\'t need to integrate at all . The society has already changed enough to accompany them and not the other way around as they forcefully became apart of Estonian society . Obviously not their fault at all , just as Estonians were deported to Siberian regions , they were semi-forcefully deported to Estonia ( some came as families with the army to keep locals under a solid foot ) .\\n\\nIn Siberia also Estonian villages formed and they created their own culture sphere trying to keep it alive.\\n\\nPoint being its idiotic to expect a nation to basically handfeed and cart every single individual to force them to integrate . If they don\\'t really want to integrate they won\\'t , simple as that . Integration is a two way process.\\n\\nWhat is \ '' positive\ '' at least in Estonia is that a very slow process is bringing Russian Estonians away from the Russian federation citizens so at least they are their own culture group besides actual Russians and Estonians . Also a small percentage do get integrated toward Estonian averages but it will still take decades to get anywhere.\\n\\nAlso as a disclaimer I must say I am not xenophobic , Russian Estonians have every right to have their space , just as Americans say \ '' I might not agree with them but I will defend their rights with them\ '' but the willy-nilly integration that you picture is not real , its in la-la land . It is not that black and white and simple.\\n\\nLiving in a country with a forcefully relocated minority of 30 % is not something you want in a country .

Dicios,europe,"Well your question should then be worded as publishers . Simply major investors who pay for the development costs and share revenue.\\n\\nThere are probably many puzzle pieces why there is no European majors besides Ubisoft ( that is actually comparable to even EA ) .\\n\\n1 ) What is a European market ? We have a lot of different languages , cultures , world views . It would be nearly impossible to produce a game that hits off to the \ '' European market\ '' . There is no easy way to entice entire Europe to play \ '' EU Call of Duty\ '' , you can\\'t fistbump the European Union flag and hope people share that ideal.\\n\\nSo a very mixed market makes it hard for their own buyers to buy anything.\\n\\n2 ) In the game of banking or investment the early bird does get the worm . Americans , Japanese have had time to gobble up plenty of practice and smaller developers that produce their main titles . As we gamers all know it only takes like 3-4 major series to lift your company from zero to hero . Assassins Creeds , World of Warcraft , Call of Duty etc . All had quite a humble beginning.\\n\\n_______________________\\n\\nBesides European developers usually don\\'t aim as high and don\\'t always go for $ $ bill . Eg Notch selling Minecraft , arguably a fairly established \ '' world player\ '' .\\n\\nThen for example World of Tanks that proclaim to have 60 million users with 1,1 million players at the same time . They even passed World of Warcraft in terms of ingame item revenue . Yes WoT is based on only that as a f2p game but even the fact that a f2p game managed to one up the already paying WoW huge userbase speaks volumes.\\n\\nObviously we can\\'t miss Ubisoft that managed to luck out and create a uber successful 3-4 game hit studio that again as mentioned before rivals EA in terms of revenue estimates.\\n\\nAlternatively the most successful Youtuber gamer is Pewdiepie who probably earns \ '' per capita\ '' the most , he is probably the most valuable gamer thus far . No actual running costs as any of the large firms have . ( Also hard to continue the brand once he puts gaming on hold but still , shows something ) \\n\\n____________\\n\\nSo to conclude I would say we simply don\\'t have a unified market enough to boost our own companies and have to by default appeal to mostly English speaking nations or Asian ones.\\n\\nSo the American companies kind of have a better starting hand and European companies have to work a little harder to appeal to firstly the large established American base , then the Asian world and Europeans , already having integrated to the common gaming base that is mostly influenced by American companies , tags along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Uralic,Estonian

You have 1 card for everything important .

Its like what smartphones did to our culture in card from , meaning we use it for such mundane reasons it became part of our lives .

So far it is still at the start of things but even such mundane things as bank logins , government communication and parking is a really great sign of how little can change so much .

In 1995 , following reunification , Germany began making the final payments towards the loans .

Just like it would help with anything else - Hell , I can\\'t think of a single aspect of my life that wouldn\\'t be improved if someone threw money at it but when it comes to children then there is just much more to it than just money . \\n\\nHow many of us can honestly say that they consider themselves to be at an age , in a good rock-solid relationship and are ready to be in it for the long haul but just don\\'t have the money to raise children ? Generations today simply aren\\'t wired like that . Many of us have shifted towards two separate extremes . The first simply find the idea of having a family unappealing , they might even be in a relationship and well off financially but would rather just extend their youth , travel and see the world rather than get bogged down with a couple of kids . For others the idea of a family has become extremely romanticized and idealized and finding such a perfect partner ( who would also reciprocate your feelings ) has become nearly impossible.\\n\\nAnd coming back to money . You don\\'t really need that much money to raise a kid but we think we do because our expectations have grown . If we drop the high expectations and the urge to appear to be better , raising your children suddenly becomes a lot cheaper : \\n\\nChildren\\ 's clothing is expensive ... only when you shop at the expensive stores , you can dress your child up for less than a tenner at your local second-hand store ( minus the shoes ) .\\n\\nSports practice , dancing and music lessons , hobbies etc are all expensive ... but your child doesn\\'t really need them . Here is a football , take it and go play with other children at the playground.\\n\\nUniversity tuition fees are exorbitant ... so don\\'t go there . Trade school and your child can start making money on his own right away.\\n\\nThat\\ 's how the previous - mostly working class - families did it , and that\\ 's how the population grew.\\n\\nThe society today almost demands us to be more successful than our parents and to demonstrate our success .

ExWei,AskEurope,"& gt ; Preface : I hope I don\\'t come off as rude or confrontational , I merely strongly disagree with many of the points you\\ 're saying . In today\\ 's times , many political arguments become rather ugly , and I want to make sure you know I don\\'t mean any of this personally.\\n\\nI understand and I even upvoted all your comments in this thread . Ironically , I am getting downvoted for having a different opinion - had I say something like \ '' Drumpf is Hitler\ '' it would be the opposite . Truly , nowadays people are offended just by the mere fact that someone with different opinion exists ( I do not mean you there ) .\\n\\n & gt ; No , he wasn\\'t . Mattis was an OBAMA pick , whom Trump actually wanted to sack . He\\ 's only still there because the Hill Republicans convinced Trump to leave someone with experience in place , because there is literally not a single other person in the entire administration who knows anything about defence.\\n\\nHow Mattis was an Obama pick when Obama fired Mattis in 2013 - http : //www.weeklystandard.com/obama-fires-top-general-without-even-a-phone-call/article/697744 ? Once Mattis assumed the office he also harshly criticized Obama - http : //www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/1/james-mad-dog-mattis-retired-us-commander-rips-oba/\\n\\n & gt ; I can\\'t find a record of Trump ever praising Estonia for that . The absolute closest I can find is him saying that countries that pay over 2 % are ones they wouldn\\'t break the treaty on , which includes Estonia , although I would think to be rather concerning since the European countries around Estonia matter more than the US itself . \\n\\nI have sent you the link in the previous comment - http : //news.err.ee/219493/trump-sends-congratulation-note-to-kaljulaid , quote from there - *\ '' He also recognized Estonian efforts within NATO , in particular its achievement of the 2 percent GDP goal regarding defense spending.\ '' * . There is also some Trump\\ 's comment about Ukraine ( in the same article ) - *\ '' Your support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine is important for our shared goal of enhancing European and regional security.\ '' *\\n\\n & gt ; Estonia would be much more reliant on Germany or the Scandinavian countries actually fighting on the ground\\n\\nWell sure , look at this article for example - [ Finnish defense minister wouldn\\'t allow in NATO forces aiding Estonia ] ( http : //news.err.ee/596302/finnish-defense-minister-wouldn-t-allow-in-nato-forces-aiding-estonia ) .\\n\\n & gt ; \u201cWell , we don\u2019t rely on American banks , we have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d \\n\\nIt was said only about golf courses\\n\\n & gt ; He had strong prexisting financial connections to Russia long before ever running for president , including a slew of properties , and there is absolutely no reason to think that has changed \\n\\nThere are many properties branded with \ '' Trump , Inc\ '' in US . Trump had several contacts with Russian investors but it seems that he did not build anything in Russia in the result - [ see this link ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia ) \\n\\n & gt ; refuses to release his tax returns\\n\\nWell that\\ 's really bad\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Sanctions against Russia are still in force\\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and that is something Trump has been fighting tooth and nail to change , and something he might still manage . Obama put many of the sanctions you\\ 're referring to in place . Do you praise an arsonist for trying to burn your house down and failing , and shame the builder who made it in the first place for not making it fireproof ? That is , to my understanding , what you are telling me.\\n\\nYes , it was Obama who initiated them . Trump is President for already 6 months and he still did not cancel them .\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; There are more US troops on the Russian border than it was during Obama\\ 's presidency\\n\\n & gt ; *sigh* . They weren\\'t put in there under Trump\\ 's watch , it was under Obama\\ 's . Look at the date on that article . The order was signed by him before he left office , and Trump arrived just soon enough to take his place at the podium . Again , how on earth is this Trump\\ 's doing ? It\\ 's an order designed by Obama , signed by Obama , and simply couldn\\'t get finished before his term ran out . Trump came into office , had no idea whether he should stop it or not , and decided to trust that Obama knew what he was doing . Do you believe that your postman somehow manages to write such passionate letters on your friend\\ 's behalf ? That he crafts everything you receive in the mail ? No , he merely delivers a pre-made package , and the same occurred here.\\n\\nWell Trump could easily cancel them * ( if he would be really pro-Russian ) * just like he trying to introduce the travel ban . Just as with the sanctions , 6 months later since Trump assumed office - US troops are still on the Russian border and there is no sign of moving them.\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Assad got punished for his chemical attack\\n\\n & gt ; I would even be willing to argue with you here , it was a tiny slap on the wrist that caused no long term damage . In exchange , he spent almost $ 60 million of military equipment , which is about 10 % of Estonia\\ 's entire military spending for a whole year . Action definitely needed to be taken , I\\ 'm not arguing with you there , but that was arguably an incredibly expensive attack for relatively gain , hmm ? \\n\\nWhy does it mater how many % of Estonia military spending it is - it was US who took that action , not Estonia.\\n\\nIt definitely costed some money but now Assad seems to be not trying to pull this trick again . Also , what was the EU response to that attack ( except just talks ) - nothing . \\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Trump tried to push other NATO countries to spend more on defence ( obviously Putin would hate that ) \\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and these countries would also hate it . Just take Germany , for example ; if we spent 2 % of our budget on military , we\\ 'd already be outspending Russia by 40 % , just by ourselves . Imagine if France and the UK chipped in ; that\\ 's a little excessive , or ? It\\ 's easy for Estonia to spend 2 % because you have a rather small economy , but for a relatively small country surrounded by allies and with no overseas territories , I see no reason why we should pay that much . More than what we do at the moment , I can agree to that with the rather shoddy state our military is in , but we already pay for much of the EU\\ 's infrastructure and bail out a ton of poor countries . We\\ 're not paying for an entire continent\\ 's army as well.\\n\\nThere could be reasons to disagree with the 2 % target goal , but my point is that Russia would definitely hate that if everyone would be really spending 2 % - it contradicts with the theory that Trump is pro-Russian ( originally claimed by the comment that I responded to ) .\\n\\nSo , what was my original comment : \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' Still that \ '' buddy of the Russian oligarchy\ '' did a lot more for deterrence against Russia than any other NATO or EU country.\ '' \\n\\nSo does any EU country has more troops on the Russian border than US has ? No .",Uralic,Estonian
ExWei,AskEurope,"So if Trump would be pro-Russian he would stop all these deployments probably , he is the \ '' Commander in Chief\ '' after all ? But he did not , and even more , he intensified these deployments as you said .

ExWei,europe,"& gt ; & gt ; Before the Soviet occupation Estonia was ahead of Finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . In 1995 ( after USSR collapsed ) GDP per capita in Estonia was $ 3,044 . In Finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . Now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850.\\n\\n & gt ; I think your figures are wrong there because Estonia still has half the GDP per capita of Finland . \\n\\nWell they are not wrong because current Finland GDP PPP is $ 43,090 and Estonian one is $ 30,850 , the difference is not a half . So this is a fact that ~50 years of the USSR occupation literally ruined the economy and now it significantly recovered with capitalism - I already described it with exact figures in my above comment.\\n\\n & gt ; Look up the actual theory , disconnect it from what you know from history , and imagine what it could be like , without a lens.\\n\\nWhat is the theory ? Seize the means of production ? What if nobody wants to buy the goods of a factory that is owned by the workers ? How do they get resources to start a production ? What happens to the current business owners ? This theory never worked and will never work - unless socialists find a way to control population via some kind of a hivemind device.\\n\\nTo be honest , even if it would have worked exactly as it written in the theory , I would still dislike it - because no \ '' workers\ '' can realistically manage risk of running an enterprise , and they should not.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t agree with how Soviet Russia ran things , despite being a socialist , all I\\ 'm saying is that it was literally the pinnacle of Russian power.\\n\\nThe pinnacle of Russian power ? Are you talking about 1930-1940 when people were being sent to gulags , or about the other part when they were queuing for bread from 6am ? \\n\\nToday Russians at least have some freedom - they can travel to foreign countries , read foreign newspapers and do business . All this was impossible in USSR.\\n\\nIt was the pinnacle only if you measure it in number of tanks and nukes.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition , have you ever actually looked at what Russia did wrong ? It was corruption in government , sectarianism , inefficient management , a one-party system that never needed to change , stagnation , isolation . None of those are something a socialist would agree with.\\n\\nSoviet Russia was also an aggressive imperialist state that attacked its neighboring countries . I often hear socialists talking about the Western Imperialism but never about Soviet imperialism.\\n\\n & gt ; This needs restating . Are you saying Marx tried to build communism ? He didn\\'t , he formed the theory , which you still need to read\\n\\nI am aware enough of the theory that wants to ruin everything . \ '' Seize the means of production\ '' - yeah lets remove people who built businesses using their capital and knowledge and put a bunch of uneducated workers in charge , I wonder how it will work out.\\n\\nAlso , since everything is seized and owned by the workers , does it mean that e.g . on a nuclear plant , a nuclear engineer and a janitor are equal in terms of what they can get ? \\n\\n & gt ; instead of taking your views from pure lies.\\n\\nSure it is pure lies , probably that\\ 's because I never was in a post-Soviet country which was not decimated by USSR occupation and Russia is far away from me . Of course IRL post-communism * ( the country called itself communist and other kind of communism did not exist yet ) * knowledge is nothing compared to some theory that never worked exactly as described and even if it would have worked ( \ '' seize the means of production\ '' ) it would be only slightly better.\\n\\n & gt ; North Korea calls itself Socialist , do you believe them as well ? \\n\\nI believe that they are communist , because USSR was very similar to them and also called themselves communist .",Uralic,Estonian

There is many civil wars ( so-called conflicts ) in Africa going on at the moment and none of them because of imperialism or climate .

Also , the non-citizens can\\'t vote only in national elections - in local elections they can vote as much as they want . So , non-citizens are only those who moved to Estonia during the USSR occupation ( so they are kind of \ '' illegal immigrants\ '' ) - it does not depend on their ethnicity .

Estonia separated from Soviet Union 25 years ago and there are still enough \ '' stupid Soviet people\ '' and even more , they are breeding .

If they pass easy language test then they get citizenship . It does not look like as a second class to me.\\n\\nI think this thing about the \ '' second class citizens\ '' goes from e.g . that they have their own Russian-language schools , but , nobody ( except their parents ) is forcing Russian kids to go there . Ironically , it is pro-Russian politicians who support this kind of \ '' apartheid\ '' . Non citizens are also eligible for all social benefits like pension , etc.\\n\\nAlso , some Russians even do not want to get Estonian citizenship because if they are non-citizens then they have visa free travel to Russia.\\n\\n\\nSo to sum up what I said : They are not second class citizens and if they want , they can really easily get that citizenship .",Uralic,Estonian

Nobody was pillaging Serbia in the past 50 years , while there is the opposite in case of Estonia . Serbs do not want reforms and this is root of the issue - nobody is preventing them from reforms and your only argument is *\ '' You sound like an 18 year old\ '' *.\\n\\nAlso , since you edited your previous comment , I will address it there : \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm sure you\\ 're aware of the fact that poverty is the primary source of corruption .

What business can you do when your whole market is limited to a small and closed balkan country ? The reforms have been designed to protect the local business and keep out foreign competition.\\n\\nYou are very wrong here . \ '' Ease of doing business\ '' is about dealing with tax authorities , setting up a business , getting permits , etc . If it is a pain in the ass to setup a local business , how exactly it \ '' protects the local business\ '' ? If they would do reforms their local business would be stronger and their economy would attract foreign investments.\\n\\nYour original point was : \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it\\ 's so simple to reform.\\n\\nAnd once I proved that it happened in other countries before , you started saying *\ '' reforms are not needed if & lt ; list of excuses & gt ; \ '' * .",Uralic,Estonian

In reality it is between Russia and Latvia , while being separated from Sweden and Finland by the Baltic Sea . Norway is so far from being near so I am not sure how to comment that .

If not reforms then there would not be EU membership and would not be foreign investments .

ExWei,europe,"Who goes hand-in-hand ? \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it\\ 's so simple to reform.\\n\\nYeah , if you really want to , it is really simple.\\n\\nWhen USSR collapsed GDP per capita in Estonia was 8 times lower than in Finland ( $ 3000 vs $ 26000 ) , because Estonian economy was pillaged by the Soviet occupation . Then in 2004 Estonia joined EU - it took 13 years . Now in Estonia GDP is $ 29,543 and Finland it is $ 40,455 - 27 % difference , compare it to the 8 times difference just when Soviet occupation ended.\\n\\nNow , lets look at e.g . Serbia : \\n\\nYugoslavia collapsed 25 years ago - they are still nowhere close to EU membership , their economy sucks and corruption is rampant .

ExWei,europe,"I , as someone who lives in EU , can not imagine that sanctions against US states from EU will ever exist . You used Russia as an example - but US economy is a lot bigger than the Russian one and it would really hit EU if introduce such sanctions . EU trade with US is 20 % .\\n\\nAlso - could you imagine what uproar it would create ? Shell Oil Company ( HQ in US is in Texas ) , for example , is Netherlands-owned - Wilders is already almost got elected in Netherlands , imagine what would happen if Netherlands economy would be hit with such sanctions ? Brexit happened because of temporal discomfort * ( let\\ 's not pretend there were no issues ) * but a total ban on trade with some US states would be a lot larger discomfort . You can care as much as you want about environment and ethics but if you are unemployed because of the sanctions then you would probably care about money over environment . EU countries would lose billions of euros , thousands would lose jobs - guess for which party they would vote ? For that one that promises to leave EU and cancel the sanctions.\\n\\n & gt ; My point is not everything should be about money and neoliberalism.\\n\\nI agree , there should be limits . But we can not allow e.g . Saudi Arabia that literally stones gays and women to be allowed , and the red states to be banned for \ '' ethics and environment\ '' .\\n\\nIMO first sort out Saudi Arabia , Qatar and North Korea , and only then think about red states - probably while trying to sort out Saudi Arabia , Trump will be already gone.\\n\\n**edit : ** and what would be US response to these sanctions ? Wage full trade war with EU ? Sorry , but we in EU do not want it .",Uralic,Estonian
ExWei,europe,"& gt ; If you have a real argument make it\\n\\nOk , let me rephrase my argument : \\n\\nYour claim was \ '' yes pull all investment from red states only invest in blue areas\ '' \\n\\n1 . How exactly do you see \ '' pulling all investments from red states\ '' ? Make some law that would prohibit private EU companies from owning shares in the states that vote republican ? As of today , EU companies can freely own shares in almost every country * ( I believe it excludes North Korea and other similar countries ) * , even in popular tax planning countries ( aka \ '' tax havens\ '' ) such as BVI . Outlaw Republican states so they would be in the same list as North Korea ? It sounds like dictatorship.\\n\\n2 . ( # 1 continues ) Ok , lets assume this law is created and it passed , what would likely happen : all affected EU companies would either create a subsidiary or move legal residence to somewhere like BVI where they would not be bothered by such laws , and then they would continue managing their investments into Republican states from there . So what would EU gain from that : instead of getting at least some % from the dividends from the US investments , EU would get 0 % from that.\\n\\n3 . I see you indirectly compared Texas to \ '' a nazi death camp\ '' in [ the other comment ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6futrk/eu_to_ignore_white_house_and_work_directly_with/dily6o3/ ) . What exactly Texas is doing that it deserves such comparisons ? Votes republican ? With countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar being allowed , it would be an ultimate double-standard to ban Texas.\\n\\n4 . On your argument on the better places for investments ( higher ROI ) . What prevents the blue states from improving their business environment to make them more attractive for investments ? Why there should be some kind of *affirmative action* to discriminate against some states ( that are \ '' guilty\ '' of voting for a different party ) ? It is like if you would have a fast car and you neighbor would have a slow car , so they would break your tires so your speed would be equal ( or worse ) .\\n\\n5 . You also say \ '' Get Asia on board too\ '' - what do you mean there ? Force private companies to invest to Asia ( many of them are already doing that - thanks to their business friendless and good ROI due to local factors ) ? The same with \ '' invest blue states only\ '' - how are you going to make companies to do that ? \\n\\nMy point is that there should be fair , free market - you are a blue state and you want investments ? Great , make yourself more competitive to win it from the red states .

Please read at least [ some Wikipedia article about that ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_nationality_law ) , for example . Especially the \ '' historical precedents of undefined citizenship\ '' . I will quote it for you : \\n\\n & gt ; \\'Undefined citizenship\\ ' ( Estonian : kodakondsuseta isik , Russian : \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ) is a term used in Estonia to denote a post-Soviet form of statelessness . It is applied to those migrants from former Soviet republics and their children , who were unable or unwilling to pursue any country\\ 's citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Russia being a successor state to the Soviet Union , all former USSR citizens qualified for citizenship of Russian Federation , available upon mere request , as provided by the law \ '' On the RSFSR Citizenship\ '' in force up to end of 2000 . [ 4 ] Estonia\\ 's policy of requiring naturalisation of post-war immigrants was in part influenced by Russia\\ 's citizenship law and the desire to prevent dual citizenship , [ 5 ] and upon the established legal principle that persons who settle under the rule of an occupying power gain no automatic right to nationality . According to Peter Van Elsuwege , a scholar in European law at Ghent University , **a number of historic precedents support this** , most notably the case of Alsace-Lorraine when France on recovering the territory in 1918 did not automatically grant French citizenship to German settlers despite Germany having annexed the territory 47 years earlier in 1871 . [ 6 ] \\n\\nPersons of undefined citizenship who reside legally in Estonia can apply for an alien\\ 's passport . Estonian alien\\ 's passport allows visa-free travel within Schengen treaty countries for a maximum of 90 days in a 6-month period . [ 7 ] Alternatively they are entitled to naturalise as citizens and receive an Estonia passport , and more than half have opted to do so since 1992 . [ 8 ] \\n\\n & gt ; if the netherlands revokes a terrorists citizenship to prevent him from coming back , then they are violating this particular human right as well ( which is why the discussion on whether to do this is an ongoing debate in my country ) .\\n\\nIn Denmark , if you are terrorist [ you lose Danish citizenship ] ( http : //www.middleeasteye.net/news/denmark-strips-man-citizenship-fighting-596200382 ) . Is Denmark also \ '' not normal world\ '' for you ? \\n\\n & gt ; because this particular human right does not have preconditions however reasonable they may look like to you\\n\\nNothing prevents them from becoming Russian citizens . They all are eligible to become Russian citizens because they were Soviet citizens and Russia is a successor of USSR . Estonia is not a successor of USSR.\\n\\nRegarding your second paragraph ... . some formatting would make it more readable by the way.. : \\n\\n & gt ; these soviets have lived there all their lives\\n\\nWrong . Many of them immigrated in 1970s - it is a considerable part of life but not \ '' all\ '' . If you moved in 1970 and after 20 years in 1991 you still do not know the local language - sorry , but you are a bad immigrant.\\n\\n & gt ; this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nLike I said , they are free to get Russian citizenship . Once they get Russian citizenship they still can live in Estonia.\\n\\n & gt ; so in a normal world they should have \\'equal rights\\ ' . however this is not a normal world . \\'native estonians\\ ' do not like them and are very smart . they thought \\'well we are very many so we rule here . and we don\\'t like them\\ ' . But they could not just tell them to go because that would be mean . So they thought on this until a smart Estonian came up with an idea . \\'Well the soviets do not know estonian . so we tell them that they can belong here if they know estonian . that sounds reasonable\\ ' . so they went to the soviets and said \\'we are so generous , we allow any soviets to become estonians , as long as they know estonian\\ ' . the soviets lack of knowledge of estonian is just a politically correct proxy for ethnicity . so to prevent smart people from excluding people they don\\'t like , this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nSo is all this an excuse to illegally immigrate to an other country and completely do not try to learn the local language ? Just answer that . Is it okay when you immigrate and don\\'t even try to at least a bit to integrate ? This all is only about their lack of at least slightest integration.\\n\\nHowever , some of them integrate ( and acquire the Estonian citizenship ) and I support that.\\n\\nChances are that you never was in Estonia and yet you are claiming you be an \ '' expert\ '' on the subject . Literally everyone who wanted got that citizenship , only those who do not need / or hate it are without citizenship now.\\n\\nAlso , regarding the discrimination : If I move to , say , Finland , they will want me to learn the Finnish language in order to become a citizen of Finland . Why Russians should get a free pass ? \\n\\nAlso , it seems to be a common misinformation , but all non-citizens are eligible for all benefits like healthcare , pension , unemployment benefits , etc . They are equal to citizens there.\\n\\n**edit : ** your comment in other thread - \ '' the EU should never have allowed you in\ '' , \ '' little insignificant fascist countries with no history\ '' .

FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; I think if you look at Brazil and Portugal , Cuba and Spain , Canada and the USA and ( finally ) the UK and Ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own , individual , languages.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter much if the language is unique to them or not , what matters is whether the culture is based on that language or not . Core concepts of many languages and associated cultures do not exist in other languages , thus it is not possible to adopt another language without abandoning or re-shaping linguistic and cultural concepts , which would lead to a loss of cultural diversity.\\n\\nConsider this example . Suppose I say to you in English that \ '' I spent yesterday evening with a neighbor.\ '' You may well wonder whether my companion was male or female , but I have the right to tell you politely that it\\ 's none of your business . But if we were speaking French or German , I wouldn\\'t have the privilege to equivocate in this way , because I would be obliged by the grammar of language to choose between *voisin* or *voisine* ; *Nachbar* or *Nachbarin* . These languages compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not I feel it is remotely your concern . This does not mean , of course , that English speakers are unable to understand the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors , but it does mean that they do not have to consider the sexes of neighbors , friends , teachers and a host of other persons each time they come up in a conversation , whereas speakers of some languages are obliged to do so.\\n\\nOn the other hand , English does oblige you to specify certain types of information that can be left to the context in other languages . If I want to tell you in English about a dinner with my neighbor , I may not have to mention the neighbor\\ 's sex , but I do have to tell you something about the timing of the event : I have to decide whether we dined , have been dining , are dining , will be dining and so on . Chinese , on the other hand , does not oblige its speakers to specify the exact time of the action in this way , because the same verb form can be used for past , present or future actions . Again , this does not mean that the Chinese are unable to understand the concept of time . But it does mean they are not obliged to think about timing whenever they describe an action.\\n\\nWhen your language routinely obliges you to specify certain types of information , it forces you to be attentive to certain details in the world and to certain aspects of experience that speakers of other languages may not be required to think about all the time . And since such habits of speech are cultivated from the earliest age , it is only natural that they can settle into habits of mind that go beyond language itself , affecting your experiences , perceptions , associations , feelings , memories and orientation in the world .",Uralic,Estonian

FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; It\\ 's much more cost-efficient to develop and maintain a capability to kill tanks than to maintain the tanks themselves . \\n\\nThe most cost-effective anti-tank weapon is another tank . Here\\ 's a wonderful excerpt from Edward Luttwak\\ 's \ '' Strategy\ '' : \\n\\n & gt ; During the Cold War , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization faced its greatest threat in what is now peaceful central Germany . And just like the South Korean government , NATO was politically committed to a preclusive defense in geographic circumstances that would have favored a far more elastic defense.\\n\\n & gt ; In a retrospective view of the situation at the level of theater strategy , we would see the eastern edge of the Federal Republic ( \ '' West Germany\ '' ) extending from the Baltic coast all the way south to Austria . For some 625 miles , the border would divide East Germany and Czechoslovakia , at the time both basing areas for the Soviet army . Upon mobilization , as units of the Belgian , British , Canadian , Dutch , German , and American armies would move out of their barracks and bases to deploy into their assigned positions , NATO\\ 's \ '' central front\ '' would acquire a physical form . We would see not a solid line with units stationed shoulder to shoulder but rather a series of deployments of men , vehicles , and weapons within a band of territory running from north to south.\\n\\n & gt ; Roughly one-third of NATO\\ 's tank and mechanized formations ( the \ '' covering forces\ '' ) would have advanced to within a few miles from the border , with the rest kept some distance behind . Even though the front held by the covering forces would not follow each twist and turn of the border , it would still be stretched out over some 600 miles . In addition , at least the low-lying tracts of the border with neutral Austria would also have to be protected , because Soviet invasion forces from Hungary could pass up the Danube valley quite quickly.\\n\\n & gt ; We can now finally dispose of the missile-infantry proposal . Given the length of the frontage that the Alliance was committed to protect , we can immediately understand why a frontal defense by missile troops would have been very weak , even if elaborately shielded by properly overwatched barriers . For we discover that in those narrow sectors of the front where the two sides would actually collide in combat , the antitank missiles would be greatly outnumbered by Soviet armored vehicles , even though the missiles were so much cheaper.\\n\\n & gt ; As matters stood during the last two decades of the Cold War , more than 10,000 tanks , an even larger number of infantry combat vehicles , much self-propelled artillery , and all manner of support units could attack from a standing start from East Germany and Czechoslovakia , with much greater forces moving up behind them from Poland and the Soviet Union.\\ ' That great mass of vehicles would not of course be distributed evenly from north to south opposite every segment of the front , but instead be concentrated into four or five vectors of advance , each moving westward in a phalanx as broad as the terrain would allow . Some might be constricted into an approach as narrow as a two-lane road , while others might advance on a width of as much as ten miles . But summing all the vectors and the width of every phalanx , Soviet armor would still be attacking only a fraction of the entire 600-mile line . Thus even if a huge force of missile troops were raised , with tens of thousands of launchers , Soviet armor rolling forward would easily outnumber them in every combat encounter.\\n\\n & gt ; The arithmetic of attrition must therefore guarantee defeat . It can not be otherwise when the number of missile launchers must be distributed to cover all the frontage , while invading armored forces attack in concentrated force ? Of course the missile troops could also be concentrated , in fact they could outconcentrate the invasion columns , if they were mobile enough . But that can not be done just by supplying trucks to transport them up and down the front along the border patrol roads , because any movements that far forward would be much too vulnerable to artillery fires . It can only be done by keeping the bulk of the missile troops in wait at rearward crossroads , ready to rush forward on their trucks to reinforce sectors of the front under attack . Incapable of cross-country movement and thus road-bound , motorized missile troops in transit would be highly vulnerable to air attack and quite unable to move forward against the artillery fires running ahead of each invading phalanx . Helicopters could assure an even faster response . Enough of them could allow the missile troops to outconcentrate the invasion columns every time , but that is no longer the cheap alternative originally proposed \u2014 and why carry missile troops with antitank launchers anyway , when helicopters can have their own missiles without need of troops to launch them ? In either case , those most fragile of aircraft would be highly vulnerable to the antiaircraft weapons that accompany armored forces and to the descending curtains of artillery fire of a large-scale offensive . \\n\\n & gt ; With trucks much too vulnerable as well as road-bound , and with helicopters too vulnerable as well as too expensive , only well-armored ground vehicles , fit to go across country , can provide mobility under fire for the missile troops , to allow them to meet the concentrated attack . Armored and tracked , such vehicles could certainly bring the missile troops where they would be needed . They would of course replicate the present carriers of the mechanized infantry . . . which of course includes antitank missiles among its weapons . And if armored vehicles are to be acquired , why not arm them with built-in missile launchers that can be used without dismounting ? And if there are to be built-in weapons anyway , why have only bulky missile-launchers with their slow rates of fire , when guns remain superior for antiarmor combat at closer ranges ? If taken that far , the original proposal dissolves into a mere variant of the existing mechanized forces , or even into a re-creation of the tank itself . We have come full circle , back to the conventional solution of fighting armor with armor . We can now recognize that the persistence of armored forces is not just the result of institutional rigidity , the force of tradition , the power of entrenched military bureaucracies . Without protected mobility there is no concentration , and without concentration there is no strength .",Uralic,Estonian

FleshyDagger,europe,"[ Background ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way ) : \\n\\n & gt ; The Baltic Way or Baltic Chain was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on August 23 , 1989 . Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) across the three Baltic states \u2013 Estonian SSR , Latvian SSR , and Lithuanian SSR , republics of the Soviet Union.\\n\\n & gt ; The demonstration originated in \ '' Black Ribbon Day\ '' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s . It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany . The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940.\\n\\n & gt ; The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements : Rahvarinne of Estonia , the Popular Front of Latvia , and S\u0105j\u016bdis of Lithuania . The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities . It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations . It has been described as an effective publicity campaign , and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene . The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter , but as a moral issue.\\n\\n & gt ; The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric , but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union . Within six months of the protest , Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.\\n\\nThere\\ 's also a documentary by two American filmmakers about [ the Singing Revolution ] ( http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0954008/ ) , which the Baltic Way was a part of ( [ trailer ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pm3yzSN8aVk ) ) .",Uralic,Estonian

Women who are housewives tend to be unhappy with that role.\\n\\nSo you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s USA to prove that housewives in present-day Germany prefer to work ? And you call this research ? \\n\\nDo you have an actual source that gives a figures on how many German parents would work rather stay at home , given the choice ? In Estonia , for example , we\\ 've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation . The most highly-educated , well-paid women were the group that saw the highest rise of birth rates after *parent\\ 's salary* was introduced that consists of child support at the level of parent\\ 's salary in the year before childbirth . This tool of financial security ( ! ) has by far been the most effective method of stopping population decline , even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society . As a side effect to this , the length of time staying at home has also increased : approximately half the parents do not work during their first year with the child . There is a sharp decrease of staying at home at the cut-off point of *parent\\ 's salary*.\\n\\nSee [ this chart ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uTLt8I2.png ) from a study by Praxis , with summary published in [ Estonian Parliament\\ 's journal ] ( http : //www.riigikogu.ee/rito/index.php ? id=13768 & amp ; op=archive2 ) . It\\ 's percentage of parent\\ 's who receive pay from work ( left axis ) for the top-paid 20 % in months since the birth of their child ( bottom axis ) . Parent\\ 's salary was introduced in 2004 , and the chart displays behaviour two years prior , at the time , and two years later . At that time , parent\\ 's salary was paid for 12 months . Notice how the percentage of parents working drops by half , given the choice to stay at home - and mind you , these are the most career-oriented people . As an implication of this , the length of staying at home also significantly increased.\\n\\nSo the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors , and not some kind of an universal thing of its own.\\n\\n & gt ; The overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high.\\n\\nOf course . But the high quality isn\\'t guaranteed , thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation , not some ideal model . And let\\ 's not forget from where we started - was the quality of day care high in DDR and the Soviet Union by today\\ 's standards that the research is based upon ?

That\\ 's the question I have been asking.\\n\\nThe only fact you\\ 've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular . This is flawed reasoning since the popularity of child care does not necessarily reflect what parents want . Instead , it may very easily reflect what they are *forced to* do to make the ends meet . Likewise , staying at home does not automatically translate to a preference , but may indicate \ '' a lack of quality in available child care.\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's like taxes . The fact that 99 % pay them does not mean that 99 % of the population would prefer to do so , given a choice not to.\\n\\n & gt ; Different studies coming to different conclusions does not mean anything if the quality of the scientific method is not on the same level.\\n\\nThere are studies supporting both sides of the argument , and there are no definitive studies that would give a solid , universal backing to either of them.\\n\\nIf you claim otherwise , then I guess it is my turn to ask for sources .",Uralic,Estonian
FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; The fact that child care for children under three is still wildly popular and common in East Germany even without the obligation to work you mentioned would suggest that yes , women prefer to work.\\n\\nDesire and actions may not necessarily be aligned . For example , a study conducted in Tallinn among mothers of one-year-olds concluded that only 7 % wished to return to work at that time . Sadly , many can not afford to stay at home beyond the 18 month maternity leave that we have . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that babies need to basically be attached to their mothers is not what modern science says at all . Mothers are not the only attachment figures of babies .

FleshyDagger,europe,"The source I provided was a table from ministry of defence\\ 's ordinance that set conscription numbers for 2013 and 2014 , and assigned them to units . It should be enough to settle the matter.\\n\\nAs for reservists , you seem to not understand the defence concept that is based on conscription . Estonia , as well as Finland and several other countries , do not keep a large active military , but instead run a small peacetime force that is tasked with training conscripts . After their training , these conscripts are assigned to reserve and continue their normal life ( with refresher training now and then ) , but they are seen as fit for active duty for ten years from their training , and should the need arise , are called up with a mobilization . Thus the main fighting force is 10 years\\ ' worth of conscripts . They are sometimes called \ '' active reserve\ '' to distinguish them from those who simply sometime in their life got military training . For example , Finland\\ 's armed forces have trained 3.5 million conscripts in the past 90 years , and about 2 million of them are alive , but only ~350 000 or ten years\\ ' worth of them are considered the fit for immediate duty and thus added to active personnel ( 36 000 , most of them conscripts in training ) of Finnish armed forces to form the wartime size.\\n\\nRomania abolished conscription in 2007 . This means that by 2017 , there will be no reservists who would be generally considered to be fit for immediate duty . So here\\ 's my question again : where are you going to take reserves from to boost wartime size ? Are you going to rely on 40-somethings and 50-somethings with obsolete training , many of whom have never even seen the current equipment ? \\n\\nI believe my comparison of Estonian active personnel + active reserve + members of paramilitary organization against Romanian active personnel was the most accurate way of comparing size , considering the core differences between professional armies and conscription-based armies.\\n\\nThe only thing that you could pick on is that the Estonian wartime operational size includes the Estonian Defence League , a volunteer military organization , in addition to conscripts . If Romania has any similar organization , its size should of course be added to wartime strength . Still , I believe this would not change the big picture significantly .",Uralic,Estonian

This also illustrates why the Supreme Court decision can not be used as a moral platform - in their naivety , North American courts relied on Soviet evidence that was often nothing less than forgery . See [ Soviet Evidence in North American Courts : An Analysis of Problems and Concerns with Reliance on Communist Source Evidence in Alleged War Criminal Trials ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/books/dp/B000BY4ZC4 ) for many more examples.\\n\\nIn short , the author doesn\\'t have a clue of Estonian historiography , nor of issues related to post-WW2 mock trials in Eastern Europe . As far as war crimes go , here are valid topics , such as the actions of Ain-Ervin Mere ( he was one of the accused in the mock trials of 1960s ) and of [ *Omakaitse* ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakaitse ) , but these topics are limited to the civil administration and their auxiliary units , and have very little to do with front-line units like the 20th Estonian Waffen-SS Division .",Uralic,Estonian

According to research , the vast majority of its occupants had been participants of so-called destruction commandos ( *h\u00e4vituspataljon* ) and deserved to be shot , about 230 were killed in total.\\n\\nThe camp became famous after a Soviet investigator multiplied the width of a anti-tank trench used for executions by the length of it , and assumed that 12 000 had been murdered there . Soviet propaganda spinned that figure of 12 000 around until the very collapse of the country.\\n\\nLinnas\\ ' role in the camp remains relatively unknown , since until the collapse of the Soviet Union , unbiased research was not possible . After the collapse , research has been seriously hindered by the lack of trustworthy evidence . So I hope that you don\\'t mind me being surprised by foreigners who know so well who-did-what . \\n\\nMerely \ '' guilt by position\ '' is not good enough for me.\\n\\n & gt ; The Omakaitse members were also involved in very questionable acts . Those people then went on to become a part of the SS Division.\\n\\nSince you seem to know this so well - how many Omakaitse members were guilty of any crimes , and how many of them were drafted into 20th Division ? Out of 15 000-20 000 men in the 20th , how many had innocent blood on their hands ? \\n\\nEven if everyone who had anything to do with crimes were conscripted , they would\\ 've still not constituted more than 7 % of 20th Division\\ 's manpower .

Annexing entire regions is not an action that comes out of thin air , and just because they don\\'t write about it as an officially held-public position doesn\\'t mean that they didn\\'t have their eye on it . \\n\\nOf course I do , and it\\ 's not limited to Crimea . Mearsheimer conveniently skips over Putin\\ 's ideology , of which Russian world or *Russkiy mir* is a cornerstone . He is determined to unite territories he believes to belong to the Russian world.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why the country I live in decided to integrate with NATO . Unlike Russia , NATO has not yet [ occupied the country ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_ % 281940 % 29 # Soviet_occupation ) , [ installed a puppet government ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Transitional_governments ) , [ deported tens of thousands to die Siberia ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Mass_deportations ) or [ simply murdered them ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Blokhin ) .\\n\\nThis , however , does not fit into Mearsheimer\\ 's narrative , because in such case , the expansion of NATO had not been something orchestrated by the West to \ '' encircle\ '' Russia , but an expression of free will by Eastern European nations , motivated by the fear of history repeating itself . And thus would collapse his core message of blaming the West.\\n\\nIn fact , the situation in Eastern Europe has very little to do with the West . Key dynamics lie within the history of the region , especially in the post-war subjugation of Eastern Europe and Russia\\ 's failure to face its bloody past like Germany has done . Could you imagine modern-day Germany [ going after those who refused to serve in the Wehrmacht or the SS ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fsm9j/russia_reopens_criminal_cases_against_lithuanians/ ) ? \\n\\nThere\\ 's a reason why Russia\\ 's neighbours are doing everything they can to isolate and protect themselves from Russia , and it\\ 's an absolute travesty that the self-proclaimed \ '' realist\ '' ignores this . His reasoning is a fantasy that might be internally sound , but nevertheless has very little connection to the real world.\\n\\n & gt ; Whether Ukraine becoming integrated with the EU and a possible NATO candidate is a threat to Russia , well as Mearsheimer says , it\\ 's not up to us what Russia deems as a threat . \\n\\nOf course Russia is free to define what they see as a threat , but this does not validate their position - deciding for the Ukrainians is a balant violation of Ukraine\\ 's right to self-determination , a cardinal principle in modern international law , binding to all members of the UN through its Charter.\\n\\nThis is also one of the topics Mearsheimer skips over - he does not even mention that Putin in his military aggression has violated the UN Charter , the Helsinki Act of 1975 , the Treaty on the Dissolution of the Soviet Union of 1991 , the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 , the Russian-Ukrainian Friendship Treaty of 1997 , or the Russian-Ukrainian Sevastopol Base Treaty of 1997 , and so on.\\n\\nWith Mearsheimer\\ 's arguments , any crackpot military aggression anywhere in the world could be defended .

Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\n & gt ; \\n\\nBUILDING THINGS\\n\\nA glimpse of this Swedish future can be caught at Arlandagymnasiet , a high school in M\u00e4rsta , half an hour north of Stockholm , which offers remedial Swedish classes for immigrant students . On a recent morning , Ayaan Hassan Ali , a 16-year-old recently arrived from Somalia , was sitting in a modern classroom , with blue chairs and bright wood paneling on the walls . In one corner , there was a large flat-screen TV , in another , a map of the world , and in the back , a couple of bookshelves filled with dictionaries : Swedish-Arabic , Swedish-Russian , and Swedish-Tigrinya among them.\\n\\nAyaan spends almost every afternoon studying at home so she can come to class well prepared . After two months in school , she says she still has a hard time speaking Swedish , but her reading and writing have improved considerably . \u201cI want to be done with the language introduction by the end of this year , \u201d she said . Her aim is to earn a middle-school diploma as quickly as possible , so that she will be able to begin high school and eventually study engineering at a university . It is an ambitious plan . \u201cSome of them complete it in a year , \u201d said Veronica Suskic , the headmaster in charge of the introductory program . \u201cBut very few.\u201d\\n\\nAyaan\u2019s main challenge might not be her own motivation but her fellow students -- and a school system under strain from the steady arrival of new immigrants . Ayaan is one of only two girls in her class of about 20 . ( It\u2019s a number in constant flux , Ayaan\u2019s teacher , Thomas Engqvist , said , since new kids come all the time , while others \u201cmove , get deported , some just disappear.\u201d ) Many of the boys arrive to Sweden as unaccompanied minors , most of them from Afghanistan . The others in the class are from Albania , Eritrea , Kyrgyzstan , Poland , Somalia , and Tajikistan.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult environment in which to teach , \u201d Engqvist said . \u201cThe testosterone level is pretty high , and their level of education tends to vary a lot . And then we have the whole world in the class -- you get mini wars , conflicts that sometimes boil over.\u201d The situation shows no sign of letting up . With a wry smile , Engqvist quoted a colleague who said that , \u201cas long as there are wars in the world , we have a job.\u201d And there are always wars , he pointed out -- \u201cright now , in Syria.\u201d\\n\\nThat day , the class spent several hours reading aloud a simple text over and over . After they had finished , the teacher turned to the class to test them on vocabulary . \u201cModig , \u201d he asked , using the Swedish word for brave . \u201cDoes anyone know what modig means ? \u201d Silence . \u201cOkay , it\u2019s when you do something even though you\u2019re afraid to do it . Does anyone have an example of being modig ? \u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a small guy picks a fight with a big guy , \u201d one of the Afghan boys , 17-year-old Sadiq , said . Like most of the Afghanis in the class , Sadiq had arrived alone , after passing through some ten countries on the way . \u201cYes ! But he has to be afraid , \u201d the teacher said . \u201cOtherwise he\u2019s just stupid . Someone else ? \u201d\\n\\nAhmad , one of the Somali boys , tried telling a story about how he was fleeing his home in Somalia and crossed a river filled with crocodiles . But the gap between his halting Swedish vocabulary and the sheer horror he wished to express was too wide , and the teacher was unable to follow along . Instead , he asked , \u201cAyaan , is being modig something good ? \u201d Ayaan looked down into her book , thinking hard . \u201cYes , \u201d she said in her deep voice , a voice that makes her seem older than she actually is . \u201cFor example , when you dare to do a test even when you\u2019re afraid you will fail.\u201d She paused . \u201cOr when you speak up , even though you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\\n\\nLater in the day , the class had a discussion about jobs . Sadiq , the 17-year-old Afghan boy , asked me if being a journalist was a good job . After being told that becoming a lawyer or studying economics would be better if we wanted to make money , he nodded absent-mindedly . \u201cHow about welding ? Is that good ? \u201d It turned out that he\u2019d been a welder since the age of five . He looked proud . \u201cYou\u2019ll always have to build things , don\u2019t you ? \u201d",Uralic,Estonian
Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\nUntil the mid-1990s , the Sweden Democrats were a party of militant skinheads in black uniforms . Its xenophobic message is unchanged , but today the group presents itself as Sweden\u2019s only reliable guardian of the welfare state . A television ad released by the party for the 2010 elections depicts an ethnically Swedish retiree hobbling forward while a hoard of Muslim women in burqas greedily charge past to grab money from the national coffers . The choice , a voice-over explains , is to \u201ccut money from immigration budgets , or from pensions.\u201d \\n\\nThis messaging plays into the worries of many Swedes that the welfare state is increasingly fragile . Over the past two decades , the size of Sweden\u2019s welfare state has shrunk . Public spending has fallen from its peak of 67 percent of the GDP in 1993 to 52 percent today , as taxes have been cut quite drastically : as a percentage of the GDP , overall taxes have gone down from 51.4 percent in 2000 to 44.3 percent in 2012 . Both services and benefits have been cut -- most notably unemployment benefits -- and big parts of the welfare sector have been opened to private , profit-making companies . In international economic circles , this has been hailed as a new \u201cNordic model\u201d -- a lean but well-financed and still generous state . But for many Swedes , the cutbacks carry a clear sense of loss . And , increasingly , some Swedes seem inclined to blame immigrants for that feeling.\\n\\nIn the 2010 elections , the Sweden Democrats earned 5.7 percent of the vote , enough to enter parliament . Post-election surveys clearly showed that the party got most of its support from working-class male Swedes -- the group , apart from immigrants , hit hardest by the shrinking supply of low-skill jobs . Today , as the next general elections in September draw closer , most opinion polls show the Sweden Democrats at close to ten percent . A recent survey showed that about 30 percent of young male members of Landsorganisationen , Sweden\u2019s largest trade union , support the party . Thus far , the government has carefully avoided dealing with the party , and no one expects this to change after the coming elections . But as the party grows , the lure of the policies that the Sweden Democrats espouse clearly grows with it . \\n\\nUSING A MEGAPHONE\\n\\nRami Al-Khamisi is a fierce-looking young man , with close-cropped hair and a physique shaped by regular visits to the local gym . But he is no delinquent -- quite the opposite . He\u2019s in his second year as a law student at Stockholm University , and in recent years , an organization he helped found , Megafonen ( \u201cThe Megaphone\u201d ) , has emerged as one of the most notable community organizations in Stockholm\u2019s suburbs . Unlike the Swedes who think of immigrants as the cause of recent tensions rippling through Swedish society , Al-Khamisi blames the tax cuts , privatizations , and cutbacks to the welfare state.\\n\\nAs we walked through the neighborhood , Rami seemed to know pretty much everybody . Meeting some teenage boys hanging out in a doorway , Rami shook hands . \u201cWhat\u2019s up , \u201d he said . \u201cYou on your way to school ? \u201d ( It\u2019s a question with an uncertain answer : In Husby , 19 percent of the 15-year-olds don\u2019t have the grades to earn placement in high school . ) As we reached a footbridge near his building , Rami pointed to a low-slung yellow building with peeling paint and darkened windows . Inside , you could see furniture strewn about , like someone had left in a hurry.\\n\\n\u201cThis used to be the Yellow House , a place for kids to hang out , \u201d Rami said , peering through the broken blinds . \u201cIt\u2019s been closed for five , six years . There was another place as well , called the Barn , that closed ten years ago . They used to arrange all kinds of things . In the summer , we went out into the Stockholm archipelago , camping and stuff . In the winter , we went skiing in Fj\u00e4llen -- the mountains up north . Now , there\u2019s almost nothing.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cI think the politicians might understand that kids here need something to do , \u201d Rami continued . \u201cBut they don\u2019t live here , they don\u2019t know our reality , so they don\u2019t realize what it does to the neighborhood when they board up places like this . Most kids here don\u2019t have their own rooms ; they live six , seven people in a two- or three-bedroom apartment . So where do you hang out ? At McDonald\u2019s , feeling like a bum ? You know what happens ? They\u2019ll start looking for some action.\u201d \\n\\nListening to Rami , it is easy to get a dark view of Sweden\u2019s future . He sees -- as does the immigrant-turned-economist Sanandaji -- a whole generation of \u201clost kids\u201d in areas like Husby , boys with an immigrant background who are at risk of never truly becoming part of society . But that\u2019s not because they\u2019re not integrated into Swedish culture . \u201cMost of the kids who rioted were born here and speak no other language than Swedish , \u201d he said . \u201cSo what exactly should we integrate into ? \u201d\\n\\nWhat Rami sees instead is a generation that , lacking education and real jobs , feels excluded from the possibility of ever having a voice in Swedish society . \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say , but there are so many here that are already on the wrong path , \u201d he said . \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll take for the politicians to realize that the segregation you see here -- it\u2019s a problem for all people in Sweden . Because this is our country , too.\u201d \\n\\nAN IMMIGRANT COUNTRY \\n\\nThe politician in charge of trying to solve this peculiarly Swedish puzzle -- at least until the September elections -- is Erik Ullenhag , the integration minister . Since 2006 , the Swedish government has been a center-right coalition under conservative Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt . But the 41-year-old Ullenhag is a member of the Liberal Party , and his politics on immigration don\u2019t deviate from the Swedish establishment consensus that straddles both the left and the right and argues that the country\u2019s open immigration policies should be kept in place . In 2010 , after the Swedish Democrats earned a place in parliament , the Reinfeldt government made a point of agreeing to an immigration deal with the Green Party that guaranteed just that . \\n\\n\u201cWe deal with this differently than in most other European countries , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019s about showing political leadership . Instead of adjusting our policies to the Sweden Democrats , we stand up for being open and tolerant . We\u2019re a small and rich country ; we should take our share of responsibility in the world . And we think that if people who come here get jobs and become part of Swedish society , there is a lot of support for the idea that people should be able to continue coming to Sweden.\u201d \\n\\nUllenhag points to surveys showing that Swedes have become more positively inclined toward immigration in the past decade . And he insists that , in the medium term , there are clear economic benefits to immigration . \u201cIn 20 to 25 years , I think we will see a situation where this openness has been very good for Sweden , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019ll make us stronger in this globalized world.\u201d \\n\\nBut he admits that there are challenges -- above all , with education and jobs . \u201cThe big integration challenge is that too few of the recently arrived have jobs . And it\u2019s true that a lot of the simpler jobs have disappeared from the labor market in the past few decades . But we think other sectors , like the service sector , can fill these gaps.\u201d To that end , the government has put in place a number of reforms to ease entry to the job market -- Ullenhag points to tax subsidies to domestic services and a focus on vocational training in school . But so far , they don\u2019t seem to have put a serious dent in the high unemployment numbers.\\n\\nBut economics aside , Ullenhag admits that Swedish society will have a problem as long as Swedish citizens don\u2019t recognize that they need to alter their own sense of national identity . \u201cSweden is an immigrant country today , as much as the United States or Canada , \u201d he said . \u201cBut have we gotten used to it yet ? No , not really . This is still a country where many people who were born here identify themselves as immigrants . Which means you\u2019re not really part of society . That\u2019s the big challenge . We have to get better at coming together around a common future -- instead of focusing on where your mom and dad were born.\u201d",Uralic,Estonian

Imagine if a non-white person started drawing white-haired and blue-eyed school shooters , doing the Hitler salute on a pile of school children , but saying it\\ 's a depiction of Jesus ? There\\ 's a clear connection between this depiction of Jesus and the racist stereotype that white people are white supremacists , and love to do school shootings . The argument however can be turned over by just saying \ '' Oh hey , it\\ 's not a racist stereotype , just a depiction of Jesus ! \ '' . Granted , seeing as most white people are not that religious anymore , it wouldn\\'t work that well , but the point remains . Just the same as there is a clear connection between their depictions of Muhammad and modern day muslims . \\n\\nThe pictures vary , some are racist ( against Arabs ) and some are chauvinistic/fascist/whatever you might call it ( against all Muslims ) . Most of the arguments in favor of the cartoons get stuck arguing about terminology while not really providing any evidence as to why the caricatures are not inflammatory against a certain group of people , which they most certainly are.\\n\\nAlso , I find that most of their stuff is not racist/fascist/chauvinist or whatever you call it , I have issues with some of their caricatures .",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,I think that this might become the longest trade negotiation in the history of mankind because as you mentioned all 27 countries have their own interests and everyone wants to get best for their country . I also think that UK will get a rude awakening when they discover that negotiations between UK and EU are not negotiations between equal partners and that they have to concede more ( simply because EU & gt ; UK ) .

Heinsz7,europe,Eastern and Central European defense industries could offer something if they got more funding as well .

Heinsz7,europe,But Google does a lot more than just Google search so can you tax the entire profit ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I am not sure if it is America overspending or Europe underspending . European defense expenditures are at historical lowpoint at the moment .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Depends . I think when it comes to security and strategic interests there is more common with Poland than Germany .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Yes but not all advertising is in the same place . When you want to tax them by number of searches made you can logically tax them only for ads that are shown on Google search not in Youtube for example .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I could understand taxing company for something when I give them my money and get something in return . But this is not the case with data because data has no value itself .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,The fact that there are no sanctions on the energy sector shows that the sanctions are not serious but just a face saving project because Europe had to do something about Ukraine .

Heinsz7,europe,They are definitely brutal to look at and live in I imagine .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,The entire European Union renewable energy is half-arsed and doesn\\'t make any sense to be honest . Eventhough this sub posts lots about solar and wind power the fact is that most of the \ '' renewable energy\ '' in the European Union comes from burning wood ( pellets made from wood ) . I mean this worse than burning coal but at least we can feel good about ourselves . I\\ 'd like to see some real efforts instead of playing around with statistics .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It does increase CO2 levels in the short term ( 10-20 year perspective ) because removing the CO2 will take longer time than releasing it into the environment because another tree takes a long time to grow - a lot longer than burning it in seconds . Also by burning trees you reduce the amount of CO2 than trees can remove from the environment because there will be less trees.\\nFor the same amount of energy burning a tree releases more CO2 in to the environment than coal.\\n\\nBurning wood is not the sustainable solution because think about what happened if the whole world started to burn wood as its main renewable energy source . It would be catastrophic for the environment which ironicaly is the thing we want to save right now.\\nEuropean Union has acknowledged that burning wood is a loophole in the requirements and they will fix it eventually but it will take time because it will mess up all the renewable energy goals if they do it too soon.\\n\\nEDIT : World already has a deforestation problem as well so burning them for energy instead of coal is the last thing we should do .

Heinsz7,europe,Russia is like one of the biggest threats to EU memberstates ( many of them ) so the HQ can\\'t be in a random European Union state . Maybe Germany because it is in a central position of the EU . But unless EU \ '' military\ '' does nothing about Russia threat then it is a pointless thing that serves interests of only half of the Europe.\\n\\nEDIT : Also who cares what Russia thinks about it . I mean are we more concerned about building a united military that can defend all memberstates or caring about Russias feelings . Russia doesn\\'t give a sh*t about what their enemies think about them and neither does USA but we in Europe are concerned about feelings and sensitivities of our potential enemies ( I don\\'t mean USA as a potential enemy ) .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,But there are countries like Sweden who have budget surplus and are having very good economic growth which means that budget deficits are not necessary for economic growth .

Heinsz7,europe,I have lost all my faith in the so called \ '' proper fiscal unification of the Eurozone\ '' because there are too many countries that don\\'t care about 3 % budget deficit and 60 % of GDP debt limits . \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t force Germany so much because it is starting to look like blackmailing in my opinion . Forcing Germany too much might break the current EU but it might not be bad after all . Maybe Northern European countries can make some kind of a trade and economic union with Germany in that case - because Northern European countries tend to have same views as Germany when it comes to economic and fiscal policies .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,You can use it faster than forests are growing . The reason why this is even viable option right now is that only Europe is burning trees for energy on such scale but imagine what would happen if the entire world started doing so .

And it gives you spike because all the CO2 that tree has collected over the decades will be released in just seconds . \\nBurning trees is green as long as tree grows in 1s and removes the CO2 that has been released as fast as it was burnt - impossible .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Russia does care about Baltics because Russia can\\'t accept the fact that they have no control over Baltic countries eventhough they see Baltic countries as part of their \ '' near abroad\ '' .

Spending efficiently is just a buzzword because it is not a new termin and everytime countries cut their military spending they say something about \ '' it\\ 's not how much you spend but how you spend\ '' \ '' more efficiency is the key\ '' but in reality military capabilites have deteriorated . There is no substitute to money . I am more than sure enough that joint EU defense policy will be used as an excuse to cut spending even more.\\n\\nEDIT : Sorry about multiple posts everybody .

Heinsz7,europe,Considering how Russia talks constantly about how they are encircled by the world and that someone will try to attack them at any moment then I am not sure about who is really paranoid .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,My media is not saying that and I talked about how situation was when we had to send aid to Greece . Estonian pensions were then about 300 euros and now they are approaching 400 euros so you can see the difference . Also our unemployment benefits are around 120 euros a month which is clearly a lot less . You can understand from these facts why people were angry .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,"I\\ 'd like to improve Eurozone and I would not be against closer fiscal union but this would mean that we would have to implement very strict rules when it comes to budget deficits , public spending and everything fiscally related because countries would be a lot more dependent on others than they are now . This would also mean there there have to be punishments so if a country breaks even one rule then they should be thrown out immediately.\\n\\nAlso we can clearly see that European Union is going to move into direction where bigger countries get more power and smaller countries get less say than they have now . As you said \ '' tough luck because you are small\ '' indeed . I can say tough luck as well - can\\'t compete with Germany ?

Heinsz7,europe,Germany is keep struggling countriea alive . If Germany leaves eurozone then I think most of the countries that have high debt and budget deficits would go bankrupt immediately because try loaning money with high interest rates . Germany does want to fix eurozone bur instead of throwing cash at the problem that makes the problem go away for a year or few they want to make sure that problems like this can never happen again . No one is entitled to Germanys money and if Germany gives it to other countries then Germany has right to set its conditions .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I think it seems a non-issue as well especially when thinking about future . Some people always talk about how we need basic income because robots are going to take most of our jobs and then some people say that we need more immigrants to do the jobs .

Heinsz7,europe,I had no idea that we have place like this in Estonia . Besides trees it looks all so different.I wonder if it during flood or something .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Many people speak German natively outside of Germany as well . For example in Austria .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Good point . Also I would add that the problem with current immigration policy is that it overlooks the problem that the new immigrants will also get old one day and somebody has to take care of them as well . It is possible that they will start inviting more immigrants from 3rd world countries to take care of them as well . So immigration only offers short term solutions and postpones problems but makes the problems even worse in the long term .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,It might be possible that I am biased as well because for example in Estonia and Latvia goverments imposed harsh austerity as soon as the crisis started which cut wages and goverment spending a lot . Also there were tax increases on people too . But it worked out well for us and now our countries have recovered and are doing well . I think that with austerity there is no middle ground - you do it or not - and in my opinion many countries that are struggling right now were initally too hesitant and wanted to make it gradually or spend their way out of it unsuccessfully .,Uralic,Estonian

Children , young and older , were offered musical entertainment by Taulide family band . Some of the posters had visible spelling errors , and fought over , some were written in uprintable expressions . People were brought to protest by bus free of charge - from every county.\\n\\nAfter greeting speeches both in estonian and Russian , Laikre Raimondo began singing , who praised the people - all those who stand for family values\\u200b\\u200b . For the wellfare of Russian-speaking people , Raimondo also sang in Russian.\\n\\nSubsequently , a spiritual Vello Salo came on stage , who read out a poem by Henrik Visnapuu.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaid SAPTK leader told the people that , because the politicians have remained deaf ears , thus the people protecting the traditional family had come to protest the Toompea . Cohabitation Law Adoption would actually be one step closer to gay marriage rights , he said . The adoption of the Law would affect all of us - families would be lumped together with gay relationship and It\\ 's unacceptable to Estonia society.\\n\\nWe assure that druing the parliament election time we will constantly remind people of who are the politicians who voted for the act , he said.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaiu\\ 's speech was interrupted continuously by cheers and applause .\\n\\nSAPTK Vooglaid Varro\\ 's CEO , said that the protest is the last chance for citizens to resist the union\\ 's efforts to push through a law against the will of the people and the family , and fundamentally reshape the meaning of marriage.\\n\\n\ '' This is our land and our country , where the people have supreme power .

Huehue777,europe,"& gt ; Nevertheless , I wouldn\\'t call Philip II \ '' incredibly wise and able\ '' : he certainly wasn\\'t the bloodthirsty , incestuous monster his Protestant enemies liked to picture him , just a narrow-minded bureaucrat who would probably have been far happier rubber-stamping documents in some minor public administration than being the absolute ruler of a world empire.\\n\\nWell he did possess a lot of good personal qualities , he was imo very smart , already when he was extremely young he knew a lot about politics and was tutored very well . \\n\\nHe became the regent of Spain already at 16 and in general he was good imo at keeping peace in places where there were no religious conflicts . He was also very just/fair and didn\\'t seem to abuse his power for personal gain , he was kind of happy with what he got and tried to take good care of it . \\n\\nMost monarchs , on the other hand , had a lot of really bad qualities if you read history and did a lot of really bad things , the fact he didn\\'t really have any bad qualities is great in itself ( this is why I liked Isabella and Philippe II a lot , it is great to read about people who have almost absolute power yet use it very well ) .\\n\\nIn terms of religious conflicts I agree that since he was a very devout Catholic he spent a lot of time trying to keep all his dominions under Catholicism , which was a mistake , since it was just delaying the inevitable , but this is not necessarily because of political reasons , but he genuinely believed Catholicism was the only true Christian religion.\\n\\nIn general both Isabel and Philippe were both very religious and did probably both go too far with their enforcement of it to their lands ( I\\ 'd say a major mistake for Isabel was also the enabling of the Inquisition , even though she didn\\'t really even support it , but rather everyone else around her were able to talk her into it and it seemed like a good idea to consolidate the monarchy ) .\\n\\nHowever , the flip side of it is that Spain stayed away from religious conflicts that plagued a lot of other Christian kingdoms of the time and thus was able to be a stronghold in terms of defending the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and expanding overseas .",Uralic,Estonian

Huehue777,europe,"1 ) Economies between many Western and Eastern EU countries is almost the same in purchasing power parity\\n\\n2 ) By this time EU has scrapped or heavily limited the amount of refugees it takes in . Many countries found out the hard way that it is extremely hard to integrate people from 3rd world muslim failed states . \\n\\nThis is why most Western/Nordic EU countries have a lot of American-style segregated societies/ghettos , filled with crime , unemployment , use of Arabic as main language , religious extremism and a deep hatred toward the native people.\\n\\nHowever immigration both illegal and legal will stay strong from African/Middle Eastern countries as migrants will continue to figure out different ways to get to EU , as Europe\\ 's standard of living will still continue to be so much higher than anywhere else around it.\\n\\n3 ) UK left the EU , some other countries considered leaving as well , but since there were no more referendums it didn\\'t happen . After the refugee crisis was solved and after another economic/debt crisis there was a time of stability , in which EU develops once more toward a federation , with the creation of an EU army as a major step forward.\\n\\n4 ) Since the economic differences were reduced between East and West , and since open borders have diminished the differences between EU people , there is more of a common sense of unity and it is now very common for Europeans to live/work/study in different EU countries and more people will begin to feel like \ '' Europeans\ '' in addition to their national identity.\\n\\n4 ) In Russia at one point Putin loses his power for one reason or the other , which creates massive chaos in the country , as there will be a huge struggle for power between the United Russia old guard , the oligarchs , the nationalists , the democracy-activists , the various regional separatists ( especially Chechnya and other Caucus muslim countries who will use this to break free from Russia ) and the communists . \\n\\nThis is why things turn from bad to worse in Russia and since Putin had destroyed virtually all democratic institutions there will be a major downfall in the economy and the overall functioning of the state . In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately . Also Turkey has become a bit more democratic , but is still very far away from joining EU.\\n\\n6 ) Estonia will be a very successful country by 2026 and its various start-ups have become quite big and well-known . Also , the 0 % corporate tax rate and the e-residency brought a lot of new companies ( +money ) and also immigrants to Estonia , which has helped push Estonia to have a very high GDP per capita PPP and in terms of quality of life it is on par or higher than other Western EU countries . Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia .

First off , it is difficult to understand , as to whether feminists even think that women should be having sex in the first place , because according to them it is an act in which the man is in a dominant position and a women in a submissive position , so the act must be frowned upon , probably at least according to some of the 3rd wave feminists.\\n\\nOK , whatever the feminist logic is toward sex , then comes the issue of when a woman is having sex on her free will . Well , the feminists can\\'t really stop that I guess , since most women actually love to have sex and find great pleasure from it . Yet , for some reason , if both people have decided on their free will that they want to have sex , it is OK , but if the man decides to gives some money for a mutual decision to have sex ( trafficking is illegal anyway everywhere in Europe and large social safety nets provide everyone with minimum living standards ) , then the man suddenly becomes a criminal ? ! \\n\\nI mean you can\\'t make this up and it is mind-boggling even to try to get into the brains of the 3rd wave feminists , but the logic seems to be getting lost somewhere here.\\n\\nIt is kind of the same as with the whole Gamergate thing imo .

If nobody else on here will say it , I will : as far as Hungary is concerned , 9 out of 10 cases of violent crimes are committed by Roma people .

100courics,europe,"Haha no , nothing of the sort . Russia does want Hungary out of the EU .

Only three or four years later did it get hijacked by what would become its current leadership . \\n\\nThe Jobbik leadership is more stupid than malevolent ( not that it absolves them of anything ) . They get money from Russia because they think Russia will help Hungary become a truly-sovereign nation by separating it from the EU . Not once has it turned up in their minds that Russia would then just engulf Hungary . They believe Hungary can get by in the 21st century without picking teams , like Switzerland and Austria . Now if we could just achieve their credit ratings ... .\\n\\nThe point is , nobody aside from them stands for that . The overwhelming majority of Hungarians still can\\'t stand Russia - not only for what they did to us , but also for what they did in the war with the Poles for example . Jobbik will either acclimate itself to moderation or will ultimately remain a party on the periphery.\\n\\nWe have three national holidays , two of which have to do with fighting against Russians ( one of them only indirectly - the Austrians were the main antagonists of that one ) . Nobody aside from these insane fucks wants to have anything to do with Russia . However , I should also include the current PM in the group , \ '' insane fucks\ '' .

100courics,europe,"I think it\\ 's important to highlight the context of EU-US relations . Last time the US was like , \ '' fuck off , Yurop , it\\ 's not my problem , \ '' the Second World War happened . Yes the world loves to go like , \ '' USA blows this , USA sucks that ... \ '' but it most likely would\\ 've been an even more horrific place right now , had the US not bothered - of course this is hypothetical . However , one of the habits the US has is to stick around after the invasion to make sure the procedure was worth its time , which is a fair demand.\\n\\nSince the War , however , the US has been locked into its self-created role of World Police . Ukraine is a member of the Partnership for Peace program of NATO . The program itself is more symbolic than practical - let alone binding - but it shows that NATO member states ( notably the US ) began placing interest in the given state . Thus , while NATO is officially merely a mutual defense pact , becoming a partner of it has many more effects in the long run . Thus , while a full-scale invasion wouldn\\'t be justified in terms of NATO use , the US may just judge the situation as it did 60 years ago : I either help them now , or will have to invade them in ten years because they\\ 'll be overrun.\\n\\nThe love-hate analogy is partially true , but most Europeans subconsciously HAVE to be happy about NATO membership because , if they weren\\'t , nothing would keep them from being next on Russia\\ 's hitlist . It\\ 's very easy to complain about the US when it does something immoral like Iraq or Afghanistan . But it\\ 's only so easy for ( western in some cases ) Europeans because they had the pillow known as the US to land on when they fell for decades now . But that also allows the US to maximize its efficiency by spying on them if need be . As history shows us , it\\ 's not exactly without reason .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,europe,"& gt ; the argument 4oo mouths costs more than 200 is primitive and populist\\n\\nI\\ 'm not sure you know what populism means . But yes , it\\ 's primitive because , in it\\ 's current state , the Hungarian parliament is primitive . MPs walk in and out as they please , read Blikk instead of paying attention to potentially state-altering topics , and charge the podium with stupid signs whenever something is happening that they don\\'t approve of . So yes , it\\ 's primitive . It\\ 's primitive , but fitting.\\n\\n & gt ; Look after the election of to how many people actually voted for them and rethink my \ '' rape\ '' metaphor.\\n\\nOkay , I\\ 'm going to address this now so that people whining about the next election will shut up and vote against Fidesz if they want them out of power . Believe it or not , Fidesz is still the most popular party in the country . Month after month , year after year since 2010 , none of the other parties come remotely close to Fidesz in polls , regardless which source is used ( Median , Szazadveg , Nezopont , Ipsos etc ) . To my knowledge , the leftist Unity coalition is launching candidates in every single one of the individual voting district . This means that they can achieve victory by plurality in 106 out of the 106 districts . Jobbik is also launching candidates in every district . I\\ 'm not sure about LMP . The point is that , if the people will it , then Fidesz will be voted out of power . You can\\'t just claim that an election is rigged just because the party you don\\'t like is ( relatively speaking ) the most popular . I hate Fidesz , but the argument saying that the elections will be rigged is ridiculous . \\n\\nFinally , \\n\\n & gt ; Opposers of the goverment will be accused of lack of patriotism and silenced\\n\\nIs this a serious statement ? Not a single day goes by without 50-100 people gathering somewhere in Budapest to protest something the government is doing . About once a month , the entire leftist coalition sponsors a protest with a few thousand people ( ~20,000 was the largest one to my knowledge ) . Leftist papers inside and outside the country are hammering the government . None of the leftist activist or politicians have been imprisoned ( to the despair of many Hungarians ) . \\n\\nYes , Fidesz is full of incompetent fools , but they are a democratically elected government who can be democratically disposed of this year , should the people will it . And if they aren\\'t , then stop being a sore loser and acknowledge that still more people prefer Fidesz than any other party .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,europe,"An efficient military MUST have a strict system of hierarchy . The EU was founded on voluntary ideas , far from establishing a common military . The closest it has is the Common Foreign/Security Policy and a handful of donated battlegroups ( a few hundred or thousand soldiers in each ) . However , nothing in the treaty authorizes either the EP or EC in establishing and maintaining a common military OR declaring war/making peace . \\n\\nI my opinion , this is because there is still a great deal of animosity between several member states , notably in the eastern half of the EU . How would the EU set up guidelines for when conflict ( hopefully never will be a case , but still ) arises between EU member states ? Member states joined voluntarily , but up til today , there was no clause in their joining saying they will be invaded by an EU contingent if they start a conflict with another state . The problem would be that who could determine which side has the moral right in the conflict ? \\n\\nAlso , almost all EU states are in NATO . As EU member states - with the exception of the UK - have shown over the past twenty years , they are still disproportionately reliant on the US as far as military \ '' field trips\ '' are concerned . This is a problem the EU has had since its inception : to be able to use military force , the Union would have to have the courage of adapting aggressive foreign policies when needed . The US is the best example for this : the US does not give a rat\\ 's ass who\\ 's going to give it the death stare for invading another country if it feels it has to be done to protect its interests . Now , regardless of the moral argument surrounding that , the US can order hundreds of thousands of soldiers to any point of the world because it is efficient . EU member states often have different positions on foreign policy issues . Thus , if a conflict arises in non-EU territory , some states may be much more reluctant to \ '' go in\ '' than others . Look at the NATO part of ISAF in AFghanistan : 34,000 American troops , and the next is the UK with 5,000 . It goes much further down after that . NATO is still almost all-US effort . Therefore , if the EU is to establish a united military , it has to engrave the idea of potential mass casualties to a state\\ 's military force into each member state\\ 's brain . That\\ 's a burden which has been carried by the US since the Second World War , but will have to be re-assumed by the EU states . A difficult sell , to say the least.\\n\\nReasons for the army : \\n\\nThe world will continue to treat the EU like a child until it has a functioning military .

Aylomein,europe,"oh dont worry , they know what they are doing , saying this tax would give policemen a raise ... just as if he wants to make police and people collide ... they obviously asked MANY people before about what they think in this topic.\\n\\nso my conclusion is , this whole idiot idea is just to make people forget that USA banned several high ranked officials from entering the country due to heavy corruptional cases . all officials were close to the current government leading party ( Fidesz , Orb\u00e1n ) . \\n\\nwhat will happen is they will keep on saying stupid shit about internet and taxing and in a month they obviously will backpedal from it so meanwhile people forget this USA incident while fighting with police ... because internet tax pisses off EVERYONE ... . except police since they get the raise from it.. what a coincidence .",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see you are from Scotland , of course you can decide if it is good for you or not by voting , but what he said is definitely only manipulation , and who do you think will be the leading politician in new scotland after the Yes campaign ? but let me highlight it : \\n\\n0-20 is pure demagogue , UK has ways and rules to deal with those , hundreds/thousands of well educated people made those rules , and you can change them WITHIN the UK system , you have political power , you can send in proposals ( sorry im not native speaker so i don\\'t know specific words , and maybe it is not the correct word here ) which the government will change if it is for the better . he is talking about weapons , but you need weapons to protect yourself . he is talking about poor and disabled which is only brought up to convince people through emotions . what can he do better in scotland what UK can\\'t do about the poor ? nobody in the world in 5000 years had a perfect plan to eliminate the problem with poors/disabled ( \ '' eliminate\ '' as making them not poor , not \ '' killing\ '' them ) . he is promising more money by eliminating taxes , or giving more to welfare . of course everyone can promise you that , but money isn\\'T produced on trees , he should be talking about from where he would take the money away so he could give to the poor and disabled . but he just talks about poor and disabled.\\n\\n0:45 he says again demagogue , logical fallacies . saying opponents say \ '' abundant oil is a curse instead of an asset.\ '' ... nobody in the world would say something like that , it is an obvious lie and manipulation . i dont have to be scottish to know the epic lie he is making.\\n\\n1:10 as soon as the guy is talking about concrete proof , evidence , about his published paper being shit , he keeps smiling and making movements like a shrug , interrupting him softly many times . all implying the same thing : that the other party is lying and it is not like that . this is a manipulative tactic . ( unless of course the other party is truly lying , but making up a lie this huge about a public paper which EVERYONE can check would be too risky to lie about ) \\n\\ni dont know what he answered to this guy but i don\\'t have to , since i know it already , ive seen this behaviour in action many times , he would answer with another logical fallacy , either saying the other guy made some errors as well , or he would say it is completely wrong and this is more complicated matter and he is trying to simplify it , or he would just grab one little thing from the other\\ 's speech and react to that . if you\\ 've seen the whole you can probably see im right , else i apologize for my speculation , but nonetheless , further proofs without speculations : \\n\\n1:40 about whats best for scotland , well , nothing to criticize but it is just an empty speech , this speech could have been said by anyone in the world about anything in any given time . but interesting thing starts here : \\n\\n2:00 glasses guy asks about his plan B if some thing doesn\\'t work out as he planned . again he is stating proofs that his questions wasn\\'t answered before . of course salmond again keeps interrupting him and smiling as if saying : \ '' completely not true , bullshit\ '' , yet doesn\\'t answer it . talks about debts , i dont know about those since im not familiar with politics in scotland . but saying something like if UK takes assets he is responsible paying it back not scotland is probably very simple and not how it works , but honestly i dont know how it works in that situation . but what annoys me is his figure of speech simplifying the problem so much . i would say about governmental matters , problems are never that easy , you have to follow contracts , procedures 99 % of the time.\\n\\n4:20 glass guy even said he lied about hospitals , making a scare campaign , of course our salmond shrugs it off as funny . if glass guy would lie he should be furious and not shrugging it off as funny . what is funny about it when you are called a liar ? infuriating.\\n\\n5:00 again question about plan B. again shrugs it off as funny . how is this funny , why doesn\\'t he answer the question ? looking \ '' cool\ '' and confident can convince the masses , but just proves he is using demagogue tactics and lies.\\n\\n5:20 can\\'t answer AGAIN the question , so who he brings up ? 100.000 people with disability SUFFERING from the government ? really ? how are you suffering in fucking scotland with GDP Per capita $ 44,378 . obvious lies to manipulate the emotions of people . if you think the government is unjust , you can send in a proposal to the government and if it is good they will vote about it . or does he think people in government hate disabled people with a passion and want them to suffer ? this is not africa . he is clearly using scare tactics as the glasses guy stated before.\\n\\nat 5:40 i cant even understand what he is asking due to accent , but regardless he is asking about how much money something cost . now if a politician brings this up , you know he is a scumbag lying shit . each and every one of them who brings this up like this is the worst manipulator . because you will know the number of whatever he asks in a government scale is gon na be billions , yet of course he doesn\\'t put into perspective , like what is the budget , why the money is needed what is it spent on etc , he just asks for the number , typical manipulation . if you really think you are right about it then you should put it into perspective for people who don\\'t see billions thrown left and right so people could actually understand the numbers . but of course he doesn\\'T do it , he doesn\\'t even let the glasses guy answer properly and just asks for the number.\\n\\nagain 6:00 i dont even understand the second half of what he says , but saying 100.000 poor CHILDREN and he is spending X number of money on something and can\\'t name some job shit is a logical fallacy again.\\n\\nedit : if you don\\'t understand one point pls ask , im not a native speaker and i tried to be short about these since for me these are obvious but if you still don\\'t see it i either was too short about why i think those or i badly phrased it . but : \\n\\n**TLDR : ** im not saying either YES-NO choice is bad , but he is definitely using scare tactics and manipulation through emotions and not through logic . and for him this is just a way to gain more popularity . especially if people vote YES",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see , i was probably wrong in some of my accusations , but i feel like you are trying to convince me why voting YES is good . i never said it is wrong to vote YES , i don\\'t know at all which is good for scotland , but from the things you said , voting YES seems pretty logical . \\n\\nyet my problem was with HOW Salmond presented that choice , not with WHAT he represented . you had sound reasoning behind what you said , that UK is right wing and scotland is left wing . uk wants nuclear weapons , scotland doesn\\'t . this is all there is to it in every topic , but Salmond was never really arguing about this but rather about emotion manipulation , let me respond to some things you said in regards to this : \\n\\n & gt ; tax on empty bedrooms , introduced by the UK government . The Scottish people and government thought it was unfair on the poor who are often assigned houses with more rooms than they might use . \\n\\nwell , tax on empty bedrooms really mostly tax the richer people , the poor who have bigger assigned houses are probably very few , and this could be easily changed within the UK system , if someone wants a smaller house he can change it with other who wanted a bigger house , i dont remember anytime in the history when somebody wanted LESS and he didn\\'t get it . problem is when you want more , not less . so it is strange to me this is a problem to begin with . \\n\\nbut basic political tactic is to always talk about every type of tax you can find , tax is the best way to convince people as a politician during a time of peace to vote for you . most political parties say they will decrease a tax ( for example eliminate the empty bedroom tax , or give more welfare money ) but of course with this the state loses money , these taxes weren\\'t introduced ( most of the time ) just for fun or for politicians to get more money in their pockets . every politician knows if you make a new tax , people will hate you . so they try to avoid increasing tax as they avoid fire . so introducing any new tax or increasing income tax is only done if the state needs money for something . so back to the point , many politicians say they eliminate/decrease said tax , and they WILL keep their promise to not seem 2faced , but soon new taxes with different names will come , because they somehow will have to solve the now deficit in the budget . maybe he will give more welfare and delete empty bedroom tax but will make a new tax for people with cars , and we could again hear reasoning that this law is bad for poor people who are assigned cars etc . taxes are there for a purpose , it is used to build the country and pay people working for the state so it actually gets back to people . ( even if a politican would steal 10million euros from it , that is such a small number compared to yearly budget that it won\\'t be even the 0,1 % of budget and will be unnoticed ) . what im trying to say is , saying that taxes need to be decreased or eliminated is pure political trickery , if you want a different approach to it you should say from where you want to make the money for it . here at least he said that the money will come from Trident , but he didn\\'t say he would use the money from it to solve the deficit from taxes , but rather said it is to use it for poor children and disableds . i don\\'t know the numbers since they never really talk about it ( or maybe they did in the full debate ) , but changing seemingly little things about taxes result in billions . but nonetheless this is an actual point he makes that he wants to stop trident . ( problem is , public safety probably shouldn\\'t be up for vote and the way should be chosen by military professionals . but of course i don\\'t know anything about this matter , but seeing russia\\ 's behaviour about ukraine , maybe this is not the best time to demilitarize . weapons are not for only attacking other nations , but rather as a deterrent to not get attacked randomly ) \\n\\n & gt ; 0:45\\nI don\\'t know how familiar you are with the campaigns , but the opposite side has been saying that oil revenues were too unstable to be relied upon or counted upon.\\n\\ni dont know who is right but doesn\\'t matter , he still on purpose exaggerated . not to mention things like these should be NOT debatable , this could be proved by professionals in the field if there really is oil shortage or not , economic things should never be put up to a vote , but decided by skilled people . only basic policies could be voted , like environmental friendliness etc.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; In the full debate , a few minutes earlier he gets to speak on oil a little . Making the case that Norway has 20 % of it\\ 's GDP as oil revenue , Scotland would have 15 % , So unless people consider Norway unstable , Scotland couldn\\'t be either.\\n\\nagain these things should not be debatable , 1 wrong doesn\\'t make 2 right . these should be proved by data and not \ '' common sense\ '' . and there could be a million difference between these 2 countries as to why it is more liability for scotland and not for norway . i dont know if any parties showed data about their choice , but they should . and until they do , talking about is only trying to make the other look dumb , which is again not a honest direct way of politics , but manipulation.\\n\\n & gt ; What the SNP propose is that we accept some debt for a proportional amount of the national assets\\n\\nseems fair , i completely agree , but things are usually more complicated , i would probably need to hear the other side\\ 's argument , because there could be many scenarios theoretically where it doesn\\'t work like that from pure materialistic perspective.\\n\\nfor example ( this is total fiction ) UK borrowed a lot of money so in 4 years they can invest in scotland farmlands because it is perfect place for it , and in 15 years the money could be paid back . now if scotland gets autonomy before they even start to build farmlands , yet they already borrowed the money , they are in a shitty situation especially if they made some prearrangements in contracts/spendings , with this , scotland has no asset so he wouldn\\'t have to pay any debt , yet it doesn\\'t seem fair does it if he doesn\\'t help paying back the money ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; 4:20 : Hospitals being mentioned are due to cost cutting in England.\\nScotland\\ 's budget is decided in part by how much England spends on Hospitals , so if they spend less , we have less to spend on our own services.\\n\\ni dont know the situation but my problem was that he was accused of lying publicly about it , yet he just laughed it off , sadly we can\\'t see his response , but seemed like there is no real response to that , because when you actually accuse someone of lying publicly , you have to have proofs else you could go to court for defamation . ( as far as i know , but maybe scottish laws are different ) \\n\\n & gt ; 6:00 He\\ 's talking about how the opposition are spending a lot on nuclear weapons when we as a country have rising child poverty rates.\\n\\nwell , i don\\'t even understand the concept of his , how can a child be poor , every child is poor until they start working . but nonetheless , UK policy is of course the same as scotland\\ 's would be in that regard , that they wouldn\\'t allow death by hunger . every democratic country in europe will try to solve things like that , so phrasing it like this is just exaggeration again . saying poor innocents ( children/disabled ) is always a good way to win over people.\\n\\nmost of the other things you wrote i agree with that i was too quick to judge . ( or in some i can not prove it logically just have bad feeling about his \ '' manipulative\ '' body language and speech , but those are all very subjective )",Uralic,Hungarian

Executioner1337,europe,"Translation TL ; DR : \\n\\n & gt ; We have addressed before in April the pedestrian-biker bridge costing 400M Forints ( 1.3M Euros ) planned for the summer water world championships . Our readers weren\\'t convinced with BKK\\ 's ( Budapest K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si K\u00f6zpont , Budapest Transportation Centre ) reasoning , and that the existing bridge only 300 meters away would justify a new pedestrian-biker overpass on R\u00e1kospatak , between Dag\u00e1ly ( the swimming pool ) and its car park.\\n\\n & gt ; But how mindful are the organizers that they thought about people reaching their cars with bikes . \\nIn April we wouldn\\'t have imagined that the 424M Forints wouldn\\'t be enough . Neither that the super expensively earned contract because of the short time frame would be extended with three months . \\n**That means that the works could be delayed up to October , while the water world championship is held in July , according to the contract . ** \\n\\n & gt ; The structure arcing above the flowing R\u00e1kos-patak cost 424M Forints gross at the time of signing the contract , and it included the implementation and everything else ( planning , technical inspection , fees , reserves ) . Now 20M Forints net can be added ( 25.4M Forints gross ) to this , since the 309M Forints dedicated to the implementation now increased to 329M Forints ( net ) according to the modification on Monday . \\nThe price increase is really only a drop in the sea of billions for the water world championship , but its rationale is beautiful . \\n\\n & gt ; The price increase was justified by *a set of unforeseen things* , which lead to the increase of cost of the bridge . \\n\\n & gt ; But the modification of the deadline is even more surprising . The work of art was the symbol of the water world championship even without its increase of cost with its complete pointlessness and its overpriced cost . But that it won\\'t even have to be finished to the world championship ? ! \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' The implementation works are according to the schedule , the facility will be finished before the start of the FINA world championship.\ '' \\nUnless if it doesn\\'t , the already existing bridge being 300 meters away can be used to approach the parked cars . It isn\\'t a big distance , especially on wheels .",Uralic,Hungarian

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,good luck getting the trains in Hungary now . Railway lines will be [ closed ] ( http : //kep.cdn.index.hu/1/0/1017/10172/101729/10172944_98b910f93fec69994e0a7c31f1e22640_wm.jpg ) too .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,hard to understand a single sentence ? got ta love the american education,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Far-right Orb\u00e1n ? Fidesz is a centre-right party . Also jobbik went through major changes so I wouldnt even call them far-right , just a ring-wing party .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,by that logic usa as a former colony has no right to say anything,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Difference is we registered a good percentage of them . While Croatia collapsed in 2 days and gave up enforcing any laws , they just mass transport everyone to us .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Being against illegal immigrants doesnt make you a far right nazi . Fidesz is a christian centre-right party and being against immigration is a perfectly fine stance for a conservative party .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,The fence will be completed at the Hungarian-Croatian border soon . Get ready Slovenia .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They fucked up real hard . They entered Hungary with a train full of migrants and police . This is basically an invade . If they just want to get rid of them they should have done what Serbia is doing . Just transport them to the border then let them walk through .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Puppet states , they are too afraid to act alone so they just follow Germany like a good dog .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"The main point was that a guy said Orb\u00e1n is far-right which I corrected that he isnt.\\n\\nHe doesnt have to accept any migrants , why would he ? 90 % of us hungarians also doesnt want any . We have enough problems on our own we really dont need migrants who dont speak our language and also refuse to integrate . You can call us selfish for that but honestly we couldnt care less , if other countries like Germany , France wants them they can do freely whatever they want but dont force us .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They dont take any illegal migrant in they only take actually verified refugees . The fence only stops illegal migrants so whole europe should be glad it got built . It seems like it really bothers you that sovereign countries can decide on their own if they want migrants or not . I honestly dont care if Germany takes in 1+ million , its their problem .",Uralic,Hungarian

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,\ '' They are people and we need to help them\ '' \\nWill you say the same when millions will come ? They will too demand things . We can\\'t and shouldn\\'t help everyone .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,its not a conspiracy theory tho . He founded and funds open society foundations also came out and said that every country should take migrants . Nothing they say in the ad is untrue .,Uralic,Hungarian

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,dae remember when Oscar & gt ; Coutinho ? ?,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,You cant do it . They dont use the official border crossings . They just travel to the border then walk through at a field . The army cant do shit since they are not allowed to shoot .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Fascist ? Fidesz was always a centre , centre-right party at max . Having common sense makes him fascist in your eyes..its just shows how much you have no idea about him . \\nCall him egoist or something atleast that would be somewhat right .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I try to understand the views of leaders like the Austrian chancellor but i just can\\'t . 5000-10000 are coming daily . A month ago it was 2000-3000 . It\\ 's clear that the numbers are increasing every day . \ '' Let all of them pass\ '' . What are they going to do when 20000 will come every day ? It\\ 's almost like they want to flood Europe with migrants with the sole purpose of changing Europe\\ 's ethnicity .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Jobbik is a principled , conservative and radically patriotic christian party . They are nationalist but not chauvinist . Unlike other parties they are not afraid of talking about the problems we are facing in Hungary . Gypsy crimes and the growing gypsy population are one of these . They reject globalism , uncontrolled immigration and also the Lisbon treaty .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"V4 countries have hundreds of years of history together . For example [ Louis I of Hungary ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_I_of_Hungary ) was a Hungarian , Polish and also Croatian king . Lot of Hungarians consider Poles as brothers .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Atleast the EU [ managed ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/UT85VRG.jpg ) to make the Hungarian-Slovak relations better .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,btw this speech is the reason why Fidesz and Orb\u00e1n won the next 2 elections so convincingly .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Our problem with Croatia is not that they are dumping the migrants at our borders . Serbia did the same since day 1 . But unlike Serbia , Croatia or atleast their government criticised us and claimed that they will handle the situation much better than us , they will enforce the EU laws and will help and register everyone . And after 2 days they totally collapsed . The fucking hypocrisy is what is annoying .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Not wanting illegal migrants with different culture and religion is not xenophobia .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,holy fuck stop with all these copycat posts,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,If he keeps his word then there is nothing wrong with representing the majority of the people . That is exactly what a politician should do .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,God bless the Slovaks and this man .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Stop implying that the rich western countries are not getting anything from the eastern countries . What about the hundreds of thousands of workers that are working and paying taxes and boosting the western countries economy ? What about the huge marketplace the western companies are getting without having to pay duty ? \\n,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Because on this issue only one view is reasonable . Whats the fucking point of relocating 160k migrants when 6000 coming daily ? Theres no sense in that . Even the migrants will not accept that . Like how they gon na accept it that some of them have to stay in Hungary , Romania while others can be in Germany , France , etc .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,idk what you guys on about . we are as free here as you are in the west . stop believing every bs,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"If you are really curious then ill tell you no i didnt vote for him . I voted for Jobbik 3 and also 7 years ago . I dont like Orban at all but calling him dictator and telling us hungarians that we are oppressed is just a fucking joke . you dont live here you have no idea whats going on here . im free to do whatever the fuck i want to do . im free to criticise them , im free to vote , to do whatever i want.\\n\\nMost of the things you listed is about corruption , and yes he and fidesz is corrupt as fuck , just as much as our last left wing government , but that doesnt mean we live in a dictatorship . He spent 8 years in the opposition and then won the elections democratically . You cant call someone a dictator just cause you dont like his policies .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,6000 coming a day and they forced countries to relocate 160k . What a genius plan LOL . I guess they will have to meet again a month later to agree on 320k ... \\n\\nThe EU can fuck off . We will hold a referendum about this 100 % .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz is democratically elected and out of 25 years they had in the national assembly they have been in the opposition for 16 years yet the far liberals label them as an authorian party . They are not any less democratic than our previous government . The fuck is wrong with the western left parties ? Slovakia has a centre-left government yet they have been pretty reasonable the whole time about the migration issue . Protecting your people and country from illegal migrants is considered a racist , far-right thing to do ? If they label Fidesz as that how the hell are they gon na call Jobbik ?",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,444.hu is an ultra liberal site so take everyting from them with a doubt .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Did Poles march into Saud Arabia and demanded shelter and welfare ?,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Because we are closer .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,\ '' we gave you money now love us\ '',Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,How can they claim to be refugees and then they aggressively force their way in . A true refugee would want to get out from a specific country and not to get into a specific country like they want now . This just shows that they are illegal migrants not refugees .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,And the one who shot it down was actually a hungarian..,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We have not been independent since then .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Yeah its hard for Greece , but instead of transporting migrants from the small islands to Athen , EU should help them deport every single one of them . After a while they will stop coming once they realize they have no chance . Australia did it with success , the EU atleast should try it.\\n",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Nationalism is the only way to preserve our history , values and culture . Without it and with uncontrolled immigration no country and nation has a future as over time you become a minority in your own country . Just look at Kosovo , that land is an ancient serb land . Ottoman rule , then shitloads of albans went there and now serbians are minority .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Where did i say that ? You are just bullshitting now .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"For what else they want to go to west ? for safety ? They were safe in Turkey , Greece , etc..",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Or in Serbia , Macedonia , Greece , Turkey..",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Just to give a serious answer for those who care : Most popular media sites in Hungary are Index , Origo , HVG , and 444.hu and they are all pushing liberal and left values.\\nDespite all this i find it amazing how most hungarians are leaning towards the right.\\n",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Then change the laws . They were made before we could even imagine a crisis like this . We have to adapt to the situation .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Sz\u00e9kelys are hungarians..,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I hope you are not serious . You should be proud to be a Hungarian .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We will build the fence till the Drava river . There are more than 4000 soldiers at the border and they are actually building it very fast like 10km/day . Btw the illegal migrants who were caught at the Hungarian-Croatian border told the police that the croatian police led them to Hungary.\\n,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,So your point is everyone who lives in Romania are romanian ? \\n,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Are you guys for real ? Comparing east GERMAN refugees to syrian ones ? They were occupied by soviets . They didnt cross over 5+ countries illegaly ( while being safe ) like the syrians . They just moved in their own country . A german had every right to live in Germany , being it west or east . Theres a reason its called Germany .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are coming from Turkey according to [ this ] ( http : //kep.cdn.index.hu/1/0/864/8645/86452/8645253_b35c23a0ab9b04a8c9446814f7e314e0_wm.jpg ) . If they cant go through Hungary they will try to go through Croatia and Slovenia .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We are saying the same.\\n\\n & gt ; would be like today syrians moving from ISIS occupied territories to safe western areas in the country\\n\\nI mean it would be like syrians from east syria moving to west syria .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I know . They do the same in Hungary . Every freaking day they chant \ '' no camp , no fingerprints\ '' . That is why EU collectively needs to help to protect Greece\\ 's borders . Send police , army , money , equipment or whatever but we need to protect the borders .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They want to get caught . EU laws doesnt allow countries to arrest anyone who claims that they are refugees . This is what happens in Hungary . They get caught , they claim they are refugees , they get registered to a refugee camp then they let them go and they can go anywhere freely . But with this wall they will be registered at Croatia and Hungary doesnt have to deal with them anymore .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I agree on the influence but not everyone shares the views with the media they read/watch . For example i read both Index and Origo but im far from the left views .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"You instantly state my comment as a bullshit just cause the media you see and listen in tv/radio says the opposite to what i said . There are two sides to everything , maybe you should read both sides and make your own conclusions .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,So their country is safe enough for women and children to stay..,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I know plenty of incidents that they caused . They plunder through agricultural land destroying the livelihood of families who own these lands . Stabbings happens quite often . Lucikly among themselves but what if one day they start attacking us . They force their ways into farms and they only leave if the police arrives . Few weeks ago they [ forced their way into a farm ] ( http : //www.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/toroczkai_egy_bevandorlo_csalad_bekoltozott_egy_tanya_udvarara/2436763/ ) where a mother with 2 childs were home alone . She was very scared but asked them to leave . They refused and she had to call the police . They are a threat and we need to protect our citizens .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I have no idea ? You are the one talking from thousands of kms away . I live near the border and have to deal with them on a daily basis . Are the hungarians who are abroad entered the countries illegaly ? Nope . But the migrants are breaking the law by illegally entering countries . They were safe in Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia . The only reason they move to west is because they want to leech on richer countries welfare . They should never get a single penny as illegal migrants .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Atleast we are doing something and the fence is scheduled to be completed before 30th of November so right now you have absolutely no idea what effect it will have . The least the fence will do is that atleast we will know where and when and how many of them entered the country .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are there legally and working and paying taxes there . The migrants are here illegally and majority of them will live off welfare .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Few hundreds in Czech Republic but thousands in other schengen countries . Just yesterday more than 2500 illegal migrants entered Hungary .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Yeah we will never accept the quota system especially when were are under heavy pressure . Just yesterday more than 3200 illegal migrants entered the country .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,its all about self control . if you are really lacking it then maybe you should consider counting calories . set a maximum amount for a day and you wont get fat for sure .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Did the mods delisted this post ? It was # 1 on front page .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"So looks like law doesnt mean anything to you . Lets just choose the easier way even if it is illegal . I actually had to deal with aggressive migrants and i even had to call the cops . In fact i have to deal with them on a daily basis cause of my job , and i also live near the border . But atleast i know why there are still some ppl who defends them . They talk from hundreds of kms away from the border like you . Oh you saw them a few times at keleti..that surely was enough to have a reasonable opinion .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Ofc the illegal way is the easier . I still dont see how can you defend them when they are breaking the law and are acting aggressively .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They are fleeing from their war torn countries . Fine , then as i said their goal should be to get out of Syria . But their goal is to get into western europe . Why dont they stay in Turkey ? They should be grateful they let them stay there and they should be happy that their lifes are not in danger anymore . They are not coming to western europe cause their life is in danger , they were safe in Turkey .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"There are hundreds of millions living in poverty . We cant help them all . People who still supports them should realize that migrants are breaking the law . They enter numerous countries illegally . You cant just go to a country illegaly and then expect people to welcome you and give you a job etc . There are millions of europeans who are unemployed . If they want a better life they should work for it . They should educate themselves , learn languages and then apply for a visa . Thats how you can enter a country legally .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Just like in every country . Russians are not more brainwashed than people in europe .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,East germans fleeing to west germany would be like today syrians moving from ISIS occupied territories to safe western areas in Syria . But they travel through several safe countries just to get better welfare .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are not horrible for having different views and values than you .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"This was in Bicske . The train was originally going to Sopron but was stopped at Bicske to get the migrants out of the train and to transport them to a refugee camp in Bicske in order to register them . This [ video ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=7L3eSbpETf8 ) was also taken there by the police , migrants refused to take any water/food and are still demanding police to let them go to Germany .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Thats why the wall is a good idea . They will get registered in Croatia now . And they WANT to get caught . They literally walk up to police in Hungary . I really doubt you know it better from Holland when im here and i know how things go .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"The train was going to Sopron , noone told them it was going to Austria . They just figured it out that Sopron is close to the border so hundreds rushed it .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,The things i said all happened . I answered your question but looks like you cant answer mine . Liberal bs media works on you it seems .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Your observations are right . Majority of them do not integrate . Thats why there are muslim and migrant districts in big european cities , especially in France and in Sweden .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Multiculturalisms does not work in a long run and yes fortunately liberals are minority in Hungary . Liberals with their policies got us into a financial crisis and the liberal government almost got us bankrupt .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are mostly in villages/towns that are near the border .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Why dont they get it only for a limited time ? Like only for a year and if they cant learn the language and find a job in that time they would get deported . With the current system they have no reason to integrate and to get a job .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Exactly . If we let them stay here permanently its like we allow them to take our land . Like a modern conquest .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I could ask the same . How can you support them ? They are not refugees , there are no wars , they just want welfare , and no i dont want them to get paid from my taxes . But if you like them so much , why dont you share your home with few of them ? Also did you see the videos about them attacking trucks ? One polish driver tried to stop them and they stabbed him to death . One italian train conductor asked them for their ticket and they ripped off his hand with a machete . This is why their countries are shitholes . They behave like animals.\\n",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Keep in mind that these billboards were funded by liberals whom fortunately are minority in the country . Majory of us hungarians are against illegal migrants , and we support the government in their actions against them . Dont get fooled by the liberal media . We are not against migrants , we have no problems with foreigners who come here legally .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"On one side we have Germany who stated that they will accept every syrian . On the other side we have thousands of migrants in Budapest who are rioting because the police enforces the EU laws and doesnt let them to Germany . What should we do ? If we let them to Germany with them not having visa or passport we are violating the EU laws , if we are not letting them then we get labelled as xenophobic and racist in the media.\\n\\nThe problem is that by stating that Germany will accept every syrian , everyone even non syrians who speaks arabic claims to be syrians and wants to go there . We were already flooded by them the statement just made it worse .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Thats a fair point , but i have to deal with them for almost a year and half for now . Sadly its part of my job . I can tell you 85-90 % of the illegal migrants are young males around 20-25 . Only a little percentage of them speaks english . \\n\\nA [ typical ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ikgBc83.jpg ) [ day ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Ekeoelv.jpg ) in [ southern ] ( http : //imgur.com/Ekeoelv , ikgBc83 , tY26Z9g # 2 ) Hungary .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,It just proves my point . \\n\\n & gt ; Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted . Directives can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Very true . We only inherited the land temporary , to develop it and maintain our culture , heritage and then to pass it to our descendants.\\nBy taking huge amount of people with different culture and language we are risking all of these things .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Are you sure ? Because trains are going from Nyugati to Debrecen .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Why are you comparing people who wants to deport them with SS ? Israel is doing it right now , why dont you compare them to Israel ?",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We will take the Austrians then when they will have to flee from their home country because of migrants .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Notice how 90 % of them are young males , yet the liberal brainwashing media only shows childs and women in the news to gain support for them .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,For how long do they get money ? Do they just get it for infinite time or only for a limited time ?,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I think you are misunderstanding the directive you linked.\\nIf there would be an EU law that says it member countries have to accept refugees if they meet certation conditions then why would Merkel want to force quota system upon EU countries ? Because theres no such law .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"With the fertility rates native europeans have compared to immigrants in EU , and the massive number of migrants coming to europe on top of that , in a few decades native europeans will be minorities in their own homeland . How sad , the current europe we know will slowly fade away , unless we do some serious action about this .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I gave up debating with you when you started insulting .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"& gt ; Anyone who does is considered racist , narrow-minded or literally Hitler.\\n\\nSadly , this is very true . If i say i want europe for europeans , germany for germans etc , i get labelled as racist instantly . Thanks to liberal media.\\n\\nI have no problems with migrants as long as they stay in their countries . Yes , they want better life , thats understandable , but they cant just cross over 5+ countries illegally then expect to settle down and live in their final destination country .

Germany doesn\\'t have gay marriage either . Ireland has the most backwards abortion laws in the western world , while Eastern Europe as a whole has the most progressive ones . I can bring examples too . You have to understand that a lot of people here are religious/conservative , ( and marriage has a religious/traditional aspect for them ) , so they elect the same kind of government , this is how democracy works , it\\ 's not about being \ '' right\ '' or \ '' wrong\ '' .

I just believe that the state should stand by the local Christian values as the \ '' official\ '' values of the country , even if other lifestyles are permitted . I wouldn\\'t seek to force this on other countries , and is more for Hungary than it is for Germany , where I know that people are a lot less attached to Christianity than they are in eastern Europe . Now , on to the parties ... \\n\\nI was very much center-right with the CDU , I was a big supporter of Merkel and I could usually see the logic in her decisions , even if I didn\\'t agree entirely . I draw the line at the migrant crisis though . Even before , I was very critical of how the EU doesn\\'t have a single , dominant pan-European department that handles the border . It\\ 's very unfair that the nations that happen to be on our border also have to protect the EU\\ 's borders mostly alone . I\\ 'm very much not a fan of how Merkel tried to strong arm Europe into doing something that wasn\\'t even a \ '' greater good\ '' situation , it wasn\\'t to help Europeans or to get Europe into a better place . It\\ 's stupid to risk the integrity of the Union for non-Europeans , especially with a decision that\\ 's so controversial . Merkel is finally changing her tune , but I don\\'t know if I\\ 'll ever go back to being as big of a CDU or EU supporter as I was before . I\\ 'll never vote for AFD though . \\n\\nAs for Hungary , it\\ 's tougher . Fidesz is very , very corrupt , even if they have mostly policies on paper . I can\\'t look past that corruption . Thus , I\\ 'd be left with Jobbik . They\\ 're an interesting bunch . I can\\'t honestly say that I\\ 'm not drawn to their rhetoric , Eastern Europe has had a hard time and it\\ 's not very easy to trust more prosperous and in our eyes often naive countries to handle our affairs . That being said , some party members are very unpolitical and say antisemitic things , silly things , and seem to be plagued with the same ideological vagueness that afflicts most other radical parties .

There is a cultural link between us and the Huns , and through that the Xiongnu , who may have been a multi-ethnic confederation that included people who may have appeared white ( though the evidence for this is very scarce ) .\\n\\nThe furthest we can track the Finno-Ugric people is the Urals .

This was the figure that clearly pointed out that the Pancho Arena was bulit from aid financed by the central budget . \\n\\nThe stadium of Felcs\u00fat was built from tao money ( corporation tax credits ) , which is practically only not recognised as public money by the Felcs\u00fat Youth Foundation and those around , but in reality \ '' tax-money\ '' is involved .

So they called the tao funds govermental resources , that is , public money . \\n\\nA few weeks ago , however , the report has been amended and nex to the \ '' central budgetary support\ '' line it is not 2.09 billion , but only 145 million HUF ( which is the funds recieved from MLSZ which is accounted as central budgetary resources elsewhere , too ) . \\n\\nAccording to the foundation\\ 's auditor there was an administrative error . \\n\\nOr again , they adapted reality to the words of the Prime Minister .",Uralic,Hungarian

ILikeWaffles95,europe,"& gt ; You know very well that this is false . Prior to the elections in 2014 , the governing Fidesz party changed the election rules and the election districts . So in 2010 , when Fidesz won 2/3 majority , they also received 2,7 million votes . 4 years later , in 2014 , they only received 2,1 million votes , and still received the same percentage of mandates in the parliament.\\n\\nWhile gerrymandering is wrong , do you want me to list all the countries **Mainly the US** who did the same shit , even more obviously.\\n\\nDo you think the US is a dictatorship because of that ? \\n\\n & gt ; limiting the number of terms of prime ministers to max 2 terms\\n\\n ? ? ? Just because a no-name insignificant party tried to make a referendum about something you can\\'t , doesn\\'t mean we have no democracy.\\n\\n & gt ; Those were all questions submitted to the constitutional court . Fidesz did everything it could to prevent the vote from happening , and when it finally did , they just gave in without consulting the people at all . For example , they didn\\'t want to hold a referendum on the Olympics . When enough people signed so that they had to have the referendum , they just cancelled the whole Olympics thing . Now we will never know if the majority wanted it or not . And all the money that was spent in the 4 years before that , for the Olympics ... all wasted.\\n\\nThey know most of the people , or at least a sizeable amount were against it , therefore they pulled the plug . The fact that we had no chance against whatever big city wanted to host it played a major role also.\\n\\nWhat\\ 's your point ? \\n\\n & gt ; THIS YEAR they are blaming Soros . Last year they were blaming the immigrants . And before that , it was the IMF , the EU , random political opponents ... \\n\\nAs if you heard Soros in 2017 , don\\'t kid yourself . \\n\\n & gt ; Orban had a meeting with Putin yesterday . No one knows what they talked about , but it implies that Putin is really pulling the strings behind the curtains.\\n\\nMerkel had a meeting with Putin too , is she a puppet too ? I don\\'t care if political leaders meet each other , if the Russians were plotting some evil master plan against EE , they wouldn\\'t plan it publicly anyways.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not a bad idea to keep Russia close to ourselves too , in case in the future things go south with Europe , \ '' Hintapolitika\ '' . They should not be our primary partners though , and don\\'t kid yourself , it doesn\\'t seem like they will be in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n & gt ; By coincidence , the numbers are better than predicted in Slovakia , Romania etc . Do you think it\\ 's some miracle that Orban did why is Hungary doing good ? Or maybe it\\ 's just an overall regional thing . Hungary\\ 's economy is so small , it doesn\\'t matter who does what , if Germany\\ 's economy slows down then so will everyone else\\ 's . When in 2011 the EU\\ 's economy was doing badly , Hungary also had a recession ( which was worse than in other countries in the region ) .\\n\\nYou are right here , but the lefties went into autistic screeching tantrums about muh ruined economy , which is not true.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no constructive opposition in Hungarian politics . They act like little children who shout stuff at eachoter because they can\\'t ride the carousel . The opposition should change , not only in its communication but in their motives aswell.\\n\\nJust because the lefties are fucking stupid , because\\n\\nA , unlike you , most of the people would cut their arms off before voting for a \ '' Western\ '' liberal.\\n\\nB , they can\\'t pull off their identity politics and after that they nothing to offer what Fidesz or Jobbik doesn\\'t . ( B-but muh liberalism : Expect from your echo chamber in Buda , nobody cares about your PC shit . We have bigger problems than \ '' muh humanity\ '' . ) \\n\\n & gt ; Wrong . They attack Hungary because Hungary treats migrants ( = HUMAN BEINGS ) , like animals . They are locked in concentration camps . You can not treat people like that , this is not Saudi Arabia.\\nThe EU agrees that Hungary should defend its borders . It doesn\\'t agree with how those people who are already inside Hungary\\ 's territory are treated.\\n\\nSee above , nobody cares about your humanitarian stuff , they are not our friends never been , never will and should be treated as such . \\n\\nAlso stuff like this : \\n\\nhttp : //nol.hu/data/cikk/1/62/23/5/cikk_1622305/05023-tuntetes-TEK_nol_nagykep.jpg\\n\\nComparing the Arad Martyrs to a bunch of arab cowards who don\\'t want to fight for their homeland is outrageous.\\n\\n & gt ; What happens when a child touches the electric fence on the border ?

What happens then ? \\n\\n & gt ; Europes economic power is build on migration\\n\\nWestern Europe has been a leading power in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire , especially after the 14-15th century . The Immigrants in Europe are not the cause of that , rather a result.\\n\\n & gt ; All those events happen because the populist right uses the oldest trick in the book . They look for people in a bad situation and blame it on foreigners . They dont offer real solution , but easy to understand answers.\\n\\nA legitimate fear is not the oldest trick in the book from foreigner , especially when you look at Western Europe and the attacks , changing demographics and so on . If you think a majority Arab/African ( Not in your lifetime , rather in your grandchildrens . ) will be the same , you are wrong.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition the people fearing foreigners the most are the people who meet them close to never . The more rural and \ '' native\ '' a reagion is , the more anti-migration it is\\n\\nI like this . You know why you think everyone is cool with immigrants ? Because if they say it otherwise , you will purge them and publicly shame them . How do you expect then dissenting views ? \\n\\nAlso , this statement has been proven wrong several times . Check out the electorate map of the US republican Party , or if you want something in Europe , check out the French map , which region voted for Le Pen and which regions have more migrant population . It will be the same . ( Expect from Paris , but it\\ 's not like French people live there anymore . ) \\n\\nForeigners will vote for liberal , not because they are so fond of you ideals , but because more liberal means more *them* and less *you* . Why do you think the people who supported islamists regimes in the middle east now suddenly vote for the most liberal , weak open border party in Sweden , UK , Germany , France and not for some right wing one ? \\n\\n\\n",Uralic,Hungarian

Istencsaszar,europe,"Nationalism is primarily an old phenomenon . It originates in a time where people , due to the language and distance barrier , never interacted with people of other nations ( or rarely ) . The rural/urban divide is simply that urban areas are more progressed socially and economically in general and therefore less likely to adopt the ideas that were designed to make sense in that environment 150 years ago",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; Quite the opposite , nationalism is extremely young . Before that class and religious differences were far more important.\\n\\nwe\\ 're both saying the same thing , just on a different scale . obviously for something that is such a hot topic in actual politics today , nationalism is a pretty goddamn old rusty thing , at its 150-175 year-ish history now . Others like immigration , integration , human rights , stuff like that are way younger.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's origin rests in the fact that written revolutionary material was dispersed along linguistic lines , and that formed the basis of \\'national identity\\ ' . In some places that identity became non-ethnic , like America and France , and in others it was hijacked into ethnic identitarianism , Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\nQuite the opposite . I think it was the westerners that hijacked the idea of a strong national identity into a generic \ '' anyone in the country = inside group , anyone outside = outside group\ '' , which mainly benefited their rulers , who played the game of thrones above the people . For the great powers of the early 1800s , this was awesome . They could alienate the entire population of the other great powers , in the public eye they turned them from \ '' my neighbor\ '' to \ '' someone loyal to xy other nation who i should distrust and i have nothing in common with\ '' . This is the attitude that crept into eastern europe , but without the great powers who would have the capacity or will to brainwash them into thinking same way . Here , it developed more naturally , along the ethnic and cultural divides that wouldn\\'t follow the arbitrary lines that separated one king\\ 's turf from another\\ 's . But the thing is , the clich\u00e9 of homogeneous nation states did arrive anyway , since this was \ '' in the package\ '' with the other liberal ideas of the french revolution like equality and democracy and that type of stuff . And so the nation state also became associated with the new free society everyone was - rightfully - demanding from the different monarchies of eastern europe . The rest is history",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"nationalism mainly developed in england and central france , neither are really places where you\\ 'd expect people to meet other nations en masse . Croatia obviously never developed nationalism by itself , it was influenced and/or created by the already-in-place German and Hungarian nationalism , both of which were inspired by the original French nationalism\\n\\ntherefore , obviously nationalism was designed to work in homogeneous areas with homogeneous people , which is why cultural genocide sprees like Germanization and Hungarization happened , but also more recently Bosnia.\\n\\n & gt ; Funny , my rural ancestors got moved about by various morons from various empires , countries , nations , they spoke several languages before an urban traitor in the capital did.\\n\\nWell the way i understand it , the cultural/social progress went like this : \\n1 , - aristocratic society where nations don\\'t matter and therefore is tolerant and accepting with different nations \\n2 , - nationalistic society where classes are formally gone ( still present but that\\ 's a different story ) and is culturally intolerant because of the rampant nationalism \\n3 , - modern urban society\\n\\nback then , rural places were still in the first phase , urban areas in the 2nd , while today , the rural areas caught up to the 2nd , but the urban areas are now in for something new which is hindered by the countryside . so yeah , I\\ 'm gon na \ '' spinning in my illusion\ '' , which was in no way challenged by your comment",Uralic,Hungarian

Istencsaszar,europe,"In Hungary we call this being a \ '' biod\u00edszlet\ '' , which means something like \ '' live decorations\ ''",Uralic,Hungarian

Istencsaszar,europe,How the fuck are these two things related,Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"Well first off , Orthodoxy somehow survived being under Hungarian rule for 900 years . So did all the Slavic nations and Romanians in Hungary . Compare , say , how well West Slavic nations survived under German rule ( Ostsiedlung ) . Or how well Arabs survived under Spanish rule . Or how well the Irish survived under British rule.\\n\\nAs I also already said , under Hungarian rule was the first law on religious freedom enacted in Transylvania , that guaranteed the religiously incredibly diverse population to practice their religion freely . Those communities ( protestant , catholic , orthodox , unitarian , other Protestant branches I have no idea about , also Armenians , who I think are Miaphysite ? ) remained basically intact for centuries.\\n\\nAlso there was for example a joint uprising of Hungarian and Romanian peasants against the nobles ( 1437 )",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; the \ '' minorities\ '' that they ruled over for hundreds of years in not the most pleasant ways.\\n\\nwell , it\\ 's a fact that it wasn\\'t pleasant and I can emphatize , but Hungary was still the most tolerant towards minorities in pretty much all of Europe ( which is sad , i would really expect it from the west to be better , but they aren\\'t ) .\\n\\nThe first country with freedom of religion was Transylvania , ruled by Hungarians . The first country to enact experimental minority protection laws was also Hungary in 1849 . So it\\ 's not like there weren\\'t efforts.\\n\\n & gt ; If they were enlightened , if they allowed the minorities to preserve their religions , customs , languages and didn\\'t treat them as 3rd-class citizens\\n\\nyou know that this was exactly this way under the dualist system ? there was nothing on your citizenship that said \ '' this guy isn\\'t Hungarian , treat him worse\ '' . The legit complaints that you could have was the language use and native language schooling ( which was , albeit possible , limited ) . Voting rights were limited not by ethnicity , but by wealth , so a wealthy non-Hungarian could just as well vote and once again *poor Hungarians could also not vote* . Probably something about religion too but Hungarians are very divided religion-wise and it was even more so back then . And since Hungarians themselves aren\\'t all Catholic at all , I find it hard to believe that Orthodoxy was particularly oppressed , especially since Orthodox priests were on the countrywide religious council ( 10 seats out of 56 or 18 % , this is roughly the same as how many Orthodox people there were in the country ) , and Orthodoxy had the status of *religio recepta* since 1791 , the same status Protestant religions had .",Uralic,Hungarian
