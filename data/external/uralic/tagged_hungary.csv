100courics,europe,"The current form of the EU . I don\\'t think most Eurosceptics are against European integration , because we all know , and have come to fear , what happens when Germany and France can\\'t get along . The problem is that the EU is clearly headed towards a federalized state ( the \ '' USE\ '' ) , which I don\\'t like . I don\\'t think we have to become a federation for things to work out well in the long run . It does , however , seem to be inevitable.\\n\\nIf we are to force the issue , I would start reform by making the Council to be elected through popular vote , like the Senate of the Americans is . Currently , each state gets one council member , usually a foreign minister appointed from the states . I think each state should get two members and they\\ 'd be elected directly . This is to reduce the democratic deficit which has plagued the EU for decades.\\n\\nThe EU is a great idea in my opinion . It has managed to keep the continent , relatively , at peace . My state should only , however , remain a member within until the last bit of sovereignty states have is eroded away . I don\\'t like this sneaky , slow disappearance of national power while EU politicians maintain that \ '' the EU is not a federation\ '' . There should be a drastic , one-step vote for a new treaty to see what\\ 's what . A treaty about making the EU into a federation . The people should know that that\\ 's the ultimate goal and that it\\ 's happening . Member states will individually decide either to stay or leave , but that the EU would become a federation.\\n\\nI don\\'t have a problem with certain states and EU bureaucrats pushing for a federation ; if they want that , then that\\ 's fine . But citizens of member states shouldn\\'t be pigeonholed into a situation in which they became members of a federation without even realizing , let alone consenting to , such an action .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,europe,"So you\\ 're saying you like a common currency , central bank , open borders , common military , and a popularly-elected president.\\n\\nThat is a description of a country . For all of these to be properly enforced , there would have to be a powerful executive , which the European Commission - though everyone complains of being too powerful - isn\\'t . For the US to regulate its currency , the federal government sets up quotas and limits on printing , borrowing etc . The EU can\\'t explicitly do everything like that because countries have differing fiscal policies . If the EU would set a standard of any sorts that may seem acceptable to Germany might prove fatal to Bulgaria . There is too wide of a range in socio-economic policies in EU states for there to be a single \ '' federal\ '' system to keep everything in check like in the US.\\n\\nOpen borders are a result of the Schengen Agreement which is independent of the EU . Switzerland is part of Schengen , but not the EU for example . Regardless how the EU\\ 's future turns out , the Schengen area can be around forever.\\n\\nAs for a popularly-elected president goes , this year you will vote for President of the European Commission for the first time . I know it\\ 's not the same as its American counterpart ( if it can be called that ) , but that\\ 's as close as we\\ 're going to get to it in the next 50 years . if there was a single position , then the largest countries would always be filling that position .

I would love to live in the make-believe world that the \ '' tolerant\ '' groups want us to believe we\\ 're living in , but I don\\'t . Muslims voluntarily come in by the tens of thousands , but not with the will to integrate into European society . Look what\\ 's happening in France , the UK and even previously-peaceful countries like Sweden.\\n\\nFor centuries there were different denominations of Christianity in Europe as well as Judaism . While fighting was constant , there was some sort of understanding between the communities of these branches , which we don\\'t see today between Muslims and Christians/Jews - and this isn\\'t just in the EU . If I move to Iran tomorrow and demand that my wife be able to paint her nails and not wear a hijab considering she\\ 's not Muslim , would they care in any way ? No , because it\\ 's mandatory - law - in Iran for women to wear hijabs . And you know what ? I guess that\\ 's alright because I CHOSE to move to Iran , thus choosing to adhere to its system of laws.\\n\\nA significant portion of Muslim immigrants do not , however , share the same view . They don\\'t care that they moved to another country with a completely different set of laws - a country which potentially saved their lives - they expect to be able to run their lives , and sometimes the lives of others , exactly as they did back in the country which they fled . I find this to be extremely disrespectful and arrogant.\\n\\nBefore the Reddit Downvote Army arrives to label me a prejudiced racist , let me make it clear that I don\\'t dislike Muslims , Hindus or any other \ '' non-European\ '' religion . I do , however , acknowledge a situation for what it is after what could be seen in countries like the Netherlands where tolerance is supposed to be key , yet many immigrants give 0 f**ks about the centuries-old Dutch way of thought .

It really is just time that will eventually erode the now-imaginary border between eastern and western Europe .

However , we didn\\'t in return get 300,000 French or British immigrants looking for better lives .

That removes the Hungarian workforce , which in turn involuntarily sabotages the country\\ 's welfare system . Hungary is by no means wealthy , but its welfare system ( notably health care ) is flawless . But that\\ 's because there\\ 's a 27 % VAT ( highest in the EU , I think ) and workers pay a lot of taxes on income . Hungary already has a 35 % retired population , and each worker leaving hurts the system more . We don\\'t reproduce like rabbits so it\\ 's difficult to look past 300,000 workers leaving in 10 years when trying to care for the retired population.\\n\\nI finished my education last year and never thought of leaving , because I know there are jobs when people are willing to start with much lower than what they expected . I heard it all : family issues , monetary issues , security issues . I\\ 'm no exception to those , but I knew that my leaving would hurt the pensioners ( who worked their whole lives to earn the help they may lose someday ) as well as the next generation .

Western European states are being bombarded with immigrants who may or may not be willing to integrate and welfare tourists , while Eastern European states ( or at least Hungary ) are losing their workforce , leaving behind pensioners who are getting screwed over because they will eventually get less of what they were guaranteed a few decades ago.\\n\\nIf there were no socio-economic disparities between the \ '' east\ '' and \ '' west\ '' EU , I\\ 'd say the free movement of labor is a fine thing .

However , one of the habits the US has is to stick around after the invasion to make sure the procedure was worth its time , which is a fair demand.\\n\\nSince the War , however , the US has been locked into its self-created role of World Police . Ukraine is a member of the Partnership for Peace program of NATO . The program itself is more symbolic than practical - let alone binding - but it shows that NATO member states ( notably the US ) began placing interest in the given state . Thus , while NATO is officially merely a mutual defense pact , becoming a partner of it has many more effects in the long run . Thus , while a full-scale invasion wouldn\\'t be justified in terms of NATO use , the US may just judge the situation as it did 60 years ago : I either help them now , or will have to invade them in ten years because they\\ 'll be overrun.\\n\\nThe love-hate analogy is partially true , but most Europeans subconsciously HAVE to be happy about NATO membership because , if they weren\\'t , nothing would keep them from being next on Russia\\ 's hitlist . It\\ 's very easy to complain about the US when it does something immoral like Iraq or Afghanistan . But it\\ 's only so easy for ( western in some cases ) Europeans because they had the pillow known as the US to land on when they fell for decades now .

100courics,europe,"& gt ; the argument 4oo mouths costs more than 200 is primitive and populist\\n\\nI\\ 'm not sure you know what populism means . But yes , it\\ 's primitive because , in it\\ 's current state , the Hungarian parliament is primitive . MPs walk in and out as they please , read Blikk instead of paying attention to potentially state-altering topics , and charge the podium with stupid signs whenever something is happening that they don\\'t approve of . So yes , it\\ 's primitive . It\\ 's primitive , but fitting.\\n\\n & gt ; Look after the election of to how many people actually voted for them and rethink my \ '' rape\ '' metaphor.\\n\\nOkay , I\\ 'm going to address this now so that people whining about the next election will shut up and vote against Fidesz if they want them out of power . Believe it or not , Fidesz is still the most popular party in the country . Month after month , year after year since 2010 , none of the other parties come remotely close to Fidesz in polls , regardless which source is used ( Median , Szazadveg , Nezopont , Ipsos etc ) . To my knowledge , the leftist Unity coalition is launching candidates in every single one of the individual voting district . This means that they can achieve victory by plurality in 106 out of the 106 districts . Jobbik is also launching candidates in every district . I\\ 'm not sure about LMP . The point is that , if the people will it , then Fidesz will be voted out of power . You can\\'t just claim that an election is rigged just because the party you don\\'t like is ( relatively speaking ) the most popular . I hate Fidesz , but the argument saying that the elections will be rigged is ridiculous . \\n\\nFinally , \\n\\n & gt ; Opposers of the goverment will be accused of lack of patriotism and silenced\\n\\nIs this a serious statement ? Not a single day goes by without 50-100 people gathering somewhere in Budapest to protest something the government is doing . About once a month , the entire leftist coalition sponsors a protest with a few thousand people ( ~20,000 was the largest one to my knowledge ) . Leftist papers inside and outside the country are hammering the government . None of the leftist activist or politicians have been imprisoned ( to the despair of many Hungarians ) . \\n\\nYes , Fidesz is full of incompetent fools , but they are a democratically elected government who can be democratically disposed of this year , should the people will it . And if they aren\\'t , then stop being a sore loser and acknowledge that still more people prefer Fidesz than any other party .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,europe,"An efficient military MUST have a strict system of hierarchy . The EU was founded on voluntary ideas , far from establishing a common military . The closest it has is the Common Foreign/Security Policy and a handful of donated battlegroups ( a few hundred or thousand soldiers in each ) . However , nothing in the treaty authorizes either the EP or EC in establishing and maintaining a common military OR declaring war/making peace . \\n\\nI my opinion , this is because there is still a great deal of animosity between several member states , notably in the eastern half of the EU . How would the EU set up guidelines for when conflict ( hopefully never will be a case , but still ) arises between EU member states ? Member states joined voluntarily , but up til today , there was no clause in their joining saying they will be invaded by an EU contingent if they start a conflict with another state . The problem would be that who could determine which side has the moral right in the conflict ? \\n\\nAlso , almost all EU states are in NATO . As EU member states - with the exception of the UK - have shown over the past twenty years , they are still disproportionately reliant on the US as far as military \ '' field trips\ '' are concerned . This is a problem the EU has had since its inception : to be able to use military force , the Union would have to have the courage of adapting aggressive foreign policies when needed . The US is the best example for this : the US does not give a rat\\ 's ass who\\ 's going to give it the death stare for invading another country if it feels it has to be done to protect its interests . Now , regardless of the moral argument surrounding that , the US can order hundreds of thousands of soldiers to any point of the world because it is efficient . EU member states often have different positions on foreign policy issues . Thus , if a conflict arises in non-EU territory , some states may be much more reluctant to \ '' go in\ '' than others . Look at the NATO part of ISAF in AFghanistan : 34,000 American troops , and the next is the UK with 5,000 . It goes much further down after that . NATO is still almost all-US effort . Therefore , if the EU is to establish a united military , it has to engrave the idea of potential mass casualties to a state\\ 's military force into each member state\\ 's brain . That\\ 's a burden which has been carried by the US since the Second World War , but will have to be re-assumed by the EU states . A difficult sell , to say the least.\\n\\nReasons for the army : \\n\\nThe world will continue to treat the EU like a child until it has a functioning military .

Aylomein,europe,im not sure you put much thought into that \ '' false dilemma\ '' of yours .,Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"oh dont worry , they know what they are doing , saying this tax would give policemen a raise ... just as if he wants to make police and people collide ... they obviously asked MANY people before about what they think in this topic.\\n\\nso my conclusion is , this whole idiot idea is just to make people forget that USA banned several high ranked officials from entering the country due to heavy corruptional cases . all officials were close to the current government leading party ( Fidesz , Orb\u00e1n ) . \\n\\nwhat will happen is they will keep on saying stupid shit about internet and taxing and in a month they obviously will backpedal from it so meanwhile people forget this USA incident while fighting with police ... because internet tax pisses off EVERYONE ... . except police since they get the raise from it.. what a coincidence .",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see you are from Scotland , of course you can decide if it is good for you or not by voting , but what he said is definitely only manipulation , and who do you think will be the leading politician in new scotland after the Yes campaign ? but let me highlight it : \\n\\n0-20 is pure demagogue , UK has ways and rules to deal with those , hundreds/thousands of well educated people made those rules , and you can change them WITHIN the UK system , you have political power , you can send in proposals ( sorry im not native speaker so i don\\'t know specific words , and maybe it is not the correct word here ) which the government will change if it is for the better . he is talking about weapons , but you need weapons to protect yourself . he is talking about poor and disabled which is only brought up to convince people through emotions . what can he do better in scotland what UK can\\'t do about the poor ? nobody in the world in 5000 years had a perfect plan to eliminate the problem with poors/disabled ( \ '' eliminate\ '' as making them not poor , not \ '' killing\ '' them ) . he is promising more money by eliminating taxes , or giving more to welfare . of course everyone can promise you that , but money isn\\'T produced on trees , he should be talking about from where he would take the money away so he could give to the poor and disabled . but he just talks about poor and disabled.\\n\\n0:45 he says again demagogue , logical fallacies . saying opponents say \ '' abundant oil is a curse instead of an asset.\ '' ... nobody in the world would say something like that , it is an obvious lie and manipulation . i dont have to be scottish to know the epic lie he is making.\\n\\n1:10 as soon as the guy is talking about concrete proof , evidence , about his published paper being shit , he keeps smiling and making movements like a shrug , interrupting him softly many times . all implying the same thing : that the other party is lying and it is not like that . this is a manipulative tactic . ( unless of course the other party is truly lying , but making up a lie this huge about a public paper which EVERYONE can check would be too risky to lie about ) \\n\\ni dont know what he answered to this guy but i don\\'t have to , since i know it already , ive seen this behaviour in action many times , he would answer with another logical fallacy , either saying the other guy made some errors as well , or he would say it is completely wrong and this is more complicated matter and he is trying to simplify it , or he would just grab one little thing from the other\\ 's speech and react to that . if you\\ 've seen the whole you can probably see im right , else i apologize for my speculation , but nonetheless , further proofs without speculations : \\n\\n1:40 about whats best for scotland , well , nothing to criticize but it is just an empty speech , this speech could have been said by anyone in the world about anything in any given time . but interesting thing starts here : \\n\\n2:00 glasses guy asks about his plan B if some thing doesn\\'t work out as he planned . again he is stating proofs that his questions wasn\\'t answered before . of course salmond again keeps interrupting him and smiling as if saying : \ '' completely not true , bullshit\ '' , yet doesn\\'t answer it . talks about debts , i dont know about those since im not familiar with politics in scotland . but saying something like if UK takes assets he is responsible paying it back not scotland is probably very simple and not how it works , but honestly i dont know how it works in that situation . but what annoys me is his figure of speech simplifying the problem so much . i would say about governmental matters , problems are never that easy , you have to follow contracts , procedures 99 % of the time.\\n\\n4:20 glass guy even said he lied about hospitals , making a scare campaign , of course our salmond shrugs it off as funny . if glass guy would lie he should be furious and not shrugging it off as funny . what is funny about it when you are called a liar ? infuriating.\\n\\n5:00 again question about plan B. again shrugs it off as funny . how is this funny , why doesn\\'t he answer the question ? looking \ '' cool\ '' and confident can convince the masses , but just proves he is using demagogue tactics and lies.\\n\\n5:20 can\\'t answer AGAIN the question , so who he brings up ? 100.000 people with disability SUFFERING from the government ? really ? how are you suffering in fucking scotland with GDP Per capita $ 44,378 . obvious lies to manipulate the emotions of people . if you think the government is unjust , you can send in a proposal to the government and if it is good they will vote about it . or does he think people in government hate disabled people with a passion and want them to suffer ? this is not africa . he is clearly using scare tactics as the glasses guy stated before.\\n\\nat 5:40 i cant even understand what he is asking due to accent , but regardless he is asking about how much money something cost . now if a politician brings this up , you know he is a scumbag lying shit . each and every one of them who brings this up like this is the worst manipulator . because you will know the number of whatever he asks in a government scale is gon na be billions , yet of course he doesn\\'t put into perspective , like what is the budget , why the money is needed what is it spent on etc , he just asks for the number , typical manipulation . if you really think you are right about it then you should put it into perspective for people who don\\'t see billions thrown left and right so people could actually understand the numbers . but of course he doesn\\'T do it , he doesn\\'t even let the glasses guy answer properly and just asks for the number.\\n\\nagain 6:00 i dont even understand the second half of what he says , but saying 100.000 poor CHILDREN and he is spending X number of money on something and can\\'t name some job shit is a logical fallacy again.\\n\\nedit : if you don\\'t understand one point pls ask , im not a native speaker and i tried to be short about these since for me these are obvious but if you still don\\'t see it i either was too short about why i think those or i badly phrased it . but : \\n\\n**TLDR : ** im not saying either YES-NO choice is bad , but he is definitely using scare tactics and manipulation through emotions and not through logic . and for him this is just a way to gain more popularity . especially if people vote YES",Uralic,Hungarian
Aylomein,europe,"i see , i was probably wrong in some of my accusations , but i feel like you are trying to convince me why voting YES is good . i never said it is wrong to vote YES , i don\\'t know at all which is good for scotland , but from the things you said , voting YES seems pretty logical . \\n\\nyet my problem was with HOW Salmond presented that choice , not with WHAT he represented . you had sound reasoning behind what you said , that UK is right wing and scotland is left wing . uk wants nuclear weapons , scotland doesn\\'t . this is all there is to it in every topic , but Salmond was never really arguing about this but rather about emotion manipulation , let me respond to some things you said in regards to this : \\n\\n & gt ; tax on empty bedrooms , introduced by the UK government . The Scottish people and government thought it was unfair on the poor who are often assigned houses with more rooms than they might use . \\n\\nwell , tax on empty bedrooms really mostly tax the richer people , the poor who have bigger assigned houses are probably very few , and this could be easily changed within the UK system , if someone wants a smaller house he can change it with other who wanted a bigger house , i dont remember anytime in the history when somebody wanted LESS and he didn\\'t get it . problem is when you want more , not less . so it is strange to me this is a problem to begin with . \\n\\nbut basic political tactic is to always talk about every type of tax you can find , tax is the best way to convince people as a politician during a time of peace to vote for you . most political parties say they will decrease a tax ( for example eliminate the empty bedroom tax , or give more welfare money ) but of course with this the state loses money , these taxes weren\\'t introduced ( most of the time ) just for fun or for politicians to get more money in their pockets . every politician knows if you make a new tax , people will hate you . so they try to avoid increasing tax as they avoid fire . so introducing any new tax or increasing income tax is only done if the state needs money for something . so back to the point , many politicians say they eliminate/decrease said tax , and they WILL keep their promise to not seem 2faced , but soon new taxes with different names will come , because they somehow will have to solve the now deficit in the budget . maybe he will give more welfare and delete empty bedroom tax but will make a new tax for people with cars , and we could again hear reasoning that this law is bad for poor people who are assigned cars etc . taxes are there for a purpose , it is used to build the country and pay people working for the state so it actually gets back to people . ( even if a politican would steal 10million euros from it , that is such a small number compared to yearly budget that it won\\'t be even the 0,1 % of budget and will be unnoticed ) . what im trying to say is , saying that taxes need to be decreased or eliminated is pure political trickery , if you want a different approach to it you should say from where you want to make the money for it . here at least he said that the money will come from Trident , but he didn\\'t say he would use the money from it to solve the deficit from taxes , but rather said it is to use it for poor children and disableds . i don\\'t know the numbers since they never really talk about it ( or maybe they did in the full debate ) , but changing seemingly little things about taxes result in billions . but nonetheless this is an actual point he makes that he wants to stop trident . ( problem is , public safety probably shouldn\\'t be up for vote and the way should be chosen by military professionals . but of course i don\\'t know anything about this matter , but seeing russia\\ 's behaviour about ukraine , maybe this is not the best time to demilitarize . weapons are not for only attacking other nations , but rather as a deterrent to not get attacked randomly ) \\n\\n & gt ; 0:45\\nI don\\'t know how familiar you are with the campaigns , but the opposite side has been saying that oil revenues were too unstable to be relied upon or counted upon.\\n\\ni dont know who is right but doesn\\'t matter , he still on purpose exaggerated . not to mention things like these should be NOT debatable , this could be proved by professionals in the field if there really is oil shortage or not , economic things should never be put up to a vote , but decided by skilled people . only basic policies could be voted , like environmental friendliness etc.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; In the full debate , a few minutes earlier he gets to speak on oil a little . Making the case that Norway has 20 % of it\\ 's GDP as oil revenue , Scotland would have 15 % , So unless people consider Norway unstable , Scotland couldn\\'t be either.\\n\\nagain these things should not be debatable , 1 wrong doesn\\'t make 2 right . these should be proved by data and not \ '' common sense\ '' . and there could be a million difference between these 2 countries as to why it is more liability for scotland and not for norway . i dont know if any parties showed data about their choice , but they should . and until they do , talking about is only trying to make the other look dumb , which is again not a honest direct way of politics , but manipulation.\\n\\n & gt ; What the SNP propose is that we accept some debt for a proportional amount of the national assets\\n\\nseems fair , i completely agree , but things are usually more complicated , i would probably need to hear the other side\\ 's argument , because there could be many scenarios theoretically where it doesn\\'t work like that from pure materialistic perspective.\\n\\nfor example ( this is total fiction ) UK borrowed a lot of money so in 4 years they can invest in scotland farmlands because it is perfect place for it , and in 15 years the money could be paid back . now if scotland gets autonomy before they even start to build farmlands , yet they already borrowed the money , they are in a shitty situation especially if they made some prearrangements in contracts/spendings , with this , scotland has no asset so he wouldn\\'t have to pay any debt , yet it doesn\\'t seem fair does it if he doesn\\'t help paying back the money ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; 4:20 : Hospitals being mentioned are due to cost cutting in England.\\nScotland\\ 's budget is decided in part by how much England spends on Hospitals , so if they spend less , we have less to spend on our own services.\\n\\ni dont know the situation but my problem was that he was accused of lying publicly about it , yet he just laughed it off , sadly we can\\'t see his response , but seemed like there is no real response to that , because when you actually accuse someone of lying publicly , you have to have proofs else you could go to court for defamation . ( as far as i know , but maybe scottish laws are different ) \\n\\n & gt ; 6:00 He\\ 's talking about how the opposition are spending a lot on nuclear weapons when we as a country have rising child poverty rates.\\n\\nwell , i don\\'t even understand the concept of his , how can a child be poor , every child is poor until they start working . but nonetheless , UK policy is of course the same as scotland\\ 's would be in that regard , that they wouldn\\'t allow death by hunger . every democratic country in europe will try to solve things like that , so phrasing it like this is just exaggeration again . saying poor innocents ( children/disabled ) is always a good way to win over people.\\n\\nmost of the other things you wrote i agree with that i was too quick to judge . ( or in some i can not prove it logically just have bad feeling about his \ '' manipulative\ '' body language and speech , but those are all very subjective )",Uralic,Hungarian

Executioner1337,europe,Read the line below that quote .,Uralic,Hungarian
Executioner1337,europe,"Translation TL ; DR : \\n\\n & gt ; We have addressed before in April the pedestrian-biker bridge costing 400M Forints ( 1.3M Euros ) planned for the summer water world championships . Our readers weren\\'t convinced with BKK\\ 's ( Budapest K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si K\u00f6zpont , Budapest Transportation Centre ) reasoning , and that the existing bridge only 300 meters away would justify a new pedestrian-biker overpass on R\u00e1kospatak , between Dag\u00e1ly ( the swimming pool ) and its car park.\\n\\n & gt ; But how mindful are the organizers that they thought about people reaching their cars with bikes . \\nIn April we wouldn\\'t have imagined that the 424M Forints wouldn\\'t be enough . Neither that the super expensively earned contract because of the short time frame would be extended with three months . \\n**That means that the works could be delayed up to October , while the water world championship is held in July , according to the contract . ** \\n\\n & gt ; The structure arcing above the flowing R\u00e1kos-patak cost 424M Forints gross at the time of signing the contract , and it included the implementation and everything else ( planning , technical inspection , fees , reserves ) . Now 20M Forints net can be added ( 25.4M Forints gross ) to this , since the 309M Forints dedicated to the implementation now increased to 329M Forints ( net ) according to the modification on Monday . \\nThe price increase is really only a drop in the sea of billions for the water world championship , but its rationale is beautiful . \\n\\n & gt ; The price increase was justified by *a set of unforeseen things* , which lead to the increase of cost of the bridge . \\n\\n & gt ; But the modification of the deadline is even more surprising . The work of art was the symbol of the water world championship even without its increase of cost with its complete pointlessness and its overpriced cost . But that it won\\'t even have to be finished to the world championship ? ! \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' The implementation works are according to the schedule , the facility will be finished before the start of the FINA world championship.\ '' \\nUnless if it doesn\\'t , the already existing bridge being 300 meters away can be used to approach the parked cars . It isn\\'t a big distance , especially on wheels .",Uralic,Hungarian

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Being against illegal immigrants doesnt make you a far right nazi . Fidesz is a christian centre-right party and being against immigration is a perfectly fine stance for a conservative party .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,The fence will be completed at the Hungarian-Croatian border soon . Get ready Slovenia .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They fucked up real hard . They entered Hungary with a train full of migrants and police . This is basically an invade .

We have enough problems on our own we really dont need migrants who dont speak our language and also refuse to integrate .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They dont take any illegal migrant in they only take actually verified refugees . The fence only stops illegal migrants so whole europe should be glad it got built .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I try to understand the views of leaders like the Austrian chancellor but i just can\\'t . 5000-10000 are coming daily . A month ago it was 2000-3000 . It\\ 's clear that the numbers are increasing every day . \ '' Let all of them pass\ '' . What are they going to do when 20000 will come every day ?

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Jobbik is a principled , conservative and radically patriotic christian party . They are nationalist but not chauvinist .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Because on this issue only one view is reasonable . Whats the fucking point of relocating 160k migrants when 6000 coming daily ? Theres no sense in that .

Slovakia has a centre-left government yet they have been pretty reasonable the whole time about the migration issue .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,How can they claim to be refugees and then they aggressively force their way in .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We have not been independent since then .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Yeah its hard for Greece , but instead of transporting migrants from the small islands to Athen , EU should help them deport every single one of them .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Nationalism is the only way to preserve our history , values and culture .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,We will build the fence till the Drava river . There are more than 4000 soldiers at the border and they are actually building it very fast like 10km/day .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I know . They do the same in Hungary . Every freaking day they chant \ '' no camp , no fingerprints\ '' .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They want to get caught . EU laws doesnt allow countries to arrest anyone who claims that they are refugees . This is what happens in Hungary .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,I know plenty of incidents that they caused . They plunder through agricultural land destroying the livelihood of families who own these lands . Stabbings happens quite often . Lucikly among themselves but what if one day they start attacking us . They force their ways into farms and they only leave if the police arrives . Few weeks ago they [ forced their way into a farm ] ( http : //www.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/toroczkai_egy_bevandorlo_csalad_bekoltozott_egy_tanya_udvarara/2436763/ ) where a mother with 2 childs were home alone .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I have no idea ? You are the one talking from thousands of kms away . I live near the border and have to deal with them on a daily basis . Are the hungarians who are abroad entered the countries illegaly ? Nope . But the migrants are breaking the law by illegally entering countries .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Atleast we are doing something and the fence is scheduled to be completed before 30th of November so right now you have absolutely no idea what effect it will have .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are there legally and working and paying taxes there . The migrants are here illegally and majority of them will live off welfare .,Uralic,Hungarian

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"So looks like law doesnt mean anything to you . Lets just choose the easier way even if it is illegal . I actually had to deal with aggressive migrants and i even had to call the cops . In fact i have to deal with them on a daily basis cause of my job , and i also live near the border .

Oh you saw them a few times at keleti..that surely was enough to have a reasonable opinion .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Ofc the illegal way is the easier . I still dont see how can you defend them when they are breaking the law and are acting aggressively .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"They are fleeing from their war torn countries . Fine , then as i said their goal should be to get out of Syria . But their goal is to get into western europe .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"There are hundreds of millions living in poverty . We cant help them all . People who still supports them should realize that migrants are breaking the law .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Multiculturalisms does not work in a long run and yes fortunately liberals are minority in Hungary . Liberals with their policies got us into a financial crisis and the liberal government almost got us bankrupt .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,They are mostly in villages/towns that are near the border .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Why dont they get it only for a limited time ? Like only for a year and if they cant learn the language and find a job in that time they would get deported . With the current system they have no reason to integrate and to get a job .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,Exactly . If we let them stay here permanently its like we allow them to take our land . Like a modern conquest .,Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"I could ask the same . How can you support them ? They are not refugees , there are no wars , they just want welfare , and no i dont want them to get paid from my taxes . But if you like them so much , why dont you share your home with few of them ? Also did you see the videos about them attacking trucks ? One polish driver tried to stop them and they stabbed him to death . One italian train conductor asked them for their ticket and they ripped off his hand with a machete . This is why their countries are shitholes . They behave like animals.\\n",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Keep in mind that these billboards were funded by liberals whom fortunately are minority in the country .

We are not against migrants , we have no problems with foreigners who come here legally .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"On one side we have Germany who stated that they will accept every syrian . On the other side we have thousands of migrants in Budapest who are rioting because the police enforces the EU laws and doesnt let them to Germany . What should we do ? If we let them to Germany with them not having visa or passport we are violating the EU laws , if we are not letting them then we get labelled as xenophobic and racist in the media.\\n\\nThe problem is that by stating that Germany will accept every syrian , everyone even non syrians who speaks arabic claims to be syrians and wants to go there . We were already flooded by them the statement just made it worse .",Uralic,Hungarian
FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,"Thats a fair point , but i have to deal with them for almost a year and half for now . Sadly its part of my job .

FLAME_JK_PERMBAN,europe,It just proves my point . \\n\\n & gt ; Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted .

Germany doesn\\'t have gay marriage either . Ireland has the most backwards abortion laws in the western world , while Eastern Europe as a whole has the most progressive ones .

I\\ 'm totally fine with gay marriage , reproductive rights , so on . I just believe that the state should stand by the local Christian values as the \ '' official\ '' values of the country , even if other lifestyles are permitted . I wouldn\\'t seek to force this on other countries , and is more for Hungary than it is for Germany , where I know that people are a lot less attached to Christianity than they are in eastern Europe . Now , on to the parties ... \\n\\nI was very much center-right with the CDU , I was a big supporter of Merkel and I could usually see the logic in her decisions , even if I didn\\'t agree entirely . I draw the line at the migrant crisis though . Even before , I was very critical of how the EU doesn\\'t have a single , dominant pan-European department that handles the border . It\\ 's very unfair that the nations that happen to be on our border also have to protect the EU\\ 's borders mostly alone . I\\ 'm very much not a fan of how Merkel tried to strong arm Europe into doing something that wasn\\'t even a \ '' greater good\ '' situation , it wasn\\'t to help Europeans or to get Europe into a better place . It\\ 's stupid to risk the integrity of the Union for non-Europeans , especially with a decision that\\ 's so controversial . Merkel is finally changing her tune , but I don\\'t know if I\\ 'll ever go back to being as big of a CDU or EU supporter as I was before . I\\ 'll never vote for AFD though . \\n\\nAs for Hungary , it\\ 's tougher . Fidesz is very , very corrupt , even if they have mostly policies on paper . I can\\'t look past that corruption . Thus , I\\ 'd be left with Jobbik . They\\ 're an interesting bunch . I can\\'t honestly say that I\\ 'm not drawn to their rhetoric , Eastern Europe has had a hard time and it\\ 's not very easy to trust more prosperous and in our eyes often naive countries to handle our affairs . That being said , some party members are very unpolitical and say antisemitic things , silly things , and seem to be plagued with the same ideological vagueness that afflicts most other radical parties .

There is a cultural link between us and the Huns , and through that the Xiongnu , who may have been a multi-ethnic confederation that included people who may have appeared white ( though the evidence for this is very scarce ) .\\n\\nThe furthest we can track the Finno-Ugric people is the Urals .

This was the figure that clearly pointed out that the Pancho Arena was bulit from aid financed by the central budget . \\n\\nThe stadium of Felcs\u00fat was built from tao money ( corporation tax credits ) , which is practically only not recognised as public money by the Felcs\u00fat Youth Foundation and those around , but in reality \ '' tax-money\ '' is involved . According to Viktor Orb\u00e1n [ Prime Minister ] it\\ 's a communist thing to say that the Stadium of Felcs\u00fat was built from public funds and according to L\u0151rinc M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros [ Mayor of Felcs\u00fat ] \ '' there was not a penny of public money\ '' for the stadium . \\n\\nThe Figyel\u0151 wrote that is why it is interesting that the Felcs\u00fat Foundation 2012 Annual Report originally stated that the Foundation received 2.09 billion HUF in grants from the central government in 2012 , which is consistent with the MLSZ [ Hungarian Football Federation ] grants and the tao-funds . So they called the tao funds govermental resources , that is , public money . \\n\\nA few weeks ago , however , the report has been amended and nex to the \ '' central budgetary support\ '' line it is not 2.09 billion , but only 145 million HUF ( which is the funds recieved from MLSZ which is accounted as central budgetary resources elsewhere , too ) . \\n\\nAccording to the foundation\\ 's auditor there was an administrative error . \\n\\nOr again , they adapted reality to the words of the Prime Minister .",Uralic,Hungarian

ILikeWaffles95,europe,"& gt ; You know very well that this is false . Prior to the elections in 2014 , the governing Fidesz party changed the election rules and the election districts . So in 2010 , when Fidesz won 2/3 majority , they also received 2,7 million votes . 4 years later , in 2014 , they only received 2,1 million votes , and still received the same percentage of mandates in the parliament.\\n\\nWhile gerrymandering is wrong , do you want me to list all the countries **Mainly the US** who did the same shit , even more obviously.\\n\\nDo you think the US is a dictatorship because of that ? \\n\\n & gt ; limiting the number of terms of prime ministers to max 2 terms\\n\\n ? ? ? Just because a no-name insignificant party tried to make a referendum about something you can\\'t , doesn\\'t mean we have no democracy.\\n\\n & gt ; Those were all questions submitted to the constitutional court . Fidesz did everything it could to prevent the vote from happening , and when it finally did , they just gave in without consulting the people at all . For example , they didn\\'t want to hold a referendum on the Olympics . When enough people signed so that they had to have the referendum , they just cancelled the whole Olympics thing . Now we will never know if the majority wanted it or not . And all the money that was spent in the 4 years before that , for the Olympics ... all wasted.\\n\\nThey know most of the people , or at least a sizeable amount were against it , therefore they pulled the plug . The fact that we had no chance against whatever big city wanted to host it played a major role also.\\n\\nWhat\\ 's your point ? \\n\\n & gt ; THIS YEAR they are blaming Soros . Last year they were blaming the immigrants . And before that , it was the IMF , the EU , random political opponents ... \\n\\nAs if you heard Soros in 2017 , don\\'t kid yourself . \\n\\n & gt ; Orban had a meeting with Putin yesterday . No one knows what they talked about , but it implies that Putin is really pulling the strings behind the curtains.\\n\\nMerkel had a meeting with Putin too , is she a puppet too ? I don\\'t care if political leaders meet each other , if the Russians were plotting some evil master plan against EE , they wouldn\\'t plan it publicly anyways.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not a bad idea to keep Russia close to ourselves too , in case in the future things go south with Europe , \ '' Hintapolitika\ '' . They should not be our primary partners though , and don\\'t kid yourself , it doesn\\'t seem like they will be in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n & gt ; By coincidence , the numbers are better than predicted in Slovakia , Romania etc . Do you think it\\ 's some miracle that Orban did why is Hungary doing good ? Or maybe it\\ 's just an overall regional thing . Hungary\\ 's economy is so small , it doesn\\'t matter who does what , if Germany\\ 's economy slows down then so will everyone else\\ 's . When in 2011 the EU\\ 's economy was doing badly , Hungary also had a recession ( which was worse than in other countries in the region ) .\\n\\nYou are right here , but the lefties went into autistic screeching tantrums about muh ruined economy , which is not true.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no constructive opposition in Hungarian politics . They act like little children who shout stuff at eachoter because they can\\'t ride the carousel . The opposition should change , not only in its communication but in their motives aswell.\\n\\nJust because the lefties are fucking stupid , because\\n\\nA , unlike you , most of the people would cut their arms off before voting for a \ '' Western\ '' liberal.\\n\\nB , they can\\'t pull off their identity politics and after that they nothing to offer what Fidesz or Jobbik doesn\\'t . ( B-but muh liberalism : Expect from your echo chamber in Buda , nobody cares about your PC shit . We have bigger problems than \ '' muh humanity\ '' . ) \\n\\n & gt ; Wrong . They attack Hungary because Hungary treats migrants ( = HUMAN BEINGS ) , like animals . They are locked in concentration camps . You can not treat people like that , this is not Saudi Arabia.\\nThe EU agrees that Hungary should defend its borders . It doesn\\'t agree with how those people who are already inside Hungary\\ 's territory are treated.\\n\\nSee above , nobody cares about your humanitarian stuff , they are not our friends never been , never will and should be treated as such . \\n\\nAlso stuff like this : \\n\\nhttp : //nol.hu/data/cikk/1/62/23/5/cikk_1622305/05023-tuntetes-TEK_nol_nagykep.jpg\\n\\nComparing the Arad Martyrs to a bunch of arab cowards who don\\'t want to fight for their homeland is outrageous.\\n\\n & gt ; What happens when a child touches the electric fence on the border ?

For me willingly sacrificing your people on the altar of GDP growth isn\\'t progress.\\n\\n & gt ; There is no \ '' more\ '' of the native population . We a shrinking without migration.\\n\\nYes , you are shrinking without immigration , with migration there are less natives compared to the overall composition of the society , and those foreigner will not vote in your favour in the favour of the German state , they will not do sacrifices , if the economic situation turns dire , they will leave.\\n\\nAlso , the accepted theory is while they have 5 children now , in a generation they will have 1-2 like the natives .

They look for people in a bad situation and blame it on foreigners . They dont offer real solution , but easy to understand answers.\\n\\nA legitimate fear is not the oldest trick in the book from foreigner , especially when you look at Western Europe and the attacks , changing demographics and so on . If you think a majority Arab/African ( Not in your lifetime , rather in your grandchildrens . ) will be the same , you are wrong.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition the people fearing foreigners the most are the people who meet them close to never . The more rural and \ '' native\ '' a reagion is , the more anti-migration it is\\n\\nI like this . You know why you think everyone is cool with immigrants ? Because if they say it otherwise , you will purge them and publicly shame them . How do you expect then dissenting views ? \\n\\nAlso , this statement has been proven wrong several times . Check out the electorate map of the US republican Party , or if you want something in Europe , check out the French map , which region voted for Le Pen and which regions have more migrant population . It will be the same . ( Expect from Paris , but it\\ 's not like French people live there anymore . ) \\n\\nForeigners will vote for liberal , not because they are so fond of you ideals , but because more liberal means more *them* and less *you* .

It gets better.\\n\\n & gt ; Dr. Mahathir has reserved his most trenchant comments for global currency traders , particularly George Soros , an American currency hedge-fund operator and philanthropist . Even before their invited speeches at the World Bank-IMF annual meetings in **Hong Kong in September 1997 , Dr. Mahathir derided Mr. Soros and other currency speculators as wealthy people who use their money to force developing countries \ '' to submit to the dictatorship of international manipulators.\ '' ** Mahathir expressed his own country\\ 's interest in a more international economy but one with protection \ '' from self-serving rogues and international brigandage.\ '' \\n\\n & gt ; **George Soros , whose Open Society Foundation funds anti-SLORC Burma activist groups in the U.S. and other countries , was one of the most vocal opponents of the country\\ 's admission into ASEAN . ** Perhaps unsurprisingly , conspiracy theorists claimed that Soros\\ ' actions in the currency market led to the collapse of the Thai baht on July 2 and the subsequent fall of other ASEAN countries\\ ' currencies . This was likened to a similar speculative attack Soros led on the British pound sterling in September 1992.\\n\\n [ WHY ARE 6 U.S .

Istencsaszar,europe,"Nationalism is primarily an old phenomenon . It originates in a time where people , due to the language and distance barrier , never interacted with people of other nations ( or rarely ) . The rural/urban divide is simply that urban areas are more progressed socially and economically in general and therefore less likely to adopt the ideas that were designed to make sense in that environment 150 years ago",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; Quite the opposite , nationalism is extremely young . Before that class and religious differences were far more important.\\n\\nwe\\ 're both saying the same thing , just on a different scale . obviously for something that is such a hot topic in actual politics today , nationalism is a pretty goddamn old rusty thing , at its 150-175 year-ish history now . Others like immigration , integration , human rights , stuff like that are way younger.\\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's origin rests in the fact that written revolutionary material was dispersed along linguistic lines , and that formed the basis of \\'national identity\\ ' . In some places that identity became non-ethnic , like America and France , and in others it was hijacked into ethnic identitarianism , Central and Eastern Europe.\\n\\nQuite the opposite . I think it was the westerners that hijacked the idea of a strong national identity into a generic \ '' anyone in the country = inside group , anyone outside = outside group\ '' , which mainly benefited their rulers , who played the game of thrones above the people . For the great powers of the early 1800s , this was awesome . They could alienate the entire population of the other great powers , in the public eye they turned them from \ '' my neighbor\ '' to \ '' someone loyal to xy other nation who i should distrust and i have nothing in common with\ '' . This is the attitude that crept into eastern europe , but without the great powers who would have the capacity or will to brainwash them into thinking same way . Here , it developed more naturally , along the ethnic and cultural divides that wouldn\\'t follow the arbitrary lines that separated one king\\ 's turf from another\\ 's . But the thing is , the clich\u00e9 of homogeneous nation states did arrive anyway , since this was \ '' in the package\ '' with the other liberal ideas of the french revolution like equality and democracy and that type of stuff . And so the nation state also became associated with the new free society everyone was - rightfully - demanding from the different monarchies of eastern europe . The rest is history",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"nationalism mainly developed in england and central france , neither are really places where you\\ 'd expect people to meet other nations en masse . Croatia obviously never developed nationalism by itself , it was influenced and/or created by the already-in-place German and Hungarian nationalism , both of which were inspired by the original French nationalism\\n\\ntherefore , obviously nationalism was designed to work in homogeneous areas with homogeneous people , which is why cultural genocide sprees like Germanization and Hungarization happened , but also more recently Bosnia.\\n\\n & gt ; Funny , my rural ancestors got moved about by various morons from various empires , countries , nations , they spoke several languages before an urban traitor in the capital did.\\n\\nWell the way i understand it , the cultural/social progress went like this : \\n1 , - aristocratic society where nations don\\'t matter and therefore is tolerant and accepting with different nations \\n2 , - nationalistic society where classes are formally gone ( still present but that\\ 's a different story ) and is culturally intolerant because of the rampant nationalism \\n3 , - modern urban society\\n\\nback then , rural places were still in the first phase , urban areas in the 2nd , while today , the rural areas caught up to the 2nd , but the urban areas are now in for something new which is hindered by the countryside . so yeah , I\\ 'm gon na \ '' spinning in my illusion\ '' , which was in no way challenged by your comment",Uralic,Hungarian

Istencsaszar,europe,How the fuck are these two things related,Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"Well first off , Orthodoxy somehow survived being under Hungarian rule for 900 years . So did all the Slavic nations and Romanians in Hungary . Compare , say , how well West Slavic nations survived under German rule ( Ostsiedlung ) . Or how well Arabs survived under Spanish rule . Or how well the Irish survived under British rule.\\n\\nAs I also already said , under Hungarian rule was the first law on religious freedom enacted in Transylvania , that guaranteed the religiously incredibly diverse population to practice their religion freely . Those communities ( protestant , catholic , orthodox , unitarian , other Protestant branches I have no idea about , also Armenians , who I think are Miaphysite ? ) remained basically intact for centuries.\\n\\nAlso there was for example a joint uprising of Hungarian and Romanian peasants against the nobles ( 1437 )",Uralic,Hungarian
Istencsaszar,europe,"& gt ; the \ '' minorities\ '' that they ruled over for hundreds of years in not the most pleasant ways.\\n\\nwell , it\\ 's a fact that it wasn\\'t pleasant and I can emphatize , but Hungary was still the most tolerant towards minorities in pretty much all of Europe ( which is sad , i would really expect it from the west to be better , but they aren\\'t ) .\\n\\nThe first country with freedom of religion was Transylvania , ruled by Hungarians . The first country to enact experimental minority protection laws was also Hungary in 1849 . So it\\ 's not like there weren\\'t efforts.\\n\\n & gt ; If they were enlightened , if they allowed the minorities to preserve their religions , customs , languages and didn\\'t treat them as 3rd-class citizens\\n\\nyou know that this was exactly this way under the dualist system ? there was nothing on your citizenship that said \ '' this guy isn\\'t Hungarian , treat him worse\ '' . The legit complaints that you could have was the language use and native language schooling ( which was , albeit possible , limited ) . Voting rights were limited not by ethnicity , but by wealth , so a wealthy non-Hungarian could just as well vote and once again *poor Hungarians could also not vote* . Probably something about religion too but Hungarians are very divided religion-wise and it was even more so back then . And since Hungarians themselves aren\\'t all Catholic at all , I find it hard to believe that Orthodoxy was particularly oppressed , especially since Orthodox priests were on the countrywide religious council ( 10 seats out of 56 or 18 % , this is roughly the same as how many Orthodox people there were in the country ) , and Orthodoxy had the status of *religio recepta* since 1791 , the same status Protestant religions had .",Uralic,Hungarian
