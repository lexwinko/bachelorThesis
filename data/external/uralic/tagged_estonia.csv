The content of that law is simply bad and of no use , but at least it\\ 's SOMETHING and makes a point . The awful thing is that when the parliament was discussing the law , I found out that a lot of my friends are flaming idiots , who think that allowing two gay men to legalise their partnership will make it possible for them to adopt random children at their will ( really , I don\\'t get the concept ) . They have a bunch of other hilarious opinions . And of course - gay women is a whole different story ... There is a movement here called Perekonna ja Traditsiooni Kaitseks ( bad translation : To Protect Family and Tradition ) . The opponents to that wierd organisation always emphasize that our traditional families don\\'t need protection , but that doesn\\'t seem to come accross.\\n\\nI know that people should know better and not be idiots , but still I want to clarify the reasons why being gay is well ... frowned upon . The Soviet Union banned gays . They were jailed and sometimes killed . My granny was quite a party animal in her time and knew lots of famous people in Estonia . She also knew that many of them were gay . She was ok with it , but most people weren\\'t as it was a crime and the one\\ 's that were suspected being gay , were actors , artists and singers that had it better than the common factory workers.\\n\\nAfter the soviet regime fell \ '' gay\ '' was not a hot topic . We had some more pressing matters . It wasn\\'t illegal to be gay , but 50 years of the regime had done it\\ 's job brainwashing several generations . Today it\\ 's safe to say that the one\\ 's against gay marriage are mostly older people remembering the Soviet times and poorly educated young people that have not been taught to think for themselves . I don\\'t want to excuse the homophobia here . I just wanted to state the reasons that most people have.\\n\\nEdit : I forgot to point out that the surveys showed what we all suspected - our local Russian community is by far more against gay marriage than Estonians .

No country will trust the treaty and that\\ 'll be the end of it.\\n\\nOkay , so we just create a new one . League of Nations - & gt ; United Nations .

Everybody knows what\\ 's going on in Ukraine , did you ever hear a NATO member saying something like : \ '' Huh , maybe Russians tell the truth , nothing it\\ 's going on there ? \ '' \\n\\nCountries are members of NATO . Countries don\\'t always take official positions on everything . Sometimes it\\ 's convenient for them not to say anything at all - just like when they divided Europe after World War 2 and left a whole bunch of nation states under Russian control . End result is that those countries had half a century of falling behind.\\n\\nIn the media it will definitely *not* be a clear-cut case .

But for big countries like Germany etc - sure , I agree with you . Also speaking of history : \\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Panama\\n\\nUS defeates the professional army of Panama ( which they actually helped to train etc ) in a month , losing 23 men.\\n\\nhttps : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Kuwait\\n\\nIraq steamrolls the professional military of Kuwait and occupies the country in 2 days.\\n\\n & gt ; I agree but still if we invest in Defense our army won\\'t become that much more than it already is\\n\\nBy that I mostly meant that the main players ( Germany & amp ; France mainly ) of Europe should do that . And it\\ 's fine if you have a small military , because during wartime it will function as part of coalition forces.\\n",Uralic,Estonian

As for smaller countries - nobody expects you to have an army of hundreds of thousands . So what you can do is minmax for maximum efficiency and continue co-operating through NATO . Strategic-level stuff isn\\'t something you should worry about anyway ( unless Germans decide to invade you again ) because that\\ 's the task of by relevant NATO planning groups.\\n\\n Although strategic stuff is often hindered by the attitude of Western Europe : \\n & gt ; Attempts by General John Craddock to push through defence planning for the Baltic were stymied by German-led opposition in western Europe , anxious to avoid upsetting the Kremlin.\\n\\nAlso that cancerous attitude the is main reason why there really hasn\\'t been large-scale exercises of moving equipment , troops etc . ( Russia does that regularly , btw ) despite logistics being a critical part of warfare.\\n\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Which is exactly why a European Army would be a good idea in my POV.\\n\\nConscription army can still be pretty good , look at Israel or Finland . Their militaries are very good & amp ; competent for small countries . As for Baltics - conscription is probably the only choice due to our location . Also if there\\ 's support from NATO - no EU army is needed .

This is intellectually dishonest thinking.\\n\\nYes , we can all yammer on about the marketplace of ideas and demonstrate how the US doesn\\'t ban Nazi rhetoric and consequently has no giant Nazi problem , because the ideas themselves are unappealing to most Americans.\\n\\nBut this doesn\\'t mean that all ideas are the same , or all populations are the same . Fundamentalist Islam is not interested in winning the hearts and minds of the native populations of Western countries . It is aimed at cultural minorities within those countries , to prevent them from assimilating . It is virulent tribalism that by design rejects debate and pluralism . When you criticize its ideas , you end up with a knife in your chest or zealots with automatic weapons screaming Allahu Akbar as they gun you down.\\n\\nIt\\ 's even immunized against internal reform - to criticize a fellow Muslim\\ 's interpretation of their religion is explicitly prohibited.\\n\\nWhen middle class British teenagers are convinced by the rhetoric of ISIS to abandon their homes and go to a despotic state in an abhorrent war zone in order to become the submissive brides of holy warriors , then it should be clear to everyone that we can\\'t treat this ideology as just another idea to be debated . This idea needs to be rooted out , with the threat of violence ( law enforcement ) if necessary.\\n\\n\ '' Radical\ '' Islam is basically Islamism - the doctrine that secular order should be replaced with a theocracy .

That does not mean there\\ 's a slippery slope to banning every other unpleasant ideology - just this particular one , and any others that may prove to be as dangerous to free society and human civilization . The threshold for banning forms of speech is and should remain incredibly high . But to demand that there should be no threshold , even in the face of homegrown suicidal mass murderers produced by an ideology completely in opposition to every value that our civilization is built upon - that is utter lunacy . It is refusing to puncture your body to excise a malignant tumor.\\n\\nIf your country was in a conventional war with a neighbor , would you think it appropriate to preserve absolute free speech by allowing the enemy to set up recruitment camps inside your country ?

Clifford_Banes,europe,"But the whole point is that immigration itself is not the problem , but immigration from places with a culture that\\ 's incompatible with the host country.\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention that many Dutch people of Moroccan decent have integrated just fine\\n\\nMost immigrants integrate \ '' just fine\ '' because they kind of have to . They need jobs and they need human interaction . So if there\\ 's a handful of people from Country X , then they\\ 'll have to get a job alongside the native population , and their friends will have to come from the native population.\\n\\nThe bigger the difference in culture , the bigger the culture shock for the immigrant , but the onus to deal with that has always been on the immigrant . They have to adapt to the culture of the host country.\\n\\nAs soon as the immigrant population from their country of origin hits critical mass and becomes an enclave , they no longer have to deal with the culture shock at all . They don\\'t need to assimilate or integrate or adapt , because they get all their social needs filled by their compatriots . Add to that an overly generous welfare state and they don\\'t even need to integrate into the workforce and interact with locals there.\\n\\nThis is only problematic for some countries of origin . Chinese immigrants have tended to form enclaves and resist integration . But I highly doubt Wilders would give two shits about a Chinatown popping up in Amsterdam . Because Chinese culture is largely compatible with Dutch culture . There are no Chinese morality police vigilantes roaming the streets of any Western country . They stopped practicing misogynistic ritual mutilation ( foot binding ) a century ago.\\n\\nPlease stop using the word \ '' racism\ '' to refer to opposition to particular cultures . \ '' Racism\ '' means the belief that certain groups of people are biologically inferior to others . People who believe that exist , and they are dangerous . Their form of racism should be opposed , but if you define that word to mean \ '' anyone who is not an enthusiastic believer in universal multiculturalism\ '' , it becomes toothless.\\n\\nI do not want mass immigration of Muslims in my country because I think Islam is a horrendous ideology completely at odds with the values of liberalism that our societies are based on . I specifically say \ '' Muslims\ '' , because the fact is that their religion is such a totalitarian force in their lives that this is their self-professed primary identity . Before ethnicity , before nationality , they are Muslim . It is an inextricably political religion that has a proscribed scriptural duty to enforce theocracy . There is no \ '' render unto Caesar\ '' in Islam . And because of this , if they don\\'t culturally integrate , they will never politically integrate.\\n\\nI actually do want immigration as a whole . More people from a diverse selection of cultures will enrich my own . I want my country to be less uniformly white ( which is a result of not ever being a colonial power , not xenophobia ) . But I don\\'t want a single person in my country who could realistically be convinced to join ISIS . Anyone whose worldview offers a path to see that perfect distillation of evil as anything but repugnant is a danger.\\n\\nAs to Wilders , it takes a special kind of willful misreading to construe his comment as a call to ethnic cleansing . I never understood lumping him in with Jobbik and Le Pen , and it really strikes me as a political hatchet job to paint him as some sort of \ '' far right\ '' lunatic . He doesn\\'t fit .

A youth riot broke out that spread to Tallinn center region . Again because censorship denied something and the Soviet regime was partly blamed but it again showed that people were kind of being allowed to riot and Moscow didn\u00b4t really heavily crack down on such events.\\n\\nPoliticians used these events as kind of \ '' independence polls\ '' and seeing how many are singing along , well even coming to such events was a good sign . Obviously the main deal was done by our politicians of that time that took the move , declared independence , seeked contacts from foreign people and played a \ '' nothing at all going on in Estonia\ '' game with Moscow .

So a lot of infrastructure around the country tbh.\\n\\n2 ) Economic difference , we still have a lot of catching up to do , Portugal and Greece are closeby but 70 years is 70 years , its hard to make it up in ~25 years , where the first 5 years you are even worse off than you were before as a fresh re-independent country.\\n\\n3 ) Mentality , some statistics still show us as what we were , ex-commie block , we perform usually as top 3 best in whatever category but we still are in that group . Last thing I viewed was something about female to male ratio in jobs , were we were top 2 when compared to old block countries.\\n\\n4 ) Nation itself , like it or not we have 1/3rd to 1/6th ( depends on your definition ) of Russian first generation or second generation badly bubbled people here and it will take time to assimilate into a one united nation with common ideas . Some people have hammer and cycle flags with Putin shirts ( unironic ) who speak no words of Estonian while the other guy might be some former Werchmaht fighter drafted into the army and still alive and kicking at 85 , such people I doubt will see eye to eye - ever . I once drew a comparison of it being like a mild Palestine/Iran over here when the \ '' right\ '' people meet.\\n\\nStill having said that semi-bad stuff we do have made immense progress in 25 years . A lot of right choice by our early politicians in terms of long term policies . Also closeness to rich countries like the Nordic block is a very nice payoff . More so the 0,5-1,5h distance between Helsinki and Tallinn has allowed for fast idea exchange and a slight boost in catching up.\\n\\nWe have stagnated in recent years ( as has Europe and somewhat Sweden/Finland ) but as such a small economy we can\u00b4t expect to do well when other partners aren\u00b4t . Still our \ '' bad\ '' currently is a small growth so it isn\u00b4t technically that bad at all.\\n\\nWhen we look at Sweden or Finland we cry out of our predicament , when we look at other Soviet block countries we cry out of joy seeing we should not complain that much .

This is for average salaries though that are around 900 eur.\\n\\nWe have entered some kind of second stage as a country/population as we are slowly creeping up on \ '' west Europes\ '' slower runners as are Portugal , Greece and a few others in terms of living standards/economy so we have all these \ '' new\ '' problems as \ '' is the wage increasing too rapidly ? \ '' and \ '' are we going to see somekind of bubble burst in terms of some pricing not catching up\ '' , \ '' is our country still good for investors if we keep growing in terms of taxes ? \ '' . Our minimum for example is being increased by 40 eur each year . It used to be 355 in 2014 , last year it was 390 , now its 430 . Next year 470 so this benefits the \ '' small guy\ '' the most . So it shows the general \ '' slow progression\ '' we are witnessing.\\n\\nFor being a small nation we actually do need just 1 startup to succeed and stay in Estonia for our entire nation to tigerleap in terms of economy . This is our current \ '' country mission\ '' . Before it was the unoriginal \ '' get into NATO , EU , Euro\ '' deal.\\n\\nI find it interesting that our government itself is kind of trying to be a startup with many interesting ideas as is selling ID cards to foreigners in trade of a easy way to do business through our legislation . Also the whole X-road program of allowing all kinds of ideas to link up with the government . Just picture a country establishing a linux server and actually allowing everyone into it who has an idea , to data with legal binding force .\\n\\nIt is however a fairly common opinion that the country is being built up in the correct way . We have our taxes in order , we have our economic discipline and our only gripe is that our economy is growing slow . This is a big fault of ours we can\\'t fix though as losing a chunk of Russian market and the general European growth affects our markets quite badly . Second fault is our population growing old so at some point we will reach a tipping point of social taxes vs taxpayers , it will be interesting to see how it will be solved.\\n\\nEconomy while \ '' growing\ '' , more importantly is not in any way in the negatives for a while so the growth is constant for the forseeable future , much easier to plan ahead a steady economy if you aren\\'t flip flopping around on the scale . In terms of investment we aren\\'t the cheapest anymore and even Lithuania has a lot of startups there , I think even Google went with Lithuania ? Too lazy to Google right now . People friendliness , lets just say we save up on friendliness so in close quarters with closer people we burst out but in general we are \ '' nordic cold\ '' , we do have more European \ '' keep smile\ '' relations though with each year and younger people are in the \ '' Youtube\ '' generation so they kind of are more open.\\n\\nFood in general is shit . We eat peasant grub to this day , potatoes , macaroni , chicken , pork etc . With a touch of more veganism and common sense of cutting back on sugar , oily foods etc ( at least in my social group ) . We are known to eat unhealthy fatty food though.\\n\\nWe are in demand of skilled labour with mostly in IT markets ( and I have seen plenty of foreigners in IT firms ) , if you average the costs of living you can live pretty well with what they offer . Around 2000-3000eur wages ( someone can correct me on this ) afaik.\\n\\nI would conclude and say we are the jack-of-all nations currently .

Dicios,europe,"I think the most interesting thing that was kind of mentioned already was the mentality.\\n\\nMy parents for example and as I have seen and heard , parents of others who lived in the communist era are somewhat more introverted and \ '' broken\ '' I would say . During the time of the system people had more taboo topics ( even if it was work , money etc related ) , more pessimism , less control of their lives ( houses were given , jobs were more or less streamlined though schools etc ) . So this created mental complexes.\\n\\nIf I compare how I talk with my sister and how my mother talks with my grandmother then there is a very certain \ '' hush hush\ '' kind of situation on certain topics . People don\\'t like to talk.\\n\\nNow it\\ 's a dog eat dog world . Again if I compare to what I have seen imho there aren\\'t any more taboo about life questions , people slam questions right in front of you be it money , living conditons , future plans etc . As the world is more open you are made to grow a thicker skin or get stuck in the cogwheels of capitalism at some level.\\n\\nI do feel there is a split of \ '' communist thinking\ '' when I look at my parents and an open market capitalist world . Maybe it is the society as a whole as the facebook generation kind of makes every person a product , we all have become walking CV\\'s.\\n\\nAs for a realistic result of those 70 years , economy and systems . Governance systems were set in stone and they were hard to restructure . You still hear from one institution or another how the basic idea how something works is still from the Communist era , not that surprising considering Communism collapsed only ~1988-1991 but I would consider it a bad thing seeing how corruption seeped in , in such a large system as USSR was.\\n\\nEconomy suffered because again , such a large system , does not govern everything correctly . As a independent unit Estonia knows their own shortcoming and investment needs . Before it was made to address the needs of Moscow first , discussion of what Estonian USSR went through them , not through ... Estonia . Somewhat similar problem with the EU but currently this is the block with the best structure , transparency and ability to stay less corrupt on average so more money finds it way to where it should be.\\n\\nBut hey , let bygones be bygones , I guess our generations life isn\\'t the worst ( yet ) .

Baltic people were often not trusted to fight near their own homeland though as they might try to escape the army or get conflicted views assaulting their own cities.\\n\\n4 ) Refugees sometimes formed batallions in foreign countries to fight from other Allied sides .

Dicios,europe,"& gt ; A question for you , if I may -- do the Russians have a sense of cultural superiority w.r.t the Estonians ? I agree with you that people who are comfortable in their enclaves do not have a pressing need to integrate ( in fact , the world outside the enclave becomes a \ '' scary\ '' prospect ) but is there an element of \ '' our culture/language is superior to that of the locals\ '' ? Or are you on pretty even footing ? \\n\\nI\\ 'm sure a Russian Estonian can answer it better but we are pretty much on equal footing.\\n\\nThere are a small percentage , with sometimes loud voices who wants to deport every Russian back if they say anything negative about Estonia or them and those who want back the \ '' good old Soviet times\ '' when Russians still had an empire or blame every personal fault on the Estonian government . So both sides have the obvious , unstable ... I guess , people.\\n\\nRussian speakers simply have a strong enough culture to draw from right next to them . The biggest stepping stone for everyone is language , Estonians mostly learn Russian but that quality isn\\'t good at all . Same way Russians do learn Estonian , probably better than Estonians Russian , but even for them its hard enough with pure classroom knowledge to come into Estonian groups.\\n\\nMore importantly I think Estonians don\\'t have a realistic inferiority complex . A country of about a million managing to regain independence through a history of different rulers , also the fairly recent loss of the Russian Soviet empire , is something that lifts most of the peoples spirits . Even if some Russians do feel superior there are enough Estonians who probably boast just as much.\\n\\nI do think most Russian Estonians are trying to find their role in society as they aren\\'t fully Russian and they aren\\'t fully Estonian so each of them has to find their comfortable zone of how much of their home brought up culture they want in their life and how much of \ '' Estonian side\ '' they want to experience . Choices like \ '' Do I put my kid in a Russian or Estonian speaking kindergarten ? \ '' is something that come up for Russian Estonians and not the other way around . Also mixed families where kids often speak fluently Estonian and Russian have something of a conundrum from what speaking school to what working environment.\\n\\nSo I guess yes , the knowledge that there is a 140 million big state and even bigger cultural sphere of Russian speakers is something that holds Estonian Russians back knowing they are having to learn the ways of something that was just some decades ago their small territory , perhaps deep inside somewhat demeaning I guess ( and unique when it comes to immigration problems ) but its not superiority per say . More of a sad predicament they find themselves in and having to adjust quickly within same generations.\\n\\nI do think it is still early and a 30 % minority does not go away in 25-30 years .

Usually , as logical , its some sort of Estonian address and as they don\\'t need to hide it its easier to verify if it is indeed where the packet got sent . If a diverse range of locations where used and all the traffic nodes of various companies can confirm a inflow of traffic through their servers it can be again physically verified that the traffic indeed came from multiple sources and not some uber hacker sending a lot of information about all the votes from one place . These things can be traced , its usually a question of \ '' how long it takes\ '' .\\n\\nWe still have that diverseness as people use different locations and their imprint of connecting and sending that packet gets left in the log .

In Europe , you\\ 're called a \ '' foreigner\ '' even if you\\ 're a 3rd generation immigrant , born and raised in Europe . If you\\ 're German , you understand who the word \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' applies to . My Turkish friends who are very secular , open minded , speak perfect Germans are still referred to as \ '' Ausl\u00e4nder\ '' by people like me.\\n\\nBut the US is a very different country . Every American is basically a new age immigrant . Only in US a question like \ '' Where are your roots ? \ '' is common enough to get an answer \ '' Originally part Irish , part Scottish\ '' etc etc.\\n\\nThere is no real \ '' American\ '' besides the Indian tribes.\\n\\nEuropean countries are old enough with indigenous populations that people have a picture of an average Swede or Brit , or German . Obviously a third generation Turk will stand out.\\n\\nYou are somehow trying to \ '' wish away\ '' the differences between origins and citizens.\\n\\nIn US from the get go ( besides Indians who sardonically got wiped away by the immigrants ... ) . US has no real first timers alive , everyone is simply a citizen . In Europe things are a tiny bit complicated and you can\\'t simply do away with thousands of years of history . There is a heavy percentage of citizens who also have their origins in that place for hundreds or even thousands of years by some bloodline . Old habits and traditions are slow to fade away and you are asking the near impossible . Again US had a very different start.\\n",Uralic,Estonian
Dicios,europe,"Integration services are horrible , otherwise integration would be successful . There are no people that can not be integrated even if they don\\'t want to . Integration is a natural process and is not something you can fight if the host country is open to having you.\\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\\nNope , nope no no no and NO.\\n\\nThis is the rose tinted glasses way of integration , this is the Disney movie integration . This is the children PG13 integration . You are basically saying \ '' it simply happens\ '' .\\n\\nEstonia has had a culturally different community for ages . We are a good \ '' testtube\ '' of a country with a large minority . \\n\\nEstonian Russians and Estonians still live in two different worlds . Different tv channels , different languages , you can even tell apart different clothe styles and hairstyles that Russian kids have and Estonian kids have.\\n\\nYes there are free state ( and thereby tax funded ) Russian language schools that also teach Estonian heavily and yes there are all kinds of projects done on media landscape or \ '' cooperative\ '' type of projects . Problem is they don\\'t work . If they feel comfortable ( as most Russians do feel ) they don\\'t see a need to change anything , they have Russian schools , Russian friends , Russian tv channels , all state sites have Russian versions etc etc . \\n\\nThey don\\'t need to integrate at all . The society has already changed enough to accompany them and not the other way around as they forcefully became apart of Estonian society . Obviously not their fault at all , just as Estonians were deported to Siberian regions , they were semi-forcefully deported to Estonia ( some came as families with the army to keep locals under a solid foot ) .\\n\\nIn Siberia also Estonian villages formed and they created their own culture sphere trying to keep it alive.\\n\\nPoint being its idiotic to expect a nation to basically handfeed and cart every single individual to force them to integrate . If they don\\'t really want to integrate they won\\'t , simple as that . Integration is a two way process.\\n\\nWhat is \ '' positive\ '' at least in Estonia is that a very slow process is bringing Russian Estonians away from the Russian federation citizens so at least they are their own culture group besides actual Russians and Estonians . Also a small percentage do get integrated toward Estonian averages but it will still take decades to get anywhere.\\n\\nAlso as a disclaimer I must say I am not xenophobic , Russian Estonians have every right to have their space , just as Americans say \ '' I might not agree with them but I will defend their rights with them\ '' but the willy-nilly integration that you picture is not real , its in la-la land . It is not that black and white and simple.\\n\\nLiving in a country with a forcefully relocated minority of 30 % is not something you want in a country .

Dicios,europe,"Well your question should then be worded as publishers . Simply major investors who pay for the development costs and share revenue.\\n\\nThere are probably many puzzle pieces why there is no European majors besides Ubisoft ( that is actually comparable to even EA ) .\\n\\n1 ) What is a European market ? We have a lot of different languages , cultures , world views . It would be nearly impossible to produce a game that hits off to the \ '' European market\ '' . There is no easy way to entice entire Europe to play \ '' EU Call of Duty\ '' , you can\\'t fistbump the European Union flag and hope people share that ideal.\\n\\nSo a very mixed market makes it hard for their own buyers to buy anything.\\n\\n2 ) In the game of banking or investment the early bird does get the worm . Americans , Japanese have had time to gobble up plenty of practice and smaller developers that produce their main titles . As we gamers all know it only takes like 3-4 major series to lift your company from zero to hero . Assassins Creeds , World of Warcraft , Call of Duty etc . All had quite a humble beginning.\\n\\n_______________________\\n\\nBesides European developers usually don\\'t aim as high and don\\'t always go for $ $ bill . Eg Notch selling Minecraft , arguably a fairly established \ '' world player\ '' .\\n\\nThen for example World of Tanks that proclaim to have 60 million users with 1,1 million players at the same time . They even passed World of Warcraft in terms of ingame item revenue . Yes WoT is based on only that as a f2p game but even the fact that a f2p game managed to one up the already paying WoW huge userbase speaks volumes.\\n\\nObviously we can\\'t miss Ubisoft that managed to luck out and create a uber successful 3-4 game hit studio that again as mentioned before rivals EA in terms of revenue estimates.\\n\\nAlternatively the most successful Youtuber gamer is Pewdiepie who probably earns \ '' per capita\ '' the most , he is probably the most valuable gamer thus far . No actual running costs as any of the large firms have . ( Also hard to continue the brand once he puts gaming on hold but still , shows something ) \\n\\n____________\\n\\nSo to conclude I would say we simply don\\'t have a unified market enough to boost our own companies and have to by default appeal to mostly English speaking nations or Asian ones.\\n\\nSo the American companies kind of have a better starting hand and European companies have to work a little harder to appeal to firstly the large established American base , then the Asian world and Europeans , already having integrated to the common gaming base that is mostly influenced by American companies , tags along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",Uralic,Estonian

You have 1 card for everything important .

Its like what smartphones did to our culture in card from , meaning we use it for such mundane reasons it became part of our lives .

So far it is still at the start of things but even such mundane things as bank logins , government communication and parking is a really great sign of how little can change so much .

In 1995 , following reunification , Germany began making the final payments towards the loans .

Just like it would help with anything else - Hell , I can\\'t think of a single aspect of my life that wouldn\\'t be improved if someone threw money at it but when it comes to children then there is just much more to it than just money . \\n\\nHow many of us can honestly say that they consider themselves to be at an age , in a good rock-solid relationship and are ready to be in it for the long haul but just don\\'t have the money to raise children ? Generations today simply aren\\'t wired like that . Many of us have shifted towards two separate extremes . The first simply find the idea of having a family unappealing , they might even be in a relationship and well off financially but would rather just extend their youth , travel and see the world rather than get bogged down with a couple of kids . For others the idea of a family has become extremely romanticized and idealized and finding such a perfect partner ( who would also reciprocate your feelings ) has become nearly impossible.\\n\\nAnd coming back to money . You don\\'t really need that much money to raise a kid but we think we do because our expectations have grown . If we drop the high expectations and the urge to appear to be better , raising your children suddenly becomes a lot cheaper : \\n\\nChildren\\ 's clothing is expensive ... only when you shop at the expensive stores , you can dress your child up for less than a tenner at your local second-hand store ( minus the shoes ) .\\n\\nSports practice , dancing and music lessons , hobbies etc are all expensive ... but your child doesn\\'t really need them . Here is a football , take it and go play with other children at the playground.\\n\\nUniversity tuition fees are exorbitant ... so don\\'t go there . Trade school and your child can start making money on his own right away.\\n\\nThat\\ 's how the previous - mostly working class - families did it , and that\\ 's how the population grew.\\n\\nThe society today almost demands us to be more successful than our parents and to demonstrate our success .

ExWei,AskEurope,"& gt ; Preface : I hope I don\\'t come off as rude or confrontational , I merely strongly disagree with many of the points you\\ 're saying . In today\\ 's times , many political arguments become rather ugly , and I want to make sure you know I don\\'t mean any of this personally.\\n\\nI understand and I even upvoted all your comments in this thread . Ironically , I am getting downvoted for having a different opinion - had I say something like \ '' Drumpf is Hitler\ '' it would be the opposite . Truly , nowadays people are offended just by the mere fact that someone with different opinion exists ( I do not mean you there ) .\\n\\n & gt ; No , he wasn\\'t . Mattis was an OBAMA pick , whom Trump actually wanted to sack . He\\ 's only still there because the Hill Republicans convinced Trump to leave someone with experience in place , because there is literally not a single other person in the entire administration who knows anything about defence.\\n\\nHow Mattis was an Obama pick when Obama fired Mattis in 2013 - http : //www.weeklystandard.com/obama-fires-top-general-without-even-a-phone-call/article/697744 ? Once Mattis assumed the office he also harshly criticized Obama - http : //www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/1/james-mad-dog-mattis-retired-us-commander-rips-oba/\\n\\n & gt ; I can\\'t find a record of Trump ever praising Estonia for that . The absolute closest I can find is him saying that countries that pay over 2 % are ones they wouldn\\'t break the treaty on , which includes Estonia , although I would think to be rather concerning since the European countries around Estonia matter more than the US itself . \\n\\nI have sent you the link in the previous comment - http : //news.err.ee/219493/trump-sends-congratulation-note-to-kaljulaid , quote from there - *\ '' He also recognized Estonian efforts within NATO , in particular its achievement of the 2 percent GDP goal regarding defense spending.\ '' * . There is also some Trump\\ 's comment about Ukraine ( in the same article ) - *\ '' Your support for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine is important for our shared goal of enhancing European and regional security.\ '' *\\n\\n & gt ; Estonia would be much more reliant on Germany or the Scandinavian countries actually fighting on the ground\\n\\nWell sure , look at this article for example - [ Finnish defense minister wouldn\\'t allow in NATO forces aiding Estonia ] ( http : //news.err.ee/596302/finnish-defense-minister-wouldn-t-allow-in-nato-forces-aiding-estonia ) .\\n\\n & gt ; \u201cWell , we don\u2019t rely on American banks , we have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d \\n\\nIt was said only about golf courses\\n\\n & gt ; He had strong prexisting financial connections to Russia long before ever running for president , including a slew of properties , and there is absolutely no reason to think that has changed \\n\\nThere are many properties branded with \ '' Trump , Inc\ '' in US . Trump had several contacts with Russian investors but it seems that he did not build anything in Russia in the result - [ see this link ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_projects_of_Donald_Trump_in_Russia ) \\n\\n & gt ; refuses to release his tax returns\\n\\nWell that\\ 's really bad\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Sanctions against Russia are still in force\\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and that is something Trump has been fighting tooth and nail to change , and something he might still manage . Obama put many of the sanctions you\\ 're referring to in place . Do you praise an arsonist for trying to burn your house down and failing , and shame the builder who made it in the first place for not making it fireproof ? That is , to my understanding , what you are telling me.\\n\\nYes , it was Obama who initiated them . Trump is President for already 6 months and he still did not cancel them .\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; There are more US troops on the Russian border than it was during Obama\\ 's presidency\\n\\n & gt ; *sigh* . They weren\\'t put in there under Trump\\ 's watch , it was under Obama\\ 's . Look at the date on that article . The order was signed by him before he left office , and Trump arrived just soon enough to take his place at the podium . Again , how on earth is this Trump\\ 's doing ? It\\ 's an order designed by Obama , signed by Obama , and simply couldn\\'t get finished before his term ran out . Trump came into office , had no idea whether he should stop it or not , and decided to trust that Obama knew what he was doing . Do you believe that your postman somehow manages to write such passionate letters on your friend\\ 's behalf ? That he crafts everything you receive in the mail ? No , he merely delivers a pre-made package , and the same occurred here.\\n\\nWell Trump could easily cancel them * ( if he would be really pro-Russian ) * just like he trying to introduce the travel ban . Just as with the sanctions , 6 months later since Trump assumed office - US troops are still on the Russian border and there is no sign of moving them.\\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Assad got punished for his chemical attack\\n\\n & gt ; I would even be willing to argue with you here , it was a tiny slap on the wrist that caused no long term damage . In exchange , he spent almost $ 60 million of military equipment , which is about 10 % of Estonia\\ 's entire military spending for a whole year . Action definitely needed to be taken , I\\ 'm not arguing with you there , but that was arguably an incredibly expensive attack for relatively gain , hmm ? \\n\\nWhy does it mater how many % of Estonia military spending it is - it was US who took that action , not Estonia.\\n\\nIt definitely costed some money but now Assad seems to be not trying to pull this trick again . Also , what was the EU response to that attack ( except just talks ) - nothing . \\n\\n & gt ; & gt ; Trump tried to push other NATO countries to spend more on defence ( obviously Putin would hate that ) \\n\\n & gt ; Yeah , and these countries would also hate it . Just take Germany , for example ; if we spent 2 % of our budget on military , we\\ 'd already be outspending Russia by 40 % , just by ourselves . Imagine if France and the UK chipped in ; that\\ 's a little excessive , or ? It\\ 's easy for Estonia to spend 2 % because you have a rather small economy , but for a relatively small country surrounded by allies and with no overseas territories , I see no reason why we should pay that much . More than what we do at the moment , I can agree to that with the rather shoddy state our military is in , but we already pay for much of the EU\\ 's infrastructure and bail out a ton of poor countries . We\\ 're not paying for an entire continent\\ 's army as well.\\n\\nThere could be reasons to disagree with the 2 % target goal , but my point is that Russia would definitely hate that if everyone would be really spending 2 % - it contradicts with the theory that Trump is pro-Russian ( originally claimed by the comment that I responded to ) .\\n\\nSo , what was my original comment : \\n\\n & gt ; \ '' Still that \ '' buddy of the Russian oligarchy\ '' did a lot more for deterrence against Russia than any other NATO or EU country.\ '' \\n\\nSo does any EU country has more troops on the Russian border than US has ? No .",Uralic,Estonian
ExWei,AskEurope,"So if Trump would be pro-Russian he would stop all these deployments probably , he is the \ '' Commander in Chief\ '' after all ? But he did not , and even more , he intensified these deployments as you said .

ExWei,europe,"& gt ; & gt ; Before the Soviet occupation Estonia was ahead of Finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . In 1995 ( after USSR collapsed ) GDP per capita in Estonia was $ 3,044 . In Finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . Now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850.\\n\\n & gt ; I think your figures are wrong there because Estonia still has half the GDP per capita of Finland . \\n\\nWell they are not wrong because current Finland GDP PPP is $ 43,090 and Estonian one is $ 30,850 , the difference is not a half . So this is a fact that ~50 years of the USSR occupation literally ruined the economy and now it significantly recovered with capitalism - I already described it with exact figures in my above comment.\\n\\n & gt ; Look up the actual theory , disconnect it from what you know from history , and imagine what it could be like , without a lens.\\n\\nWhat is the theory ? Seize the means of production ? What if nobody wants to buy the goods of a factory that is owned by the workers ? How do they get resources to start a production ? What happens to the current business owners ? This theory never worked and will never work - unless socialists find a way to control population via some kind of a hivemind device.\\n\\nTo be honest , even if it would have worked exactly as it written in the theory , I would still dislike it - because no \ '' workers\ '' can realistically manage risk of running an enterprise , and they should not.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t agree with how Soviet Russia ran things , despite being a socialist , all I\\ 'm saying is that it was literally the pinnacle of Russian power.\\n\\nThe pinnacle of Russian power ? Are you talking about 1930-1940 when people were being sent to gulags , or about the other part when they were queuing for bread from 6am ? \\n\\nToday Russians at least have some freedom - they can travel to foreign countries , read foreign newspapers and do business . All this was impossible in USSR.\\n\\nIt was the pinnacle only if you measure it in number of tanks and nukes.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition , have you ever actually looked at what Russia did wrong ? It was corruption in government , sectarianism , inefficient management , a one-party system that never needed to change , stagnation , isolation . None of those are something a socialist would agree with.\\n\\nSoviet Russia was also an aggressive imperialist state that attacked its neighboring countries . I often hear socialists talking about the Western Imperialism but never about Soviet imperialism.\\n\\n & gt ; This needs restating . Are you saying Marx tried to build communism ? He didn\\'t , he formed the theory , which you still need to read\\n\\nI am aware enough of the theory that wants to ruin everything . \ '' Seize the means of production\ '' - yeah lets remove people who built businesses using their capital and knowledge and put a bunch of uneducated workers in charge , I wonder how it will work out.\\n\\nAlso , since everything is seized and owned by the workers , does it mean that e.g . on a nuclear plant , a nuclear engineer and a janitor are equal in terms of what they can get ? \\n\\n & gt ; instead of taking your views from pure lies.\\n\\nSure it is pure lies , probably that\\ 's because I never was in a post-Soviet country which was not decimated by USSR occupation and Russia is far away from me . Of course IRL post-communism * ( the country called itself communist and other kind of communism did not exist yet ) * knowledge is nothing compared to some theory that never worked exactly as described and even if it would have worked ( \ '' seize the means of production\ '' ) it would be only slightly better.\\n\\n & gt ; North Korea calls itself Socialist , do you believe them as well ? \\n\\nI believe that they are communist , because USSR was very similar to them and also called themselves communist .",Uralic,Estonian

There is many civil wars ( so-called conflicts ) in Africa going on at the moment and none of them because of imperialism or climate .

Also , the non-citizens can\\'t vote only in national elections - in local elections they can vote as much as they want . So , non-citizens are only those who moved to Estonia during the USSR occupation ( so they are kind of \ '' illegal immigrants\ '' ) - it does not depend on their ethnicity .

Estonia separated from Soviet Union 25 years ago and there are still enough \ '' stupid Soviet people\ '' and even more , they are breeding .

If they pass easy language test then they get citizenship . It does not look like as a second class to me.\\n\\nI think this thing about the \ '' second class citizens\ '' goes from e.g . that they have their own Russian-language schools , but , nobody ( except their parents ) is forcing Russian kids to go there . Ironically , it is pro-Russian politicians who support this kind of \ '' apartheid\ '' . Non citizens are also eligible for all social benefits like pension , etc.\\n\\nAlso , some Russians even do not want to get Estonian citizenship because if they are non-citizens then they have visa free travel to Russia.\\n\\n\\nSo to sum up what I said : They are not second class citizens and if they want , they can really easily get that citizenship .",Uralic,Estonian

Nobody was pillaging Serbia in the past 50 years , while there is the opposite in case of Estonia . Serbs do not want reforms and this is root of the issue - nobody is preventing them from reforms and your only argument is *\ '' You sound like an 18 year old\ '' *.\\n\\nAlso , since you edited your previous comment , I will address it there : \\n\\n & gt ; I\\ 'm sure you\\ 're aware of the fact that poverty is the primary source of corruption .

What business can you do when your whole market is limited to a small and closed balkan country ? The reforms have been designed to protect the local business and keep out foreign competition.\\n\\nYou are very wrong here . \ '' Ease of doing business\ '' is about dealing with tax authorities , setting up a business , getting permits , etc . If it is a pain in the ass to setup a local business , how exactly it \ '' protects the local business\ '' ? If they would do reforms their local business would be stronger and their economy would attract foreign investments.\\n\\nYour original point was : \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it\\ 's so simple to reform.\\n\\nAnd once I proved that it happened in other countries before , you started saying *\ '' reforms are not needed if & lt ; list of excuses & gt ; \ '' * .",Uralic,Estonian

In reality it is between Russia and Latvia , while being separated from Sweden and Finland by the Baltic Sea . Norway is so far from being near so I am not sure how to comment that .

If not reforms then there would not be EU membership and would not be foreign investments .

ExWei,europe,"Who goes hand-in-hand ? \\n\\n & gt ; It\\ 's simply ignorant of you to play the blame game , and make it sound like it\\ 's so simple to reform.\\n\\nYeah , if you really want to , it is really simple.\\n\\nWhen USSR collapsed GDP per capita in Estonia was 8 times lower than in Finland ( $ 3000 vs $ 26000 ) , because Estonian economy was pillaged by the Soviet occupation . Then in 2004 Estonia joined EU - it took 13 years . Now in Estonia GDP is $ 29,543 and Finland it is $ 40,455 - 27 % difference , compare it to the 8 times difference just when Soviet occupation ended.\\n\\nNow , lets look at e.g . Serbia : \\n\\nYugoslavia collapsed 25 years ago - they are still nowhere close to EU membership , their economy sucks and corruption is rampant .

ExWei,europe,"I , as someone who lives in EU , can not imagine that sanctions against US states from EU will ever exist . You used Russia as an example - but US economy is a lot bigger than the Russian one and it would really hit EU if introduce such sanctions . EU trade with US is 20 % .\\n\\nAlso - could you imagine what uproar it would create ? Shell Oil Company ( HQ in US is in Texas ) , for example , is Netherlands-owned - Wilders is already almost got elected in Netherlands , imagine what would happen if Netherlands economy would be hit with such sanctions ? Brexit happened because of temporal discomfort * ( let\\ 's not pretend there were no issues ) * but a total ban on trade with some US states would be a lot larger discomfort . You can care as much as you want about environment and ethics but if you are unemployed because of the sanctions then you would probably care about money over environment . EU countries would lose billions of euros , thousands would lose jobs - guess for which party they would vote ? For that one that promises to leave EU and cancel the sanctions.\\n\\n & gt ; My point is not everything should be about money and neoliberalism.\\n\\nI agree , there should be limits . But we can not allow e.g . Saudi Arabia that literally stones gays and women to be allowed , and the red states to be banned for \ '' ethics and environment\ '' .\\n\\nIMO first sort out Saudi Arabia , Qatar and North Korea , and only then think about red states - probably while trying to sort out Saudi Arabia , Trump will be already gone.\\n\\n**edit : ** and what would be US response to these sanctions ? Wage full trade war with EU ? Sorry , but we in EU do not want it .",Uralic,Estonian
ExWei,europe,"& gt ; If you have a real argument make it\\n\\nOk , let me rephrase my argument : \\n\\nYour claim was \ '' yes pull all investment from red states only invest in blue areas\ '' \\n\\n1 . How exactly do you see \ '' pulling all investments from red states\ '' ? Make some law that would prohibit private EU companies from owning shares in the states that vote republican ? As of today , EU companies can freely own shares in almost every country * ( I believe it excludes North Korea and other similar countries ) * , even in popular tax planning countries ( aka \ '' tax havens\ '' ) such as BVI . Outlaw Republican states so they would be in the same list as North Korea ? It sounds like dictatorship.\\n\\n2 . ( # 1 continues ) Ok , lets assume this law is created and it passed , what would likely happen : all affected EU companies would either create a subsidiary or move legal residence to somewhere like BVI where they would not be bothered by such laws , and then they would continue managing their investments into Republican states from there . So what would EU gain from that : instead of getting at least some % from the dividends from the US investments , EU would get 0 % from that.\\n\\n3 . I see you indirectly compared Texas to \ '' a nazi death camp\ '' in [ the other comment ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6futrk/eu_to_ignore_white_house_and_work_directly_with/dily6o3/ ) . What exactly Texas is doing that it deserves such comparisons ? Votes republican ? With countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar being allowed , it would be an ultimate double-standard to ban Texas.\\n\\n4 . On your argument on the better places for investments ( higher ROI ) . What prevents the blue states from improving their business environment to make them more attractive for investments ? Why there should be some kind of *affirmative action* to discriminate against some states ( that are \ '' guilty\ '' of voting for a different party ) ? It is like if you would have a fast car and you neighbor would have a slow car , so they would break your tires so your speed would be equal ( or worse ) .\\n\\n5 . You also say \ '' Get Asia on board too\ '' - what do you mean there ? Force private companies to invest to Asia ( many of them are already doing that - thanks to their business friendless and good ROI due to local factors ) ? The same with \ '' invest blue states only\ '' - how are you going to make companies to do that ? \\n\\nMy point is that there should be fair , free market - you are a blue state and you want investments ? Great , make yourself more competitive to win it from the red states .

Please read at least [ some Wikipedia article about that ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_nationality_law ) , for example . Especially the \ '' historical precedents of undefined citizenship\ '' . I will quote it for you : \\n\\n & gt ; \\'Undefined citizenship\\ ' ( Estonian : kodakondsuseta isik , Russian : \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ) is a term used in Estonia to denote a post-Soviet form of statelessness . It is applied to those migrants from former Soviet republics and their children , who were unable or unwilling to pursue any country\\ 's citizenship after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Russia being a successor state to the Soviet Union , all former USSR citizens qualified for citizenship of Russian Federation , available upon mere request , as provided by the law \ '' On the RSFSR Citizenship\ '' in force up to end of 2000 . [ 4 ] Estonia\\ 's policy of requiring naturalisation of post-war immigrants was in part influenced by Russia\\ 's citizenship law and the desire to prevent dual citizenship , [ 5 ] and upon the established legal principle that persons who settle under the rule of an occupying power gain no automatic right to nationality . According to Peter Van Elsuwege , a scholar in European law at Ghent University , **a number of historic precedents support this** , most notably the case of Alsace-Lorraine when France on recovering the territory in 1918 did not automatically grant French citizenship to German settlers despite Germany having annexed the territory 47 years earlier in 1871 . [ 6 ] \\n\\nPersons of undefined citizenship who reside legally in Estonia can apply for an alien\\ 's passport . Estonian alien\\ 's passport allows visa-free travel within Schengen treaty countries for a maximum of 90 days in a 6-month period . [ 7 ] Alternatively they are entitled to naturalise as citizens and receive an Estonia passport , and more than half have opted to do so since 1992 . [ 8 ] \\n\\n & gt ; if the netherlands revokes a terrorists citizenship to prevent him from coming back , then they are violating this particular human right as well ( which is why the discussion on whether to do this is an ongoing debate in my country ) .\\n\\nIn Denmark , if you are terrorist [ you lose Danish citizenship ] ( http : //www.middleeasteye.net/news/denmark-strips-man-citizenship-fighting-596200382 ) . Is Denmark also \ '' not normal world\ '' for you ? \\n\\n & gt ; because this particular human right does not have preconditions however reasonable they may look like to you\\n\\nNothing prevents them from becoming Russian citizens . They all are eligible to become Russian citizens because they were Soviet citizens and Russia is a successor of USSR . Estonia is not a successor of USSR.\\n\\nRegarding your second paragraph ... . some formatting would make it more readable by the way.. : \\n\\n & gt ; these soviets have lived there all their lives\\n\\nWrong . Many of them immigrated in 1970s - it is a considerable part of life but not \ '' all\ '' . If you moved in 1970 and after 20 years in 1991 you still do not know the local language - sorry , but you are a bad immigrant.\\n\\n & gt ; this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nLike I said , they are free to get Russian citizenship . Once they get Russian citizenship they still can live in Estonia.\\n\\n & gt ; so in a normal world they should have \\'equal rights\\ ' . however this is not a normal world . \\'native estonians\\ ' do not like them and are very smart . they thought \\'well we are very many so we rule here . and we don\\'t like them\\ ' . But they could not just tell them to go because that would be mean . So they thought on this until a smart Estonian came up with an idea . \\'Well the soviets do not know estonian . so we tell them that they can belong here if they know estonian . that sounds reasonable\\ ' . so they went to the soviets and said \\'we are so generous , we allow any soviets to become estonians , as long as they know estonian\\ ' . the soviets lack of knowledge of estonian is just a politically correct proxy for ethnicity . so to prevent smart people from excluding people they don\\'t like , this is a basic human right with no strings attached.\\n\\nSo is all this an excuse to illegally immigrate to an other country and completely do not try to learn the local language ? Just answer that . Is it okay when you immigrate and don\\'t even try to at least a bit to integrate ? This all is only about their lack of at least slightest integration.\\n\\nHowever , some of them integrate ( and acquire the Estonian citizenship ) and I support that.\\n\\nChances are that you never was in Estonia and yet you are claiming you be an \ '' expert\ '' on the subject . Literally everyone who wanted got that citizenship , only those who do not need / or hate it are without citizenship now.\\n\\nAlso , regarding the discrimination : If I move to , say , Finland , they will want me to learn the Finnish language in order to become a citizen of Finland . Why Russians should get a free pass ? \\n\\nAlso , it seems to be a common misinformation , but all non-citizens are eligible for all benefits like healthcare , pension , unemployment benefits , etc . They are equal to citizens there.\\n\\n**edit : ** your comment in other thread - \ '' the EU should never have allowed you in\ '' , \ '' little insignificant fascist countries with no history\ '' .

FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; I think if you look at Brazil and Portugal , Cuba and Spain , Canada and the USA and ( finally ) the UK and Ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own , individual , languages.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter much if the language is unique to them or not , what matters is whether the culture is based on that language or not . Core concepts of many languages and associated cultures do not exist in other languages , thus it is not possible to adopt another language without abandoning or re-shaping linguistic and cultural concepts , which would lead to a loss of cultural diversity.\\n\\nConsider this example . Suppose I say to you in English that \ '' I spent yesterday evening with a neighbor.\ '' You may well wonder whether my companion was male or female , but I have the right to tell you politely that it\\ 's none of your business . But if we were speaking French or German , I wouldn\\'t have the privilege to equivocate in this way , because I would be obliged by the grammar of language to choose between *voisin* or *voisine* ; *Nachbar* or *Nachbarin* . These languages compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not I feel it is remotely your concern . This does not mean , of course , that English speakers are unable to understand the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors , but it does mean that they do not have to consider the sexes of neighbors , friends , teachers and a host of other persons each time they come up in a conversation , whereas speakers of some languages are obliged to do so.\\n\\nOn the other hand , English does oblige you to specify certain types of information that can be left to the context in other languages . If I want to tell you in English about a dinner with my neighbor , I may not have to mention the neighbor\\ 's sex , but I do have to tell you something about the timing of the event : I have to decide whether we dined , have been dining , are dining , will be dining and so on . Chinese , on the other hand , does not oblige its speakers to specify the exact time of the action in this way , because the same verb form can be used for past , present or future actions . Again , this does not mean that the Chinese are unable to understand the concept of time . But it does mean they are not obliged to think about timing whenever they describe an action.\\n\\nWhen your language routinely obliges you to specify certain types of information , it forces you to be attentive to certain details in the world and to certain aspects of experience that speakers of other languages may not be required to think about all the time . And since such habits of speech are cultivated from the earliest age , it is only natural that they can settle into habits of mind that go beyond language itself , affecting your experiences , perceptions , associations , feelings , memories and orientation in the world .",Uralic,Estonian

FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; It\\ 's much more cost-efficient to develop and maintain a capability to kill tanks than to maintain the tanks themselves . \\n\\nThe most cost-effective anti-tank weapon is another tank . Here\\ 's a wonderful excerpt from Edward Luttwak\\ 's \ '' Strategy\ '' : \\n\\n & gt ; During the Cold War , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization faced its greatest threat in what is now peaceful central Germany . And just like the South Korean government , NATO was politically committed to a preclusive defense in geographic circumstances that would have favored a far more elastic defense.\\n\\n & gt ; In a retrospective view of the situation at the level of theater strategy , we would see the eastern edge of the Federal Republic ( \ '' West Germany\ '' ) extending from the Baltic coast all the way south to Austria . For some 625 miles , the border would divide East Germany and Czechoslovakia , at the time both basing areas for the Soviet army . Upon mobilization , as units of the Belgian , British , Canadian , Dutch , German , and American armies would move out of their barracks and bases to deploy into their assigned positions , NATO\\ 's \ '' central front\ '' would acquire a physical form . We would see not a solid line with units stationed shoulder to shoulder but rather a series of deployments of men , vehicles , and weapons within a band of territory running from north to south.\\n\\n & gt ; Roughly one-third of NATO\\ 's tank and mechanized formations ( the \ '' covering forces\ '' ) would have advanced to within a few miles from the border , with the rest kept some distance behind . Even though the front held by the covering forces would not follow each twist and turn of the border , it would still be stretched out over some 600 miles . In addition , at least the low-lying tracts of the border with neutral Austria would also have to be protected , because Soviet invasion forces from Hungary could pass up the Danube valley quite quickly.\\n\\n & gt ; We can now finally dispose of the missile-infantry proposal . Given the length of the frontage that the Alliance was committed to protect , we can immediately understand why a frontal defense by missile troops would have been very weak , even if elaborately shielded by properly overwatched barriers . For we discover that in those narrow sectors of the front where the two sides would actually collide in combat , the antitank missiles would be greatly outnumbered by Soviet armored vehicles , even though the missiles were so much cheaper.\\n\\n & gt ; As matters stood during the last two decades of the Cold War , more than 10,000 tanks , an even larger number of infantry combat vehicles , much self-propelled artillery , and all manner of support units could attack from a standing start from East Germany and Czechoslovakia , with much greater forces moving up behind them from Poland and the Soviet Union.\\ ' That great mass of vehicles would not of course be distributed evenly from north to south opposite every segment of the front , but instead be concentrated into four or five vectors of advance , each moving westward in a phalanx as broad as the terrain would allow . Some might be constricted into an approach as narrow as a two-lane road , while others might advance on a width of as much as ten miles . But summing all the vectors and the width of every phalanx , Soviet armor would still be attacking only a fraction of the entire 600-mile line . Thus even if a huge force of missile troops were raised , with tens of thousands of launchers , Soviet armor rolling forward would easily outnumber them in every combat encounter.\\n\\n & gt ; The arithmetic of attrition must therefore guarantee defeat . It can not be otherwise when the number of missile launchers must be distributed to cover all the frontage , while invading armored forces attack in concentrated force ? Of course the missile troops could also be concentrated , in fact they could outconcentrate the invasion columns , if they were mobile enough . But that can not be done just by supplying trucks to transport them up and down the front along the border patrol roads , because any movements that far forward would be much too vulnerable to artillery fires . It can only be done by keeping the bulk of the missile troops in wait at rearward crossroads , ready to rush forward on their trucks to reinforce sectors of the front under attack . Incapable of cross-country movement and thus road-bound , motorized missile troops in transit would be highly vulnerable to air attack and quite unable to move forward against the artillery fires running ahead of each invading phalanx . Helicopters could assure an even faster response . Enough of them could allow the missile troops to outconcentrate the invasion columns every time , but that is no longer the cheap alternative originally proposed \u2014 and why carry missile troops with antitank launchers anyway , when helicopters can have their own missiles without need of troops to launch them ? In either case , those most fragile of aircraft would be highly vulnerable to the antiaircraft weapons that accompany armored forces and to the descending curtains of artillery fire of a large-scale offensive . \\n\\n & gt ; With trucks much too vulnerable as well as road-bound , and with helicopters too vulnerable as well as too expensive , only well-armored ground vehicles , fit to go across country , can provide mobility under fire for the missile troops , to allow them to meet the concentrated attack . Armored and tracked , such vehicles could certainly bring the missile troops where they would be needed . They would of course replicate the present carriers of the mechanized infantry . . . which of course includes antitank missiles among its weapons . And if armored vehicles are to be acquired , why not arm them with built-in missile launchers that can be used without dismounting ? And if there are to be built-in weapons anyway , why have only bulky missile-launchers with their slow rates of fire , when guns remain superior for antiarmor combat at closer ranges ? If taken that far , the original proposal dissolves into a mere variant of the existing mechanized forces , or even into a re-creation of the tank itself . We have come full circle , back to the conventional solution of fighting armor with armor . We can now recognize that the persistence of armored forces is not just the result of institutional rigidity , the force of tradition , the power of entrenched military bureaucracies . Without protected mobility there is no concentration , and without concentration there is no strength .",Uralic,Estonian

FleshyDagger,europe,"[ Background ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way ) : \\n\\n & gt ; The Baltic Way or Baltic Chain was a peaceful political demonstration that occurred on August 23 , 1989 . Approximately two million people joined their hands to form a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) across the three Baltic states \u2013 Estonian SSR , Latvian SSR , and Lithuanian SSR , republics of the Soviet Union.\\n\\n & gt ; The demonstration originated in \ '' Black Ribbon Day\ '' protests held in the western cities in the 1980s . It marked the 50th anniversary of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany . The pact and its secret protocols divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence and led to the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940.\\n\\n & gt ; The event was organised by Baltic pro-independence movements : Rahvarinne of Estonia , the Popular Front of Latvia , and S\u0105j\u016bdis of Lithuania . The protest was designed to draw global attention by demonstrating a popular desire for independence for each of the entities . It also illustrated solidarity among the three nations . It has been described as an effective publicity campaign , and an emotionally captivating and visually stunning scene . The event presented an opportunity for the Baltic activists to publicise the illegal Soviet occupation and position the question of Baltic independence not as a political matter , but as a moral issue.\\n\\n & gt ; The Soviet authorities in Moscow responded to the event with intense rhetoric , but failed to take any constructive actions that could bridge the widening gap between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union . Within six months of the protest , Lithuania became the first of the Republics of the Soviet Union to declare independence.\\n\\nThere\\ 's also a documentary by two American filmmakers about [ the Singing Revolution ] ( http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0954008/ ) , which the Baltic Way was a part of ( [ trailer ] ( http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pm3yzSN8aVk ) ) .",Uralic,Estonian

Women who are housewives tend to be unhappy with that role.\\n\\nSo you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s USA to prove that housewives in present-day Germany prefer to work ? And you call this research ? \\n\\nDo you have an actual source that gives a figures on how many German parents would work rather stay at home , given the choice ? In Estonia , for example , we\\ 've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation . The most highly-educated , well-paid women were the group that saw the highest rise of birth rates after *parent\\ 's salary* was introduced that consists of child support at the level of parent\\ 's salary in the year before childbirth . This tool of financial security ( ! ) has by far been the most effective method of stopping population decline , even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society . As a side effect to this , the length of time staying at home has also increased : approximately half the parents do not work during their first year with the child . There is a sharp decrease of staying at home at the cut-off point of *parent\\ 's salary*.\\n\\nSee [ this chart ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uTLt8I2.png ) from a study by Praxis , with summary published in [ Estonian Parliament\\ 's journal ] ( http : //www.riigikogu.ee/rito/index.php ? id=13768 & amp ; op=archive2 ) . It\\ 's percentage of parent\\ 's who receive pay from work ( left axis ) for the top-paid 20 % in months since the birth of their child ( bottom axis ) . Parent\\ 's salary was introduced in 2004 , and the chart displays behaviour two years prior , at the time , and two years later . At that time , parent\\ 's salary was paid for 12 months . Notice how the percentage of parents working drops by half , given the choice to stay at home - and mind you , these are the most career-oriented people . As an implication of this , the length of staying at home also significantly increased.\\n\\nSo the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors , and not some kind of an universal thing of its own.\\n\\n & gt ; The overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high.\\n\\nOf course . But the high quality isn\\'t guaranteed , thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation , not some ideal model . And let\\ 's not forget from where we started - was the quality of day care high in DDR and the Soviet Union by today\\ 's standards that the research is based upon ?

That\\ 's the question I have been asking.\\n\\nThe only fact you\\ 've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular . This is flawed reasoning since the popularity of child care does not necessarily reflect what parents want . Instead , it may very easily reflect what they are *forced to* do to make the ends meet . Likewise , staying at home does not automatically translate to a preference , but may indicate \ '' a lack of quality in available child care.\ '' \\n\\nIt\\ 's like taxes . The fact that 99 % pay them does not mean that 99 % of the population would prefer to do so , given a choice not to.\\n\\n & gt ; Different studies coming to different conclusions does not mean anything if the quality of the scientific method is not on the same level.\\n\\nThere are studies supporting both sides of the argument , and there are no definitive studies that would give a solid , universal backing to either of them.\\n\\nIf you claim otherwise , then I guess it is my turn to ask for sources .",Uralic,Estonian
FleshyDagger,europe,"& gt ; The fact that child care for children under three is still wildly popular and common in East Germany even without the obligation to work you mentioned would suggest that yes , women prefer to work.\\n\\nDesire and actions may not necessarily be aligned . For example , a study conducted in Tallinn among mothers of one-year-olds concluded that only 7 % wished to return to work at that time . Sadly , many can not afford to stay at home beyond the 18 month maternity leave that we have . \\n\\n & gt ; The idea that babies need to basically be attached to their mothers is not what modern science says at all . Mothers are not the only attachment figures of babies .

FleshyDagger,europe,"The source I provided was a table from ministry of defence\\ 's ordinance that set conscription numbers for 2013 and 2014 , and assigned them to units . It should be enough to settle the matter.\\n\\nAs for reservists , you seem to not understand the defence concept that is based on conscription . Estonia , as well as Finland and several other countries , do not keep a large active military , but instead run a small peacetime force that is tasked with training conscripts . After their training , these conscripts are assigned to reserve and continue their normal life ( with refresher training now and then ) , but they are seen as fit for active duty for ten years from their training , and should the need arise , are called up with a mobilization . Thus the main fighting force is 10 years\\ ' worth of conscripts . They are sometimes called \ '' active reserve\ '' to distinguish them from those who simply sometime in their life got military training . For example , Finland\\ 's armed forces have trained 3.5 million conscripts in the past 90 years , and about 2 million of them are alive , but only ~350 000 or ten years\\ ' worth of them are considered the fit for immediate duty and thus added to active personnel ( 36 000 , most of them conscripts in training ) of Finnish armed forces to form the wartime size.\\n\\nRomania abolished conscription in 2007 . This means that by 2017 , there will be no reservists who would be generally considered to be fit for immediate duty . So here\\ 's my question again : where are you going to take reserves from to boost wartime size ? Are you going to rely on 40-somethings and 50-somethings with obsolete training , many of whom have never even seen the current equipment ? \\n\\nI believe my comparison of Estonian active personnel + active reserve + members of paramilitary organization against Romanian active personnel was the most accurate way of comparing size , considering the core differences between professional armies and conscription-based armies.\\n\\nThe only thing that you could pick on is that the Estonian wartime operational size includes the Estonian Defence League , a volunteer military organization , in addition to conscripts . If Romania has any similar organization , its size should of course be added to wartime strength . Still , I believe this would not change the big picture significantly .",Uralic,Estonian

This also illustrates why the Supreme Court decision can not be used as a moral platform - in their naivety , North American courts relied on Soviet evidence that was often nothing less than forgery . See [ Soviet Evidence in North American Courts : An Analysis of Problems and Concerns with Reliance on Communist Source Evidence in Alleged War Criminal Trials ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/books/dp/B000BY4ZC4 ) for many more examples.\\n\\nIn short , the author doesn\\'t have a clue of Estonian historiography , nor of issues related to post-WW2 mock trials in Eastern Europe . As far as war crimes go , here are valid topics , such as the actions of Ain-Ervin Mere ( he was one of the accused in the mock trials of 1960s ) and of [ *Omakaitse* ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakaitse ) , but these topics are limited to the civil administration and their auxiliary units , and have very little to do with front-line units like the 20th Estonian Waffen-SS Division .",Uralic,Estonian

According to research , the vast majority of its occupants had been participants of so-called destruction commandos ( *h\u00e4vituspataljon* ) and deserved to be shot , about 230 were killed in total.\\n\\nThe camp became famous after a Soviet investigator multiplied the width of a anti-tank trench used for executions by the length of it , and assumed that 12 000 had been murdered there . Soviet propaganda spinned that figure of 12 000 around until the very collapse of the country.\\n\\nLinnas\\ ' role in the camp remains relatively unknown , since until the collapse of the Soviet Union , unbiased research was not possible . After the collapse , research has been seriously hindered by the lack of trustworthy evidence . So I hope that you don\\'t mind me being surprised by foreigners who know so well who-did-what . \\n\\nMerely \ '' guilt by position\ '' is not good enough for me.\\n\\n & gt ; The Omakaitse members were also involved in very questionable acts . Those people then went on to become a part of the SS Division.\\n\\nSince you seem to know this so well - how many Omakaitse members were guilty of any crimes , and how many of them were drafted into 20th Division ? Out of 15 000-20 000 men in the 20th , how many had innocent blood on their hands ? \\n\\nEven if everyone who had anything to do with crimes were conscripted , they would\\ 've still not constituted more than 7 % of 20th Division\\ 's manpower .

Annexing entire regions is not an action that comes out of thin air , and just because they don\\'t write about it as an officially held-public position doesn\\'t mean that they didn\\'t have their eye on it . \\n\\nOf course I do , and it\\ 's not limited to Crimea . Mearsheimer conveniently skips over Putin\\ 's ideology , of which Russian world or *Russkiy mir* is a cornerstone . He is determined to unite territories he believes to belong to the Russian world.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why the country I live in decided to integrate with NATO . Unlike Russia , NATO has not yet [ occupied the country ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_ % 281940 % 29 # Soviet_occupation ) , [ installed a puppet government ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Transitional_governments ) , [ deported tens of thousands to die Siberia ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietization_of_the_Baltic_states # Mass_deportations ) or [ simply murdered them ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Blokhin ) .\\n\\nThis , however , does not fit into Mearsheimer\\ 's narrative , because in such case , the expansion of NATO had not been something orchestrated by the West to \ '' encircle\ '' Russia , but an expression of free will by Eastern European nations , motivated by the fear of history repeating itself . And thus would collapse his core message of blaming the West.\\n\\nIn fact , the situation in Eastern Europe has very little to do with the West . Key dynamics lie within the history of the region , especially in the post-war subjugation of Eastern Europe and Russia\\ 's failure to face its bloody past like Germany has done . Could you imagine modern-day Germany [ going after those who refused to serve in the Wehrmacht or the SS ] ( http : //www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fsm9j/russia_reopens_criminal_cases_against_lithuanians/ ) ? \\n\\nThere\\ 's a reason why Russia\\ 's neighbours are doing everything they can to isolate and protect themselves from Russia , and it\\ 's an absolute travesty that the self-proclaimed \ '' realist\ '' ignores this . His reasoning is a fantasy that might be internally sound , but nevertheless has very little connection to the real world.\\n\\n & gt ; Whether Ukraine becoming integrated with the EU and a possible NATO candidate is a threat to Russia , well as Mearsheimer says , it\\ 's not up to us what Russia deems as a threat . \\n\\nOf course Russia is free to define what they see as a threat , but this does not validate their position - deciding for the Ukrainians is a balant violation of Ukraine\\ 's right to self-determination , a cardinal principle in modern international law , binding to all members of the UN through its Charter.\\n\\nThis is also one of the topics Mearsheimer skips over - he does not even mention that Putin in his military aggression has violated the UN Charter , the Helsinki Act of 1975 , the Treaty on the Dissolution of the Soviet Union of 1991 , the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 , the Russian-Ukrainian Friendship Treaty of 1997 , or the Russian-Ukrainian Sevastopol Base Treaty of 1997 , and so on.\\n\\nWith Mearsheimer\\ 's arguments , any crackpot military aggression anywhere in the world could be defended .

Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\n & gt ; \\n\\nBUILDING THINGS\\n\\nA glimpse of this Swedish future can be caught at Arlandagymnasiet , a high school in M\u00e4rsta , half an hour north of Stockholm , which offers remedial Swedish classes for immigrant students . On a recent morning , Ayaan Hassan Ali , a 16-year-old recently arrived from Somalia , was sitting in a modern classroom , with blue chairs and bright wood paneling on the walls . In one corner , there was a large flat-screen TV , in another , a map of the world , and in the back , a couple of bookshelves filled with dictionaries : Swedish-Arabic , Swedish-Russian , and Swedish-Tigrinya among them.\\n\\nAyaan spends almost every afternoon studying at home so she can come to class well prepared . After two months in school , she says she still has a hard time speaking Swedish , but her reading and writing have improved considerably . \u201cI want to be done with the language introduction by the end of this year , \u201d she said . Her aim is to earn a middle-school diploma as quickly as possible , so that she will be able to begin high school and eventually study engineering at a university . It is an ambitious plan . \u201cSome of them complete it in a year , \u201d said Veronica Suskic , the headmaster in charge of the introductory program . \u201cBut very few.\u201d\\n\\nAyaan\u2019s main challenge might not be her own motivation but her fellow students -- and a school system under strain from the steady arrival of new immigrants . Ayaan is one of only two girls in her class of about 20 . ( It\u2019s a number in constant flux , Ayaan\u2019s teacher , Thomas Engqvist , said , since new kids come all the time , while others \u201cmove , get deported , some just disappear.\u201d ) Many of the boys arrive to Sweden as unaccompanied minors , most of them from Afghanistan . The others in the class are from Albania , Eritrea , Kyrgyzstan , Poland , Somalia , and Tajikistan.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult environment in which to teach , \u201d Engqvist said . \u201cThe testosterone level is pretty high , and their level of education tends to vary a lot . And then we have the whole world in the class -- you get mini wars , conflicts that sometimes boil over.\u201d The situation shows no sign of letting up . With a wry smile , Engqvist quoted a colleague who said that , \u201cas long as there are wars in the world , we have a job.\u201d And there are always wars , he pointed out -- \u201cright now , in Syria.\u201d\\n\\nThat day , the class spent several hours reading aloud a simple text over and over . After they had finished , the teacher turned to the class to test them on vocabulary . \u201cModig , \u201d he asked , using the Swedish word for brave . \u201cDoes anyone know what modig means ? \u201d Silence . \u201cOkay , it\u2019s when you do something even though you\u2019re afraid to do it . Does anyone have an example of being modig ? \u201d\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when a small guy picks a fight with a big guy , \u201d one of the Afghan boys , 17-year-old Sadiq , said . Like most of the Afghanis in the class , Sadiq had arrived alone , after passing through some ten countries on the way . \u201cYes ! But he has to be afraid , \u201d the teacher said . \u201cOtherwise he\u2019s just stupid . Someone else ? \u201d\\n\\nAhmad , one of the Somali boys , tried telling a story about how he was fleeing his home in Somalia and crossed a river filled with crocodiles . But the gap between his halting Swedish vocabulary and the sheer horror he wished to express was too wide , and the teacher was unable to follow along . Instead , he asked , \u201cAyaan , is being modig something good ? \u201d Ayaan looked down into her book , thinking hard . \u201cYes , \u201d she said in her deep voice , a voice that makes her seem older than she actually is . \u201cFor example , when you dare to do a test even when you\u2019re afraid you will fail.\u201d She paused . \u201cOr when you speak up , even though you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\\n\\nLater in the day , the class had a discussion about jobs . Sadiq , the 17-year-old Afghan boy , asked me if being a journalist was a good job . After being told that becoming a lawyer or studying economics would be better if we wanted to make money , he nodded absent-mindedly . \u201cHow about welding ? Is that good ? \u201d It turned out that he\u2019d been a welder since the age of five . He looked proud . \u201cYou\u2019ll always have to build things , don\u2019t you ? \u201d",Uralic,Estonian
Forgot_password_shit,europe,"Cont\\n\\nUntil the mid-1990s , the Sweden Democrats were a party of militant skinheads in black uniforms . Its xenophobic message is unchanged , but today the group presents itself as Sweden\u2019s only reliable guardian of the welfare state . A television ad released by the party for the 2010 elections depicts an ethnically Swedish retiree hobbling forward while a hoard of Muslim women in burqas greedily charge past to grab money from the national coffers . The choice , a voice-over explains , is to \u201ccut money from immigration budgets , or from pensions.\u201d \\n\\nThis messaging plays into the worries of many Swedes that the welfare state is increasingly fragile . Over the past two decades , the size of Sweden\u2019s welfare state has shrunk . Public spending has fallen from its peak of 67 percent of the GDP in 1993 to 52 percent today , as taxes have been cut quite drastically : as a percentage of the GDP , overall taxes have gone down from 51.4 percent in 2000 to 44.3 percent in 2012 . Both services and benefits have been cut -- most notably unemployment benefits -- and big parts of the welfare sector have been opened to private , profit-making companies . In international economic circles , this has been hailed as a new \u201cNordic model\u201d -- a lean but well-financed and still generous state . But for many Swedes , the cutbacks carry a clear sense of loss . And , increasingly , some Swedes seem inclined to blame immigrants for that feeling.\\n\\nIn the 2010 elections , the Sweden Democrats earned 5.7 percent of the vote , enough to enter parliament . Post-election surveys clearly showed that the party got most of its support from working-class male Swedes -- the group , apart from immigrants , hit hardest by the shrinking supply of low-skill jobs . Today , as the next general elections in September draw closer , most opinion polls show the Sweden Democrats at close to ten percent . A recent survey showed that about 30 percent of young male members of Landsorganisationen , Sweden\u2019s largest trade union , support the party . Thus far , the government has carefully avoided dealing with the party , and no one expects this to change after the coming elections . But as the party grows , the lure of the policies that the Sweden Democrats espouse clearly grows with it . \\n\\nUSING A MEGAPHONE\\n\\nRami Al-Khamisi is a fierce-looking young man , with close-cropped hair and a physique shaped by regular visits to the local gym . But he is no delinquent -- quite the opposite . He\u2019s in his second year as a law student at Stockholm University , and in recent years , an organization he helped found , Megafonen ( \u201cThe Megaphone\u201d ) , has emerged as one of the most notable community organizations in Stockholm\u2019s suburbs . Unlike the Swedes who think of immigrants as the cause of recent tensions rippling through Swedish society , Al-Khamisi blames the tax cuts , privatizations , and cutbacks to the welfare state.\\n\\nAs we walked through the neighborhood , Rami seemed to know pretty much everybody . Meeting some teenage boys hanging out in a doorway , Rami shook hands . \u201cWhat\u2019s up , \u201d he said . \u201cYou on your way to school ? \u201d ( It\u2019s a question with an uncertain answer : In Husby , 19 percent of the 15-year-olds don\u2019t have the grades to earn placement in high school . ) As we reached a footbridge near his building , Rami pointed to a low-slung yellow building with peeling paint and darkened windows . Inside , you could see furniture strewn about , like someone had left in a hurry.\\n\\n\u201cThis used to be the Yellow House , a place for kids to hang out , \u201d Rami said , peering through the broken blinds . \u201cIt\u2019s been closed for five , six years . There was another place as well , called the Barn , that closed ten years ago . They used to arrange all kinds of things . In the summer , we went out into the Stockholm archipelago , camping and stuff . In the winter , we went skiing in Fj\u00e4llen -- the mountains up north . Now , there\u2019s almost nothing.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cI think the politicians might understand that kids here need something to do , \u201d Rami continued . \u201cBut they don\u2019t live here , they don\u2019t know our reality , so they don\u2019t realize what it does to the neighborhood when they board up places like this . Most kids here don\u2019t have their own rooms ; they live six , seven people in a two- or three-bedroom apartment . So where do you hang out ? At McDonald\u2019s , feeling like a bum ? You know what happens ? They\u2019ll start looking for some action.\u201d \\n\\nListening to Rami , it is easy to get a dark view of Sweden\u2019s future . He sees -- as does the immigrant-turned-economist Sanandaji -- a whole generation of \u201clost kids\u201d in areas like Husby , boys with an immigrant background who are at risk of never truly becoming part of society . But that\u2019s not because they\u2019re not integrated into Swedish culture . \u201cMost of the kids who rioted were born here and speak no other language than Swedish , \u201d he said . \u201cSo what exactly should we integrate into ? \u201d\\n\\nWhat Rami sees instead is a generation that , lacking education and real jobs , feels excluded from the possibility of ever having a voice in Swedish society . \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say , but there are so many here that are already on the wrong path , \u201d he said . \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll take for the politicians to realize that the segregation you see here -- it\u2019s a problem for all people in Sweden . Because this is our country , too.\u201d \\n\\nAN IMMIGRANT COUNTRY \\n\\nThe politician in charge of trying to solve this peculiarly Swedish puzzle -- at least until the September elections -- is Erik Ullenhag , the integration minister . Since 2006 , the Swedish government has been a center-right coalition under conservative Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt . But the 41-year-old Ullenhag is a member of the Liberal Party , and his politics on immigration don\u2019t deviate from the Swedish establishment consensus that straddles both the left and the right and argues that the country\u2019s open immigration policies should be kept in place . In 2010 , after the Swedish Democrats earned a place in parliament , the Reinfeldt government made a point of agreeing to an immigration deal with the Green Party that guaranteed just that . \\n\\n\u201cWe deal with this differently than in most other European countries , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019s about showing political leadership . Instead of adjusting our policies to the Sweden Democrats , we stand up for being open and tolerant . We\u2019re a small and rich country ; we should take our share of responsibility in the world . And we think that if people who come here get jobs and become part of Swedish society , there is a lot of support for the idea that people should be able to continue coming to Sweden.\u201d \\n\\nUllenhag points to surveys showing that Swedes have become more positively inclined toward immigration in the past decade . And he insists that , in the medium term , there are clear economic benefits to immigration . \u201cIn 20 to 25 years , I think we will see a situation where this openness has been very good for Sweden , \u201d Ullenhag said . \u201cIt\u2019ll make us stronger in this globalized world.\u201d \\n\\nBut he admits that there are challenges -- above all , with education and jobs . \u201cThe big integration challenge is that too few of the recently arrived have jobs . And it\u2019s true that a lot of the simpler jobs have disappeared from the labor market in the past few decades . But we think other sectors , like the service sector , can fill these gaps.\u201d To that end , the government has put in place a number of reforms to ease entry to the job market -- Ullenhag points to tax subsidies to domestic services and a focus on vocational training in school . But so far , they don\u2019t seem to have put a serious dent in the high unemployment numbers.\\n\\nBut economics aside , Ullenhag admits that Swedish society will have a problem as long as Swedish citizens don\u2019t recognize that they need to alter their own sense of national identity . \u201cSweden is an immigrant country today , as much as the United States or Canada , \u201d he said . \u201cBut have we gotten used to it yet ? No , not really . This is still a country where many people who were born here identify themselves as immigrants . Which means you\u2019re not really part of society . That\u2019s the big challenge . We have to get better at coming together around a common future -- instead of focusing on where your mom and dad were born.\u201d",Uralic,Estonian

Imagine if a non-white person started drawing white-haired and blue-eyed school shooters , doing the Hitler salute on a pile of school children , but saying it\\ 's a depiction of Jesus ? There\\ 's a clear connection between this depiction of Jesus and the racist stereotype that white people are white supremacists , and love to do school shootings . The argument however can be turned over by just saying \ '' Oh hey , it\\ 's not a racist stereotype , just a depiction of Jesus ! \ '' . Granted , seeing as most white people are not that religious anymore , it wouldn\\'t work that well , but the point remains . Just the same as there is a clear connection between their depictions of Muhammad and modern day muslims . \\n\\nThe pictures vary , some are racist ( against Arabs ) and some are chauvinistic/fascist/whatever you might call it ( against all Muslims ) . Most of the arguments in favor of the cartoons get stuck arguing about terminology while not really providing any evidence as to why the caricatures are not inflammatory against a certain group of people , which they most certainly are.\\n\\nAlso , I find that most of their stuff is not racist/fascist/chauvinist or whatever you call it , I have issues with some of their caricatures .",Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,I think that this might become the longest trade negotiation in the history of mankind because as you mentioned all 27 countries have their own interests and everyone wants to get best for their country . I also think that UK will get a rude awakening when they discover that negotiations between UK and EU are not negotiations between equal partners and that they have to concede more ( simply because EU & gt ; UK ) .

Heinsz7,europe,Eastern and Central European defense industries could offer something if they got more funding as well .

Heinsz7,europe,But Google does a lot more than just Google search so can you tax the entire profit ?,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I am not sure if it is America overspending or Europe underspending . European defense expenditures are at historical lowpoint at the moment .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Depends . I think when it comes to security and strategic interests there is more common with Poland than Germany .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Yes but not all advertising is in the same place . When you want to tax them by number of searches made you can logically tax them only for ads that are shown on Google search not in Youtube for example .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I could understand taxing company for something when I give them my money and get something in return . But this is not the case with data because data has no value itself .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,The fact that there are no sanctions on the energy sector shows that the sanctions are not serious but just a face saving project because Europe had to do something about Ukraine .

Heinsz7,europe,They are definitely brutal to look at and live in I imagine .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,The entire European Union renewable energy is half-arsed and doesn\\'t make any sense to be honest . Eventhough this sub posts lots about solar and wind power the fact is that most of the \ '' renewable energy\ '' in the European Union comes from burning wood ( pellets made from wood ) . I mean this worse than burning coal but at least we can feel good about ourselves . I\\ 'd like to see some real efforts instead of playing around with statistics .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,It does increase CO2 levels in the short term ( 10-20 year perspective ) because removing the CO2 will take longer time than releasing it into the environment because another tree takes a long time to grow - a lot longer than burning it in seconds . Also by burning trees you reduce the amount of CO2 than trees can remove from the environment because there will be less trees.\\nFor the same amount of energy burning a tree releases more CO2 in to the environment than coal.\\n\\nBurning wood is not the sustainable solution because think about what happened if the whole world started to burn wood as its main renewable energy source . It would be catastrophic for the environment which ironicaly is the thing we want to save right now.\\nEuropean Union has acknowledged that burning wood is a loophole in the requirements and they will fix it eventually but it will take time because it will mess up all the renewable energy goals if they do it too soon.\\n\\nEDIT : World already has a deforestation problem as well so burning them for energy instead of coal is the last thing we should do .

Heinsz7,europe,Russia is like one of the biggest threats to EU memberstates ( many of them ) so the HQ can\\'t be in a random European Union state . Maybe Germany because it is in a central position of the EU . But unless EU \ '' military\ '' does nothing about Russia threat then it is a pointless thing that serves interests of only half of the Europe.\\n\\nEDIT : Also who cares what Russia thinks about it . I mean are we more concerned about building a united military that can defend all memberstates or caring about Russias feelings . Russia doesn\\'t give a sh*t about what their enemies think about them and neither does USA but we in Europe are concerned about feelings and sensitivities of our potential enemies ( I don\\'t mean USA as a potential enemy ) .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,But there are countries like Sweden who have budget surplus and are having very good economic growth which means that budget deficits are not necessary for economic growth .

Heinsz7,europe,I have lost all my faith in the so called \ '' proper fiscal unification of the Eurozone\ '' because there are too many countries that don\\'t care about 3 % budget deficit and 60 % of GDP debt limits . \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t force Germany so much because it is starting to look like blackmailing in my opinion . Forcing Germany too much might break the current EU but it might not be bad after all . Maybe Northern European countries can make some kind of a trade and economic union with Germany in that case - because Northern European countries tend to have same views as Germany when it comes to economic and fiscal policies .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,You can use it faster than forests are growing . The reason why this is even viable option right now is that only Europe is burning trees for energy on such scale but imagine what would happen if the entire world started doing so .

And it gives you spike because all the CO2 that tree has collected over the decades will be released in just seconds . \\nBurning trees is green as long as tree grows in 1s and removes the CO2 that has been released as fast as it was burnt - impossible .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,Russia does care about Baltics because Russia can\\'t accept the fact that they have no control over Baltic countries eventhough they see Baltic countries as part of their \ '' near abroad\ '' .

Spending efficiently is just a buzzword because it is not a new termin and everytime countries cut their military spending they say something about \ '' it\\ 's not how much you spend but how you spend\ '' \ '' more efficiency is the key\ '' but in reality military capabilites have deteriorated . There is no substitute to money . I am more than sure enough that joint EU defense policy will be used as an excuse to cut spending even more.\\n\\nEDIT : Sorry about multiple posts everybody .

Heinsz7,europe,Considering how Russia talks constantly about how they are encircled by the world and that someone will try to attack them at any moment then I am not sure about who is really paranoid .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,My media is not saying that and I talked about how situation was when we had to send aid to Greece . Estonian pensions were then about 300 euros and now they are approaching 400 euros so you can see the difference . Also our unemployment benefits are around 120 euros a month which is clearly a lot less . You can understand from these facts why people were angry .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,"I\\ 'd like to improve Eurozone and I would not be against closer fiscal union but this would mean that we would have to implement very strict rules when it comes to budget deficits , public spending and everything fiscally related because countries would be a lot more dependent on others than they are now . This would also mean there there have to be punishments so if a country breaks even one rule then they should be thrown out immediately.\\n\\nAlso we can clearly see that European Union is going to move into direction where bigger countries get more power and smaller countries get less say than they have now . As you said \ '' tough luck because you are small\ '' indeed . I can say tough luck as well - can\\'t compete with Germany ?

Heinsz7,europe,Germany is keep struggling countriea alive . If Germany leaves eurozone then I think most of the countries that have high debt and budget deficits would go bankrupt immediately because try loaning money with high interest rates . Germany does want to fix eurozone bur instead of throwing cash at the problem that makes the problem go away for a year or few they want to make sure that problems like this can never happen again . No one is entitled to Germanys money and if Germany gives it to other countries then Germany has right to set its conditions .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,I think it seems a non-issue as well especially when thinking about future . Some people always talk about how we need basic income because robots are going to take most of our jobs and then some people say that we need more immigrants to do the jobs .

Heinsz7,europe,I had no idea that we have place like this in Estonia . Besides trees it looks all so different.I wonder if it during flood or something .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Many people speak German natively outside of Germany as well . For example in Austria .,Uralic,Estonian
Heinsz7,europe,Good point . Also I would add that the problem with current immigration policy is that it overlooks the problem that the new immigrants will also get old one day and somebody has to take care of them as well . It is possible that they will start inviting more immigrants from 3rd world countries to take care of them as well . So immigration only offers short term solutions and postpones problems but makes the problems even worse in the long term .,Uralic,Estonian

Heinsz7,europe,It might be possible that I am biased as well because for example in Estonia and Latvia goverments imposed harsh austerity as soon as the crisis started which cut wages and goverment spending a lot . Also there were tax increases on people too . But it worked out well for us and now our countries have recovered and are doing well . I think that with austerity there is no middle ground - you do it or not - and in my opinion many countries that are struggling right now were initally too hesitant and wanted to make it gradually or spend their way out of it unsuccessfully .,Uralic,Estonian

Children , young and older , were offered musical entertainment by Taulide family band . Some of the posters had visible spelling errors , and fought over , some were written in uprintable expressions . People were brought to protest by bus free of charge - from every county.\\n\\nAfter greeting speeches both in estonian and Russian , Laikre Raimondo began singing , who praised the people - all those who stand for family values\\u200b\\u200b . For the wellfare of Russian-speaking people , Raimondo also sang in Russian.\\n\\nSubsequently , a spiritual Vello Salo came on stage , who read out a poem by Henrik Visnapuu.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaid SAPTK leader told the people that , because the politicians have remained deaf ears , thus the people protecting the traditional family had come to protest the Toompea . Cohabitation Law Adoption would actually be one step closer to gay marriage rights , he said . The adoption of the Law would affect all of us - families would be lumped together with gay relationship and It\\ 's unacceptable to Estonia society.\\n\\nWe assure that druing the parliament election time we will constantly remind people of who are the politicians who voted for the act , he said.\\n\\nVarro Vooglaiu\\ 's speech was interrupted continuously by cheers and applause .\\n\\nSAPTK Vooglaid Varro\\ 's CEO , said that the protest is the last chance for citizens to resist the union\\ 's efforts to push through a law against the will of the people and the family , and fundamentally reshape the meaning of marriage.\\n\\n\ '' This is our land and our country , where the people have supreme power .

Huehue777,europe,"& gt ; Nevertheless , I wouldn\\'t call Philip II \ '' incredibly wise and able\ '' : he certainly wasn\\'t the bloodthirsty , incestuous monster his Protestant enemies liked to picture him , just a narrow-minded bureaucrat who would probably have been far happier rubber-stamping documents in some minor public administration than being the absolute ruler of a world empire.\\n\\nWell he did possess a lot of good personal qualities , he was imo very smart , already when he was extremely young he knew a lot about politics and was tutored very well . \\n\\nHe became the regent of Spain already at 16 and in general he was good imo at keeping peace in places where there were no religious conflicts . He was also very just/fair and didn\\'t seem to abuse his power for personal gain , he was kind of happy with what he got and tried to take good care of it . \\n\\nMost monarchs , on the other hand , had a lot of really bad qualities if you read history and did a lot of really bad things , the fact he didn\\'t really have any bad qualities is great in itself ( this is why I liked Isabella and Philippe II a lot , it is great to read about people who have almost absolute power yet use it very well ) .\\n\\nIn terms of religious conflicts I agree that since he was a very devout Catholic he spent a lot of time trying to keep all his dominions under Catholicism , which was a mistake , since it was just delaying the inevitable , but this is not necessarily because of political reasons , but he genuinely believed Catholicism was the only true Christian religion.\\n\\nIn general both Isabel and Philippe were both very religious and did probably both go too far with their enforcement of it to their lands ( I\\ 'd say a major mistake for Isabel was also the enabling of the Inquisition , even though she didn\\'t really even support it , but rather everyone else around her were able to talk her into it and it seemed like a good idea to consolidate the monarchy ) .\\n\\nHowever , the flip side of it is that Spain stayed away from religious conflicts that plagued a lot of other Christian kingdoms of the time and thus was able to be a stronghold in terms of defending the Mediterranean against the Ottomans and expanding overseas .",Uralic,Estonian

Huehue777,europe,"1 ) Economies between many Western and Eastern EU countries is almost the same in purchasing power parity\\n\\n2 ) By this time EU has scrapped or heavily limited the amount of refugees it takes in . Many countries found out the hard way that it is extremely hard to integrate people from 3rd world muslim failed states . \\n\\nThis is why most Western/Nordic EU countries have a lot of American-style segregated societies/ghettos , filled with crime , unemployment , use of Arabic as main language , religious extremism and a deep hatred toward the native people.\\n\\nHowever immigration both illegal and legal will stay strong from African/Middle Eastern countries as migrants will continue to figure out different ways to get to EU , as Europe\\ 's standard of living will still continue to be so much higher than anywhere else around it.\\n\\n3 ) UK left the EU , some other countries considered leaving as well , but since there were no more referendums it didn\\'t happen . After the refugee crisis was solved and after another economic/debt crisis there was a time of stability , in which EU develops once more toward a federation , with the creation of an EU army as a major step forward.\\n\\n4 ) Since the economic differences were reduced between East and West , and since open borders have diminished the differences between EU people , there is more of a common sense of unity and it is now very common for Europeans to live/work/study in different EU countries and more people will begin to feel like \ '' Europeans\ '' in addition to their national identity.\\n\\n4 ) In Russia at one point Putin loses his power for one reason or the other , which creates massive chaos in the country , as there will be a huge struggle for power between the United Russia old guard , the oligarchs , the nationalists , the democracy-activists , the various regional separatists ( especially Chechnya and other Caucus muslim countries who will use this to break free from Russia ) and the communists . \\n\\nThis is why things turn from bad to worse in Russia and since Putin had destroyed virtually all democratic institutions there will be a major downfall in the economy and the overall functioning of the state . In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately . Also Turkey has become a bit more democratic , but is still very far away from joining EU.\\n\\n6 ) Estonia will be a very successful country by 2026 and its various start-ups have become quite big and well-known . Also , the 0 % corporate tax rate and the e-residency brought a lot of new companies ( +money ) and also immigrants to Estonia , which has helped push Estonia to have a very high GDP per capita PPP and in terms of quality of life it is on par or higher than other Western EU countries . Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia .

First off , it is difficult to understand , as to whether feminists even think that women should be having sex in the first place , because according to them it is an act in which the man is in a dominant position and a women in a submissive position , so the act must be frowned upon , probably at least according to some of the 3rd wave feminists.\\n\\nOK , whatever the feminist logic is toward sex , then comes the issue of when a woman is having sex on her free will . Well , the feminists can\\'t really stop that I guess , since most women actually love to have sex and find great pleasure from it . Yet , for some reason , if both people have decided on their free will that they want to have sex , it is OK , but if the man decides to gives some money for a mutual decision to have sex ( trafficking is illegal anyway everywhere in Europe and large social safety nets provide everyone with minimum living standards ) , then the man suddenly becomes a criminal ? ! \\n\\nI mean you can\\'t make this up and it is mind-boggling even to try to get into the brains of the 3rd wave feminists , but the logic seems to be getting lost somewhere here.\\n\\nIt is kind of the same as with the whole Gamergate thing imo .
