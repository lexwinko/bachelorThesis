A new player will probably start playing , just take a look at the report options and see `` unskilled player '' as one of them .

These are the type of guys I usually do n't hang out with ( the edgy 14 year old vapelords ) , but fuck it . It was fun . Most of the time they just ride dirtbikes and ATV 's from cops , but when they are in bigger cities they ca n't use them because surveillance . The one time I joined them was in a bigger-ish city ( Tallinn ) . The thing about Tallinn ( specifically the old-town ) is that it has a bunch of older buildings and such . A lot of those buildings have really cool old courtyards kinda built in between them , some of which you can climb into if you can get over the fence/gate . So the one time I joined them , we were running from a relatively slow moving cop car and we climbed into one of those courtyards . Of course , these courtyards still have surveillance cameras and security systems , but it was dark and most of us were wearing shit over our faces so it was ( probably ) fine .

See , the PC is not picking up that there is an audio device in . When I check the page that shows you the current audio devices , it says that there are no audio devices connected . Also , troubleshooting says that the issue is that there are no audio devices in . Why is this ? I am thinking it might be my sound card or something like that , but I can not be sure .

Everything was fine in that time period . Then , I open Overwatch . I play one round ( about 10 minutes ) . Then suddenly , both my monitors go black and I hear an error noise through my headphones . I realize - oh shit ; it 's my PC ! I then quickly turn off the PC to avoid any damages . I check all the parts for damage , and there is none . Then I realize my GPU is rather hot . So I make the logical assumption that my GPU must have overheated ( ? ) .And because my monitors are hooked up to my GPU , that 'd explain them going dark . Also , that 's the first time that my monitors have done that . The GPU has no visible damage , though . I then boot up my computer . Then , I had the idea to boot up Overwatch again , and observe my GPU temperature through a program called HWMonitor . And would you look at that - the GPU is at 80C while I 'm in the menu . One thing I did notice , is that my GPU 's fans are extremely weak while they 're going off . When they 're going and I put my hand under them , I barely even feel wind . According HWMonitor , the GPU fans are going at around 2600-2700RPM . ***EDIT : *** I observed spec info while actually playing - temperature never goes over 81 degrees and fans stay at 2600-2700RPM .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"About the breed thing https : //terriermandotcom.blogspot.com.ee/2009/10/pit-bull-rights-verus-pit-bull.html ? m=1 I 've found this long article/opinion ( whatever You call it ) to be pretty much true . The problem is that people do n't make themselves clear what they 're getting into while choosing between breeds . The two extremes ( pits are killers vs pits are nanny dogs ) add fuel to the fire and people tend to pick a side instead of facing the truth . Every breed is different and each dog is different , but there are some things that you can naturally expect from any given breed in general . With a pit there 's a good chance that you have to put a lot more time in socialising the dog compared to retrievers . Ofc , you have to socialise the retriever as well , but it probably ( ! ! ! ) takes less of an effort . When the owner admits that truth , all is well . If he does n't - well , then he may have another example of `` my dog hates other dogs '' on his hands . Meanwhile every retriever owner must know that his dog may be that special one in its breed and either due to a very bad experience or due to genetics/illness/whatever reason be afraid or simply hate other dogs . What 's truly bad ? People following either one of these extreme opinions - pits are killers vs pits are nanny dogs . Edit : I own a golden retriever an while other golden owners I know are more or less ok , this one person sticks out . His dog is extremely well trained when it comes to following rules , but the problem is that the owner has put all his effort into training the dog to follow orders and zero effort into teaching him how to play with other dogs . The result is an agressive young male golden who has attacked a young female ( unprovoked ) , can not read other dogs and does n't know what playtime is . I agree , it 's not a breed thing - it 's the owner that has managed to create a bully . And to be clear , I like pits . We are currently helping a traumatized pit to adjust again . When I asked the owner why does she insist on socialising his dog with a golden and not a pit , the answer fit the stereotype . She has tried , but the other owners simply do n't limit agression , do n't teach their dogs to play gentle , do n't limit games with valuable objects , simply let the dogs fight . As her dog started to pick up these bad habits , she started to find friends from other breeds and it has helped her dog a lot . She 's a true sweetheart .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"& gt ; Well , I am very glad you are here to tell the story ! Well , I truly hope that people do n't forget how painfully stupid , ignorant and violent the USSR was . Nothing like this should ever happen again . & gt ; This makes more sense to me . In Finland they sell lots of reindeer ( not sure exact species ) or used to up to about five years ago , and in other central and southern European countries there is also controlled ( varying by region ) hunting of deer or hoofed animals . About the ban ... Hoofed animals are definitely on the menu , but I sort of doubted for a second about the hunting rules , but yes , dogs are allowed here as well . I 've eaten reindeer meat twice and once it was sort of `` meh , I 've had better '' , the second time it was glorious : P & gt ; Yes , especially if in Estonia there is no stray dog or overpopulation problem ( what is the situation there ? ) and you are importing dogs from shelters in other countries . The situation is far from good . We do n't have dogs ( or cats ) roaming the streets like we used to 2 decades ago , but not every dog is being adopted . People interested in getting a pet do n't bring dogs from foreign shelters . We have plenty in our own shelters and in addition to that there are a couple of people importing street dogs from Russia , Belarus and Ukraine in order to sell them to Finland . That does n't help the situation of our own one bit . The current law demands all of the dogs that leave shelters to be sterilized or castrated . I do n't like the idea of it as I think that most owners actually do manage to avoid unwanted litters and many of the dogs are far from fully grown , but at the same time we continue the endless battle of explaining why it 's not ok to let some random dogs make puppies `` out of love '' and then try to sell them as purebred without the evil FCI papers . Then again , I think it has gotten a lot better . & gt ; Spain is a bit far away for rescues I guess , though I can see an Estonian wanting to buy a Spanish Water Dog and getting it from a breeder in Spain , the UK or some other country closer to you . My dogs father is from Southern France , so that unethical puppymiller drove all the way and back to bring herself a champion and then start milling away . My friends friend bought a dog from Turkey . They both drove half way . & gt ; We drove to France over a couple of days ( with 4.5 month old Spanish Mastiff puppy in the car with us ! ) to collect our 8 week Beauceron . Wow ! I ca n't stand my kids in the car that long , but maybe a couple of dogs are ok : D I think that the mindset that You have is the correct one . It 's just a couple of days on the road , but You 're going to spend years with that dog later on . You ca n't risk a bad breeder . & gt ; What you say about the breeders there is awful . Sadly there are so many unethical situations in so many places . Ugh . Not all breeders are like that of course , but there are problems with goldens , labradores , german shepherds . The breeds are simply so popular and the demand for dogs is so high that the breeders have no problem protecting each other as they use each other 's dogs in breeding . I researched my dogs breeder for 2 months , called over 15 people . She was so nice and my dogs parents are actually with very good temperaments and looks . Yet the health ... Only after I gt my puppy did I start finding odd things about him . Oh , the lies , I was told ! ! ! The I accidentally met the doctor that had chipped my puppy . She immediately recognized the dog , told me horror stories and all the pieces started to fall into place . All thanks to one vet and 0 other breeders . I 've learned my lesson the hard way and can only tell about my story advising everybody to be EXTRA careful with the extremely popular breeds . & gt ; I am really sorry about all your puppy 's health problems . I hope you can keep her fit and healthy with the right food . Thank You ! It 's getting better : ) It was truly horrible and at times I did n't think he would make it . He 's such a sweet puppy , loves us dearly and we love him to the moon and back . & gt ; Often people make a mistake or do n't choose the best breeders with their first dog . I did n't know any better the first time I bought a dog , but by the time I got my second and contacted that breeder , it was very different . Really excellent in so many ways . You live and learn . : ) The thing is - I tried to pick the best one . She 's still spoken about as a very good breeder . I 've pointed out that she knew about the healt issues even before breeding and it does n't seem to turn any heads . She has males that everybody wants as they are the champions . And those everybody just keep their mouths shut . I ordered the ichthyosis test for my dog and after receiving the results , posted them to 3 different databases ( one local , 2 international ) . Who ever wants to will get to the info . I refuse to just sit on this and do nothing . Only after I faced some other puppy owners did they admit that oh , yeah , they are havng some major issues themselves . So sad ... I home goldens lose their popularity and then only the good breeders remain/emerge .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"Just like in most of Europe , Estonia has also banned cropping and docking . You can import a cropped/docked dog , but the procedures could not be done in Estonia ( and no , there are no clinics that might do it for any sort of money ) . People used to have personal protection dogs ca 20 years ago due to the rough times there were in the country , but not any more . Due to the climate , dogs that by breed standard are meant to `` guard '' homes AND are able to do so , need to have very thick double coats and are not in any danger of being cropped/docked . So no doberman is actually used to guard anything here . There are people who like the look of mutated ears and tails , but they are a minority and mostly just show-offs . Serious breeders and people who want to train their dogs to the highest standards do n't import docked/cropped dogs . As far as I know , our military , police and customs tend to use other breeds . There is no necessity to crop/dock anyone . Edit : Yes , u/SharpStiletto is correct . At least in Europe , personal protection dogs is either a thing of the past or has n't been a thing at all .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"It 's a non-issue . In Europe most dogs are intact and do n't break their tails . If an ear infection occurs , then medication is used and all is well again . Dogs communicate with their tails and ears . Why would you want to cut these things off just in case ? If you think that dogs with long tails and floppy ears is a problem then cutting them off is not the solution . You will be cutting every single dog and there is no end to that . The real solution is not buying these dogs and as the demand drops , only the breeds with very short tails and pointi ears remain . You do n't seem to want to do that . Somehow you think that cropping and docking is the preferred option .",Uralic,Estonian

Huskys , Malamutes , Samoyeds , Beagles , Jack Russells and pugs are also very popular . What about in your area in general ? Does it tend to tilt towards short-haired breeds ?

So no , a dog is legally not exactly the same as a car . The thing is that in most of Europe docking , cropping and declawing without a valid medical reason is considered the same as abusing your pet . In the US it 's not . It 's pointless to argue that the government should n't regulate it when you already let the government take away pets from people who do n't treat them right .

6unauss,dogs,"Ultimatums where a thing in the soviet times ... What can I say - I almost died because of the idiotic rules . You see , I was born at the end of the month , and the limit of that month 's caesareans had already been exceeded . The delivery lasted 42 hours , but that did n't matter . So , if it was told that each `` member state '' needed to create it 's own dog breed , then that became the new plan : D I read the second quote and looked into it as it sounded wrong . It is wrong . By 1934 , the number of huntable animals had catastrophically reduced . and new regulations were designed to prevent further decline . In 1937 a hight limit of 45 cm was set to hounds and in 1940 it was raised up to 55 cm on one condition - that the hound would not pursue deer ( do n't know the correct terms ) . To be sure , the dogs were tested for it . This favored the use of low growing hound hunting . Today there does n't seem to be such ban . Plus we have tons of deer , moose ect . You 'd be suprised how many rare breeds exist here . It 's absolutely possible that we have some dogs of your breeds . Short-haired breeds are gaining popularity mainly because the mindset that a dog has to live outside , has to endure -30 degrees celsius ect has shifted . I currently own a 9 mo golden retriever , but a year ago I was seriously considering Kromfohrländers . There are still none of there dogs here . I managed to find some in Finland , but decided to get a golden due to some personality traits that would n't have suited us . Still - I almost took the leap and brought the first Kromfohrländer to live in Estonia . There are tons of people like me here , who actually travel far longer distances and come back with a breed that nobody knows about . It 's a breath of fresh air . My golden truly has the best personality and suits our relaxed lifestile well , but I really regret feeding the popular breed market . I was severely lied to by the breeder that was fully aware that my dogs mother and dad should be off in terms of breeding , we 've left a hughe amount of money to the vet office , to the emergency room and now on top of the allergies , gastrointestinal problems , ichthyosis and food intolerance - I have a suspicion that all is not well with the puppy 's hips . I 've done tons of detective work and it seems to be the same pattern with all the popular breeds . As the country is small and all the breeders know each other , they have formed a protective circle . Even the better breeders do n't tell the truth about the unethical ones . And they know ! I 'm fairly sure that my next dog will be either a rescue mutt or some unpopular breed to avoid feeding these scumbags . The dogs are suffering and my heart just brakes .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"They say no , because the client wants it , is willing to pay and it 's not illegal . I already asked about it in another comment , but I 'm going to repeat it again . Do you all honestly think that it 's a final and absolutely ok solution to keep cutting dogs tails and ears off ? And let 's not even discuss the ethics , or the dogs feelings ect . Is it really the only way ? If you truly belive that the ears and tails are a medical problem , cut the damn demand on these dogs and the breeders will either start looking for a solution or other breeds will emerge . As long as there is demand for the dogs that are produced today , the breed will not change towords the direction where no cutting is needed . There are so many breeds that are not being cut . Saying : `` But I want this one ! '' while disregarding the fact that with the breed comes a problem ( according to you ) is simply immature . If the ears and tails are such a problem as you say - then there are truly defective dogs being bred in North-America . I do n't belive that , but if this is the case , then put an end to this and do n't support the production of deffective dogs .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,dogs,"But it is kept in the hands of the vets . The vet ultimately decides , but that does n't rule out legislation that : 1 ) gives the supervising organ ( animal services or whatever it is in your area ) the tools to take action if they suspect that the reasons are not valid ( ask the vet some proof , for example ) ; 2 ) gives vets the tools to decline from said procedure even if the owners insist , but there is no medical reason for it ; 3 ) gives clear instructions to your local FCI sub-organisations ( or what ever it is that is responcible for shows and other competitions in your area ) to ban dogs that have been `` modified '' from the shows . The last point has come up in Europe as there are breeds that need rhinoplasty in order to breathe . Of course it 's ok to help them breathe again , but these dogs should not be able to compete and thanks to the titles reproduce more and more sick offspring .

6unauss,Documentaries,"I agree 100 % , but wanted to add that it 's always about pipelines , weapon sales , some zika funds to scam money out of ect . Never about democracy or freedom ! I 'm no flat earth believer , but have seen oh so many scams in my life that I do not consider everything that the government officials , `` star-scientists '' like Bill Neye and other well funded people with conflict of interest say as the pure truth that can not be challenged . The reason why it 's impossible to come up with a solution to the problem stems from missing dialogue . The opponents are extremes , the elite is either divided into two extremes or misrepresented by the sensationalist media . Pick a side ! Everything and everyone are either black or white ! All this talk about saving the planet while the war industry is on full gear ? ? ? That 's why most of Europe does n't believe what the USA has to say . What we see in Europe - The USA goes in ( as we 've seen multiple times , the `` last straw '' for the USA has been based on a lie ) to bring `` freedom '' ( read : sell weapons , build pipelines , expand its market ect ) , shit hits the fan , Europe gets to deal with the flood of refugees , the USA wipes its hands clean , shouts `` freedom '' , in comes McDonald 's and Starbucks . I 'm 90 % certain that even if you do n't consider racism , fear , lack of funds and other reasons , the feeling that the USA just shat on Europe and expects us to eat that shit now is a vastly underestimated feeling that lurks in the hearts of many Europeans . The feeling that we are no longer in control is something that is especially familiar to the ex-soviet part of Europe . We 've been there , we 've seen how it does n't work , we 're STILL trying to integrate the 30 % , some of which does n't want to integrate . It 's shitty even over half a century later . I 'm not against bringing in refugees , but order must remain and we 're not able to take in more than we can handle . For example the ultra liberal side must understand that each country has its laws and the refugees must follow them as well . There has to be a mechanism to send back the ones that do n't follow the law . Today , this mechanism is missing and it 's a problem . The far right side must look deep inside them and find compassion . The thing is that as long as the USA does n't taste the shit that it 's brought upon Europe , these wars will continue to take place . Old wars and lies will be forgotten and new ones will be started . If by any chance the USA is challenged by China or Russia and pushed from the world police position , nothing will change in terms of refugees . The place of origin and the destination may change , but not much more . The solution does n't lie in not letting everybody into Europe . The solution is to eliminate the initiative to start these wars . The one that offers a way to do that is actually worth a peace prize .

6unauss,DIY,"Smart lighting could help a lot , but if you do n't plan to keep the lights on all the time , you should still consider the amount of natural light reaching your room and bouncing off the walls . Depending on the purpose of the room you may consider a mirror near the window on the wall that light hits the most or on the wall opposing the window . The point is to capture all natural light and spread it in the room . It may not suit if it looks wierd or for example reflects light into the eye of somebody sitting on the sofa . If the room gets extra small amount of natural light , you can also consider painting the window wall lighter than the rest ( even white may suite ) . As the wall where the window is gets less light than the other walls , it seems darker in contrast to the window and other walls . You can brighten the whole wall by painting it in a lighter color . If you have perfect walls with smooth finish , you can pick a glossy paint that also reflects light . Avoid it if the walls are not that smooth . There are lots of materials with drawings out there explaining the logic behind choosing the right colours for specific conditions . You may raise the ceiling or widen the space with paint .

These are not some quick flips . He usually buys rare pieces in a good to mint condition , holds on to them , waits for the right collector , sometimes for years . No immediate cashflow . Could you do it ? Probably not . Me neither . Still , you ca n't say that car investing is not possible . There 's this saying here . When even the taxi drivers start talking real estate , you know the bubble has arrived . At the moment the market here is hotter than in 2007-2008 ( that was the peak in Estonia the last time ) .

6unauss,pics,"I totally agree with You . BTW There is an old Russian plant near Estonian ( and Finnish ) border and all of the countries in this region are constantly monitoring the s***hole called Ленинградская АЭС ( Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant ) . It 's reactors are the same as Chernobyl 1 and 2 . There has been [ some action ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Nuclear_Power_Plant # Incidents_and_accidents ) previously that makes us feel a bit uneasy . The reactors should have been stopped in 2010 , but the Russians decided to take a gamble . After all , there is nothing at stake here , is there ? ! In 2012 they decreased the output of the plant by 80 % due to safety measurements . That sentence does n't mean that it 's now producing 80 % of what it could . Nope , it means that the plant is producing ca 20 % of it 's nominal capacity . Why ? Well , they hope to extend the life of the plant some more . Expect some nuclear action in North-Eastern Europe soon ! My only hope is that when ( not if ) that happens , the wind will remain blowing from the west for ... errr ... a couple of years .

6unauss,AskReddit,"What ? Well , that 's not true ! Even in the smallest European countries the media is in the native language . Relatively few people use foreign news sources as there is simply no need for that . What 's more - You seem to assume that English media is somehow superior or the source language of all foreign news . That 's not true either as most of Europe does n't have English-speking countries as neighbours . Even if it was true , then why would it be necessary for students to learn 2 or 3 foreign languages in school and many people learning additional languages later in life ? English is a popular second language mostly because of all the English entertainment available . That 's why kids learn English even before school . It 's the cartoons , later British and American film industries . Secondly comes the fact that the majority of new software is English . Thirdly - because doing business with the Americans , Brits , Australians ect is impossible without speaking English yourself . They rarely know any other language . Granted - the British are slightly better at that and sometimes can at least understand French or German . In most of Europe it 's simply considered a sign of illiteracy to be able to speak less than 2 foreign languages . 3 is ok and above 4 is very good . English is more widespread as it is a very simple language to learn . Most of the other European languages are far more complex and require more time and dedication . I would also argue about French , German , Spanish and Italian people not speaking English . I have NEVER encountered negativety about that , but what I 've heard from my American friends , is that it depends on the accent . Variations of American accent might be frown upon . That does n't mean that the French do n't want to speak English . They might not want to speak AMERICAN English . I 'm not defending them , just noting the nuance .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,pics,"I do n't want to understate the contribution of these people in any way , but felt the need to point out that no one went there voluntarily . USSR picked people from it 's soviet republics and forced them to go . For example from Estonia alone 4833 men ( 20-39 years old ) where sent there . Many of the people had NO CLUE whatsoever that this `` mission '' was going to be somehow dangerous . They were lied to and in order for You to understand why they did not suspect anything ... There was NO free media , even the Ukranians did n't know exactly what had happened . Whenever there was ( is ) a catastrophe in the USSR ( Russia ) , the so-called media always belittles the impact , delays the news and avoids asking any help ( khm- [ Kursk ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kursk_\ ( K-141\ ) # Naval_exercise_and_disaster ) -khm ) . Few had somehow got the word that the `` emergency '' was actually more like a disaster . Those , who knew that and had ANY contacts in the system , used them and did everything to avoid going . 85 % of the men remained there 3-4 months although it was promised that no one should be in the area more than two months ( well , the USSR lied a lot ) . The main protective gear was cottonwool mask . Iodine was given to 30-40 % of the men and with such a delay , that it was useless . Altogether there were 600 000 “ liquidators ” . 50 people died shortly after the catastrophe and it has been estimated that another 4000 lives have been/are shortened due to the radiation . In addition during the 3 years following the accident 1800 cases of thyroid cancer among children was discovered . Reports claim that absolutely everyone survived the cancer , but still - not a walk in the park kind of disease . What we can learn from this is that many lives could have been spared if the plant had been in a more developed and less who-gives-a-fuck-about-human-loss country than the USSR . Or ... probably had n't happened at all . The people that were sent to Chernobyl are heroes , yes ... but most became that due to the terror of USSR . Edit : Fixed wording .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,DIY,"& gt ; peat Well , that was deffinately not the case as I have always grown my strawberries in the same peat-soil mixture sold in plantations and meant for containers . The thing is that some of the containers ( and the drainage point ) were too deep for most strawberry species ( probably not the right word ) that tend not to grow their roots as deep as other species . The others were too shallow ( roots constantly in water ) . Tried growing cucumber and tomatoes as well ( again special soil from plantation ) - neither liked the conditions . The containers worked with flowers though . Have used the same soil in the country yard ( dug a hole , lined with weed-block ( also blocks some smaller pests ) and in the new containers - everything grows like crazy . Edit : grammar",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,DIY,"Have used several smaller versions of this system and to be honest - it only works with specific plants . You have to choose plants considering the exact depth where the drainage point is . Even then You ca n't expect it to work when the plant is not fully grown . This makes the system pointless in case You want to grow the plants from seeds . As I already had the containers , I tried to make it work for 4 years and always got to the point where some plants with roots going way deeper or never reaching the point , where the water is , needed to be watered from the top . Last year I finally gave up and built wooden containers with a mesh lining in the bottom , plastic lining covering the whole of the inside ( poked some holes in the bottom ) and wheels underneath . As the conteiners are situated on a tiled surface , I added shallow plastic container pans that do n't let the water ruin the tiles . I grow strawberries in these containers and must say , that thanks to the proper watering and wheels I have managed to double the harvest . I turn the containers frequently and this seems to stimulate the plants to produce more strawberries . It also makes it easy to shelter the plants from heavy rain , winds and hail storm - simply push the containers under some shelter . I really advise to try this instead of messing with watering from below . It only works if You choose the `` correct '' plants . Edit : http : //imgur.com/a/bhNTI Added 2 photos taken with a potato , unfortunately did n't take a photo of the mesh stapled under the garbage bags . I plan to replicate the containers in my country house , but then make the containers larger and pick industrial sized wheels for easyer maneuvering .",Uralic,Estonian

If You had seen Your parents ' naked bodies and not just once , but up until say seven years of age , You probably would n't think of it as a wierd thing and there would be no false shame . It 's more common in Northern and North-Eastern Europe to go to sauna naked with the whole family . From what I 've heard it seems that North America is very conservative considering anything related to naked bodies AND children .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,tifu,"As I used to be a swimmer ( and here in Estonia most swimming pools have gender specific showers without any partition walls ) , I did n't have a choice and showering naked in front of 20 naked women was simply a fact . Then again I think that this boosted my confidence as a teenager . I learned that there are very few women with `` perfect '' bodies and most of us have some flaws . Ergo - most men must have just as imperfect bodies as women ! I suddenly realised that I had absolutely nothing to stress about . The fact that one of my breasts was a bit larger than the other or that I had a quivering ass did not matter at all . My husband has a similar bacground and used to shower after football ( soccer to You ) practice with 20 naked dudes . So , because of that environment and the fact that my husband also knows what the average female body looks like , we do n't feel uncomfortable being naked in front of each other . I truly belive that if we lived in a place where only perfectly filled breasts , butts and six-packs were exposed , neither of us would be as chill walking around at home naked and that would n't be a bad thing either . If the marriage is happy and full of love then hell - do n't undress at all or go naked all the time ! Other people should not have a say in that : ) Oh and about the part of You considering Yourself conservative ... A formerly religious friend of mine used to be extremely conservative and I really could n't imagine her finding a husband outside her church ( Estonia is considered the least religious country in the world and that limited her options ) . Well , today she is 32 years old , married and expecting her first child , but what 's more - she married to a man from another church and today they are flaming atheists AND nudists ! ! ! That 's far too extreme for me . So , be warned ( take it as a joke ) - You too may one day become a nudist : D Edit : typo",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,tifu,"You are right , probably there is a limit and it depends on both the child and the level of nudity that the parents are showing .

I am a woman , several of my friends have had abortions , I 've gone to the clinics with them , supported them , told them that it 's really going to be ok . I am pro-choice , but ... Am I missing something important about the law ? ? ? How the hell is 27 weeks the line in US , but in Europe many children are born on week 24 and survive ? ! ? ! An infant born on week 27 does n't survive on it 's own either . It needs immediate medical attention in order to survive and in order to develop further . Being pro-choice , I truly belive that drawing the line after week 12 is absolutely adequate if there are exceptions left in case the fetus has serious development problems . What kind of education system does the US have if there is such a necessity for abortions AFTER week 12 ? What are Your sex-ed classes good for if such a vast number of pregnancys are undetected before week 12 or so many girls and women know about the unwanted pregnancy and decide to abort it later and not sooner ? ! The later the abortion is carried out , the riskier it is for the mother . How is this not acknowledged ? You are comparing the 12-week ban with other states . What about the rest of the world ? At one point you have to accept that reclessness , stupidity and ignorance can not be tolerated and do n't deserve freedom . With freedom comes responsibility , especially if it involves other lives . It is not ok to do harm in the name of freedom . Yes , I too have been recless ( actually an idiot ) and just been lucky . I own up to it . After these incidents I took the SOS-pill and started taking pregnancy tests as the sex-ed classes had taught me that being an idiot does not exempt one from the consequences and responcibility .

In that way You can train the puppy to wait/follow You and teach him that You will not follow him . Changing pace and direction is a great and very mild way to do that . The more You show him that watching You is the most important thing , the easier it is to walk with him later . Bring the pace down , stop for breaks , let him run around while You sit down ( a simple way to see if he might be tired after all ) .

6unauss,dogs,"First of all - I agree ! You need a proffessional to teach You . There are many problems starting with lack of exercise and ending with aggression . I 'd say that the barking is the least of Your problems . Now , the thing is that exercise consists of two parts - physical and mental . It 's rather easy to take the dogs for a walk ( one dog at a time , once a day at least 1 hour , the other walks can be short ) , but their minds need exercise as well . As the outside world is intimidating for at least one of the dogs , You need to exercise them mentally it in Your own home . How food-motivated are they ? The base of most training is the fact that You own food . The dogs have to EARN food from You . Remember to practice these things with one dog at a time . You can replace any of these words with what suits You best . 1 . Take some treats ( or kibble ) . Put one piece in Your right hand . Let the dog concentrate on Your right hand . Show the dog that You have the treat and say WAIT . If it tries to take it , close Your palm and hold Your finger up as a sign . After the dog calms down , show him the treat again and repeat it until the dog waits at least 2 seconds . Then say TAKE and let the dog eat the treat . Do n't expect much patience at first . The purpose is to let the dog understand what WAIT means . That can be useful learning to be silent and wait in the cage , wait for food ect . TAKE is important so that the dog understands that he is under command and is realeased only after You say so . Try this with soft food as well . Hold some canned food in Your closed hand and order the dog to wait . If it does so , squeeze some food out saying TAKE and let him lick the food . Once in a while tell him to wait and stop squeezing . 2 . When WAIT and TAKE are clear , start practicing with a non-favourite toy . A rope is really good for that . Keep treats nearby and start practicing taking away the toy . How ? Take a treat in Your left hand , approach the dog and holding the treat offer a switch telling him THANKS . If the switch goes well , approach the dog with a treat in Your pocket , hold the rope from both ends , say THANKS and offer the dog a treat . If the dog is not ok switching , offer better/larger treats or start with something less interesting than a rope . Normally I would recommend teaching the dog to give away objects by putting Your index fingers behind the object inside the dogs mouth , BUT as at least one of them has agression problems it might be better to leave this for the future . 3 . Your dog Max seems to show food related agression . The exercises above are just babysteps in overcoming that . I would seriously suggest You to start feeding Your dogs from hand in order to show them who controls food . If You want to give Your dogs bones , let them wait and then give the TAKE command . As switching treats for toys becomes easier , You can start switching treats for bones . Do n't leave him hanging and give the bone back as You see that the dog has eaten the treat . Always use WAIT and TAKE commands . These exercises are something that You should first teach Your dogs and then let them do these with Your family members and boyfriend . The ability to trust Your boyfriend and give him the toy should reduce some problems . If You are not always able to feed the dogs from hand , You can also use toys that can be filled with canned food and then frozen ( Kong toys ) . If Your boyfriend arrives to Your place , give the dog a Kong toy filled with yummy food . It may help .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,puppy101,"This ! A 16 week old puppy needs 3 feeding times that should be no more than 10 hours apart . The pup is just hungry . It 's totally fine to feed the puppy , go for a 15 minute walk ( moving at a faster pace helps the puppy poop ) and then tuck him in for the night . It 's like with human babies - eating right before bedtime is absolutely ok . It 's not and adult human trying to lose weight that the OP is dealing with : ) Edit : inserted explanation",Uralic,Estonian

The cribs are often given away for free and the parts are totally useable .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"You 're mixing things up a bit . Teaching Your dog to hunt for treats does not mean leaving a bunch of treats around . Te point should be mental stimulation and it should be done in a controlled situation under Your orders . For example making a trail of saucers leaving treats under some of them and teaching Your dog to find the ones with food under them . He should be allowed to eat the treat only after You give the permission . All is not lost , but You ca n't turn back time . You have to keep in mind that most retrievers are constantly hungry . Please forget the shock collar and mouse traps . You would simply be punishing Your dog for something that YOU teached him to do . That 's as wrong as can get . Instead teach Your dog two orders - WAIT and TAKE . I 'll copy-paste my own instructions from another post : You can replace these order words with what suits You best . Take some treats ( or kibble ) . Put one piece in Your right hand . Let the dog concentrate on Your right hand . Show the dog that You have the treat and say WAIT . If it tries to take it , close Your palm and hold Your finger up as a sign . After the dog calms down , show him the treat again and repeat it until the dog waits at least 2 seconds . Then say TAKE and let the dog eat the treat . Do n't expect much patience at first . The purpose is to let the dog understand what WAIT means . TAKE is important so that the dog understands that he is under command and is realeased only after You say so . Try this with soft food as well . Hold some canned food in Your closed hand and order the dog to wait . If it does so , squeeze some food out saying TAKE and let him lick the food . Once in a while tell him to wait and stop squeezing . By practicing it consistently , Your dog learns to hold himself back when it comes to food . At the same time look for mental stimulation exercises involving treats . The one with saucers is good , but Youtube is full of other good ideas . The point is that all these exercises should be done under YOUR control . If You want some fun for Your dog while You 're not around , find special toys that are meant for that ( Kong toys , puzzles ) . NEVER leave any food around or shit in the toilet ! You have to aknowledge what kind of breed You have at home and not fool Yourself . Retrievers live to eat . It 's what they love the most in life . Do n't punish him for that . Instead avoid situations where it might be a problem . If Your roommates do n't understand this , You can buy shock collars and mouse traps for them .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"Thank You for the clarification . To tell You the truth - I 'd move with the dog . If You ca n't trust Your roommates , It 's bound to end badly as it is an unrealistic expectation that Your dog smells some chicken bones on a plate left on the coffe table for 8 hours while You 're away and does n't react to it . You ca n't fill Your whole home with mouse traps . Dogs are opportunistic and even if he learns that eating from the bin ends with pain ... He will not associate this with eating from a random plate . Edit : spelling",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,"I 'm just finding it very hard to imagine the traps working . Your dog is not an idiot and will soon pick up where the traps are and how to avoid them . Plus mouse traps can really do some damage . Most of them are designed to break the mouse 's neck . I do n't know how much You 're willing to invest , but there are garbage bins that are more difficult for dogs to open . There are sort of railings that prevent children and dogs from grabing stuff from the counters , there are toilet systems that close the lid after the person has stood up . Maby these might help , but still ... there 's the coffee table that You ca n't control . Edit : One more thing .

That alone does n't mean that the deniers are 100 % correct . The main problem is that it 's considered stupid and uncool to challenge the claims of the supporters . Now THAT is truly unscientific . Whenever someone tries to point out the serious flaws of research that does n't allow the claims to be definitive , he is targeted by blind believers that have stopped questioning . And that applies to both sides . Yet , questioning everything plays the most important part in the curious minds that we should be , but no longer are . I believe ( as there is no definitive proof ) that there are changes happening . We can not predict the severity of the changes and we are not able to pinpoint ALL of the causes . One of these seems to be human activity , but then again , there are other causes originating from out of space , from the Earth itself . The numbers vary A LOT depending on where and how the observation has taken place , who finances the research and what't the researchers ' bias before starting their work . The media tends to show us poor polar bears fighting for their lives due to melting ice , but fails to point out that the south pole ice breaks maximum records . It 's just called bad public relations . I 'd compare the whole subject with vaccinations . If the supporters ( and I 'm one of them ) would stop lying and stick to the whole truth each time , then the opponents would n't have as much ammunition . The problem is human nature . It 's difficult for us to admit to some flaws .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,I made a [ sliding version ] ( http : //imgur.com/a/lOXMe ) for my daughter 's room . I must admit - I failed to add a lock at first and our golden soon figured out how to open it : D,Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"And this is ok , but what about the minority ? Are these girls and women not aware of what causes pregnancy ?",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,Wow ! I 'd find an other trainer ... I truly hope that You can find a solution . It 's not the dog 's fault that he has that kind of an urge to eat everythng . I have a golden retriever and believe me - I know the challenges . On the other hand You can see it as a plus . High food motivation makes training with treats super easy . Use that to teach Your dog things that some dog owners would n't even think about . Labs can be amazingly obedient dogs ( with some exceptions in the food department ) . By training obedience Your dog gradually learns to control his urges even when it comes to food and even when You 're not around ( it takes a very long time ) . It 's funny what You said about surviving in the nature . I always say that about goldens . They would die in a couple of days in the wild . Poisoning or gastrointestinal blockage would be the two most probable causes . I sometimes look at my golden and almost cry thinking about how it 's like to live one 's life feeling CONSTANT hunger .,Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,UrbanHell,"Depends on the `` khrushchyovka '' , but some of them are making a comeback as all the new buildings offer things that I and many other people do n't want . For example - open plan kitchens with no way to divide kitchen from the living room ( I have two kids and a large dog - I frequently need to keep them away from the kitchen ) , no actual seperate space between the entrance and living/dining area ( a must in our muddy climate ) , awful sound barrier between neighbors , no hallways meaning that the living room has 5 doors and nobody has any privacy in their rooms . There is an actual demand for these characteristics that the newer buildings do n't meet .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,UrbanHell,"Haah , used to live in Väike-Õismäe and loved it as a kid ! I can see my old house and my kindergarten in that picture . Our friends used to make 3 or 4 circles around the place looking for the right building : D However , the pond in the middle was a death trap as several people ( including children ) drowned in it during a number of years . This is the only disrict in Tallinn that was designed to accomodate all services , living spaces and jobs within itself . The only two things that were not built were a cinema and a theatre . The plan was grand , but even then unrealistic as people still tended to work outside the district .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,UrbanHell,"What ! ? ! ? ! ? I had no idea ! My sister visited Romania a few months ago , but apparently visited the tourist traps and nothing else . I had no idea about this . She described Bukarest as one of the most interesting places she 's been .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,dogs,Children play around her home as well and yet she poops INSIDE her own house every day . Can You imagine !,Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"I never said that I oppose that . I have 2 children myself . I 'll explane You briefly how it 's solved in most of Europe , but specificly in Estonia . The standard procedure is that all girls and women register their pregnancies before week 12 . Local financial aid ( that absolutely everybody receives ) depends on that . If You register Your pregnancy before week 12 , You will receive that aid , if not , You wo n't . The number of pregnancies not registered before week 12 is truly very tiny . Belive me , the human body works pretty much the same on both continents . Up until the end of week 12 it 's possible to abort the pregnancy without any medical reasons . Most doctors perform ultrasound , blood and urine tests ect before week 12 as well , but the ultrasound during week 13 is mandatory for everybody . This determines some risks . During week 15 additional blood-tests ( here called the triple-test ) are done . These combined with the week 12 ultrasound determine if it 's necessary to take a DNA test on week 18 . As there are risks involved , an additional ultrasound is done before that and the doctor then decides if there is any risk of a severely unhealthy baby or not . After that up until week 24 another ultrasound ( called infant anatomy ) is done and that is really the most important one as by then it 's 99,9 % clear if the baby has serious abnormalities . Up until week 24 it 's possible to abort the pregnancy DUE TO MEDICAL reasons ( that means problems with the baby OR the mother ) . Of course all these and all other blood and urine tests , health checks are free .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"I wrote it in another reply , but how is this possible , that in Europe the % of women that do n't get to the doctor before week 12 is paltry , but in the US it seems to be such an issue ? There is something seriously wrong with the WHOLE system in the US and the ones that suffer are women AND unborn children .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"This is exactly what sex-ed teaches in Estonia . If You 're having sex and You would deffinately abort the pregnancy , You need to test yourself once in 2-3 months . If You do n't have regular periods ( I had my period once a year before my first child ) , You have to take extra care . It 's not an excuse ! ! ! Human body is not that different in the US . You can apply that regret factor to ANY period of time . That 's why there is counceling , that 's why it is taught from an early age to detect pregnancy EARLY .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"Well , Reddit is usually so very proud of the freedom of speech .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"No worries . I actually expected a far worse response : D The thing is that it 's really unexeptable that the US has it covered when it comes to so many other fields , but healthcare - WTF ? ! ? Why is this less important than police forces and firefighters ? Why is educating children a taboo in many groups and the government allows clueless parents to raise their children ignorant ? Each next generation is supposed to be smarter , have better access to more TRUE information .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"You DO understand that it was irony ? No ? You do understand that I 'm not American and do n't give crap about Your constitution . BTW , yes , it is possible in Europe to go to prison for Reddit comments . In fact it has happened in many countries for extreme manifests about Jews and I 'm fairly sure that this would also happen in the US if anybody felt that the comment incited violence against some group of people or one specific one . The medical professionals in Europe have decided that the limit for abortion in case of non-medical reasons is 12 weeks and in case of medical reasons 24 weeks . It has been suggested by the medical community and turned into a law by the parliaments .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,OldSchoolCool,"Do You have a link to any of the tests where these third row seats are involved ? I looked and could n't find any . The rear window is one issue , but there 's hardly any crumple zone and I truly do n't belive that the kids ' feet would be safe .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,OldSchoolCool,"Well , that 's the thing . The floor of the boot is intact , but the boot is collapsed ( probably due to the fact that it was a tractor , which makes the point of impact higher ) . Looking at the pictures nobody can say how far the boot collapsed right at the time of the accident . Of course it bounces back . Again - it may just as well be , that the additional structure works , but as long as there are no crash tests released ... It 's just a guess .",Uralic,Estonian
6unauss,TwoXChromosomes,"It 's also about the principles that the Americans carry regarding abortion and personal rights . Instead of forcing Your local politics and congress to solve the shitty situation about inadequate sex-ed , inaccessible abortions and health care in general , You are cheering that it is possible to abort a pregnancy ( and I do n't mean for medical reasons ) after the fetus has grown significantly , the abortion has become a serious risk to the mothers health and the fetus might very likely survive if born alive at that time . Do n't You see where the problem is ? You do n't get what You pay for . This is not freedom for women . It should n't be a right to do more harm than necessary and while I agree that today , ( due to the inaccessibility of abortions ) it might be necessary for the limit to be at 24 weeks , at the level of economics , medicine , social capability ect that the US is today , there is NO REASON why it should remain at that . Other , and much poorer countries are able to do that . Why ca n't You ? ! The ones that are n't taught proper sex-ed , are n't even given a chance to decide for themselves . Where 's the freedom in that ? Freedom to drive 50 miles to a clinic to have an abortion during week 25 ? It 's bad . Really bad ! It 's like third world bad . You could make it legal to abort the fetus on week 38 . It would n't mean more freedom for women . Most would probably call it extremely selfish and barbaric . Well , for comparison - In Europe it 's considered barbaric to kill a healthy fetus during week 27 . I already explained why . I read these posts here and feel as if You 're simply being hoaxed . Hoaxed into beliving that Your freedom has been taken care of , while actually it 's not . I ask again - Why is it considered freedom to not educate Your children properly ? Why is it not considered neglection ? Why is it called freedom to not have access to proper health care ? Just do something about it instead of praising the authoroties for turning the situation even shittier .",Uralic,Estonian

6unauss,aww,"Question : I have a son with anxiety problems and we are currently waiting for a golden retriever puppy ( mother and grandfather are therapy dogs , father has the same personality , but as it looks rather stunnig , it 's a show dog ) . We are hoping for the puppy to have the same personality as it 's parents and therefore start training it as soon as possible to become a much needed help for our son . But ... I 'm thinking about what happens when the dog dies . I know that it probably lives a good 12 years , but what then . How is it usually handeled ? Is a new puppy introduced and trained before the old dog dies ( how might that be possible if the old dog still works and takes care of its owner ) or will the person in need of a service dog live without a dog for a while ? Edit : Do n't live in the US , but still interested in how it 's done over there .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"From me as well , thanks for the feedback . I 'll only go over the design of the sidebar as gyno already touched on everything else .

We tested 3 different designs of expandable rules plus different variations of those as well . I wanted it to fit the overall default look of the subreddit while using the already existing colors from the sidebar . It does say `` hover for more info '' right under the rules , but it 's kind of small ( again to save space ) .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Yeah , that sounds fine .",Uralic,Estonian
9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Not exactly , though it certainly can look like it if you bump it all the way to the max . It seems to affect contrast in the mid-tones , making it look more sharp . You can also go into the negative values with clarity which will make your photo look muted and even blurry . It 's better used as an adjustment brush rather than globally across the picture . [ Here 's another dramatic example . ] ( http : //2.bp.blogspot.com/-2dXoEqP9iKk/VSGjsoBe1dI/AAAAAAAAWmc/WwBShJE1c2o/s1600/MitchDeClarifyed.jpg ) Saving both is a good idea , though it 's the option that takes the most space on your card , so only do that if you have a big enough memory card .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"ISO 400 is fine , but with that shutter speed you could have easily dropped the ISO down to 100 . Did you shoot this in raw and did you edit this at all ?

[ Here 's an example of what it does . ] ( http : //www.lifeafterphotoshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lightroom-hdr-03.jpg ) If you did n't shoot in raw , I suggest you look into it .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"I like where you were going with this , and I think I know what you wanted to achieve , but I find there are a couple things wrong with this shot . The crop just is n't working for me . [ I 'd have gone with something tighter on top and bottom ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/dH4w7p7.png ) , even more than what I did , but I wanted to leave the speaker in . You should have also left some more room behind his back for better composition ( always shoot a bit wider , you can later crop ) . Second thing is the green tint . I think warmer tones would fit the old music a bit more , so I did a [ color balance fix ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/agMIl9D.png ) and later also added [ a slight gradient map ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/zEdaQRk.png ) - could n't tell which one I prefer . Since you used an f/1.8 lens , you could have gotten a bit closer to him ( since I cropped off a bit from below ) and achieved a bit shallower depth of field , which would make this shot even better . Not a whole lot , but just enough to blur the background and the TV a bit more . Lastly , [ I noticed this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/4QWQPbJ.png ) . Do n't know what happened there . Seems like you used an adjustment brush , maybe an accident , maybe a compression error , who knows . I 'm not the best at this so do n't take my opinions on everything ( or anything ) as the truth , but I feel like pointing out other people 's mistakes and trying to improve their pictures is a way of learning things myself .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Generally yeah , and yours should too . RAW files are essentially just the raw data that your camera 's sensor captures . JPGs are great for sharing , but if you shoot JPGs straight in the camera , you lose a lot of the detail and editing capabilities as JPGs are already compressed and edited a little bit by your camera ( usually a little bit of contrast and smoothing to get rid of some noise ) . RAWs are much bigger in file size ( generally if you have a 20 megapixel camera , you have a 20MB raw file size ) . Shooting in raw means you will need to do some postprocessing as it rarely looks good straight out of the camera . However , you do get a lot of benefits while shooting raw such as capturing a lot more detail and being able to bring it back even if you under/over exposed ( [ example ] ( http : //www.fastrawviewer.com/sites/fastrawviewer.com/files/field/image/FastRawViewer_ShadowBoost.jpeg ) ) . You can also change your photo 's white balance in a photo editor even after shooting ( something that gets locked if you shoot JPGs ) . I usually just use the automatic setting for white balance on my camera and correct it in post if the camera got it wrong . It 's great not having to worry about it . The downside of raws is that it adds another step to getting your photos out into a final stage where you can share them , because the raw file formats are generally not supported on any image sharing sites , meaning you 'll have to open them in your image editor ( the one you mentioned supports raw editing ) and after editing your photo , you 'll need to save it in a different format ( jpg for photos , generally ) .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,Ah interesting . It 's recommended to use a longer focal length for panning shots as it greatly increases the motion blur of the background ( but it 's also harder to track the object ) . You can open the aperture open wider for this kind of shots so you can get a faster shutter speed .,Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,photography,"I 'm looking to get my first full frame camera , though I 'm in no particular rush . Currently I 'm looking at Canon 6D , because of its lower cost and the negative aspects of the camera do n't matter to me too much . However , I 'm completely unaware of Nikon 's naming system and I was wondering if there are any Nikon bodies that are around that price range that can compete with 6D . I 've also read that there should be a 6D mk2 coming out some time next year , so would it be sensible to wait till then to get it at a further discount price ?",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,photography,"I have a Sony a58 , and even though I have n't used the other two you listed , I do n't think I can recommend it . The plastic lens mount has worked just fine for me and one of the reasons I got this camera over other similarly priced cameras was the front scrollwheel for changing aperture/shutter speed/other settings . I do n't like the digital viewfinder , I do n't think it 's bad but the digital part is just something that does n't sit well with me . The camera also has a fixed half-transparent mirror , which makes shooting in low light a bit more tricky . Also there is noticeable noise already at ISO 800 . If you 're considering the 18-55 mm kit lens , then it 's not very sharp , and at 18mm ( mine at least ) has noticeable blue tinted vignetting . I 'll update this comment if something else comes to mind , but for now this is all that I can think of . Edit : typos .",Uralic,Estonian

9Ghillie,pcmasterrace,"The term water retention ( also known as fluid retention ) or hydrops , hydropsy signifies an abnormal accumulation of clear , watery fluid in the tissues or cavities of the body . Water is found both inside and outside the body ’ s cells . It forms part of the blood , helping to carry the blood cells around the body and keeping oxygen and important nutrients in solution so that they can be taken up by tissues such as glands , bone and muscle . Even the organs and muscles are mostly water . The body uses a complex system of hormones and hormone-like substances called prostaglandins to keep its volume of fluid at a constant level . If one were to intake an excessive amount of fluid in one day , the amount of fluid would not be affected in the long-term . This is because the kidneys quickly excrete the excess in the form of urine . Likewise , if one did not get enough to drink , the body would hold on to its fluids and urinate less than usual .

0Gorthaur0,Catholicism,"Yes , as far as I know ( but surely , I ca n't speak for everyone ) . I can only speak 100 % sure for Poland and Hungary ( which are not western , but almost 100 % Catholic ) , but the anti-russian sentiment & amp ; media of the western countries often portrays Orthodoxy as some superstitious religion , and the Orthodox leaders heavily connected to the state . Also , the historical figure of Rasputin ( who represents Orthodoxy for the average Catholics living in a mostly Catholic country ) heavily influenced the average image of an eastern priest : mysterious , wild , uncivilised . As far as I know , this opinion is also common among protestant Europeans . Also , the pictures of Orthodox priests blessing guns/tanks/vodka did n't really helped in fighting these preconceptions . However , the pictures of Ukrainian priests standing beetween rebels and government forces maybe contributed to showing a real side of their religion.But , again , I ca n't speak for everyone , nor for every country .",Uralic,Hungarian

Yavanna supports this theory , when she says : some works can only be done once '' ( I 'm not sure if this is *exactly* what she said , I do n't own an English copy of the Sil. ) . I guess that non-valar and non-elves also own some kind of this `` will-power '' . However , this is n't a very clear thing in Tolkiens works . Magic is never described in details .

I think , that Tolkien felt the same way in the trenches of the Somme , as the romanticist writers in the age of heavy industrialisation : He wanted to feel the peace , and the idillic society of the long lost past .

0Gorthaur0,ArtefactPorn,"The Hungarians of the 10th century were probably a mixture of Turks , Ugors , and some other Eastern-European folks . This week , I heard an interesting interview on our state radio with a researcher . According to the recent genetic researches , some 20-25 % of the 10th century Hungarians showed asian ( mainly central and north ) characteristics , the other were eastern-european . Now , almost no Hungarians ( except the ones who live in Transylvania , or in Moldva ) show traces of Asian genes . According to the researcher , the reason of this is intermarrying with the Europeans of the Carpathian Basin . The old legends connect the Hungarians to the Huns , but most of the modern scientists rule out this possibility . However , it is not impossible , that some fragments of the remaining Huns became a kind of aristocrats among them , and united the tribes . Our culture is not homogenous : it shows both Asian and European characteristics .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"Today marks the centenary of the beginning of the Battle of the Somme . Tolkien also participated in this horrid operation . More than 1,2 million soldiers died or became severely injured in the offensive . I thought it would be interesting to share the thoughts of the Professor about his experiences : > One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression ; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years . By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead . Tolkien was always a pacifist , and it 's also worth to read some of his thoughts about World War II : > Well , the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter — leaving , alas , everyone the poorer , many bereaved or maimed and millions dead , and only one thing triumphant : the Machines . As the servants of the Machine are becoming a privileged class , the Machines are going to be enormously more powerful . What 's their next move ? ( Letters 96 ) It 's also important to note , that many of his great thoughts arose in the darkest of times : He first started thinking about the idealistic world of Middle-Earth in the trenches of the Somme . He dreamed about better times , when humanity lived in harmony with the greater powers of this Earth , and with the Nature . > It was just as the 1914 War burst on me that I made the discovery that 'legends ' depend on the language to which they belong ; but a living language depends equally on the 'legends ' which it conveys by tradition . … Volapuk , Esperanto , Ido , Novial , & c & c are dead , far deader than ancient unused languages , because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends ... ( Letters 180 ) So , I thought it 'd be important to share this , because his philosophy always amazed me , and how he found peace in writing in those desperate days . Please , share your opinions .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,Christianity,"So , somebody made a post about the Lord of the Rings , and its Christian paralells . I thought you would enjoy this poem from J. R. R. Tolkien : In Habbanan beneath the skies Where all roads end however long There is the sound of faint guitars And distant echoes of a song , For there men gather into rings Round their red fires while one voice sings – And all about is night . Not night as ours , unhappy folk , Where nigh the Earth in hazy bars , A mist about the springing of stars , There trails a thin and wandering smoke Obscuring with its veil half-seen The great abysmal still Serene . A globe of dark glass faceted with light Wherein the splendid winds have dusky flight ; Untrodden spaces of an odorous plain That watches for the moon that long has lain And caught in meteors ’ fiery rain – Such there is night .

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"The Elves who spoke with the Númenoreans were n't just elves : They were Emissaries of the Valar . I think that the Valar knew , or at least could 've guessed the exact fate of mortals . Also , the Valar do n't seem to be the types to use merciful lies , so I do n't think they would give false information to the men , just to discourage them from going to Valinor . Also , the voyage of Bilbo and Frodo ( and later Sam ) to Valinor was not a reward , and this is also explicitely said in the RoTK : they ( especially Frodo ) *had* to go there , because the mental damage ( by the Ring ) , and the physical ( by the morghul knife ) was unbearable , and could n't be healed in this world . And , as the letter above says , the Valar do n't have the power to lengthen the lifespan of Mortals .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,And how the world *is* beautiful because it is broken .,Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"What do you mean by active help ? The Valar help in many ways , but the only `` active help '' ( by my dictionary ) is when they finally kick Melkor out of Angband , and when Ulmo tells about the plan of Gondolin to Turgon ( However , that was through a dream , so I 'm not sure if it 's active ) . But , the water , the strongest manifestation of Ulmo carries off the Ringwraiths . The stars of Varda give Sam the hope he needs . The ents , created by Yavanna , destroy Isengard . And , the descendants of Thorondor help Gandalf on many occasions . I do n't think that Manwe told the eagles , that `` Rescue my homeboy Gandalf '' , I rather think , that he was rescued because the eagles still patrol the skies , and still are on the side of the Free People of ME . They *are* creations of Manwe , but as Dwarfs are n't servants/messangers of Aule , the eagles are most certainly not just errants of Manwe . So , I would n't really call anything in LoTR an `` active intervention '' , but in their own ways , these things are *because* of the past interventions of the Valar .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I 'm not really sure . Maybe the wind itself was created that way , to aid the good cause ( this seems rather ridiculous , but we ca n't rule it out completely ) . This point could be argued endlessly , since Tolkien does n't give an exact explanation on how this works ( and it is very good this way ) . However , I admit , I overlooked the wind , and your point is good , but again , I 'm unsure .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"Surprise : Swords and horses were part of the human warfare until the XXth century . Although bows became useless much much faster , they 've still been around for a couple of thousand years . This is the historical reason . The reason Tolkien never developed advanced technologies for ME , is because the people in this supposed `` ages '' were living in an idyllic society , and they did not wish for these kind of things ( as Tolkien did not wish for them in the XXth century , and as many of us do n't wish for them now ) . Although , there are some places , where you see clear examples of technological advancement : The works of the Noldor in Aman ( fëanorian script , the palantirs , and because of Melkor 's temptation , weapons ) , or the Golden Age of Númenor ( shipbuilding , astronomy , mathematics , architecture , and in the time of the Darkening , weapons ) . Another reason , is that in the third age most societies were in a decline process . There were many many examples of technological developement going backwards in human history : after the fall of Rome , for example , most of our knowledge about engineering/siege engineering was lost , and Western-Europeans had to relearn it from Byzantium , and the Arabs , invent new menthods , or rediscover the old ones .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"Yes , I get your point , but even iron weapons were ( in most parts of the world ) in active use for more than 3 thousand years . So , I should have written iron swords , instead of simply swords ? The blacksmithing techniques have also seen some improvements , but as I gather , the medieval Europeans did n't really achieve big results . But correct me , if I 'm wrong . I 'm not a history expert , but I try to do my best .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"No , I do n't think , and I did not write that . First , I wrote the feanorian alphabet . That was created in their `` Golden age '' . Than , because of Melkor 's influence , they created weapons . I also wrote the same with the Númenoreans . They had advanced knowledge in mathematics , astronomy , etc.. In the times of their Darkening , they misused this knowledge : started to create warships , weapons . And , at last , the servants of Morgoth/Sauron/Saruman even created machines . I do n't think he objected to having a roof over his head . But get the Letters , and you will clearly see , that he objected to having cars , that ruin the countryside , he objected to using atomic bombs . He hated advanced machinery , for a very good reason .",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I 've been thinking about this , and maybe my take is wrong , but I think that it 's the seal of the door . ( This idea sound simple , I know ) . I still like the Arda Marred theory of u/SkylanderOne",Uralic,Hungarian
0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"I ca n't really answer the first part of your question . However , it is possible to overcome a curse . Mim cursed Androg , but it is stated in the Children of Húrin , that Androg overcame the curse , when Beleg healed him from his arrowshot-wound . Although Tolkien clearly states , that the curse is over , it 's still interesting , that Androg dies from an arrow later ( if I remember correctly ) . Melian also stated , that it 'd be possible for the Curse of the Children of Húrin to break . So , it always comes to the unanswered question of TCoH : Was Túrin the victim of his destructive nature , or the Curse of Morgoth ? And , it is stated , that the curse of a dwarf is especially strong , so I think this means that weaker curses also exist . I think the power of the curse comes from the nature of the `` curse-caster '' , rather than an outside power . Definitely not from Ilúvatar , or one of the Valar .",Uralic,Hungarian

Such explosives in men 's hands , while their moral and intellectual status is declining , is about as useful as giving out firearms to all inmates of a gaol and then saying that you hope `` this will ensure peace '' . But one good thing may arise out of it , I suppose , if the write-ups are not overheated : Japan ought to cave in . Well we 're in God 's hands . But He does not look kindly on Babel-builders . I was lucky enough to see the Hiroshima Dome with my own eyes , and I think I only then understood his thoughts fully .

100courics,budapest,"I live by Oktogon and all I can say is that the entire area is packed with pubs/bars and lounges . Two minutes from Retox there 's a ruin bar called [ Instant ] ( http : //instant.co.hu/ ) . If I recall correctly , there are three separate dance floors and places to sit and drink . However , a beer is like HUF 800 , so do n't go there TO get drunk . For places to get cheap alcohol , I 'd primarily recommend shopping in a grocery store ( CBA and Spar are the most common ) . In Retox 's street , there 's a pub called Bakeger . It 's a basement bar at the corner of the street . It 's a genuine old man 's pub , but a lot of students discovered it ( myself among them ) over the past couple of years because a mug is HUF 250 and shots are cheap too . The good thing about that place is that it 's cheap , in the city centre , and a place to go out rather than drinking in the hostel room . But , once again , do n't expect shiny lights . Sometimes there are only old alcoholics there , sometimes the place is packed with foreign students . Non-party related , but you should check out Margaret Island while you 're here . It 's grassy and a cool place to sit out with your friends and drink or just enjoy the weather . There are a few clubs on the island , but to be honest they 're not the best . My friends and I went in one and spent half a night figuring out why there were so many guys , and then found out it was a gaybar . [ Szimpla ] ( http : //www.szimpla.hu/ ) is the place virtually every foreign young person/student goes to first in Budapest . It 's in the 8th district , so it should be about a 20-30 minute commute ( tram/walk ) . Alcohol rules are the same as Instant : do n't go there just for the drinking because it will add up . People go there to mingle with loads of other foreigners ; the only languages I heard there before were English , French and German . Maybe once a few words of Hungarian . Szimpla is the icon of the term `` ruin bar '' . It 's where the movement began . Definitely a place to check out . Other than that , like I said , the entire area near Retox is packed with fun establishments . Nagymezo street has nice bars next to each other , but my favorite is the Grand Boulevard ( Nagykorut ) . cafebars next to each other for half a kilometer or so ( places like Gong Cafe , Gong 2 , Limit Bar , etc ) . This place has an iconic nightlife .",Uralic,Hungarian
100courics,polandball,"Of course we did bad shit but saying that we - or even Horthy - welcomed the alliance with Nazi Germany is a massive exaggeration .

100courics,hungary,"For Hungarians , the situation is complicated even though the two mainly-involved countries are Ukraine and Russia . Many Hungarians feel that Ukraine falling apart would provide the opportunity to return the 150,000-strong Hungarian minority ( in a country of 40+ million ) in Sub-Carpathia to their native land , seeing as the region was historically Hungarian . It was just a Stalinist decision which created Zakkarpatia and moved hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians/Russians there in the 50 's . Anyways that attitude supersedes any other critical approach for many Hungarians . The problem is many Hungarians , even after 45 years of occupation , clearly never learned - or forgot - the horrific burden Russians come with . There 's a saying here , `` Hungarians are amnesiacs '' . Because they forgot the effects of the German/Russian occupations and clearly do n't learn from mistakes made by our ancestors in the past . As far as Ukraine goes , I see more empathy for the rebels for the most part . That 's because of the above-mentioned situation . The situation of Hungarians in Romania , Slovakia , Serbia , Ukraine etc are often deemed comparable to Russians in Ukraine , and as Hungarians they always feel the need to reunite with Hungarians . Unfortunately it 's really hard for Hungarians to translate this to other western nations in the 21st century since the fate of the entire continent may be decided in just a few years - so there 's a little more at stake than the 150,000 Hungarians in Zakkarpatia . It 's also not making it easy that our PM placed all his eggs in the Russian basket , seeing as Russia is now viewed as Europe 's pariah . Yup , Hungarians were always terrible diplomats , arguably the worst which is why we always drew the short end in the past 150 years .

Remember that Franco was already aided by the Germans in the Spanish Civil War . Also , if the Allies landed in Spain , they would have to cross the Pyrenees to get into France . Mobilizing such a large number of men , machinery and munitions would be time-consuming , thus unnecessary . & gt ; The Nazi 's did not occupy France so would n't it mean a much less opposed invasion into Europe ?

The emperor could easily have looked past it , should it have been an assassin in a more significant country ( France or Germany instead of Serbia ) - The alliances that we all know of today were n't remotely as clear back in the day . Everyone knew France and the German Empire were n't best friends , but the loyalties of countries like Great Britain ( who had at that point recent royal lineage ancestry in Germany ) , the Russian Empire , Italy , and ( most importantly ) the United States were still very questionable . -The treaty of Versailles was nothing but a public humiliation move . Everyone wanted to make it seem like the Entente were just walking around , doing nothing , when suddenly , out of nowhere , the evil Central Powers tried to rape them . Already by the time the Second Balkan War was over , everyone knew there was going to be another , potentially more devastating war .

This was also a bit weird ; the United States , while neutral at the time , was unlikely to ever enter a war against Britain or France at that point . However , Germany had weapon licensing contracts with the Germans , which at first made them ( the Germans ) assume the US was at their side .

Recently , both the executive and legislative branches began to think they are no longer accountable before the people , having to answer only to fundraisers and oligarchs . They have to be reminded who truly rules over them . An amendment would create specific points of accountability . For example , with the Snowden case , the NSA would be held directly responsible for the spying on American citizens within the US . And by the NSA , I mean everyone in AND around the NSA who knew of it , had the power to stop , but chose not to . These people would be prosecuted and jailed . This is a crude drawing obviously , but the main idea is visible : clear pointers from accountability . Nowadays , when a scandal erupts , political leaders handle it by blaming and firing a few higher-ups , while keeping themselves and the system the same . That has to stop .",Uralic,Hungarian

100courics,economy,"Hungary is either going to come out of its recent developments as the ultimate European winner of the 21st century , or will go back 50 years . In 2010 an eccentric ( to say the least ) right-wing government was elected . I 'm saying this because one has to understand the political logic behind economic investments of a state . Anyway , this government is a proponent of strict scrutiny of the economy , rather than the anarcho-capitalist idea of letting the economy regulate itself . Now this attitude alone garnered proponents and critics , the critics being by far the larger group : -Opponents of these events are claiming that Hungary is slipping back into a socialist state-like situation in which the government creates a bubble by fixing prices and inflation to make the people *think* life is golden - as happened in Hungary when it really was a socialist state . -Proponents say that what I just wrote is a gross exaggeration of the situation . It is true that when Western entrepreneurs arrived in Hungary in the late 80s/early 90s , most invested only to drain money out of the country . Meanwhile , the majority of the first generation of Hungarian entrepreneurs ( those who began to work in the private sphere which began to appear by the early 80s despite communism ) became oligarchs who could n't give less of a damn about the country 's economy or condition , they just wanted to stuff their pockets . Basically , while Hungary officially pulled ahead of most ex-communist bloc countries in the 90s , Hungarians themselves had tragic experiences with the private sphere . But , apparently , the current government gave the green light for partial monopolies to twenty-some western companies it has confidence in through strategic partnership agreements . Most of these are companies which have been in Hungary since the 90s AND actually contributed to the economy through taxation and job creation . For example , Coca-Cola : http : //www.kormany.hu/download/a/40/c0000/Korm % C3 % A1ny-Coca-Cola_en.pdf Another is Suzuki : http : //www.suzuki.hu/pages/display/corporate/article/cikk : suzuki_enters_long_term_strategic_partnership_with_hungarian_government You get the idea : the government wants those companies which are known to have been beneficial to Hungary 's development to continue investing . How has the EU been reacting to these events ? There has been sparring between the Union and the national government on a weekly basis in 2012 ( it mostly cooled down by the end of 2013 ) . Two of the four freedoms of the EU are really the issue at hand : movement of goods and capital . The European Commission said Hungary was barring these fundamental values by enacting legislation which a ) favors Hungarian brands over foreign ( protectionism , which the EU tries to combat in all member states ) and b ) tries to limit the investors to only those who the Hungarian government can trust . The Hungarian economy has improved , despite alarming voices . FDI figures reached new heights in 2012 , if I remember correctly . The budget deficit is under control and the EU removed Hungary from the Excessive Deficit Procedure last year , which it has been under since joining in 2004 . It 's not a spotless method , however . The current government inadvertently may also have presented an atmosphere in which small-to-medium private entities are discouraged from forming , threatening a fundamental value of capitalism : competition . Another alarming note is the Hungarian government 's recent ( yesterday ) decision to upgrade and expand the country 's nuclear power-plant with the aid of Russian funds and Russian work . http : //www.euronews.com/2014/01/14/nuclear-deal-between-russia-and-hungary/ Here 's the problem with that : Russia never , ever gives anything for free . East-central and eastern European countries are continuously bullied by Russia through energy exports . It basically exercises hegemony in the region through energy such as natural gas and oil . What 's odd is that , while the other countries in the region are trying their best to pull towards the West , the Hungarian government actually voluntarily approached the Russians with this idea , denying a tender for the project ( which means there was no official competition announced , which many Western bodies would have been glad to enter ) . This also brings us back to the freedoms I mentioned earlier . The Hungarian government denied the right to freedom of the movement of capital by denying a fair competition - not to mention that it denied this to EU competitors in favor of Russia . The `` good '' news is that ( officially , at least ) it 's just monetary investment , meaning Hungary will simply have to pay back the money . That 's good because at least that can be done . The real problem would come if it was agreed that Russians would provide the energy itself ; then , Hungary would become the next Ukraine : whenever it would say no to Russia , the Russians would cut energy supplies , paralyzing the country . Just my take on Hungary 's economy . I know , a lot of this seems like it does n't have anything to do with what you asked but they 're all related . Hope this helps .

So there 's a large cultural distinction between Serbs and Hungarians , but not so much between Hungarians and Croats - aside from plain ethnicity . Also , there was still conscription in Hungary in the early and mid-90s . There are urban legends of the Antall government secretly working out scenarios in which Hungary would be drawn in by the war ( if there was genocide against ethnic Hungarians for example ) .

100courics,explainlikeimfive,"In terms of legality , it does ( or so it should ) . Since the US has a negative constitution , it focuses on curbing powers of authority , not enabling them ( as is the case with most European states ) . In itself , the Second Amendment should n't even be questioned ; everybody knows it was meant to allow citizens to possess firearms , not [ this ] ( http : //tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy-images/Bear % 20Arms % 20a % 20Right.jpg ) . However , there were things that the Founding Fathers could simply not foresee . For example , even repeaters would n't be introduced until several decades after the drafting of the Bill of Rights , let alone machine guns and weapons of mass destruction ( NBC ) . Many anti-gun enthusiasts argue this and claim that if the Founding Fathers lived today , they would probably support gun control laws . Obviously this can never be proven so it remains a grey area instead . The rise of guerrilla warfare and modern terrorism also questions the black-and-white validity of the Second Amendment . In 1788-89 , guerrilla warfare could n't have been imagined since firearms were relatively primitive and small numbers of fighters could rarely make it work against larger numbers of organized soldiers . Today , however , as Afghanistan shows us , that is very possible . No Constitution-drafting state in the right mind today would allow there to be an all-out right to bear arms for civilians , out of fear for things like terrorism and guerrilla movements . Of course , it can be argued that many of these outlaws did n't obtain weapons illegally anyways . The media does an excellent job at undermining the Second Amendment . Whenever there 's a shooting at a public location , the media lets it ride for weeks , sometimes months to create anti-gun sentiment among the population . An unintended effect of this is the copycat phenomenon , in which a loner wants a similar set of 15 minutes of fame and repeats the process . This creates more and more anti-gun feelings in the public . This ca n't just be viewed from a legal standpoint , because that is not the only thing that affected such laws in the US for decades now .

German captured English and French had a great survival chance . They were more Aryan than Slavs , who Germany saw as Judeo Bolshevik pawns , and thus as more disposable .

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"This is one of the biggest problems for me which I 've remedied several ways . First , I just look at what he 's really doing and see if it 's so bad .

He pays for me , gives me sex , is the father of my beautiful child , such a nice man , makes me feel safe , why should I bother him over this ? I 'm his partner and I 'm here to help him in a mutually beneficial relationship . The problem is in the moment I can barely help but let it slip . I literally do bite my tongue to help me avoid saying it . Then I shift it to something positive , I might go over and sit in his lap , or give him a kiss , or let him get a glimpse of my butt or something fun like that so I 'm not in a negative mindset . 1 or 2 minutes later it is something that I 've probably already forgotten , yet if I 'd pursued him about it could lead into him being angry or an argument taking place .

Yes there is degeneracy but you can call it out . No SPLC or ADL or stuff like that . Honestly if you want to move to Poland you should marry a Pole and have her only speaks the language to you in the house . That 's how my husband learned German , I would only speak to him in German and eventually he learned it that way . Just as a random aside from that , being in a relationship where you communicate less verbally can be awesome . You need to communicate in other ways so you spend more time physically touching , holding hands , sex , looking at each other , Etc . less of the offhand remarks that tend to start arguments . You re learn the different languages of love , especially in the beginning when you can barely speak and learn to communicate more with touch , sex , facial expressions , and smiles : ) We sometimes went hours together just silently looking at each other , me in his arms .

Most of the stories he had to tell were very very grim , the soldiers on both sides were incredibly cruel to each other . He said they would have to kill an enemy and quickly steal his boots before his legs froze , because the German boots were ill suited .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"I do n't think I 'm as virtuous as you think , I always did do it for myself . I viewed the boys I rejected for wanting sex as wanting to defile me and ruin my chances of a high quality man and thus as bad . I did it in a self interest of wanting a patriarchal husband . I just saw how gender relations worked from a young age , the natural urge of men toward an untouched virgin wife . I only wanted one man in my life , whoever I ended up marrying . These days I keep with that . I 'm only permitted to talk to other men when my husband is present . I 'm sorry if I 'm rambling on I just really love gender roles . The innate tender love between a man and a woman . Do you ever plan on having kids ? I do n't use birth control , my husband and I have a very large house capable of accommodating around 10 kids and we both want a big family . I 'm also home 24/7 so we can make it work . I think having children is essential to marriage , there 's something so intimate about being pregnant , it marks a girl physically as belonging to her husband which I love . It feels so freeing to let go of control and your husband is there to protect you . Being pregnant and held in his arms is the best feeling in the world .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"Interesting . I always love hearing what you have to say from a Catholic perspective .

I started dating ( not in a relationship , just romantically dating ) my husband when I was 14 and he was 19 on and off for a while , and during this time he slept around . For a few years I witnessed him become less and less happy and be destroyed by the life of promiscuity . We started dating again and he expressed his desire to live a pure life with a family and children . I made him wait till marriage totally chaste , not even kissing me until we could become intimate . He 's a total alpha male , everything you 'd want in a husband . Handsome , economically successful , traditional , dominant , loving , protrctve , good genes . I 'm glad I married him but I do wish he never slept around like that because it made him so unhappy , and I 'm glad that he has a woman who will treat how how a patriarch deserves to be treated . It 's not like I do n't rely on him either , being held in his arms and being safe and owned is such a great feeling .",Uralic,Hungarian

I 'm not saying to repress your sexual urges to my level prior to marriage , but its not some awful standard not to crawl in the street in sex clothes . And btw I doubt those super moral pride parade goers would like me or give me much consideration either not that I mind . & gt ; what you really mean here is , no one in your immediate circle of friends would act in this way . i would ask you to define `` normal '' for me , but i do n't want you think i 'm doing it for semantics alone . That 's fine , normal is common/predominant behavior in my view , homosexuality does not fit this , let alone homosexuals like the one I linked . That behavior is not normal by any definition and you know it",Uralic,Hungarian

That only exists in decadent societies . Plenty of places like my country and Russia have actually seen a decline in support for gay rights from the populace over the past several years , and new laws banning homosexual propaganda will help . & gt ; i suggest you broaden your experiences a bit . travel some new places , meet some new people . it is n't healthy to remain trapped within your own bubble of comfort for too long , without coming out to breathe in the real world .

There were 2 million rapes max , so at most there 's an insignificant number of part Russian people in Germany . In Russia however , there were around 10 million rapes by German soldiers .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; when you go around calling other people 'sub-human ' or 'degenerates ' -- that 's antithetical to tolerance . that 's not a sign of confidence ; its a sign of insecurity ( if not complete and utter self-loathing ) . Ok subhumans is too far but not everything here is serious anyway . Degenerate is a very plain term . Degeneracy means evidence of decline , degenerates are people who engage in lesser behavior . It is not a sign of insecurity , and I have no idea how you think it makes me self loathing ? I like who I am . & gt ; a person that is secure with their own standing in the world does not need to shit on others . Wrong , I just recognize that there are sick people in society who need to be called out . Silent tolerance will allow the worst in society to be accepted . & gt ; its one thing to keep your distance from the unfamiliar . its completely another thing to be hostile ( like you are ) to what you can not understand . It seems you think hostility is always a bad thing . Hostility is inherent in nature , even in the animal kingdom different tribes of animals are hostile to foreigners to protect what they have . Even in the worst case , your argument is based around accusing me of being insecure , I do n't think that 's a very serious problem , insecurity even if it were true about me which I do n't think it is . I 'd rather be the watchdog against subversion and be 'insecure ' than allow society to accept trash like pedophiles and have achieved your standard of personal security . I prefer standing up for what I believe is right than you thinking I 'm secure in myself . In fact , yielding in my beliefs due to others judgement is a greater sign of insecurity than sticking up for what I believe in . I 'm secure in myself , people who espouse beliefs such as moral relativism are the ones I view as less secure in themselves . & gt ; the world is chaotic , and neither of us can do anything to change that . again , a confident person accepts things as they are . People can do nothing to change that ? Let 's say ten years ago there was no gay 'marriage ' in America , would you have just accepted that ? People can cause change in the world , only the weak pacify themselves by saying that everything is out of their control . What you call confidence appears more to me as weakness . I 'm interested in what you have to say and its hard to understand your point of view to me .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,CoonTown,Deport them all,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; your desire for structure ( which then leads to repression ) is considered unhealthy by many . I understand that , it is also supported by many and many view the results of your lack of morals/laws governing behavior to be regressive . & gt ; a truly confident person is tolerant of those that are not like them . I 'm very confident in myself , enough to know that all people are not equally deserving of tolerance . For example we should n't tolerate harmful behavior , criminals , liars , etc . Tolerance as a philosophy seems to be rooted in an expectation that all behavior is equal and deserving of tolerance . C.S . Lewis had something similar to say on `` equality '' , `` No man who says I ’ m as good as you believes it . He would not say it if he did . The St. Bernard never says it to the toy dog , nor the scholar to the dunce , nor the employable to the bum , nor the pretty woman to the plain . The claim to equality , outside the strictly political field , is made only by those who feel themselves to be in some way inferior . What it expresses is precisely the itching , smarting , writhing awareness of an inferiority that the patient refuses to accept . And therefore resents . '' I 'm totally self confident , even without supporting lesser behavior ! & gt ; meanwhile , people that are insecure have to cling onto their `` comfort '' , in order to uphold their sense of control within a chaotic world , outside of their control . Hit the nail on the head , I totally agree . I view order/conformity as a better goal than chaos and nihilism . & gt ; comfort is good , if you 're comfortable with yourself . comfort is bad , when you 're using it to sooth yourself from the reality of the situation going on outside your door . You keep acting like a homosexual agenda is inevitable , the opposite is the case . Eastern Europe is moving in the opposite direction of the U.S. , against left wing ideology . 10 years ago , 15 % of Russians supported gay 'marriage ' , today that number is 4 % . When countries have suffered within recent history , they do not accept decadency . Eastern European nations stripped of their independence by the U.S.S.R. , and now understand the true nature of the left wing and are shifting to the right . & gt ; you 're welcome to hate gays , but i 'm not sure what you 're going to do when the rest of the world begins to follow in the steps of U.S . Most Hungarians do n't want to model ourselves after the U.S. , believe it or not we have our own language , race , and culture and our media is n't pushing degeneracy on us . BTW , I do n't hate gays entirely . Ive said this before , I have lesbian inclinations myself , I just do n't do it because I prefer a more rewarding life . What I hate is the self righteous attitude of this entitled , diseased minority who believe they can degenerate one of the oldest human traditions without backlash .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,Modern feminism exists as a [ Jewish cancer ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category : Feminists_by_religion ) which harms modern women in many ways .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Yep . That speech coming out of anyone 's mouth expect for his would be viewed as genius . Hitler saw how international capitalism rendered Western 'democracies ' a farce , something even more visible today . Because he recognized how globalist capitalism was strangling Western culture , he fought against it . Today , the same international elites who control the government , education system , voting system , and media have done their best to portray him in as negative a way as possible . You see some Hollywitz movie with Nazis as the bad guy every six months , even though Stalin for example and even America have killed more people .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"The national socialism subreddit is a subreddit which assumes you know about several topics which are very discreet and most people do n't understand . It is also vitriolic to some degree . For an understanding of almost all the issues they discuss , I recommend reading Mein Kampf and Zweites Buch . Those two books outline national socialism perfectly . & gt ; when I visit that subreddit all I see is white trash complaining about immigrants and jews . Do n't rush to judgement on calling others who you 've never even met white trash . I 've Skyped with a lot of those people before and they seem like very intelligent individuals . & gt ; Another question I have is , is NS about peaceful segregation between races or is it all about violence ? As far as Hitler 's national socialism , it was about securing race homelands for Europeans . He did not want to commit violence for the heck of it , but he was fighting international capitalist forces . & gt ; My last question is are all NS groups anti-Semitic and racist ? If you 're talking national socialism as in Hitler 's national socialism then yes to both absolutely . National socialism has only once existed , non racist national socialism is just an idea . & gt ; And one more thing , can someone point me in the direction of NS economics and polices . Learn about Hjalmar Schacht 's economic plan . Also search more about the German Labor Front , rations , and other techniques Germany used to create a self sufficient economy . They never became totally self reliant , they needed some trade with allies for steel during the war but were far less reliant on globalism for sustenance . I think there was some NS general thread a while back with a lot of info too",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,What non `` racist '' national socialism has ever existed ?,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"That 's an interesting idea but I disagree . Hitler , Theodor Fritsch , Anton Drexler , Himmler , and Goebbels were the main people behind the advancement of national socialism and were all very very racist .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,Jesse Owens was treated well but that 's because it was a spectacle . The few Africans in Germany were sterilized during the Nazi reign . The foreign S.S. fighters were almost entirely European and only a few were non European .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Here 's a short video about it . http : //m.youtube.com/watch ? v=S1Fc0Jtp20c Degeneracy just means behavior showing evidence if a decline .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Ok that 's a bit extreme I admit calling them the NSDAP .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,I think you ca n't stay in the early reactionary mode forever . The mass propaganda and Keynesian spending are short term solutions so big problems . I think over time you have to tone down and move more toward traditionalism with less of a revolutionary aspect . I disagree democracy is the end goal because democracies are often the cause of situations that require fascism . Weimar Germany was a democracy but was horrible for the German people . Modern 'democratic ' America is a joke . I think you need to create a more relaxed and less extreme but still ordered society .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,The difference is progressive 'fascism ' does n't exist in practice .,Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,They have several arguments aside from the usual knee jerk and six gorillion * It is totalitarian and puts the collective peoples success before the rights of individuals . * It limits the 'free movement ' of people around the world . * It has a system of laws which they generally oppose,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"It is actually working well for me , our country like Russia is moving in the opposite direction of the West .

As for transgender , it is in every way inferior to normal people . There is no way to say that mentally ill people who have to surgically mutilate themselves , have a 40 % suicide rate , and many other problems are somehow equal to straight people . & gt ; given that their sexual activity is consensual and is not with minors .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,That 's horrible,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Frankurt School Marxism is mostly a dead ideology do I can lay it out for you . A group of Jewish intellectuals created this ideology . It mainly centers around critical theory . Critical theory is the one element of cultural Marxism that remains common in the far left today . It espouses an attack on `` mass culture '' and political `` hegemony '' . For example attacking `` hegemonic masculinity '' AKA patriarchy and male rule , because that was what they percieved as the 'mass culture ' . Critical theory is the main pillar of cultural Marxism and stresses criticizing society , which obviously is easy for foreigners who have a belief in cultural superiority . Many of these Marxists were Jewish mysticists and zionists , which makes it easy to understand why they disliked European society . During WW2 , a bunch of them escaped to America and influenced the American counterculture of the 50s and 60s by kind of tutoring other influential Jewish revolutionaries in America . Herbert Marcuse for example , went to America and influenced Abbie Hoffman , a famous Jewish counterculture leader . In this way , cultural Marxism served as basically nothing more than an attack on culture . Many attacks on Western morals , institutions , and principles sprung from cultural Marxism . As for the common right wing claim of 'cultural marxism ' , I 'm somewhat wary of this cause its a knee jerk term . Yes , cultural Marxism was harmful and I do see similar beliefs espoused in the media but can not see the influence of Frankfurt School directly today . I do n't know if I 'd call it malevolent . It certainly complains more than it creates solutions and exists as a prasitic ideology on societies whose only purpose is to criticize .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Cultural Marxism in the Jewish Frankfurt School version is a very specific forgotten branch of Marxism .

I think the nationalism would have to gradually tone down from a more reactionary Fascism such as Hitler 's to a nationalist conservative government like Franco . Obviously , the state would have to maintain its laws but I think over time once degeneracy is removed and the society is cleansed of international elements , you have to tone down the nationalism . Obviously keep a closed border and do n't liberalize the laws , but over time shrink the army , lessen propaganda , etc . Pure reactionary fascism is unsustainable over time .",Uralic,Hungarian

No reason why we should take the poorest Africans in the world into our fairly safe and peaceful land . Other countries who have taken in these illegal immigrants have paid harshly . In crime example , in Finland immigrants commit 10x more rape on average than natives . I do n't understand the logic of people who complain about deportations . Illegal immigrants provide us nothing . They demand food , shelter , and protection from our country and give us nothing . What do you think we will gain from these 'refugees ' ? You can be open minded , nothings wrong with that but do n't confuse masochism with open mindness . We should n't punish our own country in the name of empathy",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,childfree,"& gt ; Actually the culture does match europe -- or arabia and spain . Much of it was taken from Russia and Germany for ashkenazim and spain/morrocco for sephardim . Utter garbage and you know this . The culture does not match , the holidays do not match , the scripture does not match , the group behaviors do not match , the ethnicity does not match . I 'm at a loss for what supposedly matches here . What matches ? Because they lived for a period on the soil of Spajn or Germany ? Yet if the cultures matched , the natives would n't have gotten sick of them . The Jews in Spain supposedly were 'matching ' the culture of the Spanish yet the supported the Muslim invaders . & gt ; Also `` partially '' ? Just like you are partially descended from africans . Nope , pure European . I got a DNA test . In fact Russian genealogists recently disproved the 'out of Africa theory ' anyway . & gt ; HAHAHA what bullshit . Most jews dont have the nose , and plenty lack black and/or curly hair . Much of the time it actually is not easy to tell . Lots of non jews get mistaken for jews and lots of jews are pegged as non jews . Nah , I became an expert at it . Even more subtle Jews like Jon Stewart are easy to visually identify .

We did not cause their country 's economic problems . Immigration has proven to be a huge problem in other countries , why should we try it for the sake of 'empathy ' ? We did n't cause their problems , we should n't let them cause problems for us .

It is a negative to society , which is evidenced by the actions of gays . Incredible levels of sexual promiscuity , infidelity , drug use , and STD rates are common among homosexuals , not to mention a general obsession with sex that I 've noticed . As far as this whole gay 'marriage ' thing I 've seen recently , the whole concept is a joke and was really used to slip by globalist trade agendas . And of course we know who is [ behind ] ( http : //www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/22/biden-jewish-leaders-helped-gay-marriage-succeed/ ) this .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"You are awesome , not deluded . She is deluded . Keep being awesome sister ! I 'm so happy I was raised by a loving mother and father who taught me how to get a nice husband , not to be used for sex .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; We 're agreed on that one , though it 's more of a `` muh traditional culture '' than Asian girls specifically , it just so happens that Asian girls usually come from very similar cultures to the one espoused as ideal by the right wing of western politics . If TRP could find western girls with traditional values in similar amounts , it would probably drop the `` Asian girls '' thing . That 's true . Not to mention , in America when I visited , I noticed pretty Asian women with even ugly white men . I think because Asian men are not attractive and white men are , it makes it easy more for white redpillers . I do n't think nihilism is good , especially among insecure men like the many there . One benefit of TRP is the ability to say offensive facts there such as jew naming , redpillwomen is also great .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; HIV ( not AIDS ) is prominent amongst the gay community , i wo n't deny that . and its largely because gay men are highly sexualized , stereotypically , i ca n't deny that either . Gay men are n't sexualized , most people do n't want them to be as forward and crazy sexually , they oversexualize themselves . & gt ; because HIV transmission has nothing to do with sexual orientation , on an innate level . its all about access to sex and unsafe practices . its far too ... black and white to conflate statistics with some sort of moral ideology .

I do n't honestly hate them as much as some people in this sub . I think they have a mental abnormality which does n't make them an awful person necessarily . Despite , on average , this group tends toward vulgar behaviors so promotion of homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality or as a positive thing is harmful .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,So you want your daughter to be the one whore that people have sex with ? /r/relationships is FULL of posts of men who are suddenly disgusted to find that their partners are sluts and drop them .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,Yeah good point,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,NSFWIAMA,"It may not be immoral by your standards to the husband , but to the kids ( assuming this is n't a troll post , which it is ) , having their genetics decided at chance along with all the future questions they will have is awful .

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"Awesome work ! Just an idea , make articles that are obviously telling the truth and right wing , but make them palatable to all audiences so that it can be shared .

The more promiscuous a girl is , the less likely she can find a good long term partner , so I did n't let anyone so much as kiss me , cause for a lot of guys an untouched virgin wife has a lot of appeal . I started going on dates with my current husband and he said he was impressed by how sexually conservative I was . I told him that if he wanted to deflower me he 'd have to put a ring on my finger and so that 's what he did ! We have a very nice life and a beautiful daughter .

You can have a great married sex life",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"& gt ; its important to explore your sexuality to an extent ( in my opinion ) . in my case , i see a bit of pre-marital sexual experience as just that -- experience . a way to learn about what works for you and what does n't ; what you like in bed and what you do n't . ultimately , with experience , you can feel more confident in your sexuality and please your lifelong partner to the best of your ability , etc . to gauge sexual compatibility and chemistry -- both are critical elements in maintaining a healthy sex life . I think it 's far more beautiful to enter inexperienced and to have everything be new . Just two partners together learning how to please each other .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"Basically our subreddit is about maintaining long term relationships with our men . I 'll try to summarize the main points as quickly as I can . We recognize men and women are different and have different needs in a relationship . We put our men as a very high priority in our lives and we wish to make their lives easier , which will end up improving the relationship . We put effort into our relationships and try to make them work well . One thing that I noticed is how you said that the woman gives sex to the man , that 's a bad attitude , it 's a mutual activity which benefits the relationship .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"Yep , it 's rather nice that way .

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"It totally depends . Some retards think reactionary is anything right wing , I think reactionary characterizes regressive ideologies such as primitivism and anarchism and some 'back in the old days ' conservatism . I think Nazism as Hitler had it was totally revolutionary . He destroyed the banking establishment , destroyed the German left wing movements , and he created a new society with totally new ideas and characteristics , moving forward . He wanted to create an organization of European states too , contrary to those who say he only cared about Germans . Mussolini in my view may have been a combination of reactionary and revolutionary , he wanted a new Roman Empire and he brought order to Italy , so in a way he was trying to go back to the old days , but he infused many new ideas so he 's partially revolutionary too . I think it 's fair to say Franco was a reactionary",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,"When I was 14 I was dating a 19 year old . That same guy ended up marrying me . We did n't have sex until we married either , we just got to know each other , spent time together and then married and started having sex . The feminists are afraid of youth , afraid of virginity , and afraid of beauty because generally speaking they lack in those categories . As a result , they try to push men to wait until later ages by which time girls are often already deflowered . A big age gap in dating is only a problem for a society which is perverted and expects all couples to be sexually active . An age gap is also beneficial because it enforces patriarchy and accounts for the fact that women mature faster . It also allows the man to be better able to provide for his woman and for her to be in a more reliant role .",Uralic,Hungarian

I generally wake up a half hour before my husband to make him breakfast and get myself presentable . When he 's out of the house and I 'm home alone is when I work , so he does n't feel like I 'm putting myself through a lot of trouble . I would also recommend working briskly , if you do you can get a lot of work done in that time .

2PantsLady,RedPillWomen,"I honestly waited till I was married to have sex , it let me have a very high quality husband . There are two caveats to that though . I live in a mostly Catholic country which is very traditionalist in some ways . I also was dumped by many many guys who wanted sex before marriage which really bummed me out . These days I have a great sex life though . This I can be sure of : Do not have sex on the first or second date . This is how you get slutzoned . If you want to save yourself for marriage , there are a lot of traditionalist Catholic and Mormon men who will be fine with you saving yourself if you choose this . If your goal is to get married , you have to make a guy desire something from marriage that he does n't currently have . Let 's say you decide to have sex with him before marriage . If he does n't live with you and wants a housewife type gal or wants you to live with him , he might want to marry you to do this . What I 'm saying is , if your goal is marriage , make sure he has something to gain from it . If you sleep with him , and live with him , and cook for him , and do all the stuff wives do before you marry him , he does n't get much more from committing to you . But let 's say you save yourself and do n't cohabitate with him , and you simply go on dates and outings with him , he might be more interested . Then he finally gets to conquer you so to speak and have you around 24/7 when you marry . That 's why divorce rates are lower for couples where the wfie saved herself and where they did n't cohabitate .",Uralic,Hungarian

If I lived in Hungary at the time I would have been outraged . At that time however my family was in Northern Germany . One benefit of the dismay of the border disaster of Trianon is that the anger about injustices to Hungary boosts nationalism .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateAnarchism,"If you read Mein Kampf , Zweites Buch , and The International Jew , you will understand why anarchists want those destroyed . In my opinion those books just fit too well with how the world looks today for people to just ignore the prophetic elements of them and not take them seriously . You ca n't read the International Jew for example , just to learn about racist literature without learning the truth in what Ford said .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Of course , I 've been stocking up lots of weapons , clean water , dry food , and camoflauge suits . It may be an overreaction but I hate Russians and wo n't be unprepared . I respect their right to nationalism , but for a country with such an alcohol problem , massive corruption , prostitution , and so many other problems , their belief in culture superior is totally false .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Lol , an 'atheist'who worships Jewish scripture . Stormfront is for dumb Americans with no actual parties that represent them . My home is in the Hungarian wild .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,She started the cock carousel ride ?,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"That sounds pretty ideal . I do think the wife should be submissive to the husband however . I also think that women should not have to work . My husband earns the money and I make his life as easy as I can make it through baking for him , comforting him , sex , looking good , etc . I think gender roles are a beautiful thing",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"Ahh do n't worry about it . Reddit is full of sad , weak individuals who lack morals . You wanting your wife to be a virgin is totally acceptable and good . Fuck them , you want to have a nice life , perfectly said .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; Yes , of course . Submissive but not a doormat or like weeabo-style submissiveness . I just mean that she should keep a positive attitude , let him lead , and be sweet and loving . Not to be a doormat but to just be a loyal , loving wife .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"For banking control , that 's a historic fact that many Jews freely admit , I do n't want to spell that out , you can ignore it if you do n't believe it . For media control I recommend reading this article about how they control United States media . It is incredibly monopolized and controlled by 6 main mega corporations . http : //www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 This article addresses the origins of the owners of these media giants .

Generally , I go to sleep safe in his arms but it feels kind of worrying when he 's not there to hold me . I 'm pretty paranoid about that kind of stuff so generally I just have weapons on me . If I 'm jogging or hiking I generally open carry a P226 , and that makes me feel super safe . At home , I usually invite a girlfriend over to keep me company .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Jews because of how much they control the media and finance , thus shifting public perception to whatever they want . They are also the primary opponent of Hungarian nationalism .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"That 's kind of bogus , I 'm a huge slut shamer obviously but what purpose does it serve in this case ? At least she 's trying to better herself and become more feminine for her guy instead of ranting on about how he should accept her or whatever . Besides , the amount of girls you can find who are a virgin is very low , like 12 % or something , and those only go to the most alpha men generally . Considering her fiancee probably is n't an alpha , its still a fair win if he gets a girl who has the guilt of the past and work to rectify her mistakes by being submissive .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,The U.S. is going to absolute shit same as Europe . The U.S. military is draining its budget . And I do n't know what the U.S. has to do with this anyway .,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; I spoke ill about my sexual past and called myself a slut on /r/relationships but they removed the original post because of my `` sex-negative language . '' I acknowledge my past was disgusting and awful but the only thing I can do at this point is to educate girls younger than myself so they do n't make the same mistakes . Wow , 'sex negative language ' , what utter crap . Being Frank should n't be frowned upon . Apparently anything that does n't idolize promiscuity is bad to those white knights . Anyway , good luck on self improvement , it 'll be a long road but its worth it . I recommend redpill women as long as you do n't mention your sexual past , cause they 'll attack you for that .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"& gt ; Know how you said you 're `` rich '' ? Hire someone to teach you social etiquette , since you 're very rustic and vulgar , very low class in manner of speech , especially noting your comment history . Maybe it 's because English is my third language retard , and I never speak it to anyone anyway . & gt ; I 'm not going to be convinced by an article on a website run by Nazis that the Jews are the cause of every economic problem . They invented this thing called Google which you can use to fact check an article . I use it all the time . And did I say Jews are the cause of every economic problem ? You claim I 'm unintelligent yet apparently have n't learned how to read yet . I said they 're over represented in the media , something which can be determined in 5 minutes of self research .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"& gt ; For someone who claims to have such a happy life , you 're very frigid , and again , you 're very low class , on par with with those obese women you 'd find selling fruits and vegetables in backwoods village markets . Oh man , and you 're an unnatractive Slav , Im sooo offended . Coming from a Marxist perspective though I am literally high class . & gt ; Where 's this whole anti-White Race thing in all of this ? Do you honestly believe that they operate on the level of an advanced beehive with the sole purpose of destroying Europe ? And do you as a Marxist want to destroy all that is holy and have everyone live in polygamous communes ? ? ? This is the type of question you 're asking . Stop misrepresenting . & gt ; If that is the case , you should n't be allowed to own guns , like the P226 you claim to have , or have children Cause I 'm making up a story about owning a pistol to sound cool : p I live in an isolated area , not having a gun is unheard of . Good luck stopping me from having kids btw",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Of course free speech should be allowed . And this whole Dylann Roof thing is bullshit anyway , in America the vast majority of violence is black on black , followed by black on white , its so shocking to these people now that a white person kills black people because statistically its so rare . Far more violence has a white victim of a black person than bice versa , but the media focuses on stories that present blacks as victims . People should be allowed to have confederate flags , spread hate , and speek hate . My whole view on why the media is overhyping this is I believe it 's part of their effort to spread a gun control agenda .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,AntiPOZi,I 'd put money on him being a crypto,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateNazism,"& gt ; Personality traits are 50 % inherited and 50 % not . This is a fact of Sociology and the debate on what influences human behaviour more has been over since the 1970 's . You ca n't conflate social theory with mathematics . You 'd have to actually find a source saying that 50 % of traits are inhereted . Let 's say Henry Ford writes the International Jew and says that 30 % of Jews are evil . Just because that 's his social theory does n't make it true . & gt ; I wan na make it clear that I do n't put them on a pedestal either & gt ; Continues to exalt over the amazing accomplishments of Jews and explain why they do no wrong & gt ; There is nothing special about the Jews , and the real enemy are economic warlords that hoard trillions of the world 's dollars . The real enemies are European Royalty , Southeast Asian Royalty , Middle Eastern Royalty , and so many others , all of whom are glorified descendants of warlords and violent nobodies . Ok , so you list all these rich dynasties yet you ignore the trillions horded by the glorified gentry of Jewish bankers . 15 % of billionaires are Jews compared to & lt ; .2 % of the world population . Yet apparently this is insignificant because in the middle ages they managed money ? You 're underestimating the power of finance , simply calling an international class of corporate , banking , and economic leaders 'managers ' is a vastly dishonest understatement .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"Well I 'm actually a woman lol , so I may not view her as harshly because of that . I almost gagged reading the post even then , obviously men judge sluts even more harshly so I understand why you have a stronger reaction . You 're right she did squander her virginity and innocence , which is a lot of what men are attracted to . I 'm glad I saved myself for marriage . The posts I really lol at are the ones where the person is self righteous about their sluttery and comes here to rage only to get btfo . I felt bad for this girl cause I 'd PMed her and she seemed like a nice person",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"They are not victims of their own behavior , they get what they deserve . They also tend to be of a lower quality of life than other white women , for lack of a better word , Untermensch . http : //www.amren.com/news/2013/06/federal-statistics-support-stereotypes-about-miscegenation/ BTW , this disdain is among non white nationalists as well , Im not a white nationalist and I dislike them , many white men in general wo n't touch a coal burner . From a strategic perspective casting them out sets a good example to other would be race defilers .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateNazism,"Well pretty much my whole point is covered in what the person above you said . But I 'd just like to add , studies have shown that personality traits are largely inherited and when you 're working with a group like Jews who have a common history of almost always being a minority , these conditions are bound to breed ethnic nepotism . The biggest areas where I 've seen a concentration of Jews are in the American media , which I 've already explained , [ feminism , and other degenerate hedonistic movements related to gender ] ( https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category : Feminists_by_religion ) , and in international finance , which is undeniable . Some other things I 've noticed which were disproven by the user above you & gt ; The Jews have no real power False , they are the world 's richest ethnicity , the ethnicity that no one can discuss freely without huge backlash , and the only ethnicity with their own right wing race state , along with their massive control of media in the West . Unless by this you mean the parasitic relationship they have with their host countries , where they still are susceptible to nationalism and pogrom type uprisings .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"You should be , that is impressive ! I do n't do any work lol , I just have a lot of free time to do whatever , what you do is a lot more impressive . On the other hand you could say that by planning to get a dominant husband through saving my virginity and being submissive to him , I 've ended up earning money too because he pays for me .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Ehh , you 're not bad actually . And no 5'11 '' is actually a decent height , nvm , I must have confused your with someone else . There was this one guy with gym photos bragging or whatever and he looked weak lol . Anyway , dating a slut is n't really an accomplishment for most men but Okk",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"Your egotism is honestly just incredible . To talk about what you 'preach ' as if you 're some fedora tipping messiah we all should heed is hilarious . From what I 've seen you say about yourself you 're simply not in a good place to judge others . You just are a massive degenerate , you 're dating an adulteress if I remember correctly , and from a picture , you are an unattractive manlet . I 'm taller than you lol and Im a woman & gt ; So , your kids will be interesting money , they will be healthy genes , and your kids will be a good education . Haha fair enough , typos are natural on a phone though .",Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,SlutJustice,That 's such a beautiful belief . Gender roles are really quite wonderful in how well men and women complement each other . A perfect harmony when you get it right,Uralic,Hungarian
2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"& gt ; Nature and circumstances will take care of that . Having a mentally ill mother wo n't do your kids any good . Oh , so now natural law and social Darwinism are legitimate theories , I thought you did n't like them in other scenarios",Uralic,Hungarian

Oh classic stuff right here . The 'logic and reason ' atheist who still believes in racial equality . The one commandment of your religion of leftism seems to be faith based egalitarianism . In order for 'racist ' to be a legitimate insult , you first have to prove racial equality ( protip : you ca n't )",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,CoonTown,"Many people go from lolbert to AnCap to Fascism . In my view , libertarianism is neocon crap spread by Jews like Ayn Rand . The state is not a bad thing , it keeps niggers out , it prevents exploitation of workers , and it can serve to mold society in the proper manner by wedding out degeneracy . In a largely unregulated capitalist society like America , you end up with the Jews ( highest IQ , its inevitable ) controlling the media and promoting degeneracy . Hence , use the state to create homogeneity and fight degeneracy .",Uralic,Hungarian

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"I would say giving away sex without getting commitment . Each guy a girl has slept with makes her less attractive generally .

For recommended reading/viewing I 'd say read A Doctrine of Fascism Mein Kampf Zweites Buch The International Jew by Henry Ford The Culture of Critique ( about Jews and Marxism ) Currency Wars For recommended viewing The Triumph of the Will The Greatest Story Never Told The Man Who Fought The Bank & gt ; I do n't think you need a state to create homogeneity and fight degeneracy .

It just fails because it 's such an old , overused and irrelevant stereotype , though Cap is fresh out of the 40s so it kinda makes sense .

2kewl4skoool,OnePiece,"But foreshadowing is inherently something that you ca n't even see and realise it 's existence until the future event , at which point you make the connection between them and see it as a neat hidden little hint to what was coming .

2kewl4skoool,vita,"Digimon and Trails of Cold steal are easily the best and safest choices . Atelier is nice , but crafting focused and because of that it might not be everyone 's cup of tea . VLR is excellent , but I recommend playing 999 first . Danganronpa is kinda fun for a silly dumb VN , but it 's also very much style over substance , which I do n't think works well for a VN , but if you like stupid anime cliches , over the top drama and weird murder mysteries then you might as well check it out . I do n't think Neptunia is good , especially not compared to the others on the list . And I 'm personally not a big fan of the action games on handheld , but they are all decent , especially Toukiden and SSD . I think Toukiden is the safer choice , because Soul Sacrifice tries some very unconventional things for the genre and not all succesfully imo .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,anime,"It 's technically seinen as it runs in Weekly Young Jump , but in my opinion it 's not much different than their Shonen Jump magazine , it just pushes the boundrie on violence and sex .

2kewl4skoool,horror,"Slight spoiler , but more like getting your expectations right : The scary vampire bit is pretty much the last shot of the movie , so you wo n't get that from the movie . The whole thing is basically a kung-fu movie with a simple traditional vampire yakuza and the transformed people fighting against the normal yakuza with some unexplained supernatural elements . Basically you should n't expect horror but a slightly weird ( the condensed trailer gives off false expectations ) martial arts movie with yakuza and vampire elements thrown in .

Sure you can teach Blaziken other moves like Brave Bird , but it will still lose to Charizard , because that attack wo n't have the STAB bonus and also causes recoil damage . A move with no STAB bonus and no super effective damage is worth as much as a STAB move with not very effective status . The lack of the x1.5 bonus evens it out , making none of its moves effective at all . You can also teach it TM80 : Rock Slide , but it 's not a naturally learned move , so I do n't consider it part of the who 's stronger argument .",Uralic,Hungarian

I do n't consider paneling a part of that , since that 's very easy to learn and understand even if you are only a reader and proprtions are 101 . I 'm pretty sure it 's not much of that being his stlye , but more like he knows the limits of his skill and he does what he is capable with it . As opposed to that Matsumoto Taiyo and professional artists are excellent in many styles , and end up choosing one or creating their own , a quick google search would prove his brilliance .

I compared him to Matsumoto because that 's how the whole discussion began , your last paragraph is exactly what I was trying to say , that context and the reason for dislike matters a lot .

Instead of an alternative to them , try make the gameplay its own , a small field is not enough for that imo . I recommend putting more arcade elements to it . I think you should focus on multiplayer ( that 's what keeps these games alive afterall ) and make very different game modes , sort of like in Smash Bros you have Final Destination and crazy level with all items .

That attack is not very strong but Charizard has the STAB advantage making it a possible one hit kill .

There is continuity in the series ( a pretty soft one though that frequently negates the ending of the previous game to the status quo for the new game ) , but the story in each game is self contained and perfectly enjoyable in any order . Also these games are huge and very similar , playing them back to back is going to burn you out and make you dislike them . Best to take break for a year or at least few months between them . So just play Zero already .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I expected bland , rehash adaptation and came out pleasently surprised . It had plenty of its original ideas that I appreciated and I found some of the deviations from the manga actually better , like the Mia/Misa character . And the original concept left plenty of room to explore in an alternate take , I found the romance angle to be one of the better ideas . Unfortunately the script was terrible and the execution of these ideas were all around poor . But I still prefer this kind of adaptation , or really more of a new interpretation , than the wast majority of anime adaptations from Japan that stick too much to the source and end up feeling like a shitty cosplay video to me . Comparing it to the manga will of course make it look a lot worse than it actually is , some of those can be excused by the short screentime , but not in this case . They completely fucked up the mindgames and they have no excuse for that . Light ended up being a completely average kid while L was just a pretend-genius , with most of his investigation being skimmed over and just dumped at you . A mediocre but interesting movie .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,4chan,"It 's not good , but I respect that it 's not just a shitty cosplay recreation , like most adaptations , but an alternate take with new ideas , and I actually preferred the new Misa plotline ( it made an twisted romance angle with loser Light ) . However all those ideas were poorly executed because the script was awful . They also fucked up the core of the series , cat and mouse mindgames . Every character was dumb , especially Light who only had one master plan at the very end , which was hoaky shit , the kind you would never see in the manga . I still appreciated it for at least trying .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"It 's as good as the player makes it out to be . The core is basic , it 's a traditional beat em up afterall , but it has a huge range of moves that you will only see if you go out of your way to do them . Most people who dislike it play on a lower difficulty and if the bosses are pushovers there is little incentive and pressure for exploring everything the game has to offer , especially defense and counters and end up using only a few moves that get the job done the fastest . The only big fault it has is that the flow of the combat is a little off and breaks too frequently . But it 's very impactful and for Fist of the North Star that might be the most important aspect .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I doubt that 's the case , it 's just a new chapter that 's first being introdueced with the mobile game , and according to the new characters bio on the Gematsu article the series will still take place in Kamurocho and continue the same timeline . I also do n't ever see them doing a timeskip , they only did that for the prequel story of Zero and some short flashback scenes , every mainline game takes places at its release year , and so will the new one , the bio says 2018 . I doubt we will ever play as one of the old characters again but they will be very likely to show up , however even 6 had very few returning characters , that 's why I also think a `` 7th '' game is unlikely .",Uralic,Hungarian

With the drawn out format and Tomino 's strange scripts ( plot at a snails pace while characterisation is frantic ) I ca n't say it with confidence that they are even great anime . Influential and special , absolutely , but not something that must be seen . Same goes for the alternate universe , modern series . Turn A and 00 are probably the safest recommendations , Mobile Fighter G Gundam must be fun for all though . I think people should only take the deep dive if they want to experience the whole Gundam phenomenon , for its universe , the videogames and the model kits , not just the anime .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,anime,"It is Twilight for `` nerds '' . Pure wishfullfilment , in a world where useless popcolture trivia knowledge is literally power , plus it has a shallow unearned romance which even becomes the focus of the story by the end , resulting in an incredibly half assed ending that practically dodges any thoughtful commentary on its VR world . It had potential but the writing is on the level of a kids novel .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"It 's a kids anime that stays true to the two original series from the early 70s and 80s . It 's pretty good at that , but do n't expect more , it 's a very simple show .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"While that 's true I think that might be because of the circumstances . His original series called Black Hammer is great team book , although it has no action and deals with psyche of old heroes stranded from their world in a farm . I think he will have much more freedom with a less traditional team like this made up of D-listers .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Not sure how that would make any sense in the yakuza world though . The only woman in the entire series who did some little action was a police officer , and if you played from an outsider perspective it just would n't have the yakuza feel .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"That 's true . I guess the two reason I do n't see it happening is because of the brutal violence and also because I have n't seen or read any Japanese crime stories , serious fiction , non-fiction or documentary that involved any women actively . While the Yakuza series has plenty of zany stuff in it , they always tried to stay as grounded as possible in the core of it , I just do n't think they would have a lady beat up dozens of gangsters in a dramatic story ( it has happened in the last game but it was played up mostly for comedy in a narratively unrelated arc ) .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"I 'm Hungarian and we really do n't have the western kinds of leftists . The opposition is barely left and has no identity or larger agenda besides being the opposition and far left is just of the bleeding heart kind and they are completely irrelevant politically with zero power , and in contrast our actual and real far right party is pretty popular . Also I 'm a university student in the capital , Budapest with a population of 2 million and I have NEVER seen a trans person . That should tell you a lot how right everything on our political spectrum is .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"That 's a shame . At least Estonia is not a prime migrant target ( from how I saw ) so you can still have hope that the identity politics will inevitebly implode on themselves without serious consequences unlike in the west . Not sure how immigration is there , but we are really fortunate with that since we only have hard working east asians , although the first generations made very little effort to integrate the second generation did perfectly .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"But Stewart is a legend , while Miller has only been good in SV , also he did n't leave for this shitty movie , but because he is completely insane .

When reality is worse than you thought was possible and can do nothing against it , when you might as well let go succumb to the hopelessnes . But at the same time it helps you focus on yourself in an egoist way , by giving up on the whole . Knowledge can be a burden , knowing that things are beyond saving is a weapon , but in form of a gun held to your own head . It 's basically what ignorance is a bliss means .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,milliondollarextreme,"Yeah , it 's basically a matrix reference that grew legs . The serious ones are the color pills that correspond to philoshophy matching its shade . It 's mostly just to keep it simple without namedropping a big thinker from the past .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I think he could be great if he sticked to character design , but not a manga artist . He is just so lazy with zero attention to detail .

Even when he tried the environments were always either completely bland plain walls or just rubble .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"The light novel was surprisingly dry for me , and I do n't think the live action adaptation ( the one with Dafoe ) was all that accurate . And do n't get me started on the kiddie shit anime adaptation , called the Flying house . I guess I really need to check out the manga finally .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"They will never do that because it 's pretty much unlocalizable . Most of the writing requires so much historical knowledge and antiquated language , so much so they even needed to have built in dictionary for the dialogue box . Even if they gave it a shot it just would n't be worth it . Also it came out 3 and a half years ago , before Zero and Kiwami , it 's time to give up any hope .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,horror,"Looks well done , but at the same time I 'm very disappointed . After the Pan 's Labyrinth Del Toro 's works became very safe and by the numbers and they relied too much on already established stories and ideas . Pacific Rim ended up good , but Crimson Peak was incredible dull and derivative . To me unfortunately this seems just like that too . I hope it ends up being more , but this trailer showed nothing original . It seemingly spoiled the whole story too and it seems like the most predictable and cliche monster movie from the 50s . At least visually it 's looking excellent , as expected from him .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"The anime is fun but drawn out and both narratively and artistically old school to a fault , however it has amazing atmosphere and the hypest soundtrack . Have only given a quick check to the manga , but that is stylistically different . Anime is pure Go Nagai , manga is more like Go Nagai tribute with modern take . Also I do n't think much of the manga was translated , so the anime is the only way . Oh and do NOT watch the first episode . It 's like a retarded preview that spoils the whole series and the twist .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"I think it could work . They could introduce her as an unbeatable force with a monster streak , the next big thing who would define an entire era , by an authority figure who immediately gives her a title shot at the next PPV . For a month they would hype it up , giving her only small segments , contract signing brawls , all the usual , but no in ring matches , essentially making her victory seem guaranteed . But at the title match she would lose quickly in a fucky finish , without ruining credibility . After that she would demand a rematch which she is not granted , and instead told to fight her way up the ladder from the very bottom , making her go through mini feuds one after another destroying everyone in her way .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,Games,"Not sure how I feel about Kenshiro bartending and running a hostess club . On one hand it 's out of character both for him and the world of 19XX , on the other it 's a staple of the Yakuza series and that makes me think it will reuse too much of it , meaning it might have lower production values and end up feeling like a reskin . But that 's just me making assumptions , other than this it looks awesome .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"That 's not how the game works . For some reason the devs just insist on calling those endings when they are not , just major turns in the narrative there is only one ending . Route A is the first `` playthrough '' , it 's about half the game . Route B is the same as A but from the perspective of a different character ( still largly same , but a lot faster playthrough ) , the rest of the routes/endings are just continuation of the story . With one true ending . Also all routes share the progress and after B or C you unlock a chapter select too . It 's hardly tedious .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,Games,"After `` B '' there is pretty much nothing repeated , you also unlock a chapter select as well not soon after it .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Mix of Mad Max and fantasy Bruce Lee with a soap drama plot and peak manliness . The writing is super simple if not straight up juvenile , but there are some incredible dialogue and one liners in it . Its cast of characters is where it really shines though . I wholeheartedly recommend watching the anime , just skip the fillers because there are a lot early on . The original movie and later ones are great too , but they are far too condensed and completely change some plot points . Watch them either later or if you only want a taste of the HnK experience .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,television,"But that 's complete nonsense .

2kewl4skoool,manga,"It was 10 out of 10 in Golden Age arc , then the series started to have a major identity crisis paired with bad execution . First of all , it got too schlocky . With the conviction arc it lost all subtelty and turned embarassingly edgy . Same goes for the violence . It lost all restraint , that retroactively cheapened so much of the impact of previous event . Like you look at the Eclipse again and think how lucky Casca is that she was only raped by handsome demon boy instead of gangbanged to death by a bunch of repulsive trolls . Miura instead of knowing when to go all out or restrain himself he tries to balances it out with even more comedy . Now half the cast is comic relief . Obviously those characters are also there to help Guts keep his humanity , but once again , no restraint and too many unfitting gags , and to me it completely ruins the atmosphere . Then we have some rule of cool stuff , like the Berserker Armor , with its own classic risk-reward mechanics that feel straight out of a shonen battle manga . It is badass , but it personally feels a little out of place . My biggest problem is the plot and mainly its narrative structure . You already know the end point , and the destination of the series , you are excited to get there but the plot seems to stop and get sidetracked with its long story arc format . With other long running series , like One Piece ( I know , not the most comparable ) the heavily segmented story telling does n't get in the way and makes you impatient because the endgame is n't obvious , and you still feel excited for every event , and how it could shape the world , I never have that feeling with Berserk .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Puts too much stock into the big 3 meme , ignores details behind the sales number , interprets trends and weekly ranking system wrong or at least not accurately , does n't know the current and previous lineup just randomly mentions few ( some that were n't even good and got cancelled fast ) , downplayes the huge success of their sports and gag mangas , brushing off one of their biggest recent hits that was Assassination Classrom ( Toriko did fine too ) , the big success of the other Jump magazines branching out to other demographics , anime centric viewpoint while they are just basically ads ... A lot . It just seemed like a video with an overly deductive approach , like he already had a conclusion in mind so he only presented the stuff that would confirm his view .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,Thankfully it was `` quickly '' fixed by Bluepoint who was brought in just for patching it . That team is seriously so good at remasters everyone should just hire for them to do theirs . I guess Konami ca n't fuck that up again because the groundwork has been laied already .,Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Yeah , it 's just a coping mechanism for being shitty . It does n't matter if you are waste because you are small and inconsequential anyway .

Really gets your noggin joggin .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I was half joking , you know . But there is plenty of nihilism in adult animation and comedy nowadays , usually portrayed and glorified as intellectuality and even if it is n't fans interpret it that way . Like Rick in R & amp ; M is written as a piece of shit wreck of a man , yet many fans see him as the opposite . & gt ; People do n't just eat up whatever entertainment industries throw at them . You are giving way too much credit to the average person , especially in the age when escapism is at its peak and people look at pop culture like its their religion .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"That large cast sounds and looks cool , but I already feel tedium at the same time . I hope Vanillaware does something more creative structurally than simply making us replay the same game 13 times , like they usually do .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Do n't be . Until the New World it 's a legitimately excellent anime that uses every advantage of the medium to enhance an already fantastic mange . For a long time it had great pacing too for about 400 episodes , with an average 3 chapters per episode which is incredible , now it 's only 1 . For comparison 's sake BnHA only adapts 2 most of the time , and in its first season that average was about only one and a half chapters . So the OP anime was really well done for its genre .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That 's not how shonen series work though , sure there is an overarching plot , but each arc tells a self contained and conlcusive story which alone I find way more compelling than the vast majority of one or two cour animes out there .

2kewl4skoool,anime,"Most modern animes with cheap and lazy digital animation looks like shit compared to those . They have some of the most legendary artists of the industry behind them , they became timeless classics for a reason .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That does n't add a correct statistic though , I only looked at canon episodes , there are a lot of single episode fillers and character specific recaps especially early on and after each arc . But most canon episodes have at worst 2 , and at best even 4 chapters adapted .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I guess I 'm the only one who outright dislikes it , though I barely played more than an hour . The parry ruins it for me , it 's overused and makes the game way too easy , worst of all you must use it too because of the charging moves of enemies so it 's not a mechanic you can ignore . The idea of having to defeat 40 of the same metroids is already tiresome . The map design is sometimes tedious and does n't flow as well as the previous ones . The graphics are great but I dislike this ancient cave theme , I prefer the futuristic look . The analog controls are great for 360 aiming but feel off for platforming , unfortunately its not customizable . It 's not bad , but the raving reviews sure made this really disappointing for me .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"That 's interesting because Jump really wants to push it as the next Naruto , going with Pierrot made me think that it would be long running too . I 'm kinda disappointed because we have n't really had one in a some time , and I think only 13 episodes will give it a very bad first impression and stigma because the beginning is very derivative and formulaic .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Also it 's just a 40 dollar budget game . I do n't think it looks graphically bad , just very dull . The texture quality is pretty good if not beter than some full priced games and many Japanese games . But the art design is really tainting it .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,anime,"I feel like even the manga started to suffer from this but in the opposite way . Ever since the anime has been dangerously close to catching up , so since about New World , Oda started rushing , cramming too much into every panel and every page . Rarely lets the story and the reader breath to take in the atmosphere and the art . Not like the chapters were ever light , but I feel like they got way too busy .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"Even worse , a lot of times it was just vacated and gifted . The Heavymetalweight champions at least pin the previous ones .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,TwoBestFriendsPlay,"We do n't realize how good we have it ( at least in the sense that we can get distracted easily if not overstimulated ) and compared to it how dull and bleak the past was just some decades ago . This is also apparent when you approach it from the other end of the spectrum . In the 30s there was the famous Hungarian suicide song called Gloomy Sunday which was immediately linked to dozens of suicides , these were only claims and pretty much urban legends , but this only paints a more striking picture of the era , because even though it was most likely complete bullshit they did not take any chances and banned the song .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,movies,"Paranormal Activity Budget : 15,000 USD , Box office : 193 million USD But yeah , those are two very similar movies that hit the cultural jackpot and this is not something anyone should consciously aim to do .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"This was like something straight out of the 80 's , both the animation , in the best sense , and writing , in both the best and worst . The writing was extremely rushed , shallow and childish , so do n't except original concepts , great promos or much creativity . It really felt like it was written by an 8 year old kid , in the first few minutes we witnessed a bear getting bodyslammed in the air upside down and then a guy gut straight up murdered , only for the whole thing to be followed by ancient wrestling cliches with sensless booking . However on the other hand this really has a fun , dumb , campy charm to it . The action was weird too . Started with over the top moves , then later it attempted more realism with a series of head and chinlocks and grounded wrestling , but not even that felt like a cohesive match , just random moves . At least it looked really cool . So all in all we will have to wait longer for a decent wrestling anime ( depending on what you want out of one ) , but we might have just gotten an awesome old-school throwback anime instead . I 'll definitely keep watching it .",Uralic,Hungarian

Granted , I 'm assuming a lot too , as we do n't know exactly why the development shift happened , how much CC2 has already done and if that will be scrapped at all to start over or continued where they left off .

So it does n't kill the flow of the events at all and the second half can and should be disregarded .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,vita,"I found it good , but there also horrible design choices with it too . I hate the long button mashing . It 's not only lame but the damn button might brake too .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,WWEGames,"Many people are confused about this , because it 's not in the one on one tab . It 's only in the title match tab . So it 's in .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,WWEGames,"That 's a terrible review . Also the website is n't even credible just a crappy site full of clickbait . It 's not even on metacritic , so I would n't be surprised if they just made the whole thing up without playing anything for more clicks .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,cringe,"Not even close . They are Polish , I think .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,WWEGames,"You are right , but it 's still awful compared to FIFA , for example . They are just doing it wrong , bad little stories frequently repeated and almostno move calling at all . They should just stick to a play-by-play commentary with little color commentary . That way the repetition would n't be so annoying .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"That 's a huge exaggeration . Believe it or not , but realistic long hair is still impossible to do in motion like this . They either go crazy with it ( like Tomb Raider 's TressFX ) or it 's too static ( like here ) .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"It 's not surprising . The manga is insanely popular , I think it 's in the top 5 best selling series this year .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"Personally I prefer the Straight Edge Society Punk a lot more . In 2013 he was surprisingly great with Undertaker , but most of his late 2012 heel work felt out of place and random , from strong , defending face champion to cowardly heel almost immediately .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,vita,"Not even close to P4G , FFX , Tearaway , Ys , Zero Escape , Gravity Rush , Soul Sacrifice and Disgaea . The game is decent , it just has too many flaws and baffling design choices even for a hunter game .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"He meant Rock vs Cena 2 and I completely agree with him ( everyone agrees that the first one needed to happen ) . It 's not even close to being draw the first one was , predictable and a boring finisher fest , that only a casual fan would enjoy . A spin on it would have been much better , like a thriple threat as he mentioned .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"I have to disagree . I am currently watching the original Gundam and Kinnikuman and absolutely love the old-school art , in my opinion it 's very charming , all hand drawn and nostalgic , mainly because I grew up on Captain Tsubasa in the 90s . On the other hand the pacing of old anime is horrible and most of the writing aged pretty badly , worse than the art in my opinion . Mostly too simple by today 's standards but still fun .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"No , Brian Cage did n't get signed , plus there are drug and several other tests before signing a contact .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,PS4,"That installing is actually just downloading the rest of the game ( 45+GB ) . What you download from the store is actually just a small fraction . Some devs utilize it so you can play while the rest is downloading ( Injustice ) , while others do n't and like Rockstar with GTA .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,PS4,"No , just single player or local co-op ( 2 player split-screen ) without it .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,SquaredCircle,"There is truth in it though . Both Survivor Series 2012 and Elimination Chamber sold poorly , even though Rock was in both of their main events . Wrestlemania is going to sell the best , no matter what . And do n't tell me that a triple threat would n't have been a better main event , than the exact same match as last year .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,vita,"I think his point ( at least mine ) is that except for Gravity Rush and Tearaway , none of those are completely new games , just spin-off games of already popular series , and honestly inferior games . Making handheld versions of console games is a bad idea , they are not very suitable for handheld gaming and have to be downgraded because of its limitations .

2kewl4skoool,anime,Wow ... What is this from ?,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"Simply because the manga and anime has to make every match insanely good , as intense as a boxing match can be , it 's a battle shonen series afterall . Obviously only one in a thousand real pro matches can get close to it . Same with any sport .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"They are indeed amazing ( just like Sideshow and Hot Toys as you mentioned ) , but I just ca n't find that pricepoint justifiable . $ 250-400 for a 12 inch figure is insane , no matter the quality .",Uralic,Hungarian

2kewl4skoool,vita,It 's also completely bullshit . The remaster looks really ugly even compared to last gen home console games .,Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,vita,"I think it 's the opposite . They want to sell it as an FF15 demo with this remaster as a bonus . They are not confident if this would sell , so they use the demo for a big boost .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,"You should watch it in japanese . The original japanese soundtrack is by far the best imo , english Falcouner ost is good too but it does n't fit the series as well , Kai is similar to the original but completely forgettable .

2kewl4skoool,PS4,"It 's perspective contols . So simply pushing the stick forward makes the character move the he is facing , turning is a little wonky though . It 's a little archaic but still the best method when walking through multiple areas and transitions with different camera angles , so you wo n't go accidently backwards after every transition . It 's good for the classic survival horrors like RE 1,2,3 but not so much for this game , not needed and a lot more awkward than usual .

2kewl4skoool,anime,"You have to finish it to understand it 's excellence . It 's main focus is consious development of completely different characters , which you wo n't get from 4 episodes at all . It 's only 7 more episodes , 2 and a half hour is not a big additional time investment so go for it . Also the first four eps do n't represent the rest of the show accurately , it changes and evolves a lot by the end and focuses less on the sport and more on the characters .",Uralic,Hungarian
2kewl4skoool,anime,I 'm just saying that those 4 episodes do n't reflect the rest of the series at all . It 's about the payoff . Those couple of episodes are a lot better time investment than the whole series of Cross Ange or Aldnoah.Zero or most of this season for example .,Uralic,Hungarian

It was convenient to have English as a lingua franca not only because two of the world 's greatest superpowers had it as their official language , but also because the world needed a language *everyone* spoke pretty well . A language spreads because of the prestige associated with it *but* language use is based on mutual accommodation : the language you speak is secondary to the actual things you 're trying to say . This creates a snowball effect and since you 've already got more than 1.5 billion people speaking English to various degrees and an enormous amount of data and information available only in English , we are no longer in a position where people speak a particular language because it 's *cool* to do so -- English has become a language that serves a utilitarian goal ( rather than a social one ) above all else , and changing this status will require a lot more than the emergence of a new superpower .",Uralic,Hungarian

Ohio ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio ) , and that one case clearly defines what forms of expression are illegal . The problem with banning speech that is *hateful* towards a certain group is that only speech that is offensive , polarizing and/or subjective needs protection . & gt ; Should we not protect minority groups from obvious hate in our society ? No , we should not , if this means creating extra rules just to accommodate these groups . What we should do is treat minorities like the citizens that they are . That means they are ( or should be ) entitled to free speech and all the rights everyone else enjoys . A necessary consequence of this is that they might have to listen to speech that 's potentially offensive to them . & gt ; If you think hate speech can be subjective then why do n't you think normal crime can be subjective ? Normal crime *can* be subjective , that 's what we have the court system for . The whole purpose of its existence is that people disagree over whether certain acts constitute a crime or not . Also , *hate speech* is not a legal term in the US so there 's literally no weight to that statement . The problem with hate speech is *precisely* that the definition is to flexible to suit any particular agenda . Moreover , if you define hate speech as *all forms of speech that attacks someone on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation* ( which is the Wikipedia definition ) , you basically end up with a bunch highly polarizing issues where no matter what you do or what you say , you will end up offending someone ( and the PC police strikes down , etc. , etc. ) . This is precisely what happened here . If you mention that the shooter 's Muslim , you might accidentally offend Muslim individuals .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Sure , but the constant term does n't matter in the end . Yes , if you have a small input size , you might want to use an algorithm that runs in O ( 2^n ) time with a small constant term as opposed to something with O ( n^2 ) and a huge constant term , but the former wo n't scale well , the latter will . In the end , that constant wo n't matter . If you have an algorithm that solves things in P1 ( x ) = x^^2 + 10^^39 time and another that does the same thing in P2 ( x ) = 2^^x time , even though P2 might work a lot better for small inputs , this trend will always change ( in this case , at around x=130 ) . Also , the constant term can be easily overlooked because advances in computer engineering will create new hardware that will be able to do operations much more quickly , essentially eliminating any disadvantage caused by the constant factor . This is something that you ca n't rely on in NP algorithms , they 're slow and their slowness `` scales '' incredibly well . The constant term is also influenced by the programming language the algorithm is coded in and a ton of other things as well , so it 's a moot point to talk about it , the asymptotic complexity is intrinsic to the algorithm , the `` actual '' time complexity is n't . An n-bit encryption algorithm has 2^n possible keys . If a government developed a computer that could calculate every single possible key , you could simply make n bigger , which is trivial and easy to do on your part but makes their job exponentially harder ( they would have to compute 2^2n = 4^n keys ) . If there were a polynomial algorithm to make this process easier , simply increasing the size of the key would n't solve problem because the algorithms would generally scale well enough to make any potential increase in key size insignificant .

An ethnic group is a group of people who identify with each other based on ancestry , culture , religion , language , etc . Now , let 's be clear , your ethnicity *is* inherited and ca n't usually be changed . The problem is that the definition is designed to be ambiguous - you said *you 're a German because you 're a descendant of Germans* , sure , but you still do n't have a good enough base case . If it 's racial , a huge percentage of the German population would n't be *German* even if they 're perceived by other members of the community as such . Yes , it 's going to be impossible for a Caucasian person to immigrate to Japan and get the population to accept them as Japanese ( because of differences in culture , religion , language , country of origin and national identity ) . However , the same person 's great-granddaughter or great-grandson will probably be Japanese , simply because the whole definition is based on being accepted by other people who are perceived ( by other members ) as belonging to the same ethnic group . If your family tree has a lot of people associated with Japan by Japanese individuals , the fact that you had a great-grandfather who came to Japan from the USA does n't actually matter at all . I chose this example because the situation of Turkish immigrants in Germany is quite similar . The problem 's that if you take away some of the differences between these groups , the whole thing becomes a lot less obvious . In Austria-Hungary in the early 1900s , for example , a lot of residents were neither Austrian nor Hungarian and a huge percentage of the population of Budapest was not Hungarian at all . Even today , having a Germanic or Slavic last name is incredibly common and has absolutely nothing to do with one 's national identity .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,worldnews,"I see what you 're trying to say , and I agree with you to some extent . European countries are very sensitive when it comes to their culture and heritage . The country you 're from *does* determine a lot of things and the extent to which assimilation is required is usually higher in Europe than in America . Also , cultural integration is by definition circular in that you 're considered integrated if other integrated people consider you integrated . However , simply claiming that you ca n't possibly become *German* if you do n't have a family tree dating back to the Roman Empire is incredibly stupid in my opinion . Turkish immigrants have a hard time because the standards that most European cultures have with regard to who is considered a member are incompatible with the Turkish immigrants of today , but this will definitely change in the future .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,AskReddit,"My German is not that great , but *Fahrvergnügen* is simply a compound word meaning `` driving pleasure '' . I think this is not a good example because I do n't care whether a single thought is expressed by a compound word or a structure like `` driving pleasure '' . I do n't have to paraphrase , I just have to use two words instead of one . Now , if I wanted to emphasize the Volkswagen connotation that this word carries , `` driving pleasure '' obviously would n't work and I would be frustrated . In fact , in Hungarian , a language with a lot of compound words , the appropriate expression is *vezetési élmény* , again , two words , but no paraphrasing needed , this concept is mapped to a collocation that 's as apt as the single German word for the same quality . There 's a lot of cases where a language might be more verbose in certain situations : *french lesson* is *franciaóra* in Hungarian , *Französischstunde* in German but *урок французского языка* ( urok frantsuzskogo yazyka , lit . : lesson of the French language ) in Russian . If there is a better/shorter way to say this in Russian , please let me know . I guess a better example would be *Schadenfreude* ( *káröröm* in Hungarian ) . If English had n't borrowed this word from German , I would have to explain it to people with a long-winded sentence like `` you know , that feeling when someone 's misfortune makes you happy '' , because there would n't be an appropriate expression that would invoke the same feelings as any of these words . There 's other , overly specific words like this in every language that are culturally distinct and ca n't be effectively translated without a loss of meaning . This is , again , not due to the *language* being inferior , but it can hinder communication and make you frustrated if you have an abstract idea that you know a perfectly good expression for in , say , English , but ca n't appropriately express it in German without a lengthy explanation . You can either code switch , simply use the word and make yourself understood if you 're talking to bilinguals *or* you can start explaining what you mean in the original language . I would probably go insane if I had to type all this in German because of my German vocabulary ( or lack thereof ) . I would have to use a lot of structures that would make my composition `` less appropriate '' or `` less apt '' . That 's probably what `` not adequate '' means in that post you originally quoted , except that the feeling is caused by the language 's lexicon instead of lack of fluency .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,AskReddit,"Yes , the fact that there are no `` primitive '' languages is a well-known linguistic fact . Still , when it comes to practicalities , the actual vocabulary of a language is a lot more important than what you can *technically* express in it .

6i7kh,programming,"I happen to know the guy , he was taken by police , his house was searched , his phone was cloned , he was fingerprinted , mugshots were taken , he was questioned and then let go . I do n't know what you would call this but it 's definitely far from voluntary action . What happened here ( known as an *előállítás* in Hungarian* ) is equivalent to an arrest in common law countries . There 's basically three types of detention here , this particular one is most commonly done when someone is reasonably suspected to have committed a serious crime . It can theoretically be extended for like a day . After that , by default , you are free to go ( similar to the bail system , but you do n't pay ) , unless the prosecutor has an indictment and wants to lock you up until the trial but that has to approved by a judge . The second one ( known as an *elővezetés* in Hungarian** ) is the one you get if you do n't appear in court or do n't show up at the police station when you are summoned . Police will simply show up at your door and enforce the summons . The third one is what 's more appropriately called a Terry stop ( per Terry v. Ohio ) in the US . The problem is that this process is only used for serious offenders in Hungary . For most other cases you 're just sent a letter to appear for interrogation at a police station in connection with a crime , police wo n't take you anywhere normally in most cases , this sort of procedure is usually reserved for serious criminals where telling them that they 're suspects would pose a threat to prosecution ( flight , witness manipulation , etc. ) . This is what the outrage is over . You are normally summoned for interrogation where you may have your mugshots taken and fingerprinted , then you are free to go until you get another letter to appear in court for your trial ( or the police might tell you to show up for another interrogation in between ) , and then if you are convicted and you have to spend time in jail you may actually still go home and stay for a while until they send you another letter to show up in jail to start your sentence . This would be the equivalent of arresting the guy for a crime and letting him go on bail in the US , without the courts intervening or any money having to be paid . ( * This term is technically not used anywhere in any law , it is the noun form of the phrase that appears in the [ law ] ( http : //net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi ? docid=99400034.TV & amp ; timeshift=20160701 ) governing all forms of detention .

First of all , I would claim that x/0 being undefined is the same thing as `` ca n't do it '' when you 're on reddit , because I 'm not doing a proof or a derivation or anything , it 's just common parlance . An operation being undefined means it is not valid to perform that operation and if you 're talking about anything practical that is basically the same thing as `` you ca n't do it '' . The same way my high school math teacher did n't say that a quadratic equation has two , one or zero REAL roots instead of just `` roots '' . And , since probabilities are strictly non-negative , yes , in this case , it makes sense to intuitively say that since zero times anything is zero , there is infinite better chance of something happening than if you did n't do anything at all . If we 're talking about a strictly negative quantity , the same thought process leads to the same conclusion . Division by zero being undefined has nothing to do with whether there 's two limits because even if the limit was just infinity/minus infinity it would n't make sense to talk about the limit as the actual answer to the division , and no one actually said anything about the limit of a function or a series , so this is not relevant at all . I 'm not trying to differentiate 1/x at zero . I 'm not trying to calculate the limit at zero . I 'm just making an observation about ratios .

6i7kh,todayilearned,"Yeah , it makes sense , until you realize that there 's really no way to decide what constitutes `` hurting religious feelings '' or `` outrage '' . Of course , laws that restrict freedom of speech and religion in the name of peace and tranquility sound good in theory , until you realize that when it comes to practicalities , you either enforce them or you 're relying on the government to not classify what you said in public as something that can cause `` outrage '' .

People who proposed the Bill of Rights knew that those things were important and that people in power will try to suppress them when they become inconvenient .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,AskReddit,"To be fair , this should be placed in context , eugenics was a policy that was perfectly in line with the cutting-edge scientific discoveries of the time . It seemed completely natural to support it and it was applauded by almost every developed country in Europe as well as the U.S . It makes sense , and it actually *works* , both in theory and in practice . Unfortunately , the reason eugenics got such a bad rep was because of Nazism and that Nazi scientists used the eugenics programs of Allied countries as a defense . Not because of its huge potential for abuse by governments , its reprehensible attitude towards human rights , and the fallout that happens later on as genetic diversity drops . Now most people think that something like this is wrong because the Nazis did it , conveniently forgetting about all the other countries that also participated because it seemed rational to do so . It 's a shitty theory in practice but simply saying it 's wrong because the Nazis did it or shunning someone because they supported it in the early 1900s is a surefire way to make history repeat itself .",Uralic,Hungarian

Since math in and of itself can not be verified experimentally , it can not be considered a natural science .",Uralic,Hungarian
6i7kh,explainlikeimfive,"Because , for most batteries , there is no surefire way to measure `` battery percentage '' . A battery is basically a series of chemical reactions that move charged particles from one terminal to the other , creating electricity . How many particles move in between the terminals ( the rate of the chemical reaction ) depends on a number of factors , and it 's far from being constant ( including temperature , the current battery percentage , and how much current your device is drawing at the moment ) . This means that a battery 's discharge pattern is non-linear , going from 12V to 11V does n't take as much time as going from 11V to 10V or 5V to 4V . You either have a system that is non-linear and not very useful ( going from 20 % to 5 % would take as fast as going from 100 % to 90 % , for example ) , or a system that 's mostly linear and not very accurate . Now , most LiOn batteries use a different system called `` coulomb counting '' . When the factory releases a battery , it comes with two `` states '' that correspond to how much charge the battery has , which correspond to 100 % and 0 % . When you 're using your battery , the system looks at how much current your battery supplies and it converts it into charge , which it matches against the pre-set values . When your phone is charging , the same thing happens . The issue with this is that some of the current is converted into heat and will not be used to charge your battery . Also , batteries tend to discharge on their own even if no outside current is drawn . Meaning , these measurements will drift , resulting in situations where if you have n't fully discharged your batteries in a while you might run out of juice at 10 % or you might be able to use your phone for an hour at 1 % .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,AskReddit,"No , not really . I 'm gon na have to correct this a bit since I know a lot of people have a pretty mistaken view of this matter . The special theory of relativity is based on the fact that every inertial system ( roughly , a frame of reference moving at a constant speed ) is equivalent . If you 're inside one , you get the same experimental results as the guy in the other system . Therefore , both you , an observer in a car and the guy on the ground can claim that they 're stationary or that they 're moving at 80mph relative to you . If you 're inside the frame , you ca n't conduct an experiment that 'll tell you how fast you 're going because all experiments have the same results in all inertial frames . The only thing you can do is measure your speed relative to another frame ( in this case , the ground ) , but that 's going to be relative because you *assume* that that inertial frame is stationary . The point is that it does n't matter whether you 're moving at 80mph and the ground is stationary or you 're stationary and the ground is moving at 80mph . Looking out the window is not an option , because both are equally possible and there 's no point arguing about which is true , because they are *both correct* and *equivalent* : crashing into a wall at 80 is still going to kill you the exact same way . Now this , combined with the fact that light moves at the same speed in all inertial frames is what causes all that weirdness . Both are pretty easy to wrap your head around but the implications are huge . TL ; DR : both the ground and you can move and it does n't make a difference . edit : typoz",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,videos,"It is formally allowed , each country sets its own rules with regards to its own naturalization process . The fact that you have to renounce all previous allegiances is simply the wording of the oath . The thing you have to realize is that a country 's view of you as a citizen is n't dependent on the views of other countries . The US can consider you a citizen while the UK considers you a citizen as well and both are valid unless one country decides not to allow dual nationality . It 's a diplomatic mess , for example if you happen to be the national of both the US and a country that is engaged in hostilities with the US and you are enlisted in the army of one ( or both ) of the countries , it can be a pretty shitty diplomatic situation . I had to explain this particular point to a dual citizen once , he thought that he would lose his US citizenship if he got conscripted into our army , which is not normally the case . Also , it becomes very difficult for the US embassy to protect you in a country that you 're a citizen of ( if you 're a UK-US dual citizen and you get arrested in the UK , you are not entitled to any consular aid or protection ) . There are other restrictions on becoming a minister , a prime minister or a president of another nation and you have to travel on your US passport when leaving or entering the US , but that 's it really . As for the supreme court rulings you asked for , the most important one is [ Vance v. Terrazas ] ( https : //supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/252/case.html ) , which says that *In establishing loss of citizenship , the Government must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship , not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation . * In that ruling , Justice Stevens explicitly mentioned that the US accepts dual citizenship . Also , read [ this State Department website ] ( http : //travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-and-dual-nationality.html ) about this issue . So , yeah , the US does n't give a fuck about who you pledge allegiance to once you 're a US citizen . However , these laws deal with the issue of a US citizen getting another nationality **after** acquiring US citizenship , which is not what you need . You have to make sure that you do n't lose your other nationality after acquiring US citizenship . You have to ask the US State Department or the government of your own country if becoming a US citizen results in the loss of your other nationality .

Some systems look at the memory of the game and make deductions about what a *good* move is ( e.g . moving towards the right , getting points , etc . ) and they *know* the sequence of moves that increase the *goodness* state of the system . It 's not perfect , but it works .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"& gt ; I 'm not saying this is an acceptable answer or that it should be an excuse It is their job , but finding a bug this complex and this intangible requires a lot of time and a ton of luck , especially if not a lot of developers are contributing to the project . You can be testing for years and still not find the source of the bug if you 're not lucky enough . Obviously , it 's definitely not acceptable from a business standpoint that a game like this should have a bug this big in it for such a long period of time , but it 's understandable that they do n't know or do n't want to fix the issue , especially if the game 's going to be ported to Source 2 in the near future . ( It still makes me pissed , but I can also understand the rationale behind their work . ) Maybe my sympathy stems from the fact that I can put myself in their shoes . I had a bug like this in a project which was only about ~40k lines long . The application was actually related to gaming ( edit : just for clarification , it was hobby work , nothing commercial and I was the only one actively contributing to the project , and I had about 9-10 testers who were also volunteers ) and the server would shut down , sometimes with no players , sometimes with 50 players , sometimes in 1 minute , sometimes in 3 days . It took me nearly 8 months to finally find what caused the error ( unfortunately , the platform I worked with was apparently built in a shed in 2 weeks cause it had no debugger or anything like that ) . Just to demonstrate how obscure these bugs can be : In the end , the bug turned out to be caused by a bug fix I did because the network engine was bugged beyond belief but it was closed-source so I could n't edit it . I did a couple of quick fixes but some of the bugs I fixed in the code were later fixed by the people who wrote the netcode . The only thing in the changelog corresponding to the version that fucked up my code was `` minor fixes regarding xxxx '' which did n't raise much suspicion . This resulted in code that was no longer doing what it was supposed to thanks to the bug fix that fixed the bug that I did a fix for . It was a time bomb that would set off every now and then and kill the whole server . Imagine the same situation with a code base that 's a lot bigger than mine . edit : typos & amp ; stuff",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,movies,"& gt ; If you do n't respect the law , which you clearly do n't , I do n't know how you 've come to that conclusion . The only thing I said is that I will choose an alternative that has a better user experience . I have never claimed that I would ever download a movie protected by copyright . Which , by the way , would be legal in my country so long as I do n't share my copy with someone else . & gt ; Why not use Webster 's , dictionary.com , or the Oxford dictionary ? Because any definition that explains *stealing* has to first define what *property* and *own* means . If you consider someone 's intellectual property *property* , then , yes , downloading movies *is* technically stealing . However , let me remind you that most people , when this topic is brought up , use loaded language like & gt ; '' It is inconvenient for me to purchase your products , therefore I am going to steal them . '' to juxtapose downloading a movie with walking into a store and stealing a physical copy , which is n't the same thing , neither legally nor *morally* . You either claim that it was only your intellectual property you were deprived of , or you need to stop using the well-known damages = ( # of copies downloaded ) * ( value of DVD/BR ) formula when you start a lawsuit . You ca n't have it both ways . Wording like this implies that it is the actual *product* that 's stolen , which is not true . You do n't steal physical objects or even information when you download a movie illegally . The only thing you steal is someone 's intellectual property , but saying that would n't be as good a deterrent as calling pirates *thieves* .",Uralic,Hungarian

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"Can absolutely confirm . I 'm not saying this is an acceptable answer or that it should be an excuse , but to all the other people out there , imagine finding a bug like this .

You probably wo n't be able to comprehend how fucking annoying a 12-hour debug session can be and how you wo n't be able to enjoy your game after being forced to do the same menial task for as long as it takes , but it makes you want to throw the fucking game out of the window in most cases and burnout is a real thing in software development .

This phenomenon is called Brooks ' law ( e : [ wiki ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks % E2 % 80 % 99_law ) ) and it 's pretty well explained in The Mythical Man-Month , a very good book on software engineering . You need people with familiarity with the code base who can reliably test and fix things and that only comes with experience . Edit : also , I 'd like to add that reports like *the AWP feels a bit weird lately* or *a lot of my recent shots have n't been registered properly* are n't of much help , these can be caused by a wide variety of modules/issues so the problem is n't specific enough to be worked with .

6i7kh,explainlikeimfive,"I know very little about Finnish but I speak Hungarian ( the two languages are linguistically related ) .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"They should have hired more developers when Valve took over CS : GO . Brooks ' Law only applies to *late* software projects . Adding manpower to an already late software project does n't usually work out , although it 'd be interesting to see how it would fare given Valve 's business structure . My analysis is that complex bugs that have been in the game for a very long time would n't be fixed by simply hiring more developers . The main problem is that it takes a long time for new developers to become productive and until that 's the case , you , as a developer , would have to spend a reasonable amount of your time educating the new guy . Valve , however , does n't actually hire people to work on one project only so this might not be a big problem . They might be able to roll out more updates if more developers concentrated on CS : GO but fixing these very subtle bugs related to hitboxes , for example , would not be accelerated by throwing manpower at the project . The required amount of familiarity would be too high a barrier for any developer assigned to a completely new project .",Uralic,Hungarian

( This would n't be murder in most jurisdictions , though , negligent manslaughter or its equivalent is more reasonable , but I 'm sure the prosecutors will try to pin murder on him as well just for good measure . ) The sentence they get does n't really matter in the end .

Abodyhun,space,At least you will finally get into someone 's pussy .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , and the last one is largely ineffective as well , since by then probably everyone on the enemy team has some sort of armor item effectively cutting your damage against them in half .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,gaming,"Haha , it 's even better when you are trying to teach some easy game to someone , and he ca n't even understand the tips presented , because he ca n't even fucking read letters yet . I just could n't wrap my head around someone not being able to do something that comes so naturally to us . Kids are weird .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"I 'm not from the US , but if I were I think I 'd either vote for Clinton , or Gary Johnson . For Clinton , as much as I know about the issues with her , they seem to be a bit overexaggerated to make her look as bad as Trump . Also she seems to have an actual shot at winning against Trump . As for the third party candidates , while Stein has some good policies , she is a bit of a nut with the anti nuclear policies and pandering to homeopathy . So that leaves Gary Johnson , who seems like the most reasonable person among the candidates , and was pretty friendly and open in his AMA and he also admitted that his answers are based on his current knowledge and is open minded about new information .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Yeah , it 's long , but if you look at it this way , those movies basically introduced the viewers to fantasy . Everything needed to be fleshed out to make the world feel complete . And even so it cut so much out of the source material . Anyway I see why people feel like they are boring , sometimes I get bored with them as well , but that does n't stop me from getting hyped to watch them .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,AskReddit,"We are totally sheltered . I imagine , many old people from that time would think that even our grandparents were spoilt and sheltered .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Yeah , I 've actually had a legit friendly arguement with a guy like that when I was on vacation in another country ( so we were talking in broken english ) . Basically it boils down to that , they see race as an important thing to preserve , and if you see things that way , you have a legitimate reason to be concerned , since there are already more people of color than white . This is also why they do n't like races mixing . Meanwhile my side of the arguement does n't see race and color as something important , so we could n't convince each other ( and if we tried it would have turned unfriendly ) , just accepted our differences in views .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,Holy shit and here we call girls who change partners yearly whores .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"How do you see things nowadays though , is the situation getting better in your area . Because as far as I know , we have cut down on these issues a lot since the start of the decade .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Also real time message notifications , better customization for the frontpage , and EVERYTHING .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Wow shuch a genocide . I imagine they are pretty angry now that they have to set up new throwaway emails and accounts . I hope they get carpal from that .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"That 's my current process with the STALKER series , and also the Left 4 Dead games . Also , some games are just not the kind that a 2 hour demo could really show .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Holy shit EA is really trying to get back the most hated company in the world title . I hope that you guys will get your games back soon .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Just go work for a day at a factory that makes cardboard or packaging . You will reek of the smell for days .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Well , it really is n't a simple issue . On one hand , it 's almost always some luxury product ( enretainment ) being pirated , but on the other hand the whole `` buy it before trying it '' notion seems to be dieing out with the fact that physical copies of music an movies are rare now and replaced by streaming services . Many people ( including myself ) pirate stuff to try it out before buying . I have an extremely shitty laptop , so I have to be really careful with games , sometimes pixel art indie games lag too . There are other games as well , mostly strategy and rpgs that ca n't be fully appreciated in the standard 2 hour trials or demos , especially when these first moments often misrepresent the whole experience . Basically many see piracy as an extended demo and advertisement to the creators . And the last reason , living in a middle european country , our wages are a fraction of the western average , while our basic expenses ( food , tax , bills ) are only sightly less , yet prices are as we say sized for the American or German wallets . This means that often even buying old games with discounts is a huge investment for us , but most of us do n't want to miss out on culture like this .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,ShouldIbuythisgame,"No idea probably either console only , or felt like they do n't need Steam . Ok I checked , it 's Origin only , which is EA 's own answer to Steam , though do n't quote me on the last part .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,ShouldIbuythisgame,Really ? What 's the difference between them ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,stalker,Started SOC 2 weeks ago . Strelok 's hideout definitely spooked me .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,ShouldIbuythisgame,"I 'm so happy about STALKER being on sale . I started the series recently as pirated version , but now I 'm definitely buying at least one of the games .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,ShouldIbuythisgame,"New game plus lets you carry your stuff and upgrades over to a new game , so you can completely max everything out . Yeah , at first I liked the jumping , but overall the free flight is more user-friendly . All in all though , Dead Space 2 just feels like a better game overall . Kinda like Assassin 's Creed 1 vs 2 .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,ShouldIbuythisgame,"I 've played both all the Dead Space games and the Fear games , I 'd say , go for Dead Space 2 . A bit less horror , than the first one , but in turn you get a lot better and streamlined gameplay , better weapons , and they got rid of frustrating mechanics from the first one . In the second game I 've found almost all the weapons viable and satisfying to use , which adds a lot to new game+ and new runs focusing on different upgrade paths . Also they made kinesis launching spears , blades , fans ... etc an actual mechanic dealing real damage . The biggest plus is that they made 0G scenes free flight instead of the disorienting jumping around the walls .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,AskReddit,what does the steam version have over the free one ?,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Actually I played it , but I was curious because he only mentioned mechanics from the first game . Which I found weird because the second one felt a lot better overall . The combat was more fluid , more variety in usable combos and less reliance on grapples against tanks and choppers .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Yeah , that 's what I was thinking about . When I type I press the buttons down all the way , or become worried that it did n't register ( I only own rubber dome keyboards ) .",Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"I loved that one so much , and it 's actually pretty logical , horses themselves prefer staying on the road .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Honestly I think racing games are a pretty clear choice with a keyboard like that , along with any game where you have to control your vehicle 's movement in real time . It 's pretty annoying that unless you have gamepad or wheel+pedals you either go max speed or none . Also gentle presses would be good for gently steering the car instead of tearing the steering wheel off then putting it back in a second . Though now that I think about it , platformers or really any game could use soft pressing as walking without having to use another button . The biggest winner here is platform games , it lets you position yourself more precisely without the fear of walking off a platform .

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,"Good luck everyone and thanks a lot OP , finally I 'll get a new board for them .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,214 thanks for the giveaway !,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,Damn I need a cat .,Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Mine is going down the stairs two steps a time . It helps when I 'm in a hurry and is less tiring than stepping on every step since you do n't stop gravity from doing it 's job while going at that speed , though it took me some time to learn and not fall down a staircase face first . So I save a few seconds going down the stairs while taking the risk of breaking a few bones one day .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,AskReddit,"Oh kiddy porn , I read kinky porn first and did n't understand why the big deal .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Congrats , you picked a half sentence to put it out of context to disprove my arguement , I never said that losing should result in a ban . What I said is that , even if our Singed is not trolling and is winning , his teammates probably do n't enjoy playing with him very much , so he should play with friends who know how to play around it . I know that it sucks but it should be better for everyone .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , bad analogy , but still stands . People in soloQ constantly deal with idiots trying to reinvent the meta while failing miserably and losing their ELO , along with trolls who pick random shit just for the sake of it . How do they know if this guy is different ? Also , even if they win , I 'm pretty sure that by the end his teammates get tilted and nervous , probably not really enjoying the game . As I said in another comment , if so many people have problems with this pick , get a few friends and play with them . Even a duo or a 3 man team can be enough to convince people to get on board with this strategy , or at least shut them up .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,pcmasterrace,374 thanks OP .,Uralic,Hungarian

Abodyhun,leagueoflegends,"Yeah , if he wants to do that , get friends and go 4 or 5 man at least having a duo bot . People keep reporting him , because there are people who actually troll like this , asking not to get banned just because they play badly or off meta .",Uralic,Hungarian
Abodyhun,randomactsofcsgo,"[ Trade Link ] ( https : //steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/ ? partner=182280116 & amp ; token=xDzqlbgO ) I think you should concentrate on popular weapons mostly , m4 , ak , deagle or ump and chose a good skin with them for moderate price , i do n't really think you should excede the 5 dollar margin , these skins will be used as playskins anyways : D",Uralic,Hungarian
