"It may be #NationalDressUpYourPetDay, but it's unlikely your cat will enjoy being dressed up! Cat costumes can be dangerous if they get stuck on something and could cause your pet to injure themselves. So forget the novelty outfits - we think cats are cute, just as they are. 😻 https://t.co/hiCgjrZEIZ"
