In case anyone thought Germans relax at this time of year."
"""My granny is a climate-bastard"" ( literally ""enviornment pig"" ): #umweltsau. The German broadcaster #wdr has taken it off its media feed after outrage from ""conservatives"" on social media which of course now made it hugely popular.

It must be a slow news day when a children's choir song about Grandma #Umweltsau polluting the environment triggers a debate about whether it's not more accurate to suggest Grandma was a Nazi and German Twitter goes into meltdown.

"The hashtag #Umweltsau (""environmental pig"") is currently the highest-trending one in #Germany - in reference to a video of a children's choir singing a satirical song on air.
