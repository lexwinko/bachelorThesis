took them a week to send it #bahncard http://t.co/GEemO7nI
Is it worth getting a #bahncard 50 1 klasse? 515 eur instead of 255 eur. I know it depends on one's usage but interested in your own experience.
Got this 25% discount on ALL DB trains in Germany but can't maximize it haha. I need one more trip before Feb29 to say it's sulit. #bahncard https://t.co/XfbuQPVniT
"I've been using @DB_Bahn for almost 2 months with the trial #BahnCard 100 and I must say I'm really enjoying it. I think their service is better than it's reputation. Friendly people, almost all trains arrived on time."

#BahnCard came in the mail the other day. Watch out Deutschland and watch out January this guy is about to be all over the country

"@Blackhalo72 @Twilight71 An alternative might be to have a system similar to @railinfo_sbb's #halbtax or @DB_Presse's #bahncard which, particularly in the Swiss case, has almost universal uptake and means that very, very few passengers pay the ""full fare"" advertised. #transportfundingmodels"
"@ant_scholkmann #Stockholm airport is the same. Now, given the number of faculty commuters with #BahnCard 50/100, why don‚Äôt we lobby @DB_Bahn for subscribing to #EDUROAM?"
@patrickdet @DB_Bahn One does not simply cancel a #BahnCard after one year...
"Deutsche Bahn informed me my wife's BahnCard discount travel card was automatically renewed. But she had already returned to USA. When I appealed to DB Customer Service, they said the account has been turned over to a collection agency. OUTRAGEOUS! I will fight it. #BAHNCARD"
@LNeckermann Who is in for a #crowdfunding of a #bahncard sneaker as @bladewing678 has suggested?
@PKoppenburg @dbmindbox @sbbnews #deutschebahn told me that it is because #bahncard are managed by some other daughter company than the tickets. Serious answer :D
Can't believe that #deutschebahn still checks the #bahncard for every owner of a PERSONALIZED ticket! It's in your database! @dbmindbox ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Worst #CustomerExperience in a decade. #lessonlearned never forgot your #bahncard travelling with @DB_Bahn. Had to pay 77 fine! üò°
"Punctual as German Rail Road @DB_Bahn : ""We request your payment till 30th Dec. 1899.""

@mattLefaux @T3RevNeverEnd lets fund #bahncard 100s and have some fun üòòit would be also a stresstest for #wlanonice which might get paid ü§î
"Honestly, fuck @DB_Bahn not giving me a reduced #BahnCard after tricking me into a subscription. Won‚Äôt pay for this shit!"
Really excited about my 1st ever 1st class trip with new 1st class #BahnCard. #deutschebahn has dampened my enthusiasm with 55 min delay :(
Thanks @DB_Bahn for your help! That was some great #customerservice! Looking forward to getting my #BahnCard in the mail!
Lame excuses! What if @DB_Bahn @VVS would reshape their services in a UC way and allow general  #bahncard discounts. https://t.co/lutDEj7HBX
"@DB_direkt how to get rid of your best customers: no service, no refund, no trains to austria. #bahncard fee to pay, no use of it possible."
"They do what they want, they do what they want, it's the Aufsichtsrat of the Deutsche Bahn, they do what they want #bahncard"
"I'm too much of a tightwad to splurge on another #Bahncard First. So, I find myself reduced to a second class Bahncards - and (hopefully) enough bonus points to buy first class upgrades for the rest of the year ;)"
"It's sometimes cheaper to buy a ticket for a fast train than to buy a ticket for the regional train. üòÅOf course, you can use the ticket for fast trains on regional trains as well. (I saved 45 cents...) #germantrains #bahncard"
Why should I buy a #bahncard? I saved 50% of each trip I did during the last 6 month because of a high delay. @DB_Bahn
"Function Plotter is such a useful #Windows10 #Windows10Mobile tool, seen here helping me pick the right #Bahncard https://t.co/9sh98HIwZ0 https://t.co/9NIjswFDus"

"finally gave @DB_Bahn another chance after years of avoidance - took a common route - stgt &lt;-&gt; ma - had significant delays in both directions (1x technical default of train, 1x no information). so giving away my #bahncard was the right decision."
When you didn't double check @DB_Bahn  app settings and it didn't have your #bahncard and now you spent 16‚Ç¨ more.üò¢ü§¶ #notmyday #facepalm
Good thing about 1st class #Bahncard is that you can still buy 2nd class tickets - bad thing is I've got used to roomy uncrowded 1st class.
Note to self: When ICE train ticket (25% #Bahncard discount) is only 1‚Ç¨ more expensive than regional train (local fare - no discount) ...
I followed your directions to email and call @db_bahn I paid for my #BahnCard but never received it. I keep getting push aside. Help!
"Hi @DB_Bahn, do you have someone who deals with complaints? Ihr #bahncard Kundenservice ist unakzeptierbar. #Bahn @DB_Info"
Oh well @DB_Bahn. This package doesn't qualify as a gift per se. It is nice to have however #bahncard :) https://t.co/HccUOpwwsg
"Did you know, that more than 5mio. people have a #Bahncard to get 25% or 50% discount on train rides in Germany. #dailymobilityfact @DB_Bahn"
... on last leg of journey free internet. Def upgrading to 1st class #Bahncard with credit card (loyalty points remain valid) #deutschebahn
listening to a talking machine for nearly 5 minutes when calling your #bahncard hotline? really? @DB_Info
Looks like I won't qualify for #bahncomfort next year unless I get a few more rail trips in. Considering upgrading to 1st class #Bahncard.
"All packed for #LinuxTag, arriving in #Berlin at 1600. Several trains overbooked, sometimes a 1st class #BahnCard would be desirable. :-)"
Win. For weeks I haven't had a #BahnCard (replacement lost in post) and now I have two of them. Handy.
