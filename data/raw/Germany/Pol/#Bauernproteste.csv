"German farmers are honking their way through Berlin on giant tractors protesting conditions and (judging by the banners on the tractors) low food prices?

German media is ignoring this today when they report on the #bauernproteste. What is wrong with modern journalism? The protests weren’t a local/German idea. https://t.co/E0nm1EbX2o,https://twitter.com/Stefan_S_aus_H/status/1186689110578286592,german

"'Ideology can't fill your stomach' (#FridaysForFuture take note!)
'Farming in a stranglehold between Environmentalism and Economy' say the signs.
German farmers want the govt to talk with them, not pass laws without their participation.

"Paradoxically, these #bauernproteste will have the exact opposite effect as desired. We now know that they are fighting against a better environment, poor farmers in S. America, and the condition of the animals under their care.
