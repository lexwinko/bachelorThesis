Crazy start to the game with 4 goals in the first 12 minutes. Things settled and PAOK gained the lead with a penalty midway through the second half and that’s how it finished.

Get the microscope out boys.

"Just saw the highlights.

1) Tzolakis didn’t look bad at all, I’d even go as far to say he looked more assured than Paschalakis, but that isn’t saying much.

2) That penalty against Semedo was very harsh. Arms were at his side and he wasn’t even looking at the ball.
