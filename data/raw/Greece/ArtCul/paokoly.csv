"FT: PAOK 3 - Olympiakos 2

Crazy start to the game with 4 goals in the first 12 minutes. Things settled and PAOK gained the lead with a penalty midway through the second half and that‚Äôs how it finished.

1) Tzolakis didn‚Äôt look bad at all, I‚Äôd even go as far to say he looked more assured than Paschalakis, but that isn‚Äôt saying much.

2) That penalty against Semedo was very harsh. Arms were at his side and he wasn‚Äôt even looking at the ball.
