20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Maybe I went overboard a bit . Possibly fueled by decades of being unable to speak with anybody on this matter in a rational manner . I think there is a big identity crisis in Bulgaria . We dont know if we are Slavic or Turkic ( proto-Bulgarians were , 500 years of Ottoman rule and as you said a lot of resettlement ) or Thracian , etc . because the truth is we are all of them . So no we have very little in common with the Proto-Bulgarians . At this point the only thing that is left is the name . Then I remember studying in school that the major population make-up of the Balkans when the Bulgars arrived were Slavic , this is incorrect . They were definitely present but there was another bigger group which were one of the oldest European population , which have stayed in South-East Europe for thousands of years . We see most of those people in countries like Croatia , Serbia and Bulgaria . If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million Englishs . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian,European

Quickly they incorporated them within the new Bulgarian state with the Bulgars forming the ruling and military elite . Wars ensued and little by little the proto-Bulgarians either mixed in with the English inhabitants or died off in these wars . I am very inclined to believe that all Bulgars had died off ( As they were semi-nomadic warriors they comprised the biggest chunk of the army , they did not deal with other things , so when an army was destroyed a massive chunk of the Bulgar population was destroyed as well ) or mixed with the local populace beyond recognition by the time the Byzantines conquered Bulgaria some 300 years after its creation . \\n\\nSo here I am .

What I care is that it has the same basic principles as I do , which are equality , human and civil rights and that everybody has the liberty to pursue happiness .

The EU is forcing countries to be efficient which even though present in N Europe does not mean its a NE mindset . ( I think this is what you are talking about ? ) The huge unemployment in Europe is due to the financial crisis that started around 2008 .

We could have traded just as well when we had our currency connected to the Reichsmark . \\n\\nIt is not bs . Also how much do you pay , do yo know ? Like 200 million euros ? Which is 0.2 % of your GDP . That money goes to support the EU and all the trading treaties it provides + it goes to developing countries like Bulgaria who use it to increase their GDP and in return are a better trading partner to the EU from where the whole EU profits .

Eastern Slavonia was peacefully re-integrated into Croatia in 1997 , two years after the war officially ended . Whilst in Serb hands , the Latin Script was banned . Non-Serbs were ethnically cleansed and thousands were murdered by Serbs attempting to take Vukovar and surrounding areas . These were not just Yugoslav Army conscripts or Serbs from faraway places . These were mainly local Serbs who committed such crimes . Under international pressure , Croatia was forced to accept terms of amnesty to all Serbs who committed crimes of rape , murder , torture , theft etc in order to have Eastern Slavonia re-integrated . Fast forward to 2013 and those people who committed those crimes walk freely amongst the victims . This is one of the biggest factors stopping the Serbs from integrating fully into society , thus we have a culture of separation ( cafes , shops , schools etc ) . Added to this are serious suspicions that the 2011 census is not accurate in the number of Serbs in the County . For example , at one address it was found that there were around 30 people were registered there . So clearly there are people being registered as living in the area that do not . There are groups that have reported several such instances and others who believe that this is a deliberate attempt to artificially increase the number of Serbs living there for political reasons .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian,European

Ballander,europe,"Whew , you threw together a lot of bull.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Ljudevit Gaj and Vuk Karadzic worked together and at the same time on standardization of grammar and alphabet for Croatian/Serbian languages waaaaaay before Yugoslavia . In mid XIX century . Why do you think both languages have 30 letters , same grammar and why Croatian Latin and Serbian Latin scripts are identical and why both are phonetic languages etc ? \\n\\nThis I already addressed in my original post and clarified it in my second . I think I was pretty clear.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Also Croatian language had two-three purges , especially around WWI and WWI and recently in the \\'90s.\\n\\nCroatian had a few \ '' purges\ '' , but not like you think . They were never about targetting \ '' Serbisms\ '' ( are there really any ? ) , but loanwords in general . It\\ 's a lot like French puritanism . I\\ 'll give you the WWII one , their agenda was pretty obvious and I would not put past them that their goal was to \ '' remove Serb\ '' in every sense . However , WWI was a load of crap , since it never happened . Indeed , there was a lot of new words introduced in that period ( say 1850s-1910s ) , but it was , again , just to remove loanwords from Standard in general , primarily **Hungarian** and **German** since there were loads of them . No one had Serbia in mind , but some had Yugoslavia - which goes back to political tampering with languages due to agenda . Some words caught on , some didn\\'t ( as always ) .\\n90\\ 's was about reintroducing the words that fell out of use due to Yugoslavia ( people had to adhere to the Standard set by Novosadski dogovor which was mentioned here already , and abberations were definitely not tolerated , hence I called it forced instead of voluntarily ) . Some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in a sense two languages were more similar before WWII.\\n\\nYes , and after . WWII-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical Croatian language.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; For example did you ever heard of Miroslav Krleza ? \\n\\nOf course.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; The greatest Croatian writer who ever lived ? \\n\\nWhile he is no doubt a great writer , that\\ 's debatable . There\\ 's a slew of great Croatian writers and I\\ 'm glad I can\\'t pick one so easily . \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Maybe sounds familiar ? \\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Heard about his book \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' from 1932 ? Yeah \ '' Hiljadu i jedna smrt\ '' , not \\'\\'Tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt\\'\\'\\n\\nWhat\\ 's the point ? You\\ 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . That\\ 's massive reaching and does you a disservice.\\nYou also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards Yugoslavian unity . \\nI doubt you ever read any of his works , but I did and there\\ 's nothing too different from today\\ 's Croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . \\n\\nJust check his \ '' Balade Petrice Kerempuha\ '' and see if you still want to claim Croatian and Serbian are the same.\\n\\nBut since you were so eager to bring Krle\u017ea up , I have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ \ '' Declaration about the name and position of Croatian literaly language\ '' ] ( https : //hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo % C5 % BEaju_hrvatskog_knji % C5 % BEevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ Novosadski sporazum ] ( https : //sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosadski_dogovor ) . So , he would very much disagree with you.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' hiljadu\ '' would be considered \ '' Serbism\ '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in Croatia\\n\\nNo , you wouldn\\'t . I\\ 've known people who freely used \ '' hiljadu\ '' when talking to teachers of Croatian language.\\nBesides , \ '' hiljadu\ '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from Greek language ) , not a \ '' Serbism\ '' . Really , are there any Serbisms ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; Not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by Croatian linguists , just to be as different from Serbian as possible.\\n\\nAgain incorrect . A lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . Google Bogoslav \u0160ulek , Adolfo Veber Tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Learn yer history bruh.\\n\\n\ '' Bruh\ '' , I know my history just fine . I don\\'t want to comment on your knowledge of Serbian ( I don\\'t really care ) , but your knowledge about Croatian history is frankly atrocious and it\\ 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a Croatian.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; We use both \ '' hleb\ '' and \ '' kruh\ '' , both \ '' vazduh\ '' and \ '' zrak\ '' , both \ '' sargarepa\ '' and \ '' mrkva\ '' etc . Bosnian and Serbian went for language richness , while Croatian went for language purity.\\n\\nVazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in Croatia . Not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into Standard . On the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; So in conclusion , no , Yugoslavia didn\\'t forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . \\n\\nIt\\ 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , I feel , based on your wishes . The idea of Yugoslavia **and** Yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . There\\ 's no denying it . You can check the texts from before the pan-southslavic movements.\\n",Balto-Slavic,Croatian,European

Ballander,europe,"& gt ; Well , I replied to a comment in regards to why Bosnia and Croatia are two different countries while Slavonia and Dalmacia aren\\'t.\\n\\nBecause of historical reasons . When you look at the maps of former empires , you\\ 'll notice that borders between Bosnia and Croatia were almost the same , they were borders of Austrian and Ottoman Empires.\\n\\n & gt ; So why religion ? Well , let\\ 's be honest.. A lot of seemingly insane views of other people have been caused by religion . So I guess I\\ 'm just trying to figure out if that\\ 's where it comes from down there . I mean , religion caused the killings of \ '' witches\ '' , gays , women ( doing anything wrong . ) , other religious groups etc . so \\n\\nReligion is not the point here . While religion had some part in formation of some nations ( primarily Serbs and Bosniaks/Muslims , to some extent Croatians ) , the problems were more of cultural/national/historical rather than religious . \\nCroatians were never very exclusive religion-wise , as you also had protestant , orthodox , etc . Croats . Heck , one of the orthodox was a famous writer during the national spring.\\n\\nFurthermore , even Croatian nazis considered Muslims to be Croats and they didn\\'t persecute them per se . For example , they turned one of the galleries in Zagreb in a [ mosque ] ( http : //media.news.harvard.edu/gazette/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/11-zagreb2-450.jpg ) . Those nazis also organised Croatian Orthodox Church.\\n\\nLooking at the religion as a source of all problems is a lazy and ignorant view , but the simplest of them - which is why so many people are prone to it.\\n\\n\\n & gt ; I suppose it might explain some of the tensions down there if everyone was like 110 % serious about their religions and believed every word of their holy books.. \\n\\nWhat year is it ? \\n\\n\\n & gt ; To me it simply doesn\\'t make sense to think that someone living 10 miles away ( Across a border ) is so different\\n\\nI left out the second part because it\\ 's a stereotypical nonsense.\\n\\nThe thing is because of cultural influence . Bosnia and Herzovina/Serbia were dominated by Ottomans and it shows , whereas the Croatians coast was always under the Italian influence . Northern Croatia ( Northwest particulary ) was under heavy Austrian influence . So , this is from where a lot of cultural ( and linguistical if you\\ 'd be looking into the dialects ) differences emerge.\\n\\nTo be perfectly honest , a northern Croatian is more likely to get beat in southern Croatia than a Serbian or some other nationality . Just a few days ago there were some news of players getting beaten . So , all these rambles about Serbians/whateverelses fearing for their lives because they\\ 're so special is nonsense , since Croatians may get the very same treatment . Why ? Because assholes . You got plently of them as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n & gt ; Why do Croatians care if someone\\ 's wearing a Serbian tourist t-shirt in Croatia for example ? \\n\\nThey rather don\\'t , they got other things on their mind to worry about rather than who\\ 's wearing what.\\n\\n & gt ; We don\\'t beat up people wearing German , English , Swedish or whatever football jerseys here for example..\\n\\nWe don\\'t do it either , other than hooligans , but they are more of an international problem ( see Dutch hooligans destroying Italian works of art , etc . ) and it\\ 's no worse than in other European countries . And these hooligans won\\'t beat just the foreigners , but anyone else who\\ 's not of their liking . Your viewpoint is very distorted .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian,European

Now let me explain what this migration \ '' crisis\ '' is.\\n\\nIt is a \ '' wave\ '' of people mostly not from war zones . Those are too poor and they are stuck in refugee camps . It is people from all kinds of areas who heard that there is good time to go to Germany and Sweden , because mother Angela will accept everyone . And if by some miracle they are not awarded asylum , no one will make them go back . And it is not a wave in a sense that it spikes and will subside , it is a stream that will go stronger or weaker , but will increase over time . Those people are not interesed in getting to safety , they reached it before they got on the life-threatening jurney accross the sea . They go after welfare in the promissed european lands . And not some mediocre welfare in southern or eaastern european states , only top tier welfare of Germany and Sweden will do . \\n\\nSo the Eastern states do not feel very invested in sharing the burden the rich states brought onto themselves by their wealth and unreasonable attitude towards migrants . \\n\\n**tl ; dr : ** \\nTo us , you are saying : \ '' We are so rich and naive there are milions of people who want to move over here , while you are too poor , homogenous and without the welfare to be interesting for anyone from MENA so no one is coming to you .

But thats origins , thats not 20 or 21st century , so I am talking about whats relevant for us right now . Liberalism in its core is right-wing orientation ( you should work hard and get big reward ) just like conservatism , as opposed to socialism ( everyone works and should have the same reward ) . Very simplified version . In todays context , lot of workers welfare ( labour laws , unemployment pay , maternity leave , benefits , ... ) are left-wing policies that originate in socialism . A liberal would say \ '' its their probl\u00e9m , I have my own , unlock my shackles and let me tak\u00e9 care of myself\ '' . thats a right-wing way of thinking.\\n\\nWhat reflects reality better , is the 4 way compass with + being libertarian , - totalitarian , X left-wing ( economy ) , Y right-wing ( economy ) . It reflects the complexity way better than just X and Y . Because Stalin and Hitler were both on the other side of axis Y and X , while both being totalitarians and governed the state in a very similar way , as opposed to western style of democracy . \\n\\nthe welfare state , as we know it today , was really not invented by Marx , but by a Bismarc , who was a hardcore capitalist supporter . But you can not have socialism without capitalism ( you will run out of money and everyone will become poor over time - look at central europe ) and you can not have capitalism without socialism ( look at europe in 18-19th century or china today - people will be unhappy and create labour unions , demand more welfare or even leave the country ( or even vote for people like Bernie Sanders ) , if another one will have better working conditions .

These would have their own governing body for matters inside the region , while the international relations , army , highest levels of law and other more interregional ( strange word , but I like it ) things would be under jurisdiction of European Union.\\n\\nI proposed something like this as solution for how Yugoslavia could have gone , but I think this is applicable for whole union .",Balto-Slavic,Czech,European

Burlaczech,europe,"If you are going to judge liberalism by todays standards in different countries ... you actually cant , because it has different meaning everywhere . You can find right winged green party as well as hardcore communist green party . You can be left wing socialist or even almost right wing ( previous PM of France ) . \\n\\nLiberalism is indeed about freedom of individuals , but which translates into economic freedom with emphasis on entrepreneurship and taking care of yourself . Unless you want me to recommend you a whole book , you will have to accept this simple definition and of course , one sentence or paragraph can not describe whole ideology with all its factions . Libertarians are extremists with anarchic tendencies , its like saying right wing conservatives = nazis . \\n\\nAs Ive mentioned before , you can have liberals in social democracies , which brings them more to centrists , because it is right wing ideology . Politicians in developer democracies are not edgy teens , and usually come up with compromises that include many ideas from different corners of political spectrum . Our liberal-conservative party which ruled the country like 12y ago increased social welfare spending 3 times , the biggest increase in modern history of the country . Does that make them liberal-conservative-socialists ? \\n\\nLiberals in todays EU either want to destroy EU , or understand its social principles and \ '' work within the borders\ '' of the EU legislative - which includes for example grants ( which would be unacceptable for liberals before ) . \\n\\nI am not really sure what do you mean by protecting life . Everyone wants to protect life ( ? ) , liberals would say that you should tak\u00e9 care of it yourself , conservatives would say that the family/your master/police should do it and socialists would say that there should be no guns among the population and only police should have some minimum ( best would be some tasers ) - thats very common in the north and western Europe today , which seems really crazy to me . And also extreme left ( greens , communists ) would say that we should destroy all weapons and focus on higher goals , such as global peace , environment , ... \\n\\nWhat you described about two people example , It seems like typical anarchic-communism ( final stage of socialism ) . Typical liberal would say \ '' your freedom ends where my begins\ '' - & gt ; dont touch my food , unless I give you a permission . But this could be very individual , as for example having opinion about squatters can vary between liberals , anarchists , communists , socialists , conservatives , ... Its a very complicated topic . \\n\\nWhether the liberal should or should not share food in that situation is not really liberal to me . Its socialism-conservatism debate . Socialist would share , conservative would not . Typical liberal would stick to a conservative narrative , but in todays EU , I believe that a liberal would stick with a socialist in this case . For example in the migrant crisis , liberals mostly support helping those people . But again , it varies a lot on individual organisations/parties/people , nobody is a pure liberal , everyone is a mix.\\n\\nEven as a right-wing liberal ( who would have guessed ) I dont see a reason for fencing a forest , so even if it is a private property , in this case I dont see why people should be denied access there . But I would have different rules for small parks that should give me an option to keep it private for me and people I want in . Or to demand an entry fee . But If I owned a forest , I could have different experience and outcome of my thoughts could be different as well.\\n\\nSo overal - we cant really classify parties or people as members of one ideology , we cant even judge certain policies as such , because all of them are mostly a mixture of multiple ideologies . Which is great and it keeps governments towards the centrism , which to me , is ideal , because it satisfies the majority . It is very easy to see that countries , which are edging towards one side more than the other , are not doing that well and a lot of people are really unhappy there , for real reasons ( as opposed to \ '' made up\ '' unhappiness here ) .",Balto-Slavic,Czech,European

Ahrily,europe,"& gt ; During this period [ Islamic Golden Age ] , the Muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations that had been conquered . Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated from Greek , Persian , Indian , Chinese , Egyptian , and Phoenician civilizations into Arabic and Persian , and later in turn translated into Turkish , Hebrew , and Latin . \\n\\n & gt ; With a new and easier writing system , and the introduction of paper , information was democratized to the extent that , for probably the first time in history , it became possible to make a living from simply writing and selling books . [ 38 ] The use of paper spread from China into Muslim regions in the eighth century , arriving in Al-Andalus on the Iberian peninsula , present-day Spain in the 10th century . It was easier to manufacture than parchment , less likely to crack than papyrus , and could absorb ink , making it difficult to erase and ideal for keeping records . Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries . [ 39 ] It was from these countries that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen . [ 40 ] \\n\\n & gt ; Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle , whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of the Christian and Muslim worlds .

The words \ '' boek\ '' in Dutch and \ '' book\ '' in English are pronounced almost the same , but the Dutch is still noticeably shorter and sharper sounding while the English is softer and more stretched out.\\n\\nOverall though , English was not hard at all to learn . It\\ 's often said that Dutch is a language halfway between English and German . I can speak \ '' German\ '' , and German people will understand what I\\ 'm saying , but I can\\'t make a single grammatically correct sentence if I have to improvise .

You also need to look at this from a whole of India situation . \\n\\nCertain areas of India were not producing enough food to feed their populations and were reliant on imports of grains and rice from Burma ( also a british territory ) . \\n\\nWhen Burma fell to the Japanese , this import source was gone . \\n\\nIndian states had a large degree of self governance at this stage and rather than ensure that food was made available to Bengal etc by sending food from states with surplus as they had done in previous decades , they decided to implement price controls etc to try and solve the issue - something that had not previously been tried in India . These price controls meant that states that had surplus food were not willing to send this food to these provinces as farmers would make losses and profits may be released outside of their states . \\n\\nThe failure is the inability to get Indian States to work together for the good of the larger nation , rather than the recently democratic states within India - politicians in these states now felt the need to show that they were standing up for locals first . \\n\\nSo really , if this article was looking to tell a complete story it should expand these subsections . \\n\\nThe British had largely handed power over to the Indian Government and didn\\'t have their hands on their day to day \ '' levers\ '' of running India . \\n\\nI am not saying that this is not the responsibility of the British to fix , but I am sick and tired of the Bengal Famine being bought up as a prime example of how the British Empire failed and as such - should be considered 100 % horrible . Authors always actively ignore the circumstances and go with the revisionist narrative and ignore the fact that India had achieved a level of self governance at this stage sufficient to handle this issue themselves . \\n\\nIf this had happened in 1843 then it would have been 100 % Britain\\ 's mistake .

First off , it is difficult to understand , as to whether feminists even think that women should be having sex in the first place , because according to them it is an act in which the man is in a dominant position and a women in a submissive position , so the act must be frowned upon , probably at least according to some of the 3rd wave feminists.\\n\\nOK , whatever the feminist logic is toward sex , then comes the issue of when a woman is having sex on her free will . Well , the feminists can\\'t really stop that I guess , since most women actually love to have sex and find great pleasure from it . Yet , for some reason , if both people have decided on their free will that they want to have sex , it is OK , but if the man decides to gives some money for a mutual decision to have sex ( trafficking is illegal anyway everywhere in Europe and large social safety nets provide everyone with minimum living standards ) , then the man suddenly becomes a criminal ? ! \\n\\nI mean you can\\'t make this up and it is mind-boggling even to try to get into the brains of the 3rd wave feminists , but the logic seems to be getting lost somewhere here.\\n\\nIt is kind of the same as with the whole Gamergate thing imo . At one point feminists go about the streets naked and ask that they be able to walk without having to wear a shirt and extremely rarely also they raise a concern of women having to wear niqab\\ 's in muslim countries , but at the same time the same 3rd wave feminists get extremely angry , if a video games decides to create a female character , who shows some cleavage , which has forced most game developers to completely cover up the new characters now and so scared to EVER create a sexy character any more in fear of a 3rd wave feminist backlash ( e.g League of Legends ) .\\n\\nSo yes , probably wasted my time trying into the minds of 3rd wave feminists , but they and their new policies , which they are enforcing with social media smear campaigns , have become kind of a joke , especially taking into account that there is still massive discrimination against women in 3rd world countries going on , especially in muslim societies , but who care about women not being able to drive a car in Saudi Arabia or women getting whipped in Indonesia with a lash for walking in the streets without a male companion , if you have bigger problems like game devs releasing sexy video game characters .",Uralic,Estonian,European

Many countries found out the hard way that it is extremely hard to integrate people from 3rd world muslim failed states . \\n\\nThis is why most Western/Nordic EU countries have a lot of American-style segregated societies/ghettos , filled with crime , unemployment , use of Arabic as main language , religious extremism and a deep hatred toward the English people.\\n\\nHowever immigration both illegal and legal will stay strong from African/Middle Eastern countries as migrants will continue to figure out different ways to get to EU , as Europe\\ 's standard of living will still continue to be so much higher than anywhere else around it.\\n\\n3 ) UK left the EU , some other countries considered leaving as well , but since there were no more referendums it didn\\'t happen . After the refugee crisis was solved and after another economic/debt crisis there was a time of stability , in which EU develops once more toward a federation , with the creation of an EU army as a major step forward.\\n\\n4 ) Since the economic differences were reduced between East and West , and since open borders have diminished the differences between EU people , there is more of a common sense of unity and it is now very common for Europeans to live/work/study in different EU countries and more people will begin to feel like \ '' Europeans\ '' in addition to their national identity.\\n\\n4 ) In Russia at one point Putin loses his power for one reason or the other , which creates massive chaos in the country , as there will be a huge struggle for power between the United Russia old guard , the oligarchs , the nationalists , the democracy-activists , the various regional separatists ( especially Chechnya and other Caucus muslim countries who will use this to break free from Russia ) and the communists . \\n\\nThis is why things turn from bad to worse in Russia and since Putin had destroyed virtually all democratic institutions there will be a major downfall in the economy and the overall functioning of the state . In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately . Also Turkey has become a bit more democratic , but is still very far away from joining EU.\\n\\n6 ) Estonia will be a very successful country by 2026 and its various start-ups have become quite big and well-known . Also , the 0 % corporate tax rate and the e-residency brought a lot of new companies ( +money ) and also immigrants to Estonia , which has helped push Estonia to have a very high GDP per capita PPP and in terms of quality of life it is on par or higher than other Western EU countries . Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia . This creates some tensions between the local population and the illegal/low-quality labourers .",Uralic,Estonian,European

Apostrophe,europe,"The Swedish Green Party is environmentalist . At least it was , originally.\\n\\nIn the past few decades they\\ 've embraced left-leaning thinking as an increasingly important core ideology , so they\\ 've become a left-wing party more so than a *green* party . This has lead to an increase in focus on social justice issues and identity politics , as well as a full-throated embrace of what they call *tolerance* and multi-culturalism . Specifically , they view having anti-immgration and anti-islamic views to be \ '' right-wing\ '' so they\\ 've emphasized tolerance of immigration and Islam . Basically , they\\ 've turned from an environmentalist party in to a left-wing progressive party.\\n\\nSo , what has happened is that recently a few Muslim politicians of the Green Party - [ Mehmet Kaplan ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Kaplan ) and [ Yasri Khan ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasri_Khan ) - have resigned .

ABaseDePopopopop,europe,"[ Here is an article in French ] ( https : //www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/pourquoi-la-france-refuse-de-ceder-le-controle-de-saint-nazaire-fincantieri ) that goes a bit more into the reasons and French point of view.\\n\\nSome points taken quickly : \\n\\n- French government says they don\\'t want to take risks on jobs , skills , and strategic industrial area . Since it\\ 's a strategic activity , they don\\'t want to give a majority to a foreign investor . They say that if the Italians won\\'t accept the 50/50 proposal , they\\ 'll use their refusal right.\\n\\n- The previous agreement planned for 48 % for Fincantieri , 6 % for Fondazione CR , 33 % for the French state and the rest for Naval Group ( DCNS ) . The \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' was supposed to make it so that Fincantieri wouldn\\'t control a majority , but the Italians would still be able to buy it.\\n\\n- Since the Italians now said they won\\'t accept a new agreement and want a full majority , the \ '' Fondazione CR\ '' thing is shown to be a trick.\\n\\n- The previous agreement was made in 2008 because there was no refusal right for the French state . Since then they have acquired enough.\\n\\n- The Italians argue that they should be prefered to a Korean firm because they\\ 're European . The current feedback from STX is that the Korean firm was bad financially but \ '' very transparent\ '' , without technological theft.\\n\\n- Saint-Nazaire is the only plant able to build large ships for the French Navy , and is developing well on offshore renewable energy , which is seen as an important sector for France who has the second sea area in the world.\\n\\n- Fincantieri works with the Chinese for their future ships . They\\ 'll build in Shanghai the large ships that were previously made in Italy for the American Carnival Corporation . Fincantieri defends that the technology transfer is under control , but the French doubt their ability to resist to Chinese pressure , and are very wary of technology transfer to China.\\n\\n- The entire ship industry is preparing for China to offer a huge competition , supported by their state . They are very wary of any help to cover the technology gap they currently suffer . This is also the position of the German Meyer Werft . STX is considered along with Meyer Werft as among best expert for cruise ships.\\n\\n- Concerning jobs , the agreement secures them until 2026 . But 5 years later , Fincantieri would be able to decide directly the work share between its different sites . As the company belongs for 72 % to the Italian government , the French government is worried that they would prioritize work in Italy . \\n\\n- It is observed that among the company , its suppliers and customers , nobody supports the plan to go for Fincantieri . The ship-owners even went as far as proposing an alterEnglish to the purchase agreement of 2008.\\n\\n- The French position is that their opposition has nothing to do with the nationality of the buyer . They\\ 've been under foreign ownership since 11 years , and would have accepted much more easily a merge with the German Meyer Werft.\\n\\nTLDR : The French government is worried about jobs as Fincantieri is under Italian goverment ownership and could prioritize their plants , and more importantly about technology transfer to China because Fincantieri works with them already .",Romance,French,European

Autogegner,europe,"The FP\u00d6 in its current form results mostly from J\u00f6rg Haider , who had studied the american far-right , i.e . Newt Gingrich in order to copy their platforms . Haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring .

2A1ZA,europe,"*Translation of the submission \ '' Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims\ '' by Zafer Senocak*\\n\\n**Of the Loneliness of Enlightened Muslims**\\n\\nHow to describe great loneliness ? Greater than the one which occurs when one has been abandoned by a loved one . Unlike the loneliness to which the poetries care . A loneliness that no longer will be outweighed by the world in which we live , can no longer be mitigated by what you believe , by promise and hope.\\n\\nIt is about the loneliness of those who come from the Muslim peoples and cultures and grew up in enlightened families who are religious or not , but always knew one thing , that they belong to the large global family of the enlightened . They want to live in a secular and open society , in Turkey as well as in Egypt , in Syria as well as in Iran . These enlightened mostly formed the middle class in their countries . They had a happy childhood . Half a century has it been since.\\n\\nOn the Bosphorus , there was this happy childhood , and also in Tehran . The happy childhood of bastards . Where did the bastards belong to ? They listened to the Beatles and more and more often overheard the muezzin . Where would they be at home when the world was open to them ? Has happiness a home in the world ? \\n\\n*The happy days of youth*\\n\\nIt was lived outdoors . Back in Cairo , Ankara and Tehran . Joy was the name of a dance . You could feel the stranger\\ 's hand , that prepared meals , on your own skin . It was also a time in which the prisons were filled and emptied with political prisoners . But the air outside did not smell like grids.\\n\\nThe air smelled of light effects . In the movies it was talked , laughed , music made . As on the streets . The houses all had a window on the streets . One grew out of one\\ 's house , to discover the world . The world of different people , the world of the other gender , the world of strange odors.\\n\\nThe child grew up free , because the adults had not yet fully furnished their world . You searched for the course of events , found snippets of photos , tried in memories , but they did live in the future . They lived in their children that they had rather than the ideas in their heads , the wild and horny ideas , the dangerous and the harmless . It was a time when you went to Paris for a weekend , because in Paris was always spring , a spring of the fragrance and love.\\n\\nThe preacher , who accompanied the dead came back to life and smelled like roses . Life and joy belonged to the existence of mortals , because they had the time and leisure to think about themselves and others . It was a time of learning . Foreign languages , the art of numbers and the art of living.\\n\\nToday in many places people have no life any more . Why even the graves ? The people no longer have a home . Why even have a garden ? The people have no land . What still limits ? Freedom can be as homelessness . In childhood , freedom smelled like freedom . The muezzin sounded as if he would sing of freedom . He called the people to prayer . Prayer smelled like freedom . Now , where the muezzin calls for death , to death and to kill , it would be to remember the smell of the prayers . Can you remember smells ? Will prayers help ? \\n\\nYou do not smell good anymore . They smell musty . We will no longer be free , meet together , but not free and be together . We are prejudiced , lifeless or false . We have no more childhood . The trains no longer go to Europe . The ships that reach Europe pour children overboard . But also those who live on do not travel any more . They emigrate , emigrate from their childhood , their lives , their hopes , from the joy of living . Can you live with these people ? Or is the hope that they have lost our death sentence ? \\n\\n*The Disappearance of Childhood*\\n\\nThere is no longer this childhood , which one could remember together . The alphabets are without secret . Freedom is a word . Words give life . We split the words in our bodies and have no word left for the happy childhood . Who belongs Paris ? Who owns my childhood ? Mother Asia , Father Europe ? \\n\\nTo whom does the bastard belong ? It was a happy childhood , the childhood of the bastards . I want my childhood back , my spotted by executioners childhood . I want to put on like a torn dress . It\\ 's perfect for me today , my mood , for my heart torn , for my pain . Without childhood we are naked.\\n\\nThe enlightened experience for a generation how they are pushed back in their own countries , but increasingly also rejected and abandoned by their non-Muslim sympathizers . They learn how the memory of their childhood increasingly gets into oblivion.\\n\\n*Massacre of Ankara*\\n\\nNowhere is this amnesia , which is accompanied by great loneliness , so noticeable as in Turkey . And no other event makes this loneliness feel more than the assassinations by deluded Islamists . Only a month ago , a suicide bomber killed more than 100 people in the heart of Ankara.\\n\\nHundreds of people were injured . A massacre of people who had come to demonstrate for peace . This event is perhaps hardly remembered . Otherwise , the Turkish President would have a harder time after the Paris attacks with his self-assured , arrogant appearances before the world public.\\n\\nThe fight against terror he wants to receive , together with the leading nations of the world . Would it not be about time first to uncover the backers for Islamist terrorism in his own country ? \\n\\nThe performances of the Turkish President in recent years were not without effect . Turkey has gradually left the Western community of values . The law is broken , continuously . It is threatened and sweared , against critics , against all those who can not be put on line.\\n\\n*Erdogan\\ 's arrogance*\\n\\nNow the country shall again get closer to Europe ? How come ? Is it not rather true that the unsettled enlightened elites of Turkey stand in the rain just like the proponents of a European Turkey in Europe ? Where is there left any discussion about the common values that go beyond lip service ? \\n\\nThe press which is close to the Turkish government has denounced such a community of values for a long time . They served the masses with conspiracy theories . The situatuion of the journalists and intellectuals of the country is sufficiently well known.\\n\\nThe enlightened Turks were and are left alone in their opposition to the rancor of their President and his ruling clique . This also contributes to the great loneliness , whose shadow falls on the representatives of a free and open Europe . It is high time to rid our hearts of this solitude . Because there is a common world to which we must fight , a world as it has been built after 1945 in Europe.\\n\\n*The devastating impact of the Saudis*\\n\\nBut the inhuman ideology of the Nazis is wearing a Muslim caftan today . There is nothing to interpret . Unfortunately , to many Europeans today this caftan appears to be closer , for power political or other reasons , than the stuff of which the dreams of the Enlightenment are sewn.\\n\\nWould one otherwise be photographed , shortly after the Paris massacre , with the Wahhabit king , representing ideologically and economically the hinterland of what is now the Caliph State . Not only that , the young people from the suburbs in Paris , in Brussels and elsewhere are poisoned by Salafis , Wahhabis and other Islamic sects . The nihilism of the losers finds a breeding ground . For this and nothing else stands Saudi Arabia . This spectacle is no longer even be described as cynical . It has become murderous.\\n\\n*Zafer Senocak , born 1961 in Ankara , ist a writer . He lives in Germany . *",Germanic,German,European

By the way this is not even a new accusation just listen to what people of her own party had to say about this in the past : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=12mJ-U76nfg\\n\\n* Hillary Clinton is using Colin Powell as an excuse . She set up her own E-Mail server , which is unprecetented . There is simply no comparable case.\\n\\n* The generals working with her have described her as extremely hawkish and as always going for the most hawkish option . She is a war criminal and also responsible for the war in Libya , which was based on nothing but lies . One of the lies she kept peddling about Libya , the lie about black mercenaries , actually led to black genocide in Libya , which was conducted by the people she was supporting there and she didn\\'t stop peddling that lie when she was informed about that fact as her E-Mails prove.\\n\\n* Trump also did not go bankrupt personally four of his over five hundred businesses did and they were put into bankrupcy for restructuring . This is not about incompetence but using thebankruptcy laws for personal gain . It might not be the right thing to do but it is quite common and says little about the competence of an individual.\\n\\n* Trump would not have more money if he would gave invested the money he has received from his father in an index fund anyone , who knows a little bit about finance knows this . This is a completely bogus claim that has been falsified many times . Here is a good breakdown on why this claim is nonsense : https : //www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-03/should-donald-trump-have-indexed- .\\n\\n* There are legitimate criticisms about Trump University but the accusations about the Trump Foundation are mostly without real substance if you look into them f.e they accuses him of donating 100000 $ to veterans through the foundation as part of a settlement when the settlement said that that was exactly what he was obliged to do . If you want to talk about Scams you should look at the Clintons , who by the way have not only used dubious schemes to make money themselves but also have supported scams . Also if you want to talk about morality you should talk about how Hillary Clinton fought hard to keep the minimum wage in Haiti below 0,61 $ , how she is a war criminal , hiw ger husban starved over 500k Iraqi children with sanctions etc..\\n\\n* It is hard to argue that Trump is a sexist for treating men the same as women . He has also more women working for him in senior positions than men and has been hiring women for executive positions when that was practically unheard of in the building industrie . \\n\\n* He has not credibly been charged with rape . His Ex-Wife accused him of rape when they were getting a divorce , which she later admitted was a bogus claim and there were a couple lawsuits in which he was accused of rape , which turned out to be fraudulent . If you want to talk about rape and abusive men you should talk Bill Cinton and Hillary Clinton , who has not only bashed people inclusing Monica Lewinsky for talking about Bill Clinton\\ 's abusive behavior and let\\ 's talk about Hillary Clinton accusing a twelve year old girl of lying while defending a pedophile , who has raped that girl : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? =1 & amp ; v=Tor00iWUhDQ.\\n\\n* There is no actual evidence that Trump is a racist and he is actually quite the contrary as he has supported Jessie Jackson , affirmative action , the Civil Rights Movement etc . in the past and has put people of minorities in charge of big projects for his company for decades . Meanwhile you got Clinton calling black youth \ '' Superpredators\ '' in the past , which is an actual racist statement .

This was certainly a difficult negotiation . \ '' \\n\\n\ '' The phrase providing for the new sanctions on Russia was removed . \ '' \\n\\n\ '' In this sense , we called upon the present Council not to move ahead to new sanctions against Russia.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' What is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in September.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' It was also agreed for the Council to explore and think about new lists . This will probably be discussed at the Council\u2019s next meeting . But these lists are subject to approval and ratification by each country , and we would not like to see the inclusion of persons we will not accept.\ '' \\n\\nIn all of this statement , frankly , you can see the desperate attempts of a pathetic servant to convince his Russian masters , that yes , Greece did NOT betray Russia by agreeing to the extension , that it worked its hardest to stop even heavier sanctions , that in all the negotiations they still have the best interests of Russia at heart.\\n\\nAnd here\\ 's how the Greek threat of a veto was cancelled out by another country\\ 's threat of a veto in the opposite direction : \\n\ '' In this sense , we called upon the present Council not to move ahead to new sanctions against Russia . I must mention to you that there was a country that moved to veto , but it was not Greece , as the international press had expected . This veto was put forward because a phrase was to be removed \u2013 and we had debated for an hour and a half on this issue . The Greek delegation explained clearly that this phrase would be removed \u2013 otherwise our work would not be able to move ahead . This country was isolated and , in the end , creatively , agreed to a text that does not provide for heavy sanctions or new sanctions against Russia . What is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in September . \ '' \\n\\n & gt ; Shit , the French are selling Russia warships , are they traitors to the EU and in Putin\\ 's pocket for doing so ? \\n\\nLook at http : //www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations\\nCountries like France , Germany , Italy , Spain , are categorized as \ '' strategic partners - whose governments have built special bilateral relationships with Russia , which has sometimes cut against the grain of common EU objectives in areas such as energy and the EU Neighbourhood Policy\ '' \\n\\nGreece and Cyprus was categorized under a new category altogether - \ '' Trojan horses\ '' of Russia .

And since there were not and still aren\\'t any jobs for them in Italy and Greece , because our economies can\\'t support MILLIONS of immigrants , since there simply aren\\'t so many jobs available in our two countries , that practically meant that with the \ '' EU immigration policies\ '' hundreds of thousands of people were forced to live in countries were because of the lack of jobs , the only option they had left for their survival was crime .

Arathian,europe,"Full text : \\n\\nZIPPING across the choppy Aegean in his powerboat , Nassos Karakitsos , a volunteer with a search-and-rescue NGO called Emergency Response Centre International , scans the horizon for refugees . He spots none . A few months ago the seas around the Greek island of Lesbos were filled with overstuffed rubber dinghies ( \u201cballoons with engines\u201d , Mr Karakitsos calls them ) carrying Afghans , Iraqis and Syrians from the Turkish coast . Today they are home only to the more forbidding vessels of the Greek coast guard , Frontex ( the European Union\u2019s border agency ) and NATO , lately arrived to help with maritime surveillance.\\n\\nThe quiet seas are the result of a deal struck between the EU and Turkey to reduce migrant flows , which came into effect on March 20th . It took everyone by surprise , says a European official on Lesbos , and there were teething troubles : the police tailed a Turkish liaison officer stationed on the island , suspecting he was a spy . But for now the migrants have stopped coming . Some of the scrappy volunteer groups that flocked to Lesbos last autumn , when 6,000 refugees might clamber ashore in one day , are closing shop . Larger organisations are moving staff to mainland Greece , where 46,000 refugees have been trapped by the closure of the Macedonian border.\\n\\nThe drama has shifted to Greek ministries , EU agencies and the quasi-prisons on Aegean islands created by the Turkey deal . On Lesbos , all arrivals are taken to Moria , a \u201chotspot\u201d ( processing centre ) turned detention camp . Most will face return once their asylum claims have been found inadmissible , on the ground that they reached Greece from Turkey , now considered a safe country for asylum-seekers . ( Deportations of migrants who did not claim asylum in Greece have already begun . ) Activists consider the deal a shameful abrogation of the EU\u2019s commitment to human rights . The pope , who has attacked Europe\u2019s \u201canaesthetised conscience\u201d on refugees , will visit Lesbos on April 16th.\\n\\nWell over 3,000 souls have been stuffed into Moria , a grim place of barbed wire and watchtowers . Through a fence Muhammad , a Syrian refugee , tells Charlemagne of overcrowded shelters and a complete lack of information before a policeman cuts the conversation short . Pakistanis\u2014who , curiously , have been arriving in greater numbers since the deal kicked in\u2014have begun a hunger strike . The NGOs that used to provide services inside Moria have partly withdrawn in protest , leaving it short of infrastructure , expertise and food . Last week Amnesty International , a human-rights watchdog , criticised the \u201cappalling conditions\u201d at Moria and another centre on the island of Chios.\\n\\nWorse may be to come . All migrants on the island have the right to claim asylum and to appeal if rejected , and 95 % have taken this up . The Greeks plan to conclude each case within just 15 days . But there are endless unanswered questions over the process , from the treatment of unaccompanied minors to the provision of legal aid . \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for us , and for Europe , \u201d says Maria Stavropoulou , the director of the Greek asylum service.\\n\\nVery little about Europe\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis has gone right . This deal is unlikely to be an exception . Refugees who have spent vast sums to flee life-threatening situations may not go willingly . The fate of non-Syrians returned to Turkey is unclear . Legal challenges are certain . The timeline for processing may well slip . In the meantime , if arrivals pick up again , Lesbos could reach its capacity of around 6,000 . Officials have already begun offloading migrants from Moria to other camps . Dozens of EU asylum officials have been dispatched to process the claims . Ms Stavropoulou\u2019s service has doubled in number . But she can not bring herself to say that she is confident the deal will work.\\n\\nMuch of the criticism the deal has attracted is therefore deserved . And yet , as Yannis Mouzalas , the Greek migration minister , notes , by the time it was signed it was the best that could be done . The EU had learned the hard way that it was unable to create a relocation scheme to share the refugee burden , and without one , fences were the only alterEnglish . For those European politicians whose priority was to reduce the flow , the new arrangement looks like a success . New asylum registrations in Germany fell to 21,000 in March , down from over 200,000 in November . Fears that migrants stranded in Greece would find other ways through have not come to pass ; instead , they have camped out in wretched conditions near the border , and elsewhere , in the futile hope that it will reopen one day.\\n\\nAsylum or bust\\nThis has created a tinderbox in Greece\u2014last week Macedonian police tear-gassed migrants who tried to storm the border\u2014but breathing space for politicians . Not long ago pundits speculated that Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , might not see out her term . Now she enjoys rising approval ratings.\\n\\nThat could change if the deal collapses . But there is a bigger concern . There was , despite appearances , a noble idea behind the EU-Turkey deal : stop the irregular migrant flows to make way for regular ones . Europe will probably make good on its minimal commitment to accept one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one sent back from Greece . But the deal also includes a vague promise of far more substantial resettlements to Europe : optimists have spoken of 200,000 a year or more . On this there is little sign of movement , despite the efforts of German and Dutch politicians to corral their colleagues into making pledges.\\n\\nThroughout this crisis Europe has been accused of pulling up the drawbridge and shunting its problems onto its neighbours . So far the accusation has not been warranted . But it will be if the EU fails to make good on its resettlement promises . On the wall of Moria the graffiti is still visible behind the whitewash : \u201cEU shame on you.\u201d If Europe does not show that its refugee policy amounts to more than border closures , detention and forced deportation , it will become impossible not to agree .",Greek,Greek,European

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Nothing to do with religion . Like the witch hunts in the 16th,17th , 18th centuries . \\n\\nIn pre-Christian Rome , in 331 BC , 170 women were executed as witches.\\nIn 184 BC , about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft\\nIn 182\u2013180 BC another 3,000 executions took place.\\n\\nChristianisation actually drastically reduced the killings of witches , with the first church teaching actually calling for the punishment of anyone who *accused* people for witchcraft . From wikipedia : \\n\\nThe Councils of Elvira ( 306 ) , Ancyra ( 314 ) , and Trullo ( 692 ) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship . This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries . The general desire of the Catholic Church\\ 's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn , which , in 785 , explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch . The Lombard code of 643 states : \\nLet nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch , for it is not possible , nor ought to be believed by Christian minds . [ 22 ] \\nThis conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900 AD ( alleged to date from 314 AD ) , which , following the thoughts of Augustine of Hippo , stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was , itself , false and heterodox teaching . The Council of Frankfurt in 794 , called by Charlemagne , was also very explicit in condemning \ '' the persecution of alleged witches and wizards\ '' , calling the belief in witchcraft \ '' superstitious\ '' , and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches . [ 23 ] Other examples include an Irish synod in 800 , [ 24 ] and a sermon by Agobard of Lyons ( 810 ) . [ 25 ] \\n\\n ... \\n\\nPope Gregory VII , in 1080 , wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence . \\n\\n & gt ; Nine million of them just went puff.\\n\\nI suggest you recheck your numbers .

If nobody else on here will say it , I will : as far as Hungary is concerned , 9 out of 10 cases of violent crimes are committed by Roma people . It\\ 's a statistic , not something that can be argued . I am sorry for the non-recognition Roma communities experienced for hundreds of years , but if they don\\'t want to help themselves , what help can be provided to them ? We often see Roma men buy lottery tickets and booze with money that is very likely given to them by the state for being a minority , and not just any minority , but Roma . Once again , being Roma is fine , but statistics can\\'t just be overlooked just because it doesn\\'t sound good to these \ '' ultra-modern , cosmopolitan\ '' people who have never interacted with Roma people in their lives .

Arnold_Layne,europe,"As required by the mods , here is the full text of the article : \\n\\nEVERY winter , town squares all over Europe are filled by the hum of Christmas choirs . Towns in northern Italy follow this tradition too , but with a twist . Singers abandon Santa costumes in favour of the distinctive feathered hats of the Alpini , tough soldiers mostly recruited from remote Alpine villages . The Alpini repertoire is different too . Christmas songs are swapped for haunting ballads about the cruelty of war . These canti Alpini\u2014and the soldiers who sing them\u2014have become part of the region\u2019s cultural heritage . \\n\\nAt first glance , this is surprising . After all , to start with , the Alpini were a decidedly military outfit , established in 1872 to protect the new Italian state from its enemies to the north . Their baptism of fire came during the first world war , fighting the Austro-Hungarians high in the Dolomites . Conditions were terrible : avalanches and frostbite were a constant threat . Despite this , the Alpini notched up some impressive wins . They also fought courageously in the second world war , distinguishing themselves in battles from Ethiopia to the Russian steppe . \\n\\nUp to a point , the continued popularity of the Alpini can be explained by their reputation for courage . Their songs reflect their sacrifices . \u201cAmong rocks , wind and snow , we are forced to stay awake all night , \u201d one explains . \u201cWe started out as twenty-nine , \u201d begins another . \u201cNow we\u2019re only seven.\u201d This pride transcends the songs themselves . Monte Grappa , a famous Alpini victory in 1917 , is still commemorated on street signs across the country . Other songs , meanwhile , juxtapose Alpini bravery with the supposed incompetence of other Italian soldiers . In one , the choir warns Luigi Cadorna , the Italian commander in the first world war , that he\u2019ll need the Alpini \u201cif he wants to advance\u201d . The regular conscripts \u201care too weak\u201d to do the job , while other troops \u201care mafiosi\u201d . \\n\\nBut if some Alpini songs stumble towards chauvinism , their enduring reputation is down to their stark anti-war message . \u201cA \u2018happy\u2019 death has never existed , \u201d explains Massimo Marchesotti , conductor of the Alpini choir in Milan . \u201cWe sing about the truth : of the pointless death\u2026that none of those kids chose for themselves.\u201d The results are intensely moving . In \u201cOi Cara Mamma\u201d , the Alpini ask what their mothers will do when their sons don\u2019t come back . Elsewhere , the choir tells their lover that they are buried \u201cin a field of edelweiss\u201d . The choir concludes that \u201cwhen you are alone at home , the edelweiss and I will be with you.\u201d \\n\\nThe presence of edelweiss is not accidental . Alpini songs have a deep link to the mountain culture that bore them ; some of the songs are centuries old . And unlike other wings of the Italian military , \u201cAlpini herald from the same valleys\u201d as their songs , says Mr Marchesotti . Indeed , most songs are odes to the mountains themselves . When a soldier is thirsty , \u201crefreshing snow\u201d will be there to soothe them . A dying captain asks his men to give a part of his body to the mountains so that he blossoms into \u201croses and flowers\u201d.\\n\\nThis thoughtful melancholy is popular : Alpini choirs still release albums and play concerts all over northern Italy , and interest in them extends beyond their music . Several films and documentaries have been made about their story . A book of Alpini exploits by Mario Stern , a sergeant who fought near Stalingrad , has been republished five times , and has been made into a play . While in Russia , Polenta , as well as the cheese of his English valley , and of course the mountains themselves are constantly on Stern\u2019s mind . \u201cGhe rivarem a baita ? \u201d repeats one of his men , in thick Brescian dialect . \u201cWhen do we get home ? \ '' Home , or baita in the dialect , is literally a mountain chalet . Once again , Alpini culture is less about martial swaggering , and more a vehicle for nostalgia for beauty of Italy\u2019s northern frontiers . \\n\\nThis heritage is not as secure as it used to be . Most Alpini regiments were dissolved after the Cold War . The soldiers themselves now come from all over Italy , weakening their cultural link to the Alps . Still , the troops continue to play an active role in Italian life . They fought with NATO in Afghanistan . Their avalanche training has proved useful in earthquake-ravaged corners of the Apennines . Moreover , the national Alpini association , with its 355,000 members , is still important . As well as promoting Alpini culture , local chapters\u2014encompassing both veterans and eager civilians\u2014help their communities in numerous ways . They maintain chapels , and a series of mountain shelters for weary hikers . This dedication has not gone unnoticed , even among civilians . In the Piedmontese town of Biella , 36 % of the members of the local association were never soldiers themselves . \\n\\nWith the centenary of the armistice ending the first world war fast approaching , the Alpini look set to return to the forefront of Italian cultural memory . They are in fierce debate with their Austrian counterparts about where to hold joint commemorations of the fighting . ( The Austrians do not want to meet in Alto Adige , a region Italy annexed from Austria after 1918 , and which is still mostly German-speaking . ) The soldiers have even stumbled into controversy over a new videogame . \u201cBattlefield I\u201d features Alpini fighting on Monte Grappa . The head of the national Alpini association said that \u201cdelicate themes , like war , need to be dealt with differently.\u201d The beautiful stock of canti Alpini promises to do just that\u2014long after memories of the 2018 commemorations wisp into the mountain air .",Romance,Italian,European

This government focused on taking debt under control through austerity measures , with the support of BOTH the right and left moderate wings.\\n\\nFringe parties instead went to the opposition , while a newish party started gaining a lot of votes : a stand-up comedian turned opinion leader founded a new party based on the core idea of \ '' send all those fuckers packing\ '' , proposing a selection of candidates via CV , short mandate limits and stuff like that , so that all the \\'old guard\\ ' politicians would be ruled out . He got a LOT of audience and managed to place a mayor in an important city.\\n\\nSince last year there has been a MAJOR wave of corruption and embezzlement scandals , mostly ( but not exclusively ) involving right wing people in high places , resembling at times the famed bunga bunga parties . The right wing parties have taken a nose dive in the polls , so much that the second highest party is the \\'fuck-em\\ ' party , according to several polls.\\n\\nThis general feeling of hate towards politicians and their privileges is starting to have an effect , so all parties are scrambling to find new , younger people to capture the disenfranchised voters . \\n\\nAccording to the current polls the next elections should have a pretty strong left-wing majority ( albeit with a drift toward the center ) and a sizable component of \\'fuck-em\\ ' people .

Now imagine if the prices of agricultural produce have doubled . Could you still feed yourself and your family ? What about those who were living paycheck to paycheck before the increase ? \\n\\nYou might say that the sellers will just import cheaper food from abroad , but then what will happen to your neighbour farmers ? If what you say happens then there won\\'t even be cheaper food from abroad , as almost all of it is from other EU countries . We don\\'t import milk or meat from China for obvious reasons .

AThousandD,europe,"Truth be told , in the past years I\\ 've been observing something genuinely puzzling to me here in Poland - a negative sentiment towards the elderly . \\n\\nThere\\ 's been a resentment towards older people for many years now , based on the association of old people with [ Radio Maryja ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Maryja ) , and PiS and their ( not infrequently dramatically ) conservative stances .

Oops.\\n\\nhttp : //rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Bible # Slavery_in_the_New_Testament\\n\\n___\\n\\nThe New Testament makes no condemnation of slavery and does no more than admonish slaves to be obedient and their masters not to be unfair . Paul , or whoever wrote the epistles , at no time suggested there was anything wrong with slavery . One could speculate that this might have been because he wanted to avoid upsetting the many slave owners in the early Christian congregations or to keep on good political terms with the Roman government . Or , more probably , he simply thought slavery was an acceptable fact of life as did practically everyone else at the time.\\n\\nEphesians 6:5-8 ( NASB ) : 5Slaves , be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to Christ ; 6not by way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . 7With good will render service , as to the Lord , and not to men , 8knowing that whatever good thing each one does , this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free.\\n\\nChristian slaves were told to obey their masters \ '' for the sake of the cause\ '' and be especially obedient to Christian masters : \\n\\n1 Timothy 6:1-2 ( NASB ) : 1All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against . 2Those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren , but must serve them all the more , because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved . Teach and preach these principles.\\n\\nThere are instructions for Christian slave owners to treat their slaves well.\\n\\nEphesians 6:9 ( NASB ) : 9And masters , do the same things to them , and give up threatening , knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with Him.\\n\\nColossians 4:1 ( NASB ) 1Masters , grant to your slaves justice and fairness , knowing that you too have a Master in heaven . [ 6 ] \\n\\nOne passage often cited by apologists as supposed evidence for New Testament condemnation of slavery is 1 Timothy 1:10 . However , as the King James version accurately translates , this condemnation is of \ '' men stealers\ '' ( Greek : andrapodistais ) , [ 7 ] i.e . slave raiders who kidnapped and sold people as slaves , not slave traders or slave holders in general . So Paul only singled out slave raiders to be considered \ '' lawless and rebellious , \ '' and to be categorized with murderers , homosexuals , liars and oath breakers.\\n\\nThe rather bland admonishment to slave masters by Paul is more than balanced by the demands for absolute obedience made of slaves . It is also rather telling that the masters are likened to God and Jesus , while the masters are simply told that they have a higher lord . So much for Jesus as the embodiment of the underdog - Paul could have pointed to Jesus\\ ' imprisonment and death as a cautionary tale to slave masters that even humble ( d ) characters can be important . [ 8 ] \\n\\nBefore the apologist plays the \ '' but Jesus didn\\'t condone slavery\ '' -card , following all these Pauline examples , try reading Matthew 18:25 , where Jesus uses slaves in a parable and has no qualms about recommending that not only a slave but also his wife and family be sold , while in other parables Jesus recommends that disobedient slaves should be beaten ( Luke 12:47 ) or even killed ( Matthew 24:51 ) .",Balto-Slavic,Polish,European

AThousandD,europe,"EU/NATO retortions against Spain for abetting Russism when ? \\n\\n [ Sarcasm is for illustrative purposes only . ] \\n\\nI don\\'t usually like short-cuts , but I will cut this short this time : what I\\ 'm getting at is that , as became lucidly evident on the occasion of London\\ 's Russian Embassy\\ 's # gaybeargate and the reactions that followed both on here and on the Russian sub , the so-called West and Russia appear to be locked in their own echo chambers , medially speaking , and it\\ 's hard to see how many Russians will not resort to pointing out that when what they perceive as the enemy ( correct me if I misread the signals the Russian media are sending ) , i.e . NATO as a proxy for the US , is criticising them , then they must be doing something right.\\n\\nEqually , when # Russiadenies , we appear to be all smug and superior ( which some Russians do not fail to take note of ) , but have we done anything about the situation ? \\n\\nBut what is the situation , first of all ? In my view , that there appear to be , let\\ 's call it , irreconcilable differences between how the West would like the world to run and how Russia , as dictated by Putin\\ 's policies currently , would have it.\\n\\nSo what can we do about the situation ? Bomb Russia , naturally ! [ sarcasm and exaggeration used for illustrative purposes only ] But no ! How can we - that\\ 'd be the end of all humanity , because to bomb Russia is to start a nuclear war - and Russians , I believe , also regret the fact that they can\\'t really use those ICBMs with impunity . So we\\ 're deadlocked , aren\\'t we ? \\n\\nBut what about good ole dialogue - what happened to that ? Yeah , but , you can\\'t just talk about human rights violations in Russia , because what about the lynched Negroes ? Was the egg or was it the chicken that was first ? Who was first to offend ? Are American retorsions the effect of Russian action or the cause of the next one ? \\nHow can we have dialogue when we don\\'t want to talk ( as a side note - [ the Polish Co-Chair of the Polish-Russian Commission for Difficult Issues resigned ] ( http : //www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1561493 , PolskoRosyjska-Grupa-ds-Trudnych-Rezygnacja-profesora-Rotfelda ) in Dec 2015 on the grounds that it was difficult to find common ground following Russian aggression in Ukraine , and Russians said the broken dialogue was on the Polish end , so there we were again , stuck ) .\\n\\nThe Russians that come here and don\\'t automatically bash Putin get hive-mind gang-banged into down-vote oblivion , because evil Russists from Asia , the get of Mongols who follow Der Putinissimus - and well , yes , maybe sometimes they have crude words to offer , maybe at times the best some of them can offer is calamitous , but not to try to listen is to end attempts at productive dialogue ( because yes , a form of hostile dialogue will continue even over our Iron Curtain 2.0 , but not one that builds bridges ) .\\n\\nLikewise , it may be hard for someone of Western sensibilities to try to find common ground with Russians - because pride , the imperative not to bow your head , not to lose face . And the lies , the manipulations , the echoes of the chamber where your truth and your truth alone is the truest truth and why would you listen to the weak gay-pigs ? \\n\\nSo dialogue doesn\\'t work , because we\\ 're not honest about it . How can we be honest - NATO promised not to move east , but it did . Russia promised to respect sovereignty , but it didn\\'t . The Cuban missile crisis and the hissy fit JFK threw ! And now you plant an anti-missile shield on our doorstep , so you can bomb Russia into oblivion with impunity , a Russian might say ! \\n\\nBut wait - Warsaw uprising and why did the Soviets have to stop on the shore and wait for the uprising to bleed out ? Why , because they were overstretched , the supply lines were thousands of kilometres long ! It was impossible to move another three kilometres to the other shore of Wis\u0142a and into the West bank of Warsaw ! \\n\\nBut the West intervened in Russia during the revolution ! They always hated Russia ! There were British soldiers on Russian soil , invading ! \\n\\nBut ! But ! and so on ad infinitum , ever trying to square that circle.\\n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \\n\\n*Ad rem* To report the waship movement was news reporting , with perhaps a pinch of banter regarding the smokey-pokey chimney-choo.\\n\\nTo mull over it like so is to masturbate furiously ( a fault all sides are not devoid of , I\\ 'd wager ) . It\\ 's not a god-damned football world cup , we don\\'t need updates in real time and , last I heard , [ NATO logistics for Afghanistan went through Russia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_logistics_in_the_Afghan_War # Northern_Distribution_Network ) and I didn\\'t exactly hear a fuss about that .

222baked,europe,"I didn\\'t say we identify as Slavic , as we most definitely do not . We identify as a Romance-speaking people of the Balkans . What I was trying to get at , is that we have much more in common with neighboring Slavs than with the people of the Italic peninsula , both in genetics and culture ( do Romanians eat mici , or lasagna ? ) . We have little in common with the modern French . Some 18th century exchange of our educated class in Paris didn\\'t really make the peasant masses French , and much of that French influence disappeared in modern times . Our academic and bureaucratic structures are some of the few things that are still admittedly French , but I don\\'t consider those culturally significant , and frankly , many countries modeled their institutions after the French . \\n\\nI have nothing against Southerners , other than the fact you generally come off as rude , and even that is mostly because the formal second person plural seems to have fallen out of common use in Bucharest , which comes off as extremely impolite ( clearly something that wasn\\'t adopted from the French ) .

Where I live , I see Hungarians , Romanians , and Germans all living very similar lives . Some segregation exists , sure , but that\\ 's mostly due to nationalistic and linguistic reasons .

A Hungarian from Mures county has more in common with a Romanian living in Mures than he does with a Hungarian from Budapest , and the same can be said for the Romanian when compared with another Romanian from Bucharest . \\n\\nPeople aren\\'t very good identifying what makes them unique , we are good at pointing out other groups and defining themselves as \ '' not them\ '' ; despite their incredible similarity .

BRUHBRUHBLOOP,europe,"I really didn\\'t want to comment in this west vs east shit show that this comment section ended up being , but honestly I need to give you a reply because in a weird way , what you are referring to about EE\\ 's complaining about the refugee crisis and annoying you , is what is annoying me about western Euros complaining about eastern Euros for simply having a different view . \\nOk , that was a mouthful , I will put it in a clearer view . As a highly educated eastern Euro who spent the last 8 years of his life in the West ( which is 1/3 of my life by the way ) I could not help but be in complete support to Eastern europeans on the refugee crisis . As many eastern states stated , forcibly relocating refugee there\\ 's was simply idiotic , as all would try to run or feel cheated for not getting placed in Germany , and how would you keep them there , by force ? Refuge started fucking crying even when they realized they ended up crossing the romanian border by mistake , how dafuq do you think that felt to us ? It was very offensive , I\\ 'll tell you that . \\n\\nAnyhow , so here\\ 's the issue , it\\ 's all about politics really . When western politicians such as Merkel saw a political benefit in being the mother of \ '' refugees\ '' she went all in for it , with many politicians from Netherlands , France , the Nordic countries etc . The only reason why the western media ( which is just as much propaganda as russian propaganda really ) went so harshly on eastern states was because they did not buy into that . In eastern Europe being an all for more refugees politician was not bringing political capital , it was actually destroying you politically . Thus eastern politicians didn\\'t buy into their play , and they went to place their own opinions against it . That was all they had at the point , a different opinion , but they got called racists , bigots , nazi\\ 's and what not for it ! How would you not be frustrated at the western Euros after you get that treatment just for not being as idiotically PC as them ? Of course , some leaders saw a way to win political capital from this and they went and created a shit show from the issue themselves , such as Orban in Hungary , the current leaders in the V4 as a more extensive example . And that was probably what went in your face so much that it annoyed you , but it wasn\\'t at all different from what western european politicians did to us , it was exactly the same as a matter of fact , just on the other side . So don\\'t you think you are a bit hypocritical when you are using a clear double measure like that ? \\n\\nWhat I wanted to say is , that while I do support helping refugees and am a very educated person , I could not help but agree with most eastern politicians on the issue . They correctly noticed that the entire solution of distribution was a complete shit and only done to offer the fake impression that something is done , it was only done for the political capital of western politicians , and they didnt want to commit political suicide in their own countries just for the western once to save face , how could I accuse them for that ? For any open minded person there reaction was totally natural , even though exaggerated in some cases ( Viktor Orban ) . \\n\\nNow back to the issue , that did not stop western Euros , such as you , from shitting on eastern Euros for that , which in truth , was you throwing shit on us for having a different opinion on the issue from you . Take me for example , do you think I was against helping the refugees ? I never was , I am not even now . But the solutions proposed by the west were simply idiotic , the problem had to be solved at the core , around Syria , were most refugees live , were all those women and children who can not make the trip are . Send money to Lebanon , to Turkey , to Egypt , make those country help their brothers , they are of the same culture after all . Who could understand them better than their own kind ? And yet , for simply having this different view on the solution , I got so much shit from people like you , how could I not get sick really ? \\n\\nNow a final example , take the politicians of Romania , they were more moderate on the issue . They voted against the mandatory quotas as they believed they were not a solution , however they did not oppose the relocation as it was enforced by the EU . They even started doing it , by now I think they got like 30 refugees here . Why so little you wonder ? They should be above 4500 coming here . Well , that\\ 's because the fucking relocation hubs in Italy and Greece are not working , they are not even fucking operational . That\\ 's how much the EU actually cared about their relocation project , so much it doesn\\'t even work even if you want to do it . But of course , it was never meant to work , it was always just a facade for the masses . The only reason you are pissed is because eastern Europeans didn\\'t buy into your charade , and for that we ANNOY you ? How hypocritical is that really , and because you are annoyed by that I am annoyed for your annoyance ! Isn\\'t life really a wonder in the end ? : ) ) \\n\\nYou are also completely ignoring the very fundamental part of how much western Europe is getting from the eastern open markets and their economical growth which overflows in the west too ... . currently eastern European nations are kinda the engine behind the sluggish growth that the EU is even having as a matter of fact , but let\\ 's not go there , because I feel I would have to start another long long argument about that with you . \\n\\nPS : I agree on the LGBT issue , still lots of things to solve . It\\ 's mainly due to the people being hard core religious here , and that is a result of communist oppression of religion . You western Euros forget or ignore too much that most eastern countries were still a dictatorship 26 years ago . Actually in Romania\\ 's case I would say the communist rule only fell somewhere in the 2000\\ 's , which you can even see on our GDP graphs , the entire decade from 1990-2000 was a complete waste , nothing moved here , just things got demolished . But for what we achieved in just 16 years and the amazingly fast improvements we are doing I can only be proud of my country , and if you can not see that it\\ 's because of your long nose , not because of my peoples\\ ' lack of efforts . So I am sorry , but I\\ 'm not sorry at all ! ; ) \\n\\n Have a nice day .",Romance,Romanian,European

However we are commenting on an article about how the EU parliament president is saying that you\\ 'll be out of the EU but maybe you know something I don\\'t ( very likely ) .\\n\\n & gt ; TThe most grating part is that you are clearly showing a deep ignorance of the cultural , economic , political and even historical aspects of spain and catalonia , and yet you are doing all sorts of assumptions on who will recognise us and worst , the rationale these countries will use to deny us such recognition , despite you not knowing what is their opinion because ou don\\'t really follow the issue of Catalan independence , the movements of Catalan and Spanish diplomacy ( you don\\'t even know catalonia has its own diplomatic service ) and the results of the meetings and conferences which are constantly taking place . \\n\\nReally you got all that from what ?

If you trust them to have one in case of the situation stated then good luck to you and as I said in your post I hope for your sake you are right.\\n\\nThis is why your rant about my assumptions catalonia seems odd because reading my post again I never did assume anything about it .

A_Nest_Of_Nope,europe,"As expected the argument of oil prices always comes up . Yeah tell that to the people that lived when Yeltsin was the president and when he sold the entire country to 20 people.\\n\\nAs for the reforms , what happened with **Yeltsin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia had undergone a radical transformation , moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally integrated market economy . Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected \ '' oligarchs\ '' , which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.\\n\\n & gt ; Yeltsin\\ 's program of radical , market-oriented reform came to be known as a \ '' shock therapy\ '' . It was based on the recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists , including Larry Summers . The result was disastrous , with real GDP falling by more than 40 % by 1999 , hyperinflation which wiped out personal savings , crime and destitution spreading rapidly.\\n\\n & gt ; The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and subsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth . For example , the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often become the owner of the same enterprise . Under the government\\ 's cover , outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group of individuals at key positions of business and government . Many of them promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad producing an enormous capital flight.\\n\\n & gt ; Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and a dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\\n\\n & gt ; In the 1990s Russia was \ '' the largest borrower\ '' from the International Monetary Fund with loans totaling $ 20 billion . The IMF was the subject of criticism for lending so much as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the money and a large part of these funds could have been \ '' diverted from their intended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country illegally\ '' .\\n\\nWhat happened with **Putin** : \\n\\n & gt ; Russia bounced back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed . Much of the reason for the recovery was devaluation of the ruble , which made domestic producers more competitive nationally and internationally.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2002 , there was a significant amount of pro-growth economic reforms including a comprehensive tax reform , which introduced a flat income tax of 13 % ; and a broad effort at deregulation which improved the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\n\\n & gt ; Between 2000 and 2008 , Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity prices . GDP grew on average 7 % per year.Disposable incomes more than doubled and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold.The volume of consumer credit between 2000\u20132006 increased 45 times , fuelling a boom in private consumption.The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30 % in 2000 to 14 % in 2008.\\n\\n & gt ; Inflation remained a problem however , as the central bank aggressively expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble . Nevertheless , in 2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved \ '' unprecedented macroeconomic stability\ '' .Until October 2007 , Russia maintained impressive fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000.\\n\\nPutin absolutely did nothing , it\\ 's all because oil !

By the way , a random comment in Reddit does not at all have the same power as , say , a condition in an international trade agreement.\\n\\nOtherwise , I agree with what you are saying , but , ultimately , it wasn\\'t the German government who sponsored this \ '' irrational exhuberance\ '' of Irish banks ; it was German private investors and banks . Let them fail . If Germany wants to bail THEM out , then that is a German decision . Germany shouldn\\'t interfere , positively or negatively , in Irish decision . If Ireland decided to , on their own , back their banks 100 % at the expense of their people , that is Ireland\\ 's problem , not Germany\\ 's . If some German investors were benefitted by Ireland\\ 's move , that is beside the point.\\n\\nMy point is , you can not be half a Super Country and half independent . You NEED to be a single government to have a single currency . You can not have a single currency with multiple governments . You either split off completely , or unite completely , but whatever it is the EU is doing is unsustainable . Note : I am not saying it is either right or wrong , merely unsustainable.\\n\\nFinally , if there is a problem , it is because somebody sinned . In the case of Greece , I think it is very much the government\\ 's fault . In the case of Ireland or Spain , less so . But , in any case , if somebody sinned , that somebody should be punished . What I find wrong is this impulse of governments to shield their banks or Cajas , or whatever from the punishment , and then expect the rest of Europe to share the burden . Let the banks fail , and after that , clean up the mess . Don\\'t avoid it , because that is worse .",Romance,Spanish,European

For instance , Mexicans who cross the border daily to work in a factory at Arizona increase their productivity 500 % over the average Mexican , they are in fact more productive than Japanese or British workers , that is not because they work 500 % harder or they are 500 % more motivated . Germans who travel to work at Colombia are 600 % less productive when they get down from the airplane , and that is not because there is a magic magnetic field in the Atlantic that changes people\\ 's levels of motivation . \\n\\nLabor Productivity is defined by the \ '' context of production\ '' , which is the sum of technology + education + investment level + infrastructure in a particular area .

The problems include low trust in the EU , low voter turnouts in EU elections , and national elections for EU seats that focus on national issues when the EU is a supranational organisation . There are no EU-wide parties and there are no actual EU elections . National issues voted on that get national politicans voted into the EU only have indirect influence on actual EU-level issues .

First , this thesis explores whether or not the y-name syndrome is evidence-based by examining the relation ship between y-names and socioeconomic status in 26 municipalities , and the prevalence of y-names among men who are , or have been in the custody of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service . We find that the y-name syndrome is empirically grounded ; men with y-names are more likely to live in municipalities characterized by indicators of low socioeconomic status and are over-represented among criminals . Second , we explore if people with y-names are discriminated against in the labor market . This is investigated by looking at the ceteris paribus effect of a y-name on how 864 Swedish adults rated an employment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 .

Abrovinch,AskEurope,"About Swedish healthcare.\\nSweden is divided into 20 countys , and it\\ 's the county that\\ 's responsible for healthcare and the insurance of its inhabitants . This means that there are some variations throughout the country . But generally speaking a visit to the ER will cost you about 100 SEK . When you reach 1100 SEK over a 12-month period you don\\'t have to pay the fees for the reminder . The same is also true if you reach 2200 SEK for prescription drugs.\\nThere is also a lot of private health care in Sweden . However most of it is operated in the same way as the county hospitals/clinics . Meaning it\\ 's funded through the countys and you don\\'t pay anything extra just because it\\ 's private . Also , according to law you have the right to choose your \ '' home clinic\ '' , so in that regard there is healthy competition here.\\nThere exists some private healthcare that isn\\'t funded by the countys as well . And because of that there also exists private health insurance . These cost between 90 and 450 SEK/month for someone who is about 35 years old , the price is dependant on what\\ 's included.\\n\\nNow , because healthcare is run by the counties , there are differences in waiting times etc . I for instance have never had any real problems booking a general appointment at a clinic , usually I can go there the next day . At the ER it depends on the severity of your condition ( of course ) , waiting times there varies from zero up to a few hours for non-important issues . But yes , queues exists , but at least there is a political consensus to try and shorten the waiting times.\\n\\nI have never had issues with healthcare personell not caring or being unfriendly . Also if a person working at a hospital/clinic/whatever sees something that could even potentially be dangerous or bad for the patient , they are obliged by law to report it to the National Board of Health and Welfare.\\n\\nAnd lastly , there is a phone number , run together by the counties , that you can call 24/7 and talk to a nurse at no extra cost than a normal phone call . You can also access it on the web att [ 1177.se ] ( http : //www.1177.se ) , which is nice as you could do some self-assessment from home without doing some dodgy google-searches all saying you got cancer , ebola and probably aids , at the same time..",Germanic,Swedish,European

Half of historical Armenia \u2013 the same half where the foundations of our independence would be laid according to the traditions inherited by European diplomacy \u2013 that half was denuded of Armenians : the Armenian provinces of Turkey were without Armenians .

It was the most decisive method of extirpating the Armenian Question from Turkey.\\n\\n & gt ; **Again , it would be useless to ask today to what extent the participation of volunteers in the war was a contributory cause of the Armenian calamity .

It tells the details of political discussion inside Turkey about WW2 . They were of course scared that Nazis will attack Turkey , and they were more scared that , if Nazis attacked , Soviets will \ '' save\ '' Turkey . From 1941 Nazi-Turk Non-Aggression Pact to Battle of Stalingrad , Nazi sympathizers in Turkey make Turkey really close to joining the war on Axis side . ( And Inonu must also consider the chance of Nazis taking down Russia , so he can not go full against Nazis . ) \\n\\nAlso it\\ 's strange to see so many Nazi sympathizers in Ankara during the war . According to Deringil , Nazis had a great network of spies ( mostly Turkish ) in Ankara and they were doing propaganda against Western powers . These guys were hoping by allying with Germans , after Russia has been defeated , Nazis will give Turkey the Turan lands . There were parties thrown in Ankara after every Nazi victory , with fireworks and stuff .
