100100145,syriancivilwar,"Is the Iranian military structured differently than the SAA ? They both have a large conscript army , and a smaller `` pretorian '' corps that tends to receive far more attention and resources from the government somewhat to the detriment of the conventional army . While Iran has n't been engaged in major conflicts in recent history from I do remember troops commanded by the IRCG being deployed in Syria a some months ago . Back then their commanders did show the same lack of regard for the lives of the men under their command that the SAA is known for . While I do n't doubt the Iranian armed forces are much better than the Syrian , I suspect it might not be because they lack the problems the SAA suffers from , but because they have them but to a far , far lesser degree .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Well , as to the point about about islamism see my other reply to that other post . History is full of examples of men throwing away their lives for secular causes with the same lack of concern for themselves as suicide bombers . All that is needed is a cause soldiers would believe in and trust in their high command . Those things are , I think we can both agree , severely lacking in Syria , and nobody is going to really support a government he mistrusts . And if a government is going to allow corruption and nepotism to propagate in something as critical to its survival as the military , do n't you think the other spheres of government activity would be affected as well ? How do you think a corrupt and incompetent police , secret police , agricultural authority , industrial regulator , health services , regional authorities , etc . would affect civilian morale ? & gt ; EDIT : to be honest I had no idea what the solidarity citizens committee was , but a quick wikipedia read mentioned that the committee did n't even last a year ? That is precisely where I was going . Even if separate groups have different ideologies , they can be very popular together when they defend a common popular cause . I do n't think most people that support JaN would go home , if the group were destroyed . They would just join another one . Thus it is not meaningless to talk about support for the rebels , in spite of the fact that `` rebels '' is a category rather than a coherent group .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"Observe , for example , the difference between the methods the Islamic Republic of Iran uses in promoting favorable viewpoints as compared to their arch rival , the Saudi Kingdom . Iranian news outlets , including state news organizations , all behave like tabloids . You 'd expect that a state TV channel would try to maintain a good standing , since it 's reputation is intrinsically linked to the reputation of the state it represents . Yet PressTV has quite justifiably acquired reputation for being deceptive and obviously biased . Overall , Iranian propaganda is crude and amateurish . When people see a story by an Iranian news organization , they expect misinformation . In comparison with Iran the Saudi government deals with foreign media in a far more traditional manner . While Iran has 2 state news agencies and a government TV channel , KSA has only 1 official press agency . The Saudi equivalent of FarsNews would be Al Arabiya , an agency usually taken far more seriously . Saudi media , unlike their Iranian counterparts , rarely tries to deceive it 's viewers and when they do it 's usually done well . As a result any deception they engage in is far more likely to be believed . Both Saudi Arabia and Iran have censorship but in the Kingdom the censor is not the preferred way of controlling the media landscape . Instead the Saudi state encourages a cultural and economic environment hostile to criticism of government . A consequence of that is the fact that they are more than capable of influencing media beyond its borders . It is said that even Al Manar reporters are hesitant to attack the Kingdom . Overall , there is a lot to discuss about Iranian propaganda . It should be clear by now that I consider it to be terrible , and beyond that vastly inferior to the more traditional means of persuasion employed by their main rival . ( I avoid the term propaganda when speaking about Saudi Arabia , since usually the term is used to denote rather crude ways to get one 's point across . ) The reasons for that are something worthy of discussion .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

Therefore , we make do with these ersatz solutions , born out of the need of the moment : Germany asks Hungary to let them pass , then starts giving signs that it\\ 's ready to do *realpolitik* and , as the *de facto* leading player of the EU , force the hands of those who have lesser bargaining positions.\\n\\nI would stay my hand for now , lest I cast a stone in anger - which I really don\\'t feel - against my ( German ) brother . \\n\\nOn a fundamental , human level - I can understand why Germany welcomed the refugees . I\\ 'm not sure if I\\ 'm qualified to mete out judgement , but I can imagine worse decisions could have been taken . At the same time , apart from the fundamental , human level , there is also the economic level and this is where politicians come in , because , it seems , they are the ones making shitty decisions , so things don\\'t get shittier .

Also , characteristics like these make people on the tribes really gel together . WA is n't exactly the same . It 's similiar in the way but BvBvB theme bases on the overall characteristics - from personalities ( Alecia is feisty hence is a Brawn , Tai has amazing positivness and joy of life hence is a ( n inner ) Beauty ) to their jobs ( Sarah is a cop and brawn is the characteristic of the job , Peter is a doctor so he clearly must be an intelectual ) ending with simply their looks ( Anna , Lindsey , Aubry ) WA takes only one characteristic into consideration - the job . It 's just one link to the other format but it gives slightly different group HvHvH seems to be taking into consideration the personality and life motivation but I do n't know if it is n't too wide of a characteristic to create groups that would gel together .

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"I 'm guessing the question is : Why ca n't we scale up the screens of mobile phones to monitor size , with the same ppi ( pixels per inch ) ? Because OLED ( the technology behind most mobile phone screens ) ca n't be scaled up without inflating the cost to insane levels . There is also the lack of content ( even 4k content is pretty rare ) and lack of hardware that could run that high of a resolution Englishly . There is also the question of diminishing returns : Doubling the number of pixels does n't necessarily mean an image that seems ( to our eyes ) twice as good so we would be wasting a lot of processing resources . Also , since monitors are meant to be viewed from a distance the increased pixel count might not even be noticeable . Example : I recently bought a 4k monitor because my old one died . Impressed by the picture quality , I wanted to show it off to my dad . His old eyes could n't even tell when I switched the resolution from 1080 to 4k .

If you are measuring plastic parts , you need accuracy of ±0,01 to ±0,05 mm , and you can buy a caliper like [ this ] ( http : //www.insize.com/products/tools/pdf/caliper/1205.pdf ) . It 's rated ±0,03 mm ( about 1/3 width of a leaf of paper ) , but mine is actually accurate within ±0.01 mm . I use that at work and it performs great . It cost about 15 € . Used on plastic it shows the exact same value as a digital 10x more expensive Mitutoyo . It 's made of milled , engraved , thick stainless steel . It will also last longer than the Mitutoyo since it has no display or batteries . OTOH , if you have to measure high precision metal parts made with tight tolerances , you need a more precise caliper *and a micrometer* ( because calipers are not really that precise , after all , you must press on stuff using your shaky , variable hand ) , and many have recommended a lot of good calipers for that .

They also managed to land a shit tonne of troops next to Nanjing even though I have the whole coastline and ports protected by the 30 or so Juntuans but they seem to be useless . They ca n't fight off a landing of more than a couple of units and then are completely useless in fighting the Japanese off the coasts before they reinforce .

NATO as a proxy for the US , is criticising them , then they must be doing something right.\\n\\nEqually , when # Russiadenies , we appear to be all smug and superior ( which some Russians do not fail to take note of ) , but have we done anything about the situation ? \\n\\nBut what is the situation , first of all ? In my view , that there appear to be , let\\ 's call it , irreconcilable differences between how the West would like the world to run and how Russia , as dictated by Putin\\ 's policies currently , would have it.\\n\\nSo what can we do about the situation ? Bomb Russia , naturally ! [ sarcasm and exaggeration used for illustrative purposes only ] But no ! How can we - that\\ 'd be the end of all humanity , because to bomb Russia is to start a nuclear war - and Russians , I believe , also regret the fact that they can\\'t really use those ICBMs with impunity .

Yeah , but , you can\\'t just talk about human rights violations in Russia , because what about the lynched Negroes ? Was the egg or was it the chicken that was first ? Who was first to offend ? Are American retorsions the effect of Russian action or the cause of the next one ? \\nHow can we have dialogue when we don\\'t want to talk ( as a side note - [ the Polish Co-Chair of the Polish-Russian Commission for Difficult Issues resigned ] ( http : //www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1561493 , PolskoRosyjska-Grupa-ds-Trudnych-Rezygnacja-profesora-Rotfelda ) in Dec 2015 on the grounds that it was difficult to find common ground following Russian aggression in Ukraine , and Russians said the broken dialogue was on the Polish end , so there we were again , stuck ) .\\n\\nThe Russians that come here and don\\'t automatically bash Putin get hive-mind gang-banged into down-vote oblivion , because evil Russists from Asia , the get of Mongols who follow Der Putinissimus - and well , yes , maybe sometimes they have crude words to offer , maybe at times the best some of them can offer is calamitous , but not to try to listen is to end attempts at productive dialogue ( because yes , a form of hostile dialogue will continue even over our Iron Curtain 2.0 , but not one that builds bridges ) .\\n\\nLikewise , it may be hard for someone of Western sensibilities to try to find common ground with Russians - because pride , the imperative not to bow your head , not to lose face . And the lies , the manipulations , the echoes of the chamber where your truth and your truth alone is the truest truth and why would you listen to the weak gay-pigs ? \\n\\nSo dialogue doesn\\'t work , because we\\ 're not honest about it . How can we be honest - NATO promised not to move east , but it did . Russia promised to respect sovereignty , but it didn\\'t . The Cuban missile crisis and the hissy fit JFK threw ! And now you plant an anti-missile shield on our doorstep , so you can bomb Russia into oblivion with impunity , a Russian might say ! \\n\\nBut wait - Warsaw uprising and why did the Soviets have to stop on the shore and wait for the uprising to bleed out ? Why , because they were overstretched , the supply lines were thousands of kilometres long ! It was impossible to move another three kilometres to the other shore of Wis\u0142a and into the West bank of Warsaw ! \\n\\nBut the West intervened in Russia during the revolution !

3w4v,nonmonogamy,"Just warning you that I have analytical tendencies . That said , here 's how I would approach your issue if it were me : **TL ; DR** You should n't feel bad because you are asking for help with a problem . That 's normal and fine and okay ! Keeping your problem , your desired outcome , and proposed solution separate in your discussion will probably make things clearer to you . By involving your partner in the discussion , you 'll feel less guilt because you wo n't be prescribing a course of action but collaborating on the health of you and your relationship . Describe your problem and desired outcome first , and let your partner suggest a solution before you suggest yours in order to get a less pre-filtered opinion and gauge his feelings . Decide what to do after that . But definitely do n't feel guilty for asking him to participate . **Long Version** You have a problem , a causal hypothesis , and a proposed solution . You also have an implied desired outcome . The thing you seem to feel guilty about is the solution part . Some or all of this analysis may seem obvious . If so , great . & gt ; I 've been really struggling with my fear and anxiety about being left behind or abandoned [ ... ] Your problem is that you are experiencing abandonment anxiety , or , to be specific , the symptoms you are bundling under this label . This is the first thing you should discuss with your partner and his wife , if you have n't already . You also have a desired outcome , which you stated as `` build [ ing ] our foundation stronger '' , but that 's more of a solution . Your real desired outcome is to experience less anxiety . & gt ; [ ... ] which is connected to an anxiety problem and a recent dip in mental health . You attribute that anxiety to two factors . The first is a change in your underlying mental health , which implies that you have experienced/are experiencing other symptoms that suggest this is the case . Your intuition about this is probably right . I 'm assuming that you are taking steps to work on this issue on your own . The second is a change in the relationship dynamic . It 's a safe bet that your abandonment issues are linked to this . However , it may be worth exploring exactly what changes have happened - is it just that he 's dating , or have other habits changed as well ? You also believe this change is a problem _because of_ the first issue . Although this seems like a reasonable assumption , it 's not the only possibility . How true this is may influence how effective a given solution is for you . In any case , you should always be sceptical of your assumptions about hidden causes , and focus more on observed effects . When evaluating solutions , a solution that will work _without assuming a cause_ is more robust . & gt ; I wanted to ask him to for a month , at most , to not pursue any new romantic relationships [ ... ] so I can examine what is bothering me and work on healthy techniques for being both a good girlfriend and a good participant in a poly relationship . This is your proposed solution ( I 'm sure you have a lot of details here you 're leaving out ) . You probably feel guilty because your solution involves a restriction on your partner , and you might be forcing or manipulating your partner into doing something he is n't comfortable with . I think you can feel less guilty by viewing this not as a final and inflexible prescription , but as a possible solution you thought up that might help you . You do n't have to feel guilty about trying to solve your problem ! You also should keep in mind that you have to trust in your partner 's agency . As long as your request is a request and not an ultimatum , your partner deserves to be able to choose to help you in this way . However , it is problematic that you are framing the conversation as the acceptance or rejection of a fully-formed proposal . Although your solution seems reasonable , the sort of solution you might come to after a discussion with your partner , it is n't the only solution . You need feedback from your partner before you can know what parameters to flex , or even if it your proposal makes sense . Maybe allow your partner ( maybe his wife too ) to propose solutions himself before you prime him with your own . Maybe his proposal will be similar to yours . Maybe it 'll be something you had n't considered . In any case , it will help you take his feelings into account . Notice the assumptions your proposal makes , though , and weigh this idea against other options that are slightly or very different . If you think you 've already done this , do it again anyway - cognitive researchers have documented that subjects almost always attach themselves to the first solution they come up with and justify its merits after the fact , so you have to spend at least some effort in trying to correct for that tendency . What are you asking him to stop doing _exactly_ ? Date , or date without your involvement ? Is there some other behavior change on his or your part that would also help ? Why a month at most ? Is it because you 're making some assumptions about his needs and feelings ? Do you already know what steps you 'll take to work on yourself and think that 's the amount of time you need ? Have you explored options that might feel uncomfortable , like breaking up and being on your own for a while ( remember , you do n't actually have to _do_ things just because you think about them ) ? Also take time to explore different rough outcomes of that month ( or whatever time period ) - your problem improves a lot , it improves a little , it stays the same , it gets worse - and what that would mean your next steps would be .

3w4v,FutureWhatIf,"Things would have to change drastically for that to happen , so let 's play out a scenario that causes it . Another economic crisis catapults a radicalized Svoboda and a new ultra-right party from the industrial , Russian speaking East to take over from Party of Regions dominance and create a new dichotomous party system . Svoboda pushes for a 'purely Ukrainian Ukraine ' policy that more aggressively targets the Ukrainian central dialects ( Surzhik ) for extinction and tries to place anti-Russian language laws on the books throughout the country . Russian language books are burned in some places . The attacks are clearly on not only the Russian language but also Russian ethnicity . The new right party moves for Eastern succession . Let the West rot in Europe - Crimea and the East will become their own state , possibly vying for annexation by the Russian Federation . In the East Ukrainian language textbooks are thrown out of school windows in retaliation . Meanwhile the economic crisis worsens , and as each side blames the other secession by the East and South becomes a serious political platform . At the same time pro-EU sentiments grow and lead to an election cycle dominated by right-wing Western politicians . In retaliation to the election , Crimea holds it 's own internal election and votes to secede , declaring Crimea a fully autonomous republic allied with Russia . Eastern attempts at secession are more mixed , and lead to skirmishes and conflicts . Local terrorism targets Ukranian law enforcement being ported form the West to `` keep the peace '' in the Eastern oblasts . With Crimea no longer voting , the votes swing to the West . The violence in the East mostly calms , but Ukrainian national identity is deeply wounded . Unlikely scenario , but I reached to make it happen . EDIT : _succeed - & gt ; secede_ EDIT2 : I did n't mention Russian and European interference , which would almost certainly play a role , or the role of the oligarchs in the political process .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

It has been complained about and there have been problems with this before , usually by experts , but reform has n't ever gotten public momentum . The NSA should change its policy for several reasons . One of them mentioned in the petition ( which by the way had an 800 character limit ) is that the release of these theorems and algorithms benefits academia and industry . Another argument is that broad classification is *bad* for national security . Those for which an application has not been found are especially ripe for exploration in the open sphere - and the argument that they should all be automatically labelled dangerous until proven harmless is itself dangerous . Duplicate discoveries by the agencies of other governments , also kept secret , may put our government and industry at risk for cryptographic attack . Transparency on cryptographic vulnerabilities ultimately leads to higher security . Another argument is that the NSA is losing some potential talent because there is no guarantee of recognition outside the agency . That 's not everything , and there are compelling arguments from the other side . But it is my ultimate belief that some moderate change in policy is good for national security , industry , and the scientific endeavour , and that it currently is n't on the agenda because the public does n't think about these issues very much and math does n't tend to capture the public imagination often more than anything else .",Balto-Slavic,Czech

2ntle,travel,"Some Croatia advice . The weather is usually nice in May but either way a week is enough to check out big ( ger ) cities and wonder a bit off the beaten path . Note that my suggestions could differ a bit from any other you may get here . That 's because May is still kinda 'off-season ' in Croatia so I took that into consideration . Seeing that you 're coming in from Italy and continuing on to Hungary , my suggested itinerary would look something like : * Istria ( Pula , Rovinj ) - cultural sightseeing . One day for both but if you 're stretched you can scrape Rovinj . It 's a nice quaint town but I found it as a unwind and relax kind of place , plus it could be dead in May so skip it if you do n't have the time . Pula is worth a visit , if only for the ancient Roman amphitheater . * Plitvice Lakes National Park - kick ass NP , basically the most universal suggestion ( besides Dubrovnik ) that anyone will give you about visiting Croatia * Zadar - a day or two . You might even come here before visiting Plitvice and using it as a base of sorts . Kornati NP is also nearby so check out if you find it worth visiting . Also Krka NP is en route when you continue down south so if that nature stuff floats your boat give it a shot . * Split - two to three days . Seeing that it 's May Split will be the liveliest city on the coast . Use the time for sightseeing and getting shitfaced . Split is also a bus and ferry hub for that part of the country so it 's convenient for island hopping and taking day trips to nearby places ( e.g . Trogir for culture/sightseeing or Omiš for whitewater rafting/rock climbing/paragliding ) . Island ( and town ) of Hvar is also advised . It 's famous for it 's nightlife but it could be dead in May . However it warrants at least a day visit . * Dubrovnik - two days . The most popular town on the coast . King 's Landing from GoT , yadda yadda , anyways you 'll want to visit . If you can squeeze it in ( ha ) go for a day trip to Mostar ( Bosnia ) . * Zagreb - two days . It 's worth a visit and on your way to Budapest so win-win . If you have any other questions about this part of the trip let me know . Also , HMU if you want to grab a beer when you get to Split .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

I know , food has to be bought regularly , the majority of people won\\'t wait to the end of the day , and a lot of the food is just thrown away , and I can see it working it many places ( mostly in cities where homeless live ) but I fear that forcing it on everyone might allow others to profit from it and resell the food , or just for consumers to delay buying food ( at least to some extent ) . And as the article says , the main food-throwawayers are the consumers , at 67 % of food binned . So I think the solution is to educate the masses and not to force legislation on the supermarkets .

Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ?

Edit : Oh , and a final thing . As has been pointed out in the post I was responding to , in a number of places those evil islamists won and got into power , at least for a while .

5thKeetle,europe,"& gt ; Let\\ 's face it the \ '' eastern block\ '' was set up for failure to begin with comprising less than 30 % of GGDP and lacking good options in trade.\\n\\nThe eastern block was a command economy with a political system made up of party cadres . It could ensure modernisation and economic growth so long as the command bit understands it\\ 's necessity but no more than that . That\\ 's why the Eastern Block fared pretty well until 1970 . If you don\\'t have free markets , the allocation of resources is most likely extremely inefficient.\\n\\nTrade is also a factor in this , however , I think the most important point here would be very poor political institutions that shaped the democracies in the region later on.\\n\\n & gt ; And captialism has usually devolved to function on the basis of a rich centre with a poor periphery . This becomes apparent on a global scale , but also if you look at a regional level , with GB probably being the best example.\\n\\nDon\\'t know about this one , maybe I would need to do some reading on it . I think this is not necessarily a product of capitalism but rather the result of the globalisation . Since the location of the resources is no longer relevant and advanced countries try not to rely on resource production , there is nothing to prevent capital and labour from accumulating in one location . Think of it as adjacency boon : D.\\n\\n & gt ; with few ressources , less possibilities for agriculture , more difficult climate and less options for efficient trade\\n\\nNowadays the most important resource is the population and the more open market and democratic a country is , the better it uses it\\ 's most important resource.\\n\\nThe issue with clientelistic systems is that they both prevent the free market from operating efficiently due to creating rents and market failures and also prevent democratic institutions from properly functioning due to clientelistic relations taking priority over meritocracy .",Balto-Slavic,Lithuanian

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Trying to counter point this : Despite having a lackluster season , 25 matches without losing is a feat in itself IMO . If we did n't have to struggle with injuries , and especially not having Zlatan completly out in one of the more important stages of the season , I 'm sure we would finish top 4 . We are obviously still a step below Chelsea/Tottenham this season , but I think we was fairly hanging on with Liverpool/City . We already had one of the best defense in the league , and with building on the team into the next season , we could probably get a top 4 finish fairly comfortable . Maybe , if the window was amazing enough and all buys fit in perfectly , we could go for a title challenge . Mourinho know how to win a league , and the team got the defense to do so , and with the right buys going forward , the team looked capable . However , obviously would need to improve in many areas and especially against top 6 . Is the team a decade away from winning ? Who knows . The best in the league are always so good . Transfer windows gets harder and more important , but all buys last windows turned out fairly good . & gt ; Throwing money at stars without having the right balance in the squad wo n't get you anywhere Also , what the fuck does this mean , because as I said , the buys were all fine , the team got great defense and just lacked finishing this season . I understand the point of view , but you are just writing stuff that is repeated again and again about teams that do n't perform . Right balance ? ? ? Liverpool finished 2 points away from the title some years ago with having 50 goals let in . Chelsea won it a couple years ago scoring only 73 goals . Chelsea this year had a balance and just performed every week , maybe due to not having to be concerned about European football ? How todays game work , it 's impossible to say how even next season is going to be . & gt ; And missing that many chances is n't bad luck but actual lack of quality .

Moreover speaking English Englishly but not having a masters in English or Teaching is not a highly valued marketable skill in most of Europe.\\n\\nBottom line , as an immigrant with imperfect language and with skills which are not closely aligned with local business , I believe it is going to be hard to find a well-paying job outside of certain industries and positions ( like marketing in the semiconductor industry ) . \\n\\nSo those are the reasons why I think that most folks who are under educated and not not fluent in a few European languages need to prepare themselves to return to university for some time to get the skills that are needed in their new place of residence . If you have recent college experience in the U.S. it will probably transfer to most Universities in Europe ... so I don\\'t think you are looking at 6-8 years of work as I am.\\n\\n\\nI think that there is a very , very real possibility that much of Europe will slide into recession for 2012 .

Anergos,europe,"& gt ; No , it wasnt . Germany was controlled by the allied forces for a significant amount of time , with the allied forces basically being able to pull the plug on the German government for a while afterwards if need be . Nobody gave Germany a bunch of money and told them to just do what they thought was best with it.\\n\\nGermany\\ 's debt repayment was tied to their exports . That gave incentives to creditors to buy German goods.\\n\\nCompare it to tying Greek Debt repayment to growth . That will give incentives to creditors to invest in Greek growth . That\\ 's pretty similar in my books.\\n\\nI will not delve into how German govt hands were tied compared to the Greek situation now . Suffice to say Greece needs approval for every economic measure they pass through parliament and there is no fear of Greece becoming an aggressor country.\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Greece is still a democracy , and regardless of how this thing goes , actual meaningful change that gets Greece to becoming a country capable of actually sustaining itself is going to mean a lot of hardships for the population , more than there are now . Its not unreasonable to believe that the Greek people might not be willing to do that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you mean by more ? You don\\'t seem to grasp the situation in Greece right now . There is no more . That\\ 's why Syriza was elected . 25 % unemployment , 40 % of populace below poverty line , salaries taking a 30-45 % dive but price of goods remain the same , what more ? Increase unemployment ? How\\ 's Greece going to make money for the payments ? Decrease salaries ? How are Greek people going to buy food and medicines ? Do you see Lidl or any other exporter rushing to drop prices on their primary goods in Greece ? \\n\\n & gt ; Because the claim has no legal value , and Greecce knows it . Otherwise they would have taken it to court . The issue is that you dont throw what you know to be a bogus claim into someones face while also effectively asking for donations . Greece is ultimately reliant on goodwill from other nations , and theyre doing a stunning job at pissing it away.\\n\\nHow exactly are you sure that it has no legal value ? Are you expert in international law and have examined the Greek documents ? Up until they actually put those documents under examination by experts , no one can tell , not me , not you.\\n\\nAnd what donations are you talking about ? Who\\ 's giving Greece free money ? IMF ? 30 billion loan over 5 years netted a healthy 2billion profit , I wouldn\\'t call that a donation . No one is giving \ '' free money\ '' .\\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; Im pretty confident they could , its not an impossible thing to do like you make it seem . The reason they dont is because its much more reasonable not to do so , so long as you can afford it . Greece cant afford it though , because they simply have too much debt , so their total deficit is too high if they dont manage to run a pretty high primary surplus.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a single economist that says it\\ 's doable . I mean , your country , the epitome of austerity , with the lowest unemployment in EU , in a top economic shape and with excellent efficiency , reached a 3 % surplus ONCE from 1995 . You expect a country with 25 % unemployment to sustain itself for that long a period of time with 4.5 % ? Let\\ 's be reasonable now ... \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Greece hasnt \ '' followed a program\ '' . Greece has been given parameters they would be required to meet in order to receive financial help . Greece has failed and keeps failing to meet them . That doesnt automatically mean that the standards are \ '' unrealistic\ '' , considering that Greece has not managed to actually nail down its tax evasion problem in that timeframe , for example.\\n\\nIt\\ 's not a program ? Well EC thinks it is . Why would they name it [ \ '' Economic Adjustment Programme\ '' ] ( http : //ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2014/op192_en.htm ) . But let us not stick to word definitions.\\n\\nGreece has failed ?

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"I advise you to look for books written by people who actually believed in this religion , and wrote them at a time where books where not easy to made and were n't massively produced , which made people to write because they trully wanted to express things , and not for money . Now , unfortunately , there is n't a single book encompassing the whole of this religion , like the Bible or the Koran of Christianity and Islam . Mostly , books written on Hellenism are each covering only a single subject . And if that was n't enough , many myths are symbolic and allegoric , having alterEnglish meanings and needing interpretation , which leads someone who is trully interested to learn on what these ancient people trully believed , to have to face a mountain of pages . Now there are three kinds of books that are religion-related from ancient Greece . One of these types are stories that are read like common fables , the other is works of philosophy and theological explanation , more like essays , and finally there are books that contain methods of divination and practices . Of the first type of books , the 'story like ' ones , most popular are works like : Hesiod - Theogony Hesiod - Works and Days Homer - Iliad Homer - Oddysey Aesop - Fables Of the second type of books , which describe in a 'serious ' manner religious and spiritual subjects are : Most of Plato 's works Aristotle - Metaphysics Proclus - Everything from him Finally , some known works that contain divination practices are : Iamblichus - On the mysteries Diagoras - On the Initiation to the Eleusian Mysteries Orpheus - Lithika What I understand from your post , is that you are looking for a book that contains story-like material , and tries to be as inclusive a single book can get .

This Egyptian city , an ancient town near Delphi , the island of Samothrace , the island of Thera ... Thing is Greece and to an extent Egypt and Lybia , are sitting right at the point where the European and the African tectonic plates collide . At the edges of two tectonic plates of the Earth . And not only that , but the area of the Aegean Sea , and the peninsula of Greece and Balkans to an extent were formed too late . The whole land that is in this area today was under the water and rose up way after the dinosaurs . Which is also why you wo n't find dinosaurs there , but in the highest peaks of Greek mountains you will discover fossils of fish . Greece became a land through extremely violent ( Cataclysmic ) geological events like mega-earthquakes and mega-volcanoes . And this kind of geological activity kept going on until the time people had learn how to write and record history . What 's my point with all of this ? That the ancient Greeks and Mediterranean people in general , lived through a series of multiple catastrophic events like the submersion or surfacing of whole islands in just a few hours . Thera , Samothrace ... It was a usual thing to see whole parts of land exist one day and not in the other . And do n't forget a detail we read on Plato 's book , about what the Egyptian wise man tells to Solon : That there had been many deluges , each one making a genocide on Greeks , which made the remaining Greeks left have to start advancing the civilization all over again . He says for that reason Greeks were oblivious to their own history , but that the Egyptians knew of it all , because the deluges did n't affected them as badly . And it is an Egyptian who tells to Solon of the story of Atlantis . Greeks did n't knew of that event . So the point is , that since in this area cataclysmic phenomena where so usual , and since real history and science have proved that whole islands can be submerged or surface from the sea in short time , it is quite plausible that once there could really exist an island named Atlantis . Of course scientists will tell you its a myth , because the Egyptian priest says that the Atlantis event happened so many several thousands of years before what science believes was the point where humans became civilized and started building cities etc . Is the history of humans older than what today 's scientists think ? Or is it an over-exaggeration of the priest ? Or could the whole story be fake ? Well the fact is that it is possible for pieces of land to be submerged , and that it happened several times in Earth 's history . The part of the story questioned is the time that the event is said to happen . The missing evidence to prove the story real , is Atlantis itself .",Greek,Greek

ACircledSquare,linuxadmin,"Can you please correct any miss understanding I may have for ZFS and GlusterFS ? Two identical servers with twi drives partitioned with ZFS . We use ZFS because ZFS is a good substitute for LVM , it also incorporates a form if its own version of RAID . But we want to take it a step further and user GlusterFS . We want to do this so we can offer the ZFS drives over the network and but also because we want replication of data in case of a major failure . This way if Server1 is completely destroyed , we can default to Server2 and still have access to the same data stored in the ZFS volumes . And here are my questions , conclusions . - ZFS offers a huge degree of scalability . By adding glusterfs we ensure redundant drives available across the network . - GlusterFS is NOT a filesystem ( like NFS , ext4 etc ) are . It is technology that offers redundancy . - GlusterFS is not to be confused with NFS , even though they are similarities . NFS is a filesystem that is available across the network ( similar as a Samba share ) . It is that and nothing else . On the other hand GlusterFS offers whatever filesystem you want to share ( can be ext4 , ext3 , btrfs ) across the network and it also allows for a huge degree of redundancy .

This has , in my limited personal experience , also been very true . It\\ 's impossible to arrest a Roma without him filing a report for police brutality . Attempts to enforce laws and periodic checks on their communities , particularly about child welfare laws , have also met with strong resistance on the grounds of the state interfering with their cultural traditions and identity . \\n\\nThat\\ 's all anecdotal , of course , not some statistical report .

Alithinos,AskHistorians,"The Greek name for Greece is Hellas , which is composite from Helios and Laas , which would translate as 'Sunland ' . At the ancient times , Greeks would call 'Sunland ' the region around mountain Parnassus , which was considered to be the mountain of god Apollo , god of the Sun , and lies in about the middle of modern Greece . ( See how the land of the Sun is related with the God of the Sun ) ? The Greeks also considered themselves to be descendants of Deucalion and Pyrra , who according to the myth , after a worldwide flood , their ark landed on mount Parnassus . So the myth says that these two stayed there and had children , and thus Hellenes ( how Greeks called each other ) also means `` Sunlandfolk '' , as ( according to the myth ) they were children of this couple , born at Parnassus . By the time of Alexander the Great , Greece could be considered in a way his empire . Greece as in that it was ruled by Greeks . After Alexander and before the Roman Empire , there were 3 Greek kingdoms , one that consisted of modern Greece and parts of Anatolia , another that included Egypt and the Middle East ( Syria , Israel , Lebanon , etc.. ) and one from Persia to India . During the Roman times , Greeks identified as Greek Romans , and during the Byzantine times , Greeks just called themselves Romans . When the Ottomans invaded , they called Greeks 'Rum ' , from the word Roman . The Byzantine Empire had already been weakened though by a number of other invaders like the Crusaders . During the Ottoman era , the area at the south of Wallachia , was called 'Rumilia ' , meaning 'Roman Land ' .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,Archaeology,"It is very usual in Greece to discover objects from the antiquity whenever someone starts digging at a piece of land . One of the interesting discoveries of the last decade was the remains of an ancient house in the town of Thebes , which had something rather special : Archaeologists discovered multiple objects , sharing a common inscription : `` Property of Hercules '' . The house itself , according to the inscriptions belonged to Hercules . The same Hercules who is said to have done the 12 labors . This discovery is special , but confusing at the same time . The line between history and mythology becomes quite blurry . How can there be a house that is property of Hercules , if Hercules never existed ?

This happens in Modern Greek quite often . \\n* History : Have to learn by heart a large portion of the textbook .

It\\ 's lack of time , as teachers are given something like 2-4 hours/week for some of the above courses , whereas \u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 can do twice the number of hours .

He was able to prevent stalling and maintain control due to the lift generated by the large horizontal surface area of the fuselage , the stabilators , and remaining wing areas . The F-15 landed at twice the normal speed to maintain the necessary descent and its tailhook was torn off during the landing . Zivi managed to bring his F-15 to a stop approximately 20 ft ( 6 m ) from the end of the runway . He was later quoted as saying \ '' It\\ 's highly likely that if I would have seen it clearly , I would have ejected ... \ '' ; leaking fuel along the wing had obstructed visibility of the wing itself . The aircraft was repaired and saw further combat service.\\n [ sauce ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle # Notable_accidents )",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"Hi . Personally I 'm not really active when it comes to offerings , ceremonies etc . I 'm more of a Pythagorian kind of guy , and among us the concept of 'Excellence ' has a special importance . Simply put this concept is the idea of improving ourselves to perfection , to become more like the gods . So that constitutes of constant improvement of one 's self : improvement of our physical bodies , mind , character ... What does that mean in day to day life ? Well one thing is I have decided to exercise my body every so often . ( In the path of perfecting my body ) . I was too obese in the past , now I 'm considered 'average ' . I also spend time learning new stuff , in the path of leading my mind do perfection . ( stuff like solving problems eg math , geometry , programming do work ) . And finally I also try to be a good person . Every once in a while I might go at a local public event like the Dioynisus march https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=7AxQGP96CXw but I 'm lucky when it comes to events like this because I live in Athens , Greece and there are a few teams of people organizing events like it .

Divide-By-Zero88,europe,"& gt ; International Law ? You guys cared about that ? Last time I spoke about Cyprus with Greeks here and said Turkey acted based on Treaty of Zurich which was recognized by the international committee , you guys told me British Empire is imperialist anyway , and that was an imperialist move of them to recognize it anyway . It\\ 's like when it works for you , you care about what International Law says , and when not , you don\\'t.\\n\\nI am confused .

CharMack90,europe,"It was also incredibly unfair.\\n\\n- The amount of Greeks who had to relocate from the new Turkish Republic to the Kingdom of Greece were almost three times as many as the Turks leaving Greece for Turkey.\\n\\n- Most Turks were notified much earlier and were allowed to pack up many of their belongings with them , whereas most Greeks had to leave on short notice and , in most cases , weren\\'t allowed to have any baggages with them ( my great-grandma left Trabzon on a boat with her family having only a picture of a saint hidden in her bosom ) .\\n\\n- The way the Turkish officials and public treated the Greeks was nothing short of inhumane . While forced to leave their homeland , they were piled up in boats , forced to walk long distances and locked up in entry/exit points ( like the infamous Selimiye Barracks ) where they were stripped naked , stolen of every little possession they could bring with them and hosed down with cold water to \ '' clean them\ '' and make sure they had no diseases ( even though -I repeat- they were *leaving* Turkey ) . Hundreds died of things like cholera or smallpox that they caught while detained inside the barracks . Eye-witnesses have even spoken of beatings , rapes , and affluent childless turkish families stealing newborn babies from mothers locked in the barracks waiting to be deported . My great-grandma had two of her sisters die of pneumonia in there . They weren\\'t even allowed to bury them ; just threw them in the sea.\\n\\n- Finally , the way Turkey treated the remaining Greeks ( as agreed upon in the Treaty of Lausanne ) was a direct violation of the treaty itself . Things like the [ Varl\u0131k Vergisi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varl % C4 % B1k_Vergisi ) and the staged [ September events ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom ) drove ethnic Greeks out of the country and dropped the population of Greeks in modern Turkey in the low thousands.\\n\\nThese are things that most Turks don\\'t even now about and the government isn\\'t planning to let them know any time soon .

Alithinos,ELINT,"While today I believe on something , there had been a time that I was n't a believer . I was born and raised a Christian . Unlike most Christians , who just say they are Christians and perhaps follow some festivals , I decided to read the bible . What I discovered was that the bible has so many contradictions that it could n't been taken seriously . The Old Testament contradicts the New Testament , the gospels of the New Testament contradict each other , and what I 've been promised from Christianity was n't happening . I was promised the power to move mountains if I believed in it , and I could n't . I was promised that if I prayed God would do me the favor I 'd ask , and God did n't did anything . Another thing I disliked was that I realised that among many 'priests ' there were people who secretly did n't even believed the religion , and just became priests because priests are paid good salaries . Religion has been hijacked by wealth lovers . People are doing and preaching things without believing on them , but for money and fame . That disgusted me and sent me away from the Church . While I have sympathy for Jesus , and I 'm sorry for what happened to him , and I consider him a good person , those who after his death claimed to be the teachers of his word , were corrupted and distorted things for their personal interests . So I stopped going to the church and considering myself a 'Christian ' , because if I called myself with that name , I would place myself along with all the others who have been doing such and such things , and I would be embarassed for that . On my journey to the truth , I read a few things about Islam , your religion . Please excuse me for what I am about to say , but to me it seems that Mohamed was just a man with thirst for power who presented himself as a prophet , only to convince other people join his battle , so he can win the wars , and gain personal wealth and fame . I 've read about Buddism , and while many of the things it says seem nice to me and good , I think it lacks many things , and leaves many things ananswered . I 've took a look on Hinduism , and I was alienated and scared by the images of some deities they have . Then I started reading about the ancient religions with the many gods . Greek , Persian , Arabic , Chaldean , Egyptian ... And I felt that they had more to tell me . Particularly the Chaldean and Greek . Today most books in schools and even documentaries on TV give a rather simplistic view on these religions and often lie about them , to make them look bad . But if one starts read about them from ancient sources , I believe he will get a better and more clear view that will surprise him . It is as if you always believed something inside you , you always had an idea or feeling or concept of how something is , but it was n't what the religion you 've been grown with was . And that made you feel that you are somehow 'wrong ' , and deviate , that you are not a good human because you have something inside you telling you what is good , and what the people around you tell you is that this is your mistake . And perhaps you might believe you are mistaken . You might believe what they tell you , that even if you follow the strictest code of the religion , you are still bad because something inside you does n't fit what the religion you are grown up with says , so that makes you personally feel bad , as if you are a bad person . But what happens if by chance or out of curiosity you pick one of the ancient books , that modern people say are myths and lies , and you discover in them that they talk about the exact same thing that you somehow knew and believed secretly with your thoughts , the same thing the others told you that is a mistake you done ? Then you start seeing why they 've been telling what they are telling , and how our world became what it is . Because lets speak the truth : Both Christianity and Islam were spread with the sword . Christianity had Constantine , and Theodosius and others doing wars , killing people , and forcing christianity , through the Roman Empires . Islam had Mohammed and Mehmed 2 ' spreading Islam with swords through the Arabic and Ottoman Empires . Call me however you want , but in my opinion I think that a God who is trying to get worshipped by killing whoever is not worshipping him , and starts wars , and tells his children to kill each other is n't a good and just God . The God I believe in is a God that if you worship him it will make him happy , but if you do n't , then he wo n't care . Not because he does n't care for humans , but because he has too many and far more serious and important things to care for . Have a nice day .",Greek,Greek

Still , Greece has voted everything that was asked of it so far has it not ? My question is , what\\ 's the point ? Everyone can see that the debt is not sustainable but Germany ( more precicely Schauble ) keeps insisting on more reformation which result in more debts wich combined in turn result to Greece being in a worse shape , people having even lower wages and more inability to pay so the market is frozen , more businesses close and on top of that , the debt is even bigger cause we take loans for older debts .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Alright , so ? Nobody has a right to life . Your only right is to not be *killed* by others ( unless it 's self-defense ) , but you do not have a right to be kept *alive* . Healthcare is exactly like any other good , in that someone has to provide it : nobody has a right to be fed , clothed , given water or medicine , including vaccines . Consider the alterEnglish . Should be kill farmers who refuse to share their product with the poor ? How about doctors , should they be held at gunpoint until they provide medical care ? Are you seriously going to advocate for **slavery** ? Of course , humans are social creatures , so we will help each-other when given a choice , but voluntary assistance and support has nothing to do with rights . And the only reason vaccines are expensive is because the government is both making it excessively complex to develop them ( just the regulatory hoops that pharmaceutical companies have to jump through to get to human trials are insane ) and by directly subsidizing the cost and warping the market . You ask what would happen to a vaccine that cost $ 1000 . Lets take that to the extreme : what if a vaccine costs $ 1,000,000 ? What about $ 1,000,000,000 ? Should all be forced to pay a billion dollars so other people can be vaccinated ? And what of the benefit : vaccines are not 100 % effective . Should we all be forced , at gunpoint , to pay a billion dollars for a vaccine with a 50 % success rate ? What about a 1 % success rate ? The answer is clearly no . Utilitarian thought on this ( and every ) subject will inevitably fail , as it can not precisely calculate the cost of a human life in any morally acceptable way . Value is subjective , and that includes the value of life . In the end , the market will determine the equilibrium price : if a vaccine is too expensive , then it wo n't be used , and cheaper replacements will pop up . If , in a hypothetical scenario where the price bottleneck is manufacturing , it truly costs a million dollars to produce a dose of a vaccine , then it simply wo n't be used . Death happens . We can either bury our head in the sand and keep screaming that diseases are oppressing us , or realize that even in a perfect society , you ca n't improve everyone 's life .

So one step would be to clear to people 's mind what we refer to when we talk about female supremacy , and how it is different from this fetish and porn genre . 2 ) Get rid of the hate rhetoric some use . In order to reach more people , some messages must be communicated in a more moderate fashion , and really hate wo n't let the idea go far along , and it would be a shame because the idea has potential . Humans in general react negative and form negative views the moment they see hate speech . And truly , recognizing a reality has nothing to do with hate . But then a question arises : Do we say that women are superior of men as a reaction that takes birth from hate towards men , or are because we have realized that this is just the truth ? 3 ) Stop using easily proven false pseudo-science and false scientific facts . That does more harm than good , because the moment one sees a lie on something , her or his whole idea about that something instantly gets worse and that something looses credibility by that . I say this because I see a lot of such arguments being made on texts I have read online defending femsup . So if we really want to bring more people , we should use arguments that ca n't be proven false . If we manage to execute and complete these 3 steps , we should then have reached our first milestone , and have made the field ready for phase 2 . The goal of the first phase should be to clear up misconceptions , to build a friendly and welcoming profile , and to be able to defend positions with strong and serious arguments . It 's too early yet to talk about the next phases . If we really want this to happen , we should focus on phase 1 , until we complete it .",Greek,Greek

First the tax rates rose up , leading to increased shelf prices that made Greek products uncompetitive , which in turn decreased demand . Then the haircut happened , which made investors to be afraid of buying Greek bonds . Then layoffs and salary reduction in the public sector happened , that resulted in less money circulating on the local market , deepening the economic depression . And well , last thing that happened was the sanctions that cut Greece\\ 's exports in half , even further deepening the economic depression.\\n\\n\\nThink of a moment of the fact , that for the last 5-6 years the only kind of news we\\ 've been hearing about Greece\\ 's economy is bad news .

Alithinos,HellenicPolytheism,"This is a literal translation of the modern Hellenic poem 'Εγώ ο Ηνίοχος ' , ( I the Charioter ) written by Radamanthys Anastasakis . Note that the word 'Charioter ' is used by Plato to personify one of the three parts of the Soul . `` Kept deep in its embrace this soil held me immortal Until Intellect and hands of mortal loved ones , picked me up to the light . Brightful day . I breathe , I listen , I wonder . Woe , everything is lost . Altars , hearths , Name . And as I only held reins on my hand , they called me Charioter . I the Charioter , victor on the stadiums of the noble Struggles , birthed by the more than perfect marriage of this virgin land , Hellas , with the more than perfect Intellect , call it Aether or Reasoning . I the Charioter stay forever contemplative , and godful worshiper of my birth givers . I fought tirelessly , and I fight until the redemption of every Soul of Love and every land of worthy , and beautiful humans , mortals , who will live free , breathing Justice , Beuaty , Love . Oh benevolant , universal , Hellenic Soul ! Incorruptible seed of high reasoning , noble passions , unsleeping contemplates , for the nice , the true , the good . I stand on the immortal soil of Hellas , indestructible , in the passage of aeons . I the Charioter , that had been ravaged for so many aeons , now smoothly rise , to find myself leaning to your Soul , which leans to me . Leaning the same way , we both reached inwards . Eeeh ! I want you to live eternally ! Feeding forever all of your senses with essences that spring from the Divine . I see Apollo being my guard , blessing this will of mine that I have for you . I the Charioter , I know , Yes I am telling you , I know and believe it deeply . The Gods and their sacreds are alive ! Fire still burns . The sacred water of the Oracle still lights up . And the laurel steams to the deeps of my Soul , your Soul , and of all the true Hellenists , that moved by the forever flowing waters of the bay of the Phaedriads , return godful to the eternal past , to live the same way eternally the present , and thrice eternally the veil of Life . Do n't be afraid chosen Soul , do n't be afraid of pain , suck pleasurably the essence of Love , and your taste , as also the whole gigantic sphere of your existence will be flooded by the transcendent seed of joy , which is hidden deeply in pain.Do n't be afraid undestructible Soul . Learn yourself and you will feel each day a bit , each day more , each day even abundantly riches of colors , thrill vibrations , each day excessive ecstasis to get inside the vastness of your depths , the magic of the perfect pleasures of Love to the Greek Gods , Heroes , philosophers , and our unique ancestors . Just reward of noble struggles . I the Charioter , submerging onto you the look of my unsleeping eyes , see the glows of your Soul , I follow the steps of your contemplation , the curves of your feelings , as you begun as then -Do you remember ? - to shower at the Holy waters of the Castalia spring . I am happy for your cleansing . I rejoice for your consecration . I the Charioter , am happy as your Soul devotionally caresses me . Apollo , how much I 'm happy for the blinking of its eyes , just reward to old struggles . Thank you ! From Apollo 's heart to the Sun of your Heart .

The word 'pagan ' is the word 'peasant ' in the language the Romans spoke , and it was a demeaning word they used against people who did n't worshipped YHVH . That practically means that any person in about most of Europe , the northest parts of Africa , and the westernmost parts of Asia that was n't worshipping YHVH , was called 'pagan ' . 'Pagan ' also means 'lake ' in Greek , so some connect the english word with the Greek that sounds exactly the same , and say that paganism has to do with worshipping lakes ( or at the lakes ) , and more generally nature ( or at nature ) .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"I think we can agree to define theft as 'the act of taking a person 's property without their consent ' . Therefore , the question becomes whether the money the government takes as tax is 'my ' property , or more accurately , if it is its own property . If it is not , then the act of taking it without my consent is obviously theft . Lets examine how property can be acquired . I think we will both agree that what I produce , I own . If I make an axe , it belongs to me , because it is through my labor that the raw resources were transformed into a usable tool . I can also give that axe to whoever I want , because it is my property , and I can ask for something else in advance . The other party is not obligated to accept that offer . So we have two modes of procurement : 1 ) Production ( or homesteading for land , which is the same : an unowned , raw resource is transformed into usable property through a man 's labor ) 2 ) Voluntary Trade Unless you can offer some third mode of property procurement , there is no other legitimate method of acquiring property . Has the government produced the products of my labor ? Of course not . Has it voluntarily traded for it ? Of course not . It may be offering services in return , but I never agreed to it . Since it has neither produced my property , nor has it traded for it voluntarily , it can not have a legitimate claim on it . Therefore to take it is theft .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"**Full post for those without an economist subscription** : \\n\\nWHAT a difference a month makes . On the night of September 4th Angela Merkel made the most dramatic decision of her decade as German chancellor : to suspend European asylum rules and allow tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary to enter Germany via Austria . It was a moral gesture that fitted the mood of the moment . As The Economist went to press , Mrs Merkel was considered a favourite to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\\n\\nIn Germany , however , that altruistic embrace has caused a backlash that could weaken a chancellor so far considered all but invincible . Using uncharacteristically missionary language , Mrs Merkel said repeatedly that the right to asylum has \u201cno upper limit\u201d . But Joachim Gauck , who as president is expected to keep out of workaday politics , responded that \u201cour reception capacity is limited even when it has not yet been worked out where these limits lie.\u201d As though on cue , the political tone turned against Mrs Merkel . \\n\\nThe numbers are dramatic . More than 200,000 migrants are believed to have arrived in Germany in September alone . For the year , official forecasts had already risen in August from 450,000 to 800,000 . This week Bild , Germany\u2019s largest tabloid , cited estimates that the number could reach 1.5m\u2014equivalent to the population of Munich . New refugees keep pouring in , and those granted asylum have the right to bring family later . No end is in sight.\\n\\nProcessing centres exceeded capacity weeks ago . Local authorities are struggling to find housing , since temporary tent cities will not suffice in winter . The government of Hamburg has begun seizing empty office buildings to house refugees , raising constitutional questions . Berlin and Bremen are considering similar measures . Schools are struggling to integrate refugee children who speak no German.\\n\\nFights have broken out inside overcrowded asylum centres , often between young men of different ethnic or religious groups . There have been more arson attacks on migrant centres . In Dresden , a xenophobic movement called Pegida is growing again : about 9,000 protested this Monday against refugees.\\n\\nMainstream society is tolerant but edgy . In a survey by German public television 51 % of Germans say that they fear the refugee influx , 13 points more than in September . Approval of Mrs Merkel dropped by 9 points to her lowest level since 2011 ( though it is still a respectable 54 % ) . In two other polls Mrs Merkel slid from Germany\u2019s most popular politician to fourth.\\n\\nThe fiercest criticism of Mrs Merkel comes from within her own conservative bloc\u2014the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , which she leads , and the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) , which exists only in Bavaria and usually supports her . Horst Seehofer , the CSU\u2019s boss and premier of Bavaria , called Mrs Merkel\u2019s decision \u201ca mistake that will keep us occupied for a long time\u201d . In one meeting he threatened half-seriously to drop off busloads of refugees at the federal parliament in Berlin.\\n\\nGerda Hasselfeldt , a CSU parliamentary leader , wants to erect transit zones along Germany\u2019s borders like those in airports . Markus S\u00f6der , Bavaria\u2019s finance minister , has called for a fence . A group of Christian Democrats calling itself the \u201csecurity club\u201d debated closing Germany\u2019s borders to refugees entirely . Another group has written a letter to Mrs Merkel charging that her refugee policy breaks the law.\\n\\nIn response Mrs Merkel\u2019s government is scrambling to make changes . It has passed legislation that cuts pocket money to refugees , currently \u20ac143 ( $ 160 ) a month , and replaces it with vouchers . More police and administrators are being hired . All Balkan countries have been declared \u201csafe\u201d so that their asylum applicants can be rejected and deported faster . On October 6th Mrs Merkel took charge of co-ordinating refugee policy , in effect demoting the interior minister , Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re.\\n\\nNone of this , however , will reduce the numbers of Syrians , Iraqis and Afghans who are fleeing war . Nor will last month\u2019s agreement by the European Union to allocate 120,000 refugees among member states . Mrs Merkel had lobbied fiercely for it , but the compromise will barely dent Germany\u2019s refugee numbers.\\n\\nShe is now concentrating her effort on getting Turkey , whence most refugees cross into the EU , to intercept and keep more migrants . But Turkey already hosts more than 2m . It will demand concessions such as easing visa restrictions for Turks entering the EU . It will also expect Germany to tone down criticism of Turkish crackdowns on the press and on Kurdish separatists . It may ask for German help to create a buffer zone in Syria.\\n\\nMeanwhile , Germans have begun to feel that the refugee crisis could change Germany even more than reunification did 25 years ago . Back then the task was to let that which belongs together grow together , as Willy Brandt , a former chancellor , famously said . Speaking on October 3rd , the anniversary of unification , Mr Gauck\u2014like Mrs Merkel a former East German\u2014said that today\u2019s challenge is greater because \u201cwhat should now grow together has so far not belonged together.\u201d Germans worry whether Muslim refugees will accept German norms of sexual equality , secularism and Germany\u2019s special responsibility towards Israel and Jews.\\n\\nThe backlash does not yet threaten Mrs Merkel\u2019s hold on power . While extremist parties have become serious contenders for power in some other European countries , they remain marginal in Germany , and voters have faith that their government will restore order , says Timo Lochocki of the German Marshall Fund , a think-tank . The chancellor faces no Christian Democratic challenger . The centre-left Social Democrats are internally torn . And the leftist opposition can not attack her for a refugee policy they themselves support.\\n\\nMrs Merkel is under pressure as never before . Yet the crisis has brought out a new style of leadership in her . For years she has been accused of following public opinion rather than guiding it . Now she has found her moral calling . \u201cIf we start having to apologise for showing a friendly face in emergencies , \u201d she says defiantly , \u201cthen this is not my country.\u201d",Greek,Greek

I mean if the couple likes such activities , sure go on and have fun ! But how is it empowering women to fuck a man with a plastic penis ? That is attributing power to the penis , something that the woman lacks , so subconsciously that would n't empower a woman , but make her feel less powerful because she does n't have a real one .

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"I seperate Jesus and his teachings from people who lived after Jesus and added their own sauce . I do n't follow whatever priests of the church said or might say , but I follow what JESUS said . Eventually , at the age of Late Antquity , many Christian priests were corrupted , because of the benefits that the Roman Empire offered to clergy of religions . The Roman state paid salaries to priests of recognized religions , and was building temples with public expenses . So some corrupted people , who had made their jobs to be priests , started seeing other religions as threats to their income . `` If the other religion becomes more popular we lose believers , and if nobody comes to the Church , the state will stop paying me my salary '' . Many who called themselves `` Christians '' did things against the teaching of Jesus , while at the same time they were saying they were doing these things in the name of Jesus . But they were hypocrits . We should n't condemn Jesus because of the defamation from some people that used him for their own , petty interests . Personally I come from Greece , where you can still see the rage of the angry 'Christian ' mobs against the pagan world , in all the ruined temples , like the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens : http : //www.mlahanas.de/Greece/Cities/Gouvas/ZeusTempleAthens1.jpg I recognize what you talk about , as I have learnt the history of this place I am living at ( Greece ) very well . Back in the late antiquity , there were militant mobs of Christians that were pretty much like today 's ISIL . They attacked pagans and destroyed their stuff . And although I believe in Jesus , I do not endorse the actions of these mobs , I believe that they sinned , went against Jesus 's rules , and even dared to throw the blaming of their sins to Him .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,rpg_gamers,"Since you say come from Zelda , I 'll recommend you these two games : The Witcher 3 The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Here is why : Personally I grew up with a N64 , and I got for it the two Zelda games that came out and loved them . And IMO they are the best Zelda games period . ( Play them if you havent ! ) When I first played Ocarina of Time I was amazed by the fresh for its age 3d graphics , and the open-worldness of the game after you leave Kokiri Village . I could go at any place of Hyrule Field I wanted ! And I thought that its world was huge . And I kept thinking of that until I played The Elder Scrolls : Oblivion . Oblivion blew me out and made me feel the same nice experience all over again . Only that with Oblivion the graphics were way better , the world way larger , the NPCs way more , the swords way more , the dungeons way more , the side quests way more ... Just everything I liked , 20,30 times more ! ! ! My perception of what I considered a 'big game world ' radically changed with Oblivion . And as for The Witcher 3 , it has a weird Majora 's Mask kind of vibe , in that its dark and has a more mature vibe . Plus you will feel more familiar playing it since you come from Zelda , because in Witcher 3 just like in Zelda you are a specific character , the game is 3rd person , and the combat needs good reflexes with timing and pressing block or attacking at the right time . Plus , you get to sail boats ! ( yay ! ) And Geralt is attracting girls as much as Link does in OoT if not more , lol . So if you are looking to get into RPGs with something that feels more familiar with what you already played , go for Witcher 3 first . But note that playing Witcher 3 has a a widespread side effect : After playing it , every other game will give you the impression that it has awful graphics .",Greek,Greek

I don\\'t know whether you\\ 're Greek or not and whether you\\ 're familiar with our politics , but the 2004-2009 government was a centre-right wing one . That government was lying about the deficit ( on the 2nd of October of 2009 , the Karamanlis administration reported a prospected deficit of 6 % of the GDP to the EU Commission and the next Government after the 04/10/09 elections , revised that to 12,5 % . That number would again be revised and finalised in 2010 , when the newly formed ELSTAT ( Hellenic Statistical Authority ) and Eurostat announced the 2009 deficit to be 15,4 % of the GDP ) and things went really out of control . So the problem was the deficit.\\n\\nHowever , the reasons that Greece had such a deficit and its causes , have yet to be recognised and accepted by the public and tackled by the bailout programs . Early retirements at 55 ( or younger for women ) in the broader public sector with pensions and benefits immeasurably ( literally ) inconsistent to what someone has paid during his working life . A 10 people job in 1980 , was a 3 people job in 2005 . No one cared to reorganize the public sector . I don\\'t know up until which point the government didn\\'t even know how many people were working in the public sector . Huge deficits in public-held companies , railways , energy , water , banks . As for the sleeping giant that is the Greek agriculture ( which undoubtedly can produce of the highest quality exportable products ) , the bulk of the money that was given by the EU throughout the years , ended up becoming 2-story houses , a couple of Mercedes E-class and lovely nights with lovely girls from the former communist countries ( also , they used to declare their crops to be many times larger than they actually were and the state didn\\'t have the means of checking that .

But Tsipras\\ ' russophilia is so well documented , he has supported Russia at his utmost and in everything , that it\\n\\nThe newspaper \ '' To Vima\ '' now has reported that Tsipras\\ ' referendum , and his disregard for all the economic havoc this would causes , was in his hopes that this would lead to Greece\\ 's leaving Euro and effectively join Russia , that he had been going to Putin and telling him about how Greece was willing to \ '' sail to new harbours\ '' ( effectively change geopolitical orientation ) . And that it Tsipras \ '' no\ '' suddenly turned to \ '' yes\ '' because Russia denied him the 10 billion loan he had been hoping for . \\n\\nThe idiot Russophile Tsipras really thought that Russia would have any reason to sustain a bankrupt Greece when Russia could have Europe sustain it instead . Why would Russia want a parasitic Greece on its back , when it can get a parasitic Greece on Europe\\ 's back ? \\n\\nThis Russophilia by Tsipras , this deliberate attempt by him to change the geopolitical orientation of the country , has directly caused the worsening of economic conditions in the past six months for Greece . \\n\\n & gt ; About the Greek Oligharchs : I don\\'t really care about them . Private entities can support anyone they want . That\\ 's why we have free economy\\n\\nCrony capitalism exists everywhere in the West , but in Greece it takes the form of supporting oligarchs connected to Russian financial interests , and sabotaging or blocking any rivals that are not connected to such . ( keep in mind that even the scandal of the German-owned Siemens deeply involved the Russia-owned *Intracom* as its partner in crime in Greece ) .\\n\\nThis isn\\'t harmless , it\\ 's corruption and destruction of the greek economy.\\n\\n & gt ; And as for Syriza , Golden Dawn , and ANEL : For what ? Ukraine ? They would on ; t criticized them if Greek people cared . Obviously , that\\ 's not the case.\\n\\nAbout ANYTHING . They\\ 've never criticized Russia about *anything* whatsoever , about any issue external or internal . Not about Ukraine , not about Georgia , not about Moldova , not about Chechnya , not about its aggressive moves against the Baltics , not about its internal oppression of dissidents or of gay people or of *anything* .",Greek,Greek

I am stupid . Please explain ? & gt ; I also think you 're lying and pretending not to have used them . There 's no way you played most of the games on the open source driver . Believe it or not , mesa/gallium3d actually works . Performance might vary , but it 's not an issue for most games I play . I 'm less capable now with Intel 's GPU , but even then I can play *almost* everything I want to . What I really , really want to play and can not is PS2 games ( pcsx2 sucks hardcore with Intel , both performance and rendering issues , I 'm told some are in Intel 's GPU hardware ) and Elite : Dangerous ( which is very GPU hungry ) . & gt ; Ugh . A playfield is a playfield is a playfield . Convenient weaseling & gt ; Yes , yes , we 're all impressed that you played with an Amiga 500 as a toddler .

Excuse me for bringing Amiga up on its 30th anniversary . & gt ; Which is sad , because back in the previous generations prior to Haswell , iGPU was substantially faster in Linux with the open source driver . Intel started taking gaming seriously and here we are . And then I went and got a Haswell ... ouch . The good news is the plan was never to use it for long ... new AMD cards were due and I wanted a chance to try Intel 's GPU . I suspect they 'll come around and adopt Gallium3d like AMD did at some point . I even recall some Intel Linux gpu driver developer that had serious doubts about Gallium3d left Intel , then implemented an ARM SoC GPU driver ( was it for the rpi ? or something else , I do n't remember ) using it as an experiment , and changed his opinion , now favoring Gallium3d . & gt ; They were common . They were on the cover of computer magazines . They were available at trade shows , they came on business cards .

333ml,lebanon,"BEIRUT : Recent media reports that there are 300,000 Syrian refugee woman currently pregnant in Lebanon has been contested by international agencies that argue the figure is not reflective of data collected since the onset of the Syrian crisis . Several local media outlets reported earlier in the week that “ out of 1.9 million Syrian refugees present in Lebanon ... there are 300,000 pregnant Syrian women that will give birth in 2017. ” The outlet did not provide a source for the information , raising questions as to its credibility . “ We ’ re not quite sure about the source used in the report , but our records show that since the beginning of the crisis in 2011 there have been a total of about 100,000 Syrian newborns in Lebanon , ” Khaled Kabbara , spokesperson for the United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , told the Daily Star . Mounia Amrani , Medical Coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres , also challenged the figure . She said such a number was impossible based upon MSF ’ s data and work with Syrian women . “ The number is exaggerated and really strange . We can expect an estimated number of about 80,000 [ pregnant women ] maximum , ” she told The Daily Star . “ The Syrian women that come to us for aid often request and use methods of family planning . So the fact that these figures are so high doesn ’ t make sense with practices we see at MSF , ” Amrani added . Minister of State for Refugee Affairs Mouin Merehbi dismissed the media reports ’ claims , saying he thought that such false information was part of an anti-Syrian refugee agenda in Lebanon . “ The maximum growth rate is maybe about 4 or 5 percent in some countries . In our region , a 3 percent increase in population is very high , ” he said . “ It ’ s not right [ to report this ] . I ’ m not sure what the purpose of this propaganda is , but it is definitely crazy. ” The report claimed that unnamed Scandinavian and Gulf countries had offered aid packages in response to the alleged projected uptick of refugees in Lebanon . Specifically , it noted that the EU had already donated 200 million euros ( $ 219.4 million ) in support . As of Thursday evening , the European Union was unavailable to corroborate or deny the claim . Over 1 million Syrian refugees are currently registered with UNHCR in Lebanon , but the government has estimated that the number is closer to 1.5 million . Large populations of refugees settling in remote and vulnerable areas of the country have sparked tensions with equally underprivileged host communities .",Romance,Italian

222baked,canada,"& gt ; A practitioner must disclose immediately to the practitioner 's client any interest , direct or indirect , that might be construed as prejudicial in any way to the professional judgment of the practitioner in rendering service to the client . I feel like you just made this up . Physicians certainly do n't have to disclose anything of the sort to their patients . You 're obligated to put the patients needs first no matter the situation , or you have to find someone else to take over your duties . There 's no grey area on that matter , and no disclosure necessary . Physicians have a regulatory authority through the Medical Council of Canada that can easily take away your license if you 're found doing anything unethical or against the wishes/interests of your patients . So , if you do find a physician is prescribing you a superfluous drug , or refuses to change your medication to a more effective regimen due to some loyalty to a pharmaceutical company , you 're free to contact the MCC , and they most certainly will pursue this kind of professional misconduct . The issue here is that in reality , it 's not really being used in anyone 's detriment . At most , it 'll be an asprin A vs asprin B type thing . That 's why the argument is mute . I feel like this is something that might seem to be open to corruption , and that 's why people who are n't directly involved with the system have a problem with it , but in reality it is n't a problem because of the high ethical standards that come with being a physician , which really are n't abused , and if they are , there are checks in place . There is also the inherent positive of pharmaceutical companies subsidizing professional education to pitch their newer better drugs . I think you can agree that is obvious . Most physicians make sufficient income that they wo n't compromise their integrity , and risk their license for some cheap perks . It 's just a perk of the job . Nobody suffers from it . It 's why the MCC deems it an acceptable practice . I do not know what the future will hold , but I trust the system on this , because I have n't seen any real corruption because of it . It 's just hypothetical .",Romance,Romanian

Aristotle was easier to translate back in 12th century , many of his texts were translated to other languages , Arab , Medieval greek ( thanks to Photios ) and classical Latin . Boethius translated Aristotle\\ 's \ '' Categories\ '' from old-greek to classical Latin in the 6th century , and it found a way to survive in western Europe until it was discovered in the 12th century , which was the basis for the translation for all of his work , so Aristotle\\ 's work had a lot of luck , so many others\\ ' didn\\'t .",Romance,Spanish

Are we going to rewrite history or delete it just because Columbus was under the Spanish flag and that rankles some radical sectors of la CUP ? & gt ; the genocide of the indigenous American population by colonist-conquistadors , and an act of aggressive Spanish nationalism against all the peoples that it oppresses and has oppressed . Do you even think that mayans , aztecs and incas were just poor Englishs that lived the whole love and peace thing ? Seriously they fucking killed and destroyed loads of neighbour tribes , they did blood sacrifices and rape and slavery were common in their cultures . That 's in truth why Cortés conquered the Aztec empire , the aztecs had too many enemies that ended under Cortés flag . More than the half of the spanish troops in america were indigenous .

If a plumber ca n't come to your house to fix your backed up toilet , can you sue him for water damages ? I think not . By extension , how can you demand somebody operate on you for an elective procedure ? A physician takes full responsibility for the outcome of a procedure , and they are in their right to refuse it even on ethical grounds . You ca n't twist their arms on this . The reverse is true though ; patients can sue doctors for a procedure they constented to but later decide they did n't want . They probably wo n't win , but it can cause a problem . Frankly , it 's not even a flat out refusal . It 's pushing it back as to mitigate a risk to the patient . It 's arguable that it might even be the responsible thing to do . There are alterEnglish anticontraception methods available . Why do people think doctors owe them anything more than other professions do and that can be and should be coerced into doing things if they do n't think it 's right ? By that logic , addicts should be suing for damages for not being prescribed drugs and causing them emotional distress . Physicians have the final say on the patients course of treatment .

19O5,exmuslim,"& gt ; I literally have n't heard a single good thing about him until now . That 's really sad . I 'm gon na give you a tldr version . Atatürk grew up in Selanik/Salonica , went to Ottoman military school and became a commander in the battle of Gallipoli . He became one of the leading figures in this war defending the Ottoman Empire against the English during WW I but unfortunately the Ottoman Empire lost WW I among Germany and Austria-Hungary , so Turkey was split among different countries . The Ottoman Empire was occupied and would have probably lost about 1/3 to 2/3 of its territory . [ Here 's the map of distribution of Turkish land ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/tr/2/21/Sevr_Antla % C5 % 9Fmas % C4 % B1_T % C3 % BCrk % C3 % A7e.PNG ) . The Ottoman Sultanate accepted the defeat and signed the treaty in Sèvres , Switzerland . Atatürk and many other Turks could n't accept that , and the Turkish awakening started with Atatürk going to Samsun , leading to the start of Turkish War of Independence against the occupiers and the traitors of the Ottoman Sultanate in 1919 . Atatürk and his followers won the war , and Atatürk created a republic , demolished the caliphate , the sharia law , implemented Switzerland based humanitarian laws instead . He reformed the Turkish language , adapted it to the latin alphabet , and even prohibited the Quran and the Adhan in Arabic , from then on it was in Turkish . So people could understand what they are praying , and that makes sense , does n't it ? ? ?

'' up to how many bytes you want and then you can do a `` read drive x pos y '' since the buffering and commands are instantly sent out to the switch the network hardware takes care of the rest , all you have to do is put it out on the network with this you can have literally thousands of SATA drives connected to a single computer What do you think ? someone should make it . edit : ok this wont be the fastest system but I aim for cheap 10 usd per drive + 1x4 gbit ethernet adapter ( 45 usd ) + 2x48 port ethernet switch ( 200 usd each ) + cables +the drives themselves would cost I think very little edit yes this is Ata over Ethernet but I have not found a single product on the net that goes between a network cable and a sata interface edit : thanks for the comments",Turkic,Turkish

At best the Greek junta would have failed after some slaughter and things would go as it has been before , more likely however Cypriots would have to go to Turkey and be permanent settlers there with no real opportunity to return back in short term.\\n\\n & gt ; Cyprus is worse with Turkey on the economic terms\\n\\nExcept without Turkey feeding Cyprus , Cyprus would have nothing economic to it being embargoed and being completely depended on Turkey and all that . You are unfortunately not the rich tax haven corporation money deposit like your southern neighbours and assuming you would be is why you assume Cyprus would be better without Turkey.\\n\\nSure if there was any Turkish Cypriots left in Cyprus after a Greek junta and not sent back like what happened after Balkan wars , the remaining ones would likely live the same tax haven but there never would be a separate independent Northern Cyprus tax haven.\\n\\nI am for unification of Cyprus by the way , I have always been .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,arabs,"& gt ; What ? You 'd rather we join the great Turkish Republic with Ataturk ? Oh boy , Atatürk back then was a commander busy fighting against the British in Çanakkale . So you think it was a right decision to fight against the Ottomans , with the British and the French ? Wow , I 'm quite surprised about that . Because first of all , the intentions of the British and the French were to destabilize the Middle East for their own benefits . They partitioned a whole entity , and created states within states within states . With the creation of the British and the French , there 's no and there will be no Pan-Arabism . Why ? Simply : 1 - The foreigners divided the states to create a larger influence and to control them . If those states were as big as the initial Arab states like [ The Kingdom of Syria ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/FEisalkingdom.png ) they were seen as a threat to their own benefits . Who the fuck destroyed that Kingdom ? The French . Why would they do that ? Because it is against the colonial mentality of divide & amp ; rule . Do you really think those foreigners wanted the good for you ? 2 - Puppets : The foreigners installed puppets of them in office in the created Arab states . 3 - Filistin : Jews started to migrate to Palestine after it was under British control . Later they fought against the British , but when it was under Ottoman control , there was no such thing as the wish of Jews to create an independent Jewish state . It came later with the Arab-British conquer of Palestine . Great job . With your first question , I see that you have no clue about WWI and the Turkish War of Independence , but let me enlighten you . Turks basically lost WW I and lost most of their territories , outside of Anatolia . The WWI ended in defeat for the Ottoman Empire and the [ Treaty of Sèvres ] ( http : //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/TreatyOfSevres_ % 28corrected % 29.PNG ) was signed . The treaty included the partitioning of Anatolia as you can see on the map . So we were basically fucked . But Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as a commander could n't accept the circumstances like the Turkish people . And he formed the Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi - the Grand Assembly , and declared war on the occupiers . The Ottoman Sultanate and the traitors who signed the Treaty of Sèvres were overthrown and Atatürk 's victory ended in the signing of [ the Treaty of Lausanne ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne ) . This treaty reinstalled Turkey in its form before it was occupied , leaving only the question of Hatay open . I do n't know why there 's so much hate towards Atatürk among Arabs , but he saved our country and our people . If he would n't have started our War of Independence we would have been cocksucking some foreign dick right now , trust me ! He 's the greatest person who 's ever lived , at least in my world .

However , I 'm gon na grab the German citizenship next month , and I really look further to leave this country , after finishing studying . What I hear a lot for example is : -Oh ... . you are so different compared to other Turks I 've met -You are German , because you were born in Germany -Turks in Turkey dont accept you Almancıs anyway , this is your home which I see as a positive assimilation For example I do n't cheer for the German national team during the World Cup , my team , Turkey , is not participating . But these people do n't get that the location where I live does n't change my nationality . However , the thing is : a successful Turk is a German or a German with Turkish roots like Mesut Özil ; a failed Turk , who eg . killed someone , he should be deported back to Turkey . Although bother motherfuckers were born and raised in Germany . Funny thing is that , Mesut Özil , ca n't neither speak proper Turkish nor proper German . That kid is a total failure , but is incredibly talented when it comes to football . But they see him as a perfect model for integration . In my point of view the most important thing is , living peacefully next to each other . I ca n't deny that I get better along with Turks than with Western Europeans .",Turkic,Turkish

1980sumthing,answers,"/u/madpainter : Knowledge of what is possible and where you need to go is only one part of the equation ; the ability to put the knowledge into practice is as equally as important , and then there is the matter of raw materials , food supply , the mix of available talent , leadership etc . I suspect there is also a critical minimum number of scientists and engineers you would need , a sort of critical mass that will be able to get the work done within the balance of their lifetimes . Do n't forget the politics that will surely come into play , especially if there is competition for limited resources , and a host of other things like premature deaths and illnesses . Let 's make some assumptions so at least we can move forward . Assume you will have enough people in all the various sciences ; assume in that group there will be people capable of doing practical work and not just theoretical ; assume they have access to water , metal ores ; and other materials needed to get boot strapped up to a basic industrial level , say Level 1 . The first thing they will need to build will be a power supply driven off a flowing water stream . No big deal ; they can do that will wood for gears and tanned leather hides from animals for drive belts and packing . They will have rudimentary machines fairly quickly . The next jump is much more difficult . Next up they will have to build a steam engine . This step is huge . If they can accomplish this , they stand a good chance of succeeding overall . But to build a good steam engine they will need some moderate to advance metallurgy , and of course , sufficient raw materials to make the alloy blends . Someone will have to be able to make castings for machine parts . The goal here , after the steam engine is made , I think would be to produce a functional lathe and milling machine , and of course the tooling needed to use them . So now that we have a steam engine we can begin to build other machines and piggyback on them to create a new industrial society , but wait , we begin to run into the human problem . Let 's assume everybody gets along ( big assumption ) , there is still the division of labor and available hours . Most of the initial bootstrapping will fall on the shoulders of a small percentage of the group , nuclear and chemical engineers will be pretty much idle during the first mini industrial age , as will many of the other more advanced scientists and engineers . Computer coders ? They will be emptying the latrine trenches for a long time before they become useful . Since we have a limited number in our group , at some point , in the early stages , the people doing the initial bootstrapping are going to run out of available man hours . They can only work so long , and they have a limited shelf life . It would be great if your group was heavily skewed toward certain sciences and skills , but I am assuming it will be a random distribution covering all the sciences . So , how long will it take to get up to basic level 1 , water driven power ? A couple of months perhaps . That 's not too hard and actually requires only a skilled mechanic to do it . Level 2 steam driven power ? Hard to say , but at least 3-5 years if everything goes right ; 10-20 worse case . A new nuclear age ; 100 years but I am just guessing . It really comes down to how many people are available for the tasks that need to be done . I think if your group of scientists and engineers is only 100 , they will not succeed in their lifetime , and it may take hundreds of years to get back a a basic industrial society . I do n't know what the critical mass number is , but a hundred seems barely adequate with all the other factors figured in . You also have to solve the problem of food . Areas rich with mineral ores needed to reach stage 1 may not be suitable for farming . Are you going to have food scientists or actual farmers in your group . Could be critical in the outcome . There is the issue of medical care . Certainly your doctors will be able to produce penicillin easily , but will the current msra and other resistant bacteria continue for a while . A simple injury or cut could be fatal . An injury to a critical engineer or scientist might derail the timeline . Bottom line is that there are far too many variables to say with any certainty how long it would take . It could be done in as little as a 100 years , it might take a 1000 years if the group dies out or ca n't reach that steam level stage quickly . I think that is the key , how fast can they get back to the new steam age . If they can get that far , and the population of the group can be increased , then eventually a return to the modern age would be possible .",Turkic,Turkish

HotSpotSword,europe,"Disregarding all the current politics and not in defense of current Turkish government or foreign policy I would like to say that I do not know why people tend to disregard industrial capacity of Turkey greatly , escpecially the military one . Since the weapon embargos of 70s we have been able to become less and less dependent on foreign military equipment . The US weapon embargo in 75 hurt the TuAF so bad that we didn\\'t have more than 20 airworthy jets . So the decision was taken to build a national arms industry capable of manufacturing jets and tanks and any kind of modern equipment . During the last decade , with an improved economy we were able to build our own [ tank ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altay_ ( tank ) , [ attack helicopter ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAI/AgustaWestland_T129 ) and even [ infantry rifles ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPT-76 ) . These are built in conjunction with foreign partners mainly South Korea and Italy . Turkey owns the production license of all these items . If a war breaks out and assuming it is a conventional one , you can be sure that factories will be pumping these out en masse . We are also capable of building our own F-16s under license from Lockheed Martin so there will be no \ '' wating for servicing\ '' as all parts are produced and assembled here in Turkey . And this industry has evolved in less than 40 years , so do not underestimate the ambitions of Turkish Military Industry .

Kurds want self-determination and this has a high priority for them which is one of the main sources the SE is lagging behind the rest of Turkey .

Most of the Kurds do n't pay electricity bills and are a burden to the Turkish state . But the conditions should be that Şanlıurfa should still remain in Turkey , and that the Kurds who live in Western Turkey would get their Turkish citizenship abandoned and would have to leave Turkey for Kurdistan with all their properties left to the Turkish state . The Turks and Turkmen of SE Anatolia would be settled to the rest of Turkey what the Kurds have left . And citizens of the new Kurdish state should not be able to get in Turkey without a visa to not give Kurds the opportunity to leave Kurdistan for Turkey .

1980sumthing,darknetplan,"1 M users creating 1k letters makes 1 GB new content uncompressed , yes there is normally no way to keep up with all new generated content anyway , just like a 2.4 kb/s internet connection should be enough for most humans as that makes already ( 5letters+space ) 400 words per second . But one could have a offline copy of the generated internet minus all the extras , including litterature , it can include simple svg graphics for informational purposes perhaps on websites like wikipedia for example . I believe the Internet is very much smaller in reality when you remove all uninteresting websites and unessential content , graphics , sound and video media . And many sites just generate webpages for the sake of it . I dont think a copy of ebay would be needed in this system right ? I think we can start right away with building an essential library that can be put in drives with different capacities where the users can select themselves their starting capacity ie 64 gb / 128+ gb etc , and at the same time demand all sites give an alterEnglish fetching system like accessing raw relevant data , like m.wikipedia site gives a minimum page but even less then that alterEnglishly we can change it with scripts . I disregard email , any realtime interactivity ( unless syncing ) , practically all graphics ( except svg ) , all music ( except midi ) , all spam sites link farms and empty sites , and all the web must be reduced until the bare minimum is left . Instead we 'd have a system that can carry the rest . Basic messaging may be added later but skipping that initially will make it faster . I cant give numbers because it is difficult calculating , me giving any is very speculative . when reducing a 1 gb site it may end up as 1 kb perhaps , when disregarding what I listed . Adding the entire net , including pictures and all media indiscriminately is unfeasibly I believe many sites generate graphics all the time and many may simply be duplicating",Turkic,Turkish

100courics,europe,"I think it\\ 's important to highlight the context of EU-US relations . Last time the US was like , \ '' fuck off , Yurop , it\\ 's not my problem , \ '' the Second World War happened . Yes the world loves to go like , \ '' USA blows this , USA sucks that ... \ '' but it most likely would\\ 've been an even more horrific place right now , had the US not bothered - of course this is hypothetical . However , one of the habits the US has is to stick around after the invasion to make sure the procedure was worth its time , which is a fair demand.\\n\\nSince the War , however , the US has been locked into its self-created role of World Police . Ukraine is a member of the Partnership for Peace program of NATO . The program itself is more symbolic than practical - let alone binding - but it shows that NATO member states ( notably the US ) began placing interest in the given state . Thus , while NATO is officially merely a mutual defense pact , becoming a partner of it has many more effects in the long run . Thus , while a full-scale invasion wouldn\\'t be justified in terms of NATO use , the US may just judge the situation as it did 60 years ago : I either help them now , or will have to invade them in ten years because they\\ 'll be overrun.\\n\\nThe love-hate analogy is partially true , but most Europeans subconsciously HAVE to be happy about NATO membership because , if they weren\\'t , nothing would keep them from being next on Russia\\ 's hitlist . It\\ 's very easy to complain about the US when it does something immoral like Iraq or Afghanistan . But it\\ 's only so easy for ( western in some cases ) Europeans because they had the pillow known as the US to land on when they fell for decades now . But that also allows the US to maximize its efficiency by spying on them if need be . As history shows us , it\\ 's not exactly without reason .",Uralic,Hungarian

But his unbiassed opinion , his mature judgment , his enlightened conscience , he ought not to sacrifice to you , to any man , or to any set of men living . These he does not derive from your pleasure ; no , nor from the law and the constitution . They are a trust from Providence , for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable .

Governing party in 1994-1998 and 2002-2010 , but imploded due to scandals , protests and general incompetence .

It is a negative to society , which is evidenced by the actions of gays . Incredible levels of sexual promiscuity , infidelity , drug use , and STD rates are common among homosexuals , not to mention a general obsession with sex that I 've noticed .

Greyfells,AskEurope,"I\\ 'm both German and Hungarian , so I\\ 'll answer for both.\\n\\nI am a fiscal conservative , and a soft social conservative . I\\ 'm totally fine with gay marriage , reproductive rights , so on . I just believe that the state should stand by the local Christian values as the \ '' official\ '' values of the country , even if other lifestyles are permitted . I wouldn\\'t seek to force this on other countries , and is more for Hungary than it is for Germany , where I know that people are a lot less attached to Christianity than they are in eastern Europe . Now , on to the parties ... \\n\\nI was very much center-right with the CDU , I was a big supporter of Merkel and I could usually see the logic in her decisions , even if I didn\\'t agree entirely . I draw the line at the migrant crisis though . Even before , I was very critical of how the EU doesn\\'t have a single , dominant pan-European department that handles the border . It\\ 's very unfair that the nations that happen to be on our border also have to protect the EU\\ 's borders mostly alone . I\\ 'm very much not a fan of how Merkel tried to strong arm Europe into doing something that wasn\\'t even a \ '' greater good\ '' situation , it wasn\\'t to help Europeans or to get Europe into a better place . It\\ 's stupid to risk the integrity of the Union for non-Europeans , especially with a decision that\\ 's so controversial .

Thus , I\\ 'd be left with Jobbik . They\\ 're an interesting bunch . I can\\'t honestly say that I\\ 'm not drawn to their rhetoric , Eastern Europe has had a hard time and it\\ 's not very easy to trust more prosperous and in our eyes often naive countries to handle our affairs . That being said , some party members are very unpolitical and say antisemitic things , silly things , and seem to be plagued with the same ideological vagueness that afflicts most other radical parties .

Huehue777,europe,"1 ) Economies between many Western and Eastern EU countries is almost the same in purchasing power parity\\n\\n2 ) By this time EU has scrapped or heavily limited the amount of refugees it takes in . Many countries found out the hard way that it is extremely hard to integrate people from 3rd world muslim failed states . \\n\\nThis is why most Western/Nordic EU countries have a lot of American-style segregated societies/ghettos , filled with crime , unemployment , use of Arabic as main language , religious extremism and a deep hatred toward the English people.\\n\\nHowever immigration both illegal and legal will stay strong from African/Middle Eastern countries as migrants will continue to figure out different ways to get to EU , as Europe\\ 's standard of living will still continue to be so much higher than anywhere else around it.\\n\\n3 ) UK left the EU , some other countries considered leaving as well , but since there were no more referendums it didn\\'t happen . After the refugee crisis was solved and after another economic/debt crisis there was a time of stability , in which EU develops once more toward a federation , with the creation of an EU army as a major step forward.\\n\\n4 ) Since the economic differences were reduced between East and West , and since open borders have diminished the differences between EU people , there is more of a common sense of unity and it is now very common for Europeans to live/work/study in different EU countries and more people will begin to feel like \ '' Europeans\ '' in addition to their national identity.\\n\\n4 ) In Russia at one point Putin loses his power for one reason or the other , which creates massive chaos in the country , as there will be a huge struggle for power between the United Russia old guard , the oligarchs , the nationalists , the democracy-activists , the various regional separatists ( especially Chechnya and other Caucus muslim countries who will use this to break free from Russia ) and the communists . \\n\\nThis is why things turn from bad to worse in Russia and since Putin had destroyed virtually all democratic institutions there will be a major downfall in the economy and the overall functioning of the state . In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately . Also Turkey has become a bit more democratic , but is still very far away from joining EU.\\n\\n6 ) Estonia will be a very successful country by 2026 and its various start-ups have become quite big and well-known . Also , the 0 % corporate tax rate and the e-residency brought a lot of new companies ( +money ) and also immigrants to Estonia , which has helped push Estonia to have a very high GDP per capita PPP and in terms of quality of life it is on par or higher than other Western EU countries . Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia . This creates some tensions between the local population and the illegal/low-quality labourers .",Uralic,Estonian

Dicios,europe,"This is a long known anomaly of colonies . They usually keep some of the culture/traditions alive better than mainland . Mostly it has to do with a smaller community and having to keep to what they know from the past ( as they lost a direct contact to the trends and have to slowly restart from where they left off ) .\\n\\nSo when England kind of went on to their natural path of development US kept the culture of when most of the colonists went to the new land and as the community was initially smaller it diverged from the \ '' main\ '' \ '' cultural development\ '' . Something that sort , I am sure some professor would explain it a lot better.\\n\\n\\nAlso language usually is quite true to written from but people get \ '' lazy\ '' in pronouncing and shorter words develop so over time some of the spoken language changes and the written form lags behind . A good example is how Wednesday was said fully with even the \ '' silent d\ '' but people simply blurred out \ '' wensdi\ '' and after a while the easier form spread.\\n\\nThis also expands to proto languages/lingusitics of very basic words like mother , home , foot , food , hand , walk , water , me , you etc . How these words are down to the bare minimum in most languages in terms of vowels as they have been used so heavily over centuries that we basically sound like cavemen ( perhaps even cavemen used similar sounds for first words ) .\\n\\nLike the word \ '' me\ '' is very easy to say , simply put your lips together and blow a little air from your throat .

ExWei,europe,"& gt ; & gt ; Before the Soviet occupation Estonia was ahead of Finland by 5 % ( $ 3771 vs $ 3589 ) . In 1995 ( after USSR collapsed ) GDP per capita in Estonia was $ 3,044 . In Finland it was $ 26,273 - 90 % lower or 8 times difference . Now , after 25 years of independence the difference is 28 % - $ 43,090 vs $ 30,850.\\n\\n & gt ; I think your figures are wrong there because Estonia still has half the GDP per capita of Finland . \\n\\nWell they are not wrong because current Finland GDP PPP is $ 43,090 and Estonian one is $ 30,850 , the difference is not a half . So this is a fact that ~50 years of the USSR occupation literally ruined the economy and now it significantly recovered with capitalism - I already described it with exact figures in my above comment.\\n\\n & gt ; Look up the actual theory , disconnect it from what you know from history , and imagine what it could be like , without a lens.\\n\\nWhat is the theory ? Seize the means of production ? What if nobody wants to buy the goods of a factory that is owned by the workers ? How do they get resources to start a production ? What happens to the current business owners ? This theory never worked and will never work - unless socialists find a way to control population via some kind of a hivemind device.\\n\\nTo be honest , even if it would have worked exactly as it written in the theory , I would still dislike it - because no \ '' workers\ '' can realistically manage risk of running an enterprise , and they should not.\\n\\n & gt ; I don\\'t agree with how Soviet Russia ran things , despite being a socialist , all I\\ 'm saying is that it was literally the pinnacle of Russian power.\\n\\nThe pinnacle of Russian power ? Are you talking about 1930-1940 when people were being sent to gulags , or about the other part when they were queuing for bread from 6am ? \\n\\nToday Russians at least have some freedom - they can travel to foreign countries , read foreign newspapers and do business . All this was impossible in USSR.\\n\\nIt was the pinnacle only if you measure it in number of tanks and nukes.\\n\\n & gt ; In addition , have you ever actually looked at what Russia did wrong ? It was corruption in government , sectarianism , inefficient management , a one-party system that never needed to change , stagnation , isolation . None of those are something a socialist would agree with.\\n\\nSoviet Russia was also an aggressive imperialist state that attacked its neighboring countries . I often hear socialists talking about the Western Imperialism but never about Soviet imperialism.\\n\\n & gt ; This needs restating . Are you saying Marx tried to build communism ? He didn\\'t , he formed the theory , which you still need to read\\n\\nI am aware enough of the theory that wants to ruin everything . \ '' Seize the means of production\ '' - yeah lets remove people who built businesses using their capital and knowledge and put a bunch of uneducated workers in charge , I wonder how it will work out.\\n\\nAlso , since everything is seized and owned by the workers , does it mean that e.g . on a nuclear plant , a nuclear engineer and a janitor are equal in terms of what they can get ? \\n\\n & gt ; instead of taking your views from pure lies.\\n\\nSure it is pure lies , probably that\\ 's because I never was in a post-Soviet country which was not decimated by USSR occupation and Russia is far away from me . Of course IRL post-communism * ( the country called itself communist and other kind of communism did not exist yet ) * knowledge is nothing compared to some theory that never worked exactly as described and even if it would have worked ( \ '' seize the means of production\ '' ) it would be only slightly better.\\n\\n & gt ; North Korea calls itself Socialist , do you believe them as well ? \\n\\nI believe that they are communist , because USSR was very similar to them and also called themselves communist .",Uralic,Estonian

6i7kh,AskReddit,"No , not really . I 'm gon na have to correct this a bit since I know a lot of people have a pretty mistaken view of this matter . The special theory of relativity is based on the fact that every inertial system ( roughly , a frame of reference moving at a constant speed ) is equivalent . If you 're inside one , you get the same experimental results as the guy in the other system . Therefore , both you , an observer in a car and the guy on the ground can claim that they 're stationary or that they 're moving at 80mph relative to you . If you 're inside the frame , you ca n't conduct an experiment that 'll tell you how fast you 're going because all experiments have the same results in all inertial frames . The only thing you can do is measure your speed relative to another frame ( in this case , the ground ) , but that 's going to be relative because you *assume* that that inertial frame is stationary . The point is that it does n't matter whether you 're moving at 80mph and the ground is stationary or you 're stationary and the ground is moving at 80mph . Looking out the window is not an option , because both are equally possible and there 's no point arguing about which is true , because they are *both correct* and *equivalent* : crashing into a wall at 80 is still going to kill you the exact same way . Now this , combined with the fact that light moves at the same speed in all inertial frames is what causes all that weirdness . Both are pretty easy to wrap your head around but the implications are huge . TL ; DR : both the ground and you can move and it does n't make a difference . edit : typoz",Uralic,Hungarian

Arnoux,europe,"There was two big parties in Hungary after Soviet occupation . MSZP which was the former communist party , and Fidesz ( Orb\u00e1n ) the other big.\\n\\nWhat MSZP did was take a huge amount of loan and gave a lot of them to people who didn\\'t work . Also had a lot of taxes on \ '' high\ '' incomes . What I mean high now is way below the minimal wage in western EU.\\n\\nWhat Orb\u00e1n did is reduced the spending , reduced the loan outstanding . Reduced the money spent on people , instead he promoted a culture where you earn money by working , not buy waiting for the government . They lowered the tax on higher incomes . Higher incomes still lower than the western minimal wage ... Orb\u00e1n also promotes families with children and they get tax reduction for children . So it promotes the people who earn some money to have children , instead of uneducated gypsies ( they were promoted by the previous party ) . Also Orb\u00e1n is heavily against migrants , which is very important for me and for majority of hungarian people . He also wants to preserve the hungarian culture , while the left parties wanted to shatter the hungarian identity . Orb\u00e1n also promotes christian values . While I don\\'t belive in god , but I think christian values are good and part of our culture .

ExWei,europe,"& gt ; Why the immigration is illegal ? I get it that you were annexed by USSR , and there was not a legal estonian governement , but you can not compare it to illegal immigration.\\n\\nBecause technically they crossed the border illegally - i.e . without authorization from Estonian government which was in exile at that moment . All Russians that lived in Estonia before 1939 are all \ '' natural citizens\ '' so there is no any tests for them . And today , everyone who wants the citizenship just learns the language ( B1 level required in Estonia ) and just passes the tests . Maybe it is a racist thing to think , but in my opinion everyone should know the language of the country they live in.\\n\\nOn the other side , many of them like the \ '' undefined citizenship\ '' and do not want to change it , because , for example , they can go to Russia without visa , while they could not do it if they were Latvian/Estonian citizens .",Uralic,Estonian
