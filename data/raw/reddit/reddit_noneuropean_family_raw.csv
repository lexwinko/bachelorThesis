Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Ping , or latency , is the delay between a piece of data being sent out and it being received on the other end ( there is a delay both ways , from you to the server and vice versa ) . A high delay will result in a game that `` lags '' , stutters or even refuses to work entirely . A delay of 80 ms is pretty low and should be good enough to play most games , except for maybe the fastest paced twitch shooters . Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transfered in a given amount of time , regardless of delay . Games in general require very little bandwidth to play , on the order of a few kilobytes per second . Unless you are downloading an update for the game , the latency is the only thing that matters .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

I 've browsed all the local music store sites and found some options within my budget . ( note the links are sweetwater because a lot of the local sites were not in English so if you were n't familiar with the setup of the keyboard , I thought it 'd help to not have to look it up . ) So here 's what I have so far ( with local prices in $ for comparison as they vary to what 's on sweetwater ) : [ Nektar Impact LX61+ ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ImpactLX61P ) ( 158 $ ) [ M-Audio Oxygen 61 ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Oxygen-61 ) ( 190 $ ) [ Korg Taktile 49 ] ( https : //www.amazon.com/Korg-Taktile-49-Key-Keyboard-Sliders/dp/B00I40XE42 ) ( 208 $ . This one seems to be out of sale on sweetwater , hence the Amazon link , so I do n't know if it 's a discontinued model . Though it is discounted at the local site by quite a bit . Was originally 341 $ . ) [ Roland A-500 Pro ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/A500Pro ) ( 280 Euros . Also the local site has a different version it seems , instead of Roland it says cakewalk in it 's place . Other than that , it looks the same but I do n't know if that makes a difference , same model . ) [ Novation Launchkey 61 ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/LaunchK2-61 ) ( 267 $ ) [ Alesis VI 49 ] ( https : //www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/VI49 ) ( 224 $ ) So basically just looking for your opinions on each one . Why you would or would n't go for a particular model . I just want to make some music for fun . I can play the piano a bit , but do n't have an interest in actually playing piano , I 'd rather make other types of music/experiment . I do a lot of sound design and use that in DAW 's ( mostly Pro Tools and Logic ) to create stuff and make organic music , it 'd be fun to have a keyboard to work with alongside that .

Installs fine , but says it requires hardware to launch , on my Mac , it does n't however . I connect my MBOX , install the drivers and load Pro Tools , I get some weird error 'The operating system held off interrupts for too long ... ' It froze my computer up completely .

12084182,relationships,"There 's actually quite a few ways you can get chlamydia . My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past . The birds carry it , get sick and then sicken their owners . There is Chlamydia pneumoniae , and it causes a different form of pneumonia . You find this infection more often in older people . It 's not common ( and neither is psittacosis ) . There are also chlamydia eye infections , too . Chlamydia in the eye is rare in countries that have better sanitation and hygiene . But it blinds many women in Africa every year . Not that I intend to exonerate the girl myself , but I would like to note that vaginal chlamydia is often silent in women , and it can go undetected for a long time .

It will be too cold to swim , however . Considering your preferences , limiting yourselves to Hvar and Dubrovnik would be disappointing . Especially regarding Hvar , which is pretty dead in early April comparing it to July and August when it becomes a great party destination . Nature parks Plitvička Jezera and Krka could satisfy your natureporn and hiking itch . Another popular hiking destination is Biokovo . Delicious food is everywhere , just check Google for restaurant reviews of the places you decide to visit . Seafood is pretty great , but try as many new things as you can . Now , as far as partying goes , you 're kinda out of luck coming here in April . During the high season you could pick and choose pretty much anywhere but that early you 'll have to stick to bigger places like Split and Zadar ( maybe Dubrovnik ) and mingle with the locals since there wo n't be many tourists around . But for a simple hammering in a bar you 'll have plenty of options and like minded patrons : D",Balto-Slavic,Croatian

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,MapPorn,"Well , no not really . The Macedonians originate from an epicentre of different nationalities in the Southern Balkans . Its where the nations of Bulgaria , Serbia , Greece meet and have met for a rather long time with Albanians coming into the mix later on as well . Most demographics maps say they were mostly Bulgarians with Greek and Serb majorities closer to the countries ' borders . Bulgaria fought many wars with reuniting with Macedonia being the major desire . But after losing the second Balkan war which was completely fought because of Macedonia and WW1 which Bulgaria basically joined to get Macedonia there was a decrease in tensions and there were much larger problems in Bulgaria that it had to deal with . After WW1 Yugoslavia was created and I think that is where Macedonia as a nation really developed . So by 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia there was a legitimate Macedonian nation that wanted to govern itself . An issue with this though was that Macedonia had no real history as a country , and no national identity past the part of the people feeling Macedonian . So in order to create a Macedonian national identity the government started separating the language with Bulgarian ( which tbh had already developed differences ) amongst other things while taking huge liberties with history like making outright wrong claims like saying they were descendants of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great . So I would say that there is a legitimate nation of Macedonia , **but** a majority of that nation 's ancestors were Bulgarian .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

AirSandFire,hinduism,"Saying `` liberation is impossible without study of scriptures & amp ; Guru '' limits the power of the Lord 's grace-bestowal . There 's nothing limiting Him from conferring grace directly . So it is possible to get liberation without doing any meditation , study , never meeting a Guru . It can happen as a sudden descent of Lord 's Power ( śaktipāta ) : & gt ; such a being becomes spiritually illuminated and liberated on his own , relying directly on Śiva , not needing initiation or instruction from other exterior guru . This is facilitated by an intense awakening of his spiritual intuition ( pratibhā ) which immediately eliminates ignorance That being said , this is extremely rare , to the point that it 's practically best to not even consider it as an option . But it 's important to keep in mind that liberation is possible at all times since the Lord 's Freedom is unlimited and not conditioned by anything . In practice though , you will need the assistance of an external Guru and holy scriptures . But do n't give up just because a Guru has n't appeared in your life yet . Just study a good scripture such as the *Yōga-Vāsiṣṭha* to give an example and absorb the words of the Sage and the Guru will appear when you are `` ripe '' .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Electrical power is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current . So in order to power a 1kW device , like a hair dryer , you would need to supply it about 4,3 amperes at 230 volts ( 4,3 x 230 = ~1000 ) , OR about 9 amperes at 110 volts ( 9 x 110 = ~1000 ) . Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation . Higher voltages are also more likely to cause electrical shocks , and I believe that was the reason the US ( and some other countries ) went with a lower standard voltage .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough .

12084182,AskReddit,"Upbringing is a weird term . I had a weird upbringing , but a lot of these things didn ’ t come from my parents , it came from realising what it takes to be a decent human being and gain respect from others and be treated fairly . It comes with having common sense . Sometimes parents are retarded and raise their children to be that way too , but oftentimes like in my own example , I tried to do my best to not be like my parents and have better habits . Not saying these are theirs , just giving a general statement , but these are some things that tick me off and give me a general impression about yourself and your choices growing up : If they constantly try to sound smarter than they are . If they litter and try to say that there ’ s a janitor or city worker that cleans up that mess , it ’ s their job . Basic manners . People who fuck up , and apologize by saying “ I ’ m sorry , but… ” There ’ s no but . If you are sorry , you say so , then shut up and deal with the consequences . How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them . Maybe that McDonalds worker has a degree but can ’ t find a job in it . Maybe life forced them to change course . Also , who would serve you that McDonalds if they didn ’ t ? If you have read nothing but the Bible . Big red-flag for me . Open your eyes a little . At least try and understand other people ’ s points of view . I might not have cared for the bible , and am not religious , but I don ’ t judge you for your choice , so don ’ t judge me for mine .

AccioIce25454,harrypotter,"* What animals did Hagrid use to breed a new species ? Hagrid used all his favorite , completely harmless animal friends , now presented in one compact species : the acromantula , the norwegian ridgeback and the three-headed dog . **Yes , you 're reading this right folks , all your favorite cuddlies at once ! ** * What is its name ? What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem . These magical researchers report back to Hagrid on a daily basis and send him monthly paintings to keep him up to date on what these cuddlies are up to .

They say that the mindset of Croatian immigrants in Australia ( and NZ , where they also traveled ) is stuck in the time frame of when they first emigrated . They do n't see Croatia and everything about it as it is today ( which is admittedly difficult if you do n't live here ) but as it was when they left . So , for instance , people that emigrated during the Yugoslavia were either yugo-nostalgic or , if they were more on the nationalistic side , were still ranting on about Yugoslavian secret service , Croatian struggle and so on . The people that emigrated because of the war in the 90s were almost all pretty far right nationalists , identifying with the Ustasha regime , blindly hating Serbs , etc . It 's like they did n't have any closure and the war is still going on in their minds ( there a lot of people like that here , mind you ) . On the other hand they said that the Australian Croats they met were all friendly ( at least towards them ) . Most of them were hard working and almost all were business owners , so I guess entrepreneurship is something that they have in common . They talked about how they teach their children to love and respect their Croatian heritage . They met a couple of 3rd generation guys that were crazy about Hajduk , getting up in the middle of night to watch matches and stuff like that , without ever going to the homeland .

Even though it would pain me to do this , I 'd prevent that so he did n't have to suffer the way he did ( totally messed up his life , he stopped exercising , caused him to gain a lot of weight since he ate a lot and did n't burn it off , and it got so bad that he became obese and his stomach overproduced acid and it ate his stomach and they had to operate to remove it , which resulted in no stomach , he can only eat a cup worth of food for a meal . No more . ) He 's lost the weight but you can see the scars from the surgery all over . I 'm pretty sure he 'd be better off not having to experience all that , also his life was very dull before he met me . And I know he would n't be with me unless I was physically around him , and we lived countries apart , and he 'd be with her at some point so I 'd just hate to live life knowing him but not at the same time , and so on ... I 'd stop my best friend from dating the bitch he was dating for 5 years that told him that she did n't love him for the past 2 years but stayed with him cause she felt sorry for him and finally felt the courage to tell him that since they were long distance for a year . Almost killed himself over it . Stop my dog from getting run over and suffering badly after that . Assholes ( tried to break into our house , he bit the guys leg - mind you , he 's a small terrier/poodle type mix and is n't violent at all , but knows bad intentions when he sees them ) They came back a few days later and as he chased the car ( according to neighbors ) they ran at him . Complete internal bleeding and for months he could n't move an inch without pain and suffering . Find better ways to make money . I was always scheming how to make more money , but definitely make better choices there . Maybe even make something I knew would be popular ( not necessarily something big , I do n't want to alter the world that much so that the whole future changes and I do n't know a thing about it - I do want to retain at least some control of my future ) Now that I know what people think about me , perhaps change their perceptions to something better ? If they did n't think much of me anyway ... ( A lot of people in high school thought I was weird cause I stuck to myself , I just did n't want to be a part of that stupid crowd )",Balto-Slavic,Serbian

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene

To be honest I doubt Maliki followed Iranian orders , but then again Yankovic did n't follow Russian orders either . Instead his associates describe Moscow 's men making their way to his inner circle , driving his previous advisers out until they virtually controlled him . Or it could be something even more innocent , like some Iranian foreign policy strategist realizing his premiership is likely to lead to outcomes highly favorable to Iran though unfavorable to Iraq and thus deciding to support him .

The argument started with OP blaming Gorbachev for everything when he did what was best for the people with Yeltsin failing to accommodate the country to the new system . ( To be fair it was the same in my country , Bulgaria , it took us most of the 90 's to recover from the shock but in the end here we are with life for Bulgarians being the best it has ever been in history ) But you see what is happening now is the same as what was happening during the USSR but now anybody can buy most commodities cheaply ( as opposed to them not even being available before ) . Capitalism in Russia has not closed the equality gap , I completely agree with you , though this is not the system 's fault but Russia 's . Its because people keep voting for Putin and for a government which is completely destroying the middle and low class and blaming the west for it . It was not the EU who sanctioned Russia on commodities such as food , it was Putin who burnt tonnes of it and answered with such sanctions that only hurt his own voters . Capitalism gave you the ability to raise the GDP ( you did ) , and to altogether improve your country but Russia ended up with basically the same system as before but with money replacing personal ties and relationships as the form of power .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian
100100145,ukpolitics,"& gt ; That 's not society sacrificing it 's ability to advance , it 's the rich sacrificing their ability to give unfair benefits to their lineage . The economy of the country is not a game . It 's the source of the people 's quality of life . Efforts to make it fair should not lower the standard of life it provides to all people , from the poorest to the richest . & gt ; Personally , I believe the elderly should be free to enjoy themselves rather than be so focused on making life easy for their family . We also have an economy based on spending , it 's not a problem if they spend on luxuries instead . When a company receives money from investment it spends them mostly to research and develop a new product , usually a product for the lower strata in a society . When a person buys a luxury product he only benefits himself and the usually quite few people that made the product . It 's also a matter of what we value as a society - would you rather we had a new line of microprocessors or some old guy had a yaht ? & gt ; If they did n't inherit it , they earned it , why should n't they enjoy it ? And why not have them give it to whomever they wish . & gt ; Also , people owning houses and passing them onto their children does ensure that there 's a gulf in society between those who 're lucky enough to have a home from their parents , and those whose parents were poor . Not really . A house is not that difficult thing to construct . Where I come from people would often build their own , sometimes just with the help of their families and extended families . Why would the poor have problems getting accommodation of their own ? & gt ; Tax avoidance is obviously going to happen , but refusing to do the right thing because of criminals is ridiculous , you just keep closing the loop holes . Because when you give people the choice of either loosing hundreds of thousands or becoming criminals the choice they are going to make is clear . And if you try to stop their criminal activities , they will simply offer a good part of the sum to your tax inspector , and he will make the same choice as well . & gt ; But anyway , this is just ideology . If you believe that your place in society should be entirely based upon your actions , you need inheritance tax . If you want people to be born into being rich , and never having to do anything themselves simply because of their luck to be born rich , and on the flip side with so much old money you accept the fact that those from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to succeed .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"For one you could make sure that everybody hears about the intervention . That way when IS or JaN suffers a defeat , it could lead to terror attacks in Russia . This is quite likely to force the Russian government to escalate it 's involvement beyond the point it would be comfortable with . Beyond that the coalition could make it clear that it 's bombing campaign will no longer interfere with IS operations against the Syrian Government , as now the government can rely on Russian air support . This is likely to turn ugly very quickly as al Baghdadi directs his entire strength in the SAA 's direction . And finally if the Russian government has provided the separatist forces in Ukraine with a certain level of support , the allies of certain rebel groups wo n't have much issue , at least diplomatically , with providing them a similar level of support as well . And even a lower level of support could do a lot to counteract the effects of the Russian involvement . Those are of course clearly just some propositions I thought of just now . There are probably even more subtle as well as even more effective methods to make sure the Russians suffer the costs of their actions .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alterEnglish , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ? Human nature is that we tend to arrive at positions and then justify them after the fact , so it 's at least worth exploring if discomfort with the topic , rather than a utilitarian assessment , led to your original criticism .

Also , I 'm a little bit bummed that Hail the Sun is leaving BSR only after one release ( that can be said to be a success as their fanbase grew twice as big as before the release of `` Wake '' ) especially if we look how Donovan is linked with some bands ( as their manager ) , is a lead singer in Sianvar and was part of BSR 's Holy Trinity Swan-Medina-Melero . Their next record could probably be another success that would bring BSR a steady position at this stage of the label . & gt ; That said BSR took some hits lately - Kurt Travis left BSR and founded Esque Records , Adventurer crashed their crowd-funded van , their drummer left and there 's still little information about their album , Stolas parted ways with their lead vocalist and decided to become a trio which will change their sound and their performence of the already existing songs . Also Eidola got pretty bigger after their release and I would n't be surprised if they would be also signed by Equal Vision in the future . & gt ; Now I 'm curious what Swan & amp ; co. will do - will we see a bunch of signings of some bands with established reputations ( maybe with a little branching out of `` swancore '' genre ) and try to grow as a label or will go into the path of signing smaller , very swancore bands like Oranges and be a stepping stone for them .

I think I knew , but I never really believed it . So thanks , reddit . I just went through an entire cycle of acceptance regarding this . & gt ; & gt ; Throwaway because my usual username is literally my name . & gt ; & gt ; After my dad 's divorce from his first wife , he did a lot of mixers and singles parties . He was freaking out that he was almost 50 and was the only one out of his siblings without a family . My favorite part of this story is that he said the last straw before he turned to `` dating magazines '' was when he went to a dance for singles and had to escape out of a bathroom window from a very agressive gay man . So he sent letters to all the women he was interested in and then planned his trip to meet all of them in their respective countries . The woman before he met my mom actually tried to trap him in a room when she found out there were other girls he was planning to see . I 'm glad he kept going after that because he went on to meet my mom in The Philippines . They had a connection and began dating until he brought her back to the states and got married . & gt ; & gt ; Reviewing this story now I ca n't believe I did n't think it was a mail order bride thing , for years I would deny it by saying it was a dating magazine . But I can see why , my parents really love and work well together . Reading about how most men that get a mail order bride are , I can confirm that my dad is kind of a socially awkward guy .

08TangoDown08,todayilearned,"I 'm not sure what you want me to tell you - what you 've said is right , but the prevailing attitude at the time was that France was the biggest land power in Europe . That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",Germanic,English

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude . Tl ; dr there have always been political movements advocating `` freedom to '' and `` freedom from '' , or equality vs liberty .",Germanic,English

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The game models are very , very different . Wow has steadly been losing players , and it rises up every new game . There are still a pull towards the `` longevity '' of having one character , leveling it up and so on , compared to a game like Dota or Starcraft or Battlefield etc . It 's not comparable . Dota is and will be a game that is always battling to keep it 's players interested , just like every other game ever . Games struggle always to stay fresh , to evolve , to be on top , and it 's even harder to do so when you have a game where you just play 1 match , and that 's it , compared to an RPG . Dota has and never will be a `` casual '' game . It 's not something whoever can pick up and enjoy . So go for most MOBA games , it 's just that some are easier than others . And Dota is the hardest . And when it battles with other Mobas , like LoL , which more plays and is easier to pick up , it will always struggle to get new player . 7.00 was n't a step to , how can one put it , `` become casual '' , neither to become a better and more interesting game . It was to refresh the game . And it did , for many people . For many people , it drove them away , but that 's because many , like me , was `` afraid '' of this change , when I see now that it was a great and interesting move to refresh something stale . I 've played Dota for many years . When 7.00 came out , I thought it was a hugely drastic change . But playing Dota now , it 's not that different from what it was a year ago . Those that stop playing the game , will stop playing the game no matter what happens . And there will be some new players , but just like Wow , the player base will go up and down . https : //www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/ Just look at wow , and look at any other games ever , and realise the facts ; A video game is always living at a limited time , and will always need to work and evolve to stay fresh , but no matter what it do , it will eventually die . All Valve can do is try to keep it 's player base now , and hope that enough young people are interested in MOBA 'S , but get tired or bored of the more casual ones . But the time of the Moba-games are slowly fading . We will see how long they can keep it up , but just like every other thing , it will eventually collapse by it 's own weight , and I think Dota is heading there . & gt ; No , not this old game horseshit again . Saying it is an old game is 100 percent legit . You know how many young people do n't see old movies because `` they are not good , they are black and white '' ? That is 100 percent legimate reason for them themselves to say . They do n't think black and white movies can be good , and why is that wrong to say ? If that 's what they think , it 's what they think and it ca n't be changed unless they activly watch the movies themselves and see they are wrong . But it does n't happen , because `` they are old '' Dota is getting old . Young people can look it up and see `` Dota 2 released 2013 '' and immediatly be turned off by it , because they want something released this year . And comparing sports to it is just ridiculous . Sports are sports , it 's the most casual thing and it 's also fun . There will always be sports . But do every person growing up take an interest in Basketball ? No , but lets say 5 or 10 percent do . That 's millions of people all around the world .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"McGuinness grew up in a sectarian statelet that viewed Catholics like him as second class citizens and who responded to their demands for civil rights with extreme violence . The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit . Northern Ireland is a better place today because they managed to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Plenty of men go down the violent path and never turn back . McGuinness not only turned back from it himself , but he turned others back from it along with him .",Germanic,English

The first Ayatollah ( Ruhollah Khomeini ) issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie - calling for his death for publishing a book that was deemed to have offended Islam . These are all facts . Also , gay people exist everywhere . Literally everywhere . Pointing out that they happen to exist in Iran is in no way an argument . If the Iranian religious police found your friends guilty of `` homosexual acts '' - then they would most likely be imprisoned - or worse . Activists do exist in Iran and perhaps the regime has softened a bit since the 80 's - but you ca n't confront a problem like this by lying about it . The Iranian government is a theocratic dictatorship that stifles the freedom of many of its citizens . That is a fact .",Germanic,English

Britain just does n't talk about the damage that their empire has done throughout the world . They just do n't . People like Winston Churchill are endlessly praised for some of the good things that they 've done but the bad things are almost completely overlooked . You 'll never hear anyone talk about what Churchill 's racist view of the American Indians and Australian aborigines were for example . You 'll never hear about his hatred for Gandhi and Indian independence , or even his abysmal record in Ireland . Let 's not forget that we have Churchill to thank for the Black and Tans . You 'll only hear about how he saved Britain during WW2 and how he should be revered for it . He was even voted the greatest ever Briton by the public . Britain will take responsibility for all of the good things their Empire did and achieved , but they 'll take no responsibility for the famines , massacres , slavery , persecutions and the rest of the many evils that their Empire carried out and enabled .

The response of the loyalist community was to orchestrate what can only be called pogroms against Catholic communities in Belfast . This is the environment that the PIRA grew out of .

123xyz123xyz,The_Donald,"The guy who wrote what im copying and pasting here knows his shit : If you want to know about rampant pedophilia by elites in Dominican Republic you need to look at 2 investigate reporters that are not too swampy ... One is Alicia Ortega and the other is Nuria Piera , Nuria is Dominican Republic 's Alex Jones.. She 's always fucking up corrupt politicians and they fear her ... She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate José Francisco Peña Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly Peña Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press Peña Gomez vudú ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... . Menendez and Melgen were accused in Dominican Republic of fraud by selling x-ray machines to the government and the corrupt DR supreme Court let them go ... FUCK THE ELITES ! ! ! !

Although being essentially abandoned did help to revolutionize our economy and now we have one of the freest markets in the world . Cheers mum . & gt ; In 1970 Britain took more than 90 % of New Zealand ’ s butter exports and 75 % of cheese exports . The Luxembourg agreement reduced the butter quota by roughly 17 % and the cheese quota by roughly 68 % over 5 years . Quantities were reduced further after 1977 , to about half the 1973 levels . New Zealand continued to have butter quotas in the 1980s and 1990s – although at much reduced levels . & gt ; Britain had long been New Zealand ’ s main supplier of imports , but this was slowly declining – from 48 % in the late 1930s , to 43 % in 1960 , and down to 30 % in 1970 . This was due partly to the recovery of other economies after the war , and their ability to compete on price and quality with British exporters . But it was also a by-product of Britain ’ s EEC membership . When Britain entered the EEC all bilateral agreements between New Zealand and Britain had to be terminated . Preferential treatment of British imports into New Zealand ended in 1977 . & gt ; In 1980 imports from Britain had fallen to 14.5 % . In 2007 they were less than 3 % . In the late 1930s Britain took more than 80 % of New Zealand exports . By 1960 it took 53 % , which reduced to 36 % in 1970 , and 5 % in 2007 .",Germanic,English

True , but we do n't even know how many viable nuclear devices the DPRK has . It 's not likely to be too many . There 's no theory of mutual destruction with North Korea . They 're not Russia - they do n't have enough nuclear weapons to completely cripple the USA . The USA has more than enough to turn the entire Korean peninsula into a smoking crater . The point I 'm essentially making is that while you 're correct that the DPRK may be able to target US cities , it 's unlikely they will be able to land multiple devices on multiple cities . It would still be an absolute humanitarian disaster if they managed to land even one , but it would n't take down the US government or the US military , and North Korea would quite probably still fall to the US and its allies . Also , despite the rhetoric that we 've been hearing from North Korea for literally decades now , I do n't consider it likely at all that they would launch a preemptive nuclear weapon towards the US . They would be wiped out if they did . The only way I can see them carrying out such a launch is if they 're already at war - they 're likely to feel as if they 've nothing to lose by launching what they have at the US in that case .",Germanic,English

Hume played a huge role in the peace process , but the peace process could never have happened if you did n't have people within SF and the PIRA willing to take huge risks in order to turn the PIRA away from violence . Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake . The problem is that people seem to think that it was down to Hume and the SDLP alone - when their whole contribution to the peace process centered almost entirely around involving and in many cases depending on SF and the moderate elements of the IRA to bring an end to the violence being orchestrated by the IRA .",Germanic,English

The status is normally determined every ten years based on the language data in the population register . ( Minimum 8 % or 3000 residents minority language speakers . ) This status is set by government decree for ten years . There was a change in the law that directs extra government funds to dual language muncipalities . Basically some municipalities that are designated single language suffered in the change . However , the determination of language status is next made in 2023 and the government was not allowed to make special determinations . The new form of the law allows the government ( i.e . cabinet ) to assign a municipality dual language status **during** the ten-year period it had been determined to have a single language , if the municipal council asks for the change .

0bi,medicalschool,"So , the post currently on the front page about number of procedures done during rotations got me thinking about what 's considered 'normal ' in the U.S. and over here . I started comparing the procedures I 've done to some listed in that post and figured it was like comparing apples and oranges and that people first needed to understand the architecture of medical school over here . I figured that warranted its own post , I hope you find it interesting . I 've made it specifically about The Netherlands , because I 'm not aware of all the specific differences between the EU countries . Maybe people from those countries can chime in on that . **So , general outline first . ** Medical school in The Netherlands is six years , but requires no premed . You can enroll straight out of high school at 18 . The education is then grossly divided in two parts of three years , the first three focus on anatomy , physiology , biochem etc . The latter three focus on rotations in increasing manner . My faculty is unique in The Netherlands due to the fact that we have full-fledged rotations during third year ( a big advantage IMO ) . You have two weeks of Christmas holidays and 8 weeks of summer leave , though this decreases each year as you advance . In turn , you get two weeks twice off at randomly designated periods during the year from fourth year onwards . **The Netherlands is a small country** ( [ 16040 sq mi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands ) ) but has [ eight university hospitals with ~300 first years each ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_hospitals # Netherlands ) , so due to student density you 'll never have to travel very far during away rotations . Door to door it rarely exceeds 1,5 hours and in those cases ( and often sooner ) you 'll most often have the option to be boarded locally ( paid for by your faculty ) . **Most medical schools** in The Netherlands have adopted a 'thematic curriculum ' . This means that instead of separate courses of anatomy , physiology etc . you get a course 'GI ' , or 'Circulation ' . You will then learn about anatomy , physiology , pathology etc . of relevant organs to that theme . The only 'traditional ' course I can think of that we have is biochem , though that 's already angled a bit towards onco . **So , the first three years** ( your 'Bachelor's ' ) consist of above mentioned 'themes ' . In general , this takes place in the faculty building and is made up of lectures , so called workgroup settings , practical sessions ( e.g . histo ) and live-patient lectures . You are also trained in scientific literacy and do an actual test-study and have ethics classes . If you 're an average or above-average student studying nine to five should be enough to pass with decent grades here . We do n't have the STEP-system , though each faculty has some version of 'progress exams ' where you take the same exam ( not the same questions ) at set intervals during med school but have to perform better as you progress . **The second portion** ( your 'Master's ' ) is mostly rotations with designated prep courses in advance . The length of each rotation differs per faculty , at mine most rotations are six weeks each . In general your first rotations will be at your faculty hospital or very close and as you advance you can have rotations further away ( this is relative though , see above ) . Most rotations are set , though you have several electives as well . Now , about the prep courses : these consist of repition and more in-depth study of most-common diseases , anatomy etc ; practical tools ( such as basic management of post-op surgical patients , heart failure pts , ATLS etc . ) ; more diseases within the field and practice patients and cases . In general you 'll be studying more than 40 hours/week during these prep courses as they are very short . **Rotations at my faculty** are ( with different prep course length , not listed ) : * IM 2 x 6 weeks * Surgery 2 x 6 weeks * Neuro 6 weeks * Psych 6 weeks * Ob/Gyn 6 weeks * Peds 6 weeks * GP 5 weeks * Ophto 2 weeks * Derm 2 weeks * ENT 3 weeks * Public health 4 weeks * Elective 6-10 weeks * 12 weeks of warding in one dpt of choice ) * Elective 12 weeks or 2 x 6 weeks All in all almost two full years of rotations . The last two bullets are both in sixth year , which is called the 'switch year ' nowadays as it has no more prep courses and focuses on actual clinical work . Rotations are generally 8-17.30 with several call duties added ; with of course the exceptions of surgery and [ derm ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/52elsz/i_dont_get_why_everybody_says_derm_hours_are_easy/ ) . **And afterwards ? ** You 're a licensed physician . You can either work as an *ANIOS* ( physician *not* in training for specialist ) , or if you 're lucky/very good/have work experience as an ANIOS you can enter a 3-6 year residency program , which will make you an *AIOS* ( you see the 'n ' for 'not ' is missing ) . There is no match system , you have to apply for a spot through regular means . After that , you 're a full fledged specialist and have to find work somewhere . Please note that to become a GP you also have to specialise . **Other notes . ** At a lot of faculties it 's possible to do a rotation abroad . At some faculties , there is a special 4-year med school programme for people who degrees in e.g . biochem- which is a lot more like your premed/med structure . I 'm not completely with all the differences between this programme and the US programme . However , they generally accept less than 30 students each year ( compared to ~300 regular 1st years ) . **So , I hope you enjoyed this read . ** Ask any question you like !",Germanic,Dutch

16dollars,SuicideWatch,"This reply is intended for you OP but I hope that some other lurker out there as well will benefit of it . 1 . In a relationship , be it a love , friendly or family one , there is a minimum of two persons . What a lot of us tend to forget is the amount of responsibility you have to take , or should *not* take , to maintain one . If you 're the one who is always calling your `` friend '' , maybe you should reconsider your friendship with this person ? Move on and try to find someone who cares for you . It may be a cliché but look at it from another perspective . You 're not boring - the people who do n't want to spend time to get to know you are . Basically - **if they do n't want to be your friend - fuck 'em . Their loss and not yours . ** Try contacting someone you have n't spoken to in a long time . I can almost guarantee that they 'll be happy that you reach out . Just have a chat and if it feels good take it a step further and meet . Just have a beer together , play some xbox or whatever you enjoy . And then you repeat . And repeat . And repeat . And then you reconnect with another person . And repeat . 2 . Have you tried internet dating ? It may sound a bit cheesy but it seems that a lot of people get something out of it . And if a date does n't work out , maybe you 've at least made a new friend ? 3 . Do you play any video games ? Voice chat is a minor social interaction but it still makes you connect with other people . Plus you 'll have something to talk about . A big warning though - excessive amount of playing video games can send you down an evil spiral ... Use it as a compliment and **not** a complete substitute for social interaction . 4 . Get out and do stuff . Take a cooking class , learn how to scuba dive , join the local bowling team . It 's the small things that keep you from killing yourself . Just think of it for a second . Suppose you actually took a cooking class . Ok , so you have to get there . You have to meet a bunch of new people and you get to cook something . Talk to some of the people there . Try something like `` hey , we should team up next week since our meatballs were so damn good '' . This means that you have to show up next week . Or one person will wonder what happened to you . You learn how to scuba dive . Sign up for a day trip with your club . Your [ buddy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_diving ) is going to ask you to pick him up at 11am . If you do n't show up two people will now wonder what happened to you . You join the local bowling team . Next sunday is your first game . If you do n't show up 10 people will wonder what happened to you . Maybe you feel that you have nothing in life that is worth living for . But try filling it with *something* and some good may come out of it . I 've been trying to live like this for the last couple of years and it does make a difference . I think you should give it a try , what do you have to lose ? Yes , I 'll admit that some days I still just want to put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger . But knowing that *someone* will miss you if you die can be a comfort albeit a small one .",Germanic,Swedish

The defense of America in WWII , since the Empire of Japan bombed America . But fighting in Europe and fighting towards Japan past Hawaii was n't protecting any American 's freedoms . Wars against pirates and Indians would also count as protecting Americans , although at some point you 've got to stop wandering into dangerous places and expecting your government to rescue you .

I do , in fact , believe that failing morally is the only acceptable solution , if the alterEnglish is succeeding immorally . This is not a debate about the necessity of deontology , because we 'd both be preaching to the choir . What I do disagree with is the notion that stating a preference for more freedom is immoral . A man who is being violently assaulted is not being immoral by begging the gang to only take his possessions , nor is he consenting to the theft : he is trying to reduce the magnitude of the violence he is being subjected to . He has no moral obligation to accept death at the hands of his assailants . Consider a different example . Say that you and nine other people are kidnapped by some gang , lined up against a wall , and told that you **will** be shot . You know that it is a certainty . The gang outmans you , outguns you and has you tied up so tight you can barely breathe . But for some reason , this unfortunate group of ten is told that , if they hold a vote and the majority agrees , they will only be beaten savagely , but will not be killed . Sure , accepting death at the hands of the gang is not immoral , and no man can be called immoral for **inaction** , but voting to be beaten instead of shot is also not immoral . You are not voting to reduce someone 's freedom to increase yours , you are voting for a net increase in freedom . Voting **to increase the oppression of others** is immoral , as it is the same as hiring a thug to beat up your neighbor . But voting **to decrease the oppression of others** is not immoral . If , tomorrow , a bunch of people formed the Anarcho-Capitalist party and claimed that , upon victory , they would immediately dismantle the oppression of the state , it would surely not be immoral to support them ?",Greek,Greek

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant , if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . — In this formulation , I do not imply , for instance , that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies ; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion , suppression would certainly be unwise . But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force ; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument , but begin by denouncing all argument ; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument , because it is deceptive , and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols . We should therefore claim , in the name of tolerance , the right not to tolerate the intolerant . We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law , and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal , in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder , or to kidnapping , or to the revival of the slave trade , as criminal. ” ― Karl Popper , The Open Society and Its Enemies",Greek,Greek

Anywho here are some sources . https : //carybankruptcy.com/blog/are-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy & gt ; After graduation , college students sometimes find themselves earning less money than expected and monthly student loan payments can quickly become quite troublesome . As stated above , ordinarily student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , but filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection may offer some assistance if graduates find themselves falling behind on student loan payments . Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects borrowers from having to repay student loans during the pendency of the chapter 13 plan . & gt ; & gt ; The only way a debtor can discharge either federally subsidized or private student loans is to prove that that repaying the student loan debt would impose an undue hardship . This is done by filing an adversary proceeding ancillary to the debtor ’ s bankruptcy case . The Brunner test is currently used in the Fourth Circuit , which includes the Eastern District of North Carolina , and requires that three conditions be met . First , the debtor must prove that a minimal standard of living can not be maintained while repaying the student loans . Second , other conditions must exist that suggest that the debtor ’ s poor financial circumstances will persist for a large percentage of the student loan repayment period . Finally , the debtor must prove that a good faith effort has been made to repay the loans prior to filing for bankruptcy . Fulfilling all of these requirements is difficult , but not impossible . http : //www.totalbankruptcy.com/overview/basics/student-loans-in-bankruptcy.aspx- - & gt ; Generally speaking , student loans are non-dischargeable debts that can not be eliminated through bankruptcy ; however , there are some rare exceptions . & gt ; & gt ; Prior to the bankruptcy law change in 2005 , student loans owed to private non-profit institutions were dischargeable , but the new bankruptcy law closed that exception . & gt ; & gt ; Currently , the only way to eliminate student loans in a bankruptcy is to file an adversary with the bankruptcy court and demonstrate that the student loans impose an `` undue hardship '' on you or your dependents . & gt ; & gt ; To learn whether your student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy , fill out the below form to talk to one of our sponsoring bankruptcy lawyers for free : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; The `` Undue Hardship '' Exception & gt ; & gt ; Bankruptcy judges have interpreted the `` undue hardship '' exception very favorably towards student loan lenders , and disability or other extreme circumstances are typically required to successfully eliminate student loans . & gt ; & gt ; A majority of jurisdictions require you to demonstrate the following : & gt ; & gt ; Repayment of the student loan would prevent you from maintaining an adequate standard of living & gt ; Your financial situation is unlikely to improve & gt ; You have made a good faith effort to repay the student loan & gt ; Adversary proceedings to determine the dischargeability of student loans can resemble a `` mini-trial '' and can be very time-consuming and complex . & gt ; & gt ; Accordingly , legal fees can be substantial and difficult to afford , especially for someone facing `` undue hardship '' . & gt ; & gt ; Chapter 13 and Student Loans & gt ; & gt ; Student Loans can be included in the 3-5 year repayment plan of your Chapter 13 bankruptcy , but you will be responsible for any remaining balance upon the completion of your bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; Anywhere from 10 % to 100 % of your student loan may be included in your bankruptcy , depending on your assets , debts , and income . & gt ; & gt ; Including your student loans in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers many protections and may provide you with short-term relief from collection activity . & gt ; & gt ; While you are in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , the student loan creditors are prohibited from adding any interest or penalties to your pre-petition debt and can not garnish your wages or place liens on your property . & gt ; & gt ; You can also request that the bankruptcy court make a final determination on the proper amount owed if there is a dispute as to the correct balance of the student loan . & gt ; & gt ; Speak to a Bankruptcy Lawyer Today & gt ; Student Loan Eligibility After Bankruptcy & gt ; & gt ; Generally speaking , a bankruptcy filing will not affect your eligibility for federal student loans . & gt ; & gt ; These government loans are based on need , not credit , and federal lenders are prohibited from denying a student loan solely based on your bankruptcy determination . & gt ; & gt ; However , federal lenders are allowed to consider your credit history since the bankruptcy when determining your willingness to repay the loan . They may also deny a request for further loans if your student loan is in default and not included in a repayment plan . & gt ; & gt ; Private student loan lenders may consider a previous bankruptcy filing when determining eligibility . & gt ; & gt ; Maintaining good credit after bankruptcy , repaying old student loans , and demonstrating a steady income are all factors that could influence a private lender to grant you a student loan even after a bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; A parent 's bankruptcy filing generally does not affect their children 's eligibility for a student loan , unless they are required as a cosigner on the loan . & gt ; & gt ; Debt After Graduation & gt ; & gt ; Of those students who do take out loans to finance their undergraduate education , some studies show that the average student loan debt is $ 20,000 . While most loans allow for a grace period for recent graduates , the likelihood of finding a full-time position that pays well enough for recent graduates to pay their loan bills is becoming increasingly slim . & gt ; & gt ; Advocates for student loan reform say that by eliminating subsidies to private lenders , the government will be able to make more Pell grants for low-income students while offering loans with fairer terms for those who require them . & gt ; & gt ; The above summary is by no means all-inclusive and is not legal advice .

Alithinos,quake,"I had make a pause in playing games and keeping up with gaming news lately for some time . Then all of a sudden I spotted this video on youtube while searching for other stuff , by Youtube recommendations , and he convinced me to look out for the beta . So I downloaded it . Now the game has some potential , but I noticed some things that in unison made my experience not enjoyable with it . : ( I 've been playing Quake 3 and Live for quite some years mind ... But the negatives can still be fixed , if Bethesda is willing to make the game more enjoyable . I hope they do fix it . Here are the negatives , of course IMHO . 1 ) Netcode is bad . I had a good ping ( 60 ) and the things happening to my screen were messed up . I 'd die and the death animation of my character would play before even the enemy 's shoot animation played . I 'd obviously hit enemies , but the game would n't register some of my hits ... Messed up . 2 ) Perhaps I would n't have a problem with the powers , if the game actually explained what they do and how to use them properly . It does n't . Some empty maps to practice and better explanations would n't go amiss . 3 ) In the beta there is a considerable lack of options . At least to what I 've been used to playing QL . For example I always had the option to auto-equip guns if newer or better . Now there is n't such an option , as there also are n't other options . 4 ) I want dedicated servers and a server browser . We are not playing in consoles , we play on computers . This match making is n't good . 5 ) What are player 's levels supposed to mean ? What is their function ? Does a player who is higher level than me has more health or something like that ? The game does n't tell you . If so , why does the game place people of different levels on the same games ? 6 ) I 'm one of those people that do n't like how the game has meters counting down the spawn time for power ups , and it has that voice telling everybody about power up spawns . I also did n't liked it in QL . Because that gets everyone too focused on power ups . So I saw the players all gathering up on the exact same room , where Quad Damage was , and all the fighting took place there , with people fighting over who is going to get QD . The rest areas of the map were empty , were not played . This became predictable and old rather quickly . And unpredictability was one of the things that made QL enjoyable for me . 7 ) Long loading times . Especially the initial one . I thought the game hanged up and killed it and restarted 3 times , before searching about it on the internet and discovering that that 's how it is supposed to work . So these were my personal complaints . Hope they fix this game 'cause it would be a pity to not fix it , because I think it has potential .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,religion,"You remind me of myself some years ago . The first thing that seemed to me closer to how I felt inside me about God , was closer to the believes of Quakers , than that of the Orthodox Christianity , which I grown with . Yet I ended up myself in Platonism - Neoplatonism . The reason I started believing in this theology is because several years after I had envisioned a very 'weird ' dream , I read about the Neoplatonic beliefs , and I had this weird feeling of surprize one feels , when he reads in a book a very detailed analysis of things and concepts he saw in his own dream . Perhaps if I knew what the theology of Plato and his successors before seeing what I thought was a 'dream ' , I would believe that it was just my own imagination , my brain playing me tricks . But seeing what I saw before even knowing that Neo-platonism existed , and discovering about 10 years later that what I had seen was supposedly a beafitic vision that many other people had seen too in the antiquity and wrote books about it , made me invest time in studying the theology started by Plato , and much to my surprize , it seems to make sense . In the believes of Platonic & amp ; Neoplatonic theology , the Universe and everything in it derived from the One . The One is not a 'god ' like the 'gods ' that go by the names Zeus or Hera , and the One is n't even a 'God ' like that of Christianity , who is depicted as an old guy with a white beard . According to Platonism , the Creator of the Universe was a single being called `` The One '' , that consisted of three parts : Aither ( Divine Essence ) Nous ( Intelligence ) World Soul ( A fiery spiritual substance that is included on everything in the Universe ) According to Platonism , the Soul of a human originates from the World of Souls , also known as `` The Realm of Ideas '' , which is said that The One , and the gods such as Zeus etc , exist on . The Soul falls from Heaven if it wills the pleasures of the material world , and thus it materializes on Earth . Since that , the Soul gets trapped in a long circle of reincarnating in the material world , and to escape the material world and live forever in the Heavens , one would have to live his life ignoring material wealth and pleasures , and excercizing and perfecting the attributes of his or her divine part , the Soul . The Soul is said to appear on visions as a fiery , pulsing energy that carries the Intelligence of an individual person and is what makes the human body 'alive ' . When a human dies and he could n't avoid being dragged on by the material pleasures , then his or her Soul drinks the water of Oblivion , forgets everything , and joins the material world in a new body . If a human dies , and he followed the way of life suggested by the belief system , then his Soul wo n't drink the water of Oblivion , but the water of Memory instead , and will come back to a new body , but will keep all the memories from the last time it lived , and if a human manages to live rightfully for 3 lives , he releases his soul from the trap , and gets to live on Heaven , along with the gods , and the One .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"'Your ' reputation may sound like property , but it is a misleading linguistic construct that does not properly elaborate its meaning . The phrase 'my reputation ' is just a convenient shorthand for 'the reputation *about* me ' . It is , in fact , a collection of thoughts of *other* people about your person . As you can not be said to own a person or their thoughts , you can not claim ownership of 'your ' reputation . If reputation can not be owned , then to 'smear ' it is not an initiation of aggression , as no property is being damaged . The idea that you invest in your reputation is also shorthand , and it does not represent its meaning well . You have taken actions to make others think more favorably of you , but there is no guarantee that they will ! For example , Hillary could gift me a million dollars , and I would still think terribly of her . She has invested in her reputation , but like any investment , there is no guarantee of return . You already addressed this , but I believe it is important to clarify . That is not to say that lying is a good thing . But as it does not constitute aggression , it can not be answered with violence . You *can* exclude liars from the community through voluntary contract with others , of course .",Greek,Greek

The ends do not justify the means , no matter how important they are , because again , *you can not measure utility objectively* . Lets take your example further : how many rapes are a fair trade-off to save the human species ? Would a million do ? A billion ? Every single human on Earth ? & gt ; The flip side question to is why , in your morality , is rape bad ? Why is rape immoral ? I believe I explained it above . The only logical justification against rape is the same as for any other right : the right to hold property . I own my body , therefore , I am the only person who can decide who uses it and how . In that regard , I am justified to use force to defend my property from aggression . It is an elegant , consistent explanation that applies in all conceivable cases .",Greek,Greek

In addition , with the unlimited access to information in today 's era , putting out BOLOs and ostracism reports for the whole world to see has become as easy as pushing a button . We should n't kid ourselves by wishfully thinking that Ancapistan would be a utopia . There will still be murders . But for those cases where private defense agencies fail ( which I believe will be very rare due to market pressure ) , the freedom to defend one 's property comes into play . In the end , I am not saying that murderers should not be killed .

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"1 . First , I would like to argue that compulsory education is not a necessity . In fact , it is overwhelmingly ineffective and a waste of money and time , time that would be best spent learning a trade or focusing on what the individual is good at . Forcing a math prodigy to sit through five hours of literature a week is only going to waste his/her potential and drive him/her away from both literature and from learning itself . As to where the education would come from , there are many answers . Private charity can and will take care of the poorest , as it has done since before the existence of governments , and without taxation to steal a percentage of their income , people will be more inclined to donate to a cause they see as worthy . In addition , private education institutions have a market incentive to procure the best and brightest in the ranks of their alumni , which is why they are even today offering scholarships . And of course there is the matter of self-organized teaching , where parents in a community can organize their own classrooms by pitching in , or teaching their strengths . 2 . The same as above . Charity has improved the lives of billions in the past few decades , and hospitals have a market incentive to reach out to the community . Plus , there is health insurance , which would no doubt be very cheap in a free , cut-throat market . 3 . The market , of course . If roads are such a necessity for modern life and trade , then people will gladly pay to use them ( which they already do , just indirectly ) . Or , new ways to transport persons and goods will be developed under the forces of the free market . 4 . I would argue that the government has failed at protecting us from terrorists so far . But even so , private security can do a far better job than the police , because its survival depends on its success . Consider this : if the police/military/FBI/NSA fails , they blame a lack of resources and so they are given more funding - they profit from their failure . If a private security contractor fails , it is going to lose its reputation , its contracts and its share in the market . 5 . Nobody . People are free to live their life in whatever way they wish , under whatever values they personally adhere to , as long as they do not initiate the use of violence . 6 . You are probably sick of this answer by now , but , the market . In a free market , racism is insanely unprofitable : you are willingly forfeiting potential paying customers , and your non-racist competitor is free to take advantage of that vacuum . You may not like blacks/whites/latinos/gays/gingers , and that is your right , but money does n't smell . Otherwise , oh well , you are free to do what you want - just do n't come crying when your competitor uses buzzwords like 'equality ' to crush you . In the end , the purpose of libertarianism is not to answer all of these questions - it is not a way of life . It is simply the belief that everyone can choose the way of life that they want , and they are then free to sort these issues out either on their own or in voluntary cooperation .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"'Pure bad luck ' ? What the fuck ? I acknowledge that luck plays a role . It may even play a significant role . But you ca n't say that it 's pure bad luck that makes people poor , or at the very least you ca n't prove it with any degree of certainty higher than attributing poverty to poor choices and bad management of money . Most 'poor ' are not homeless with barely a set of clothes . They are caught in a cycle of poverty of their own making ( poor choices in education , lack of marketable skills , criminal records ) that is propagated by their own behavior ( expensive vices like alcoholism , smoking , gambling , overspending on non-essentials ) and exacerbated by the state . Remember that laws like minimum wage were not implemented to 'protect the workers ' , but to force blacks into poverty by making it impossible for them to compete with whites . The war of drugs has destroyed urban communities and ruined the lives of 'criminals ' that harmed nobody . Mutual aid societies , which provided affordable healthcare insurance to the poor , were legislated away by the government . Drug patents upheld by the state prevent competition from reducing pharmaceutical prices . The solution is not more state . The solution is *less* state in every sector . Some examples are to get rid of the government enforced monopoly of the AMA and allow physicians licensed in other countries to work in the US , get rid of patent laws , remove all barriers to entry in the insurance market and for the love of god privatize Medicare/Medicaid after breaking them to smaller companies . They are the single most important problem with US healthcare : if they are willing to pay anything for a drug/operation/etc. , then hospitals/pharmaceuticals will charge as high as possible , thus setting the price floor for the rest of the insurance companies .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,explainlikeimfive,"Our bodies constantly generate a lot of heat because of our metabolism . So we have to constantly lose heat to maintain our normal temperature . If you put a bucket of warm water outside , and that warm water just happened to be 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit , but the outdoor temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit , the water would cool down . That 's because the outdoor temperature , while still warm , is cooler than the temperature of the water . Heat naturally flows from warmer places to cooler places . The heat 's `` goal '' is to reach equilibrium–a state where everything is the same temperature as everything that surrounds it . That 's why a hot bowl of soup or a cold glass of soda will eventually reach room temperature if you leave them out long enough . The difference between you and a bucket of water ( well , one of many differences ) is that your body is constantly generating more heat . All that heat has to go somewhere , so it tries to escape through your skin . The greater the difference between the outside temperature and the temperature of your body , the faster that heat will escape .

Your body is a factory , one that requires a constant input of food , water and oxygen , and has a very narrow range of operating temperatures . If that factory stops working because it runs out of input or the temperature is too hot or too cold , you die . In order to survive , you have to labor for shelter , food , water and clothes . *You can freely choose to not eat , or not drink , or to sleep in the ice . * With every breath you take , you are making a conscious , uncoerced choice to keep on living . *Nobody is forcing you to stay alive* . If you want to lay under the stars and await for your inevitable death by dehydration , nobody is going to stop you . To claim that your metabolism is oppressive is absurd . In such an island , where you are alone , you are free . You may not be comfortable , and you may not be safe , but you have complete freedom over your actions and your only 'laws ' are the laws of physics . *You determine your own fate every second by not giving up* . Do you see my point ? Nature ca n't oppress you , because a crime requires two persons , a perpetrator and a victim . Nature is certainly *not* a person , as it has no free will . It is merely a system of biological interactions . Capital ca n't oppress anyone either , as it is not a person . *You own yourself regardless of context . * Even in your dying breaths , where you have no food , no water and no shelter , you own yourself and the consequences of your ( in ) actions . If I own everything else , you still own yourself . But lets get back to the whole metabolism thing . Obviously man wo n't stop *needing* food , water and shelter , no matter how hard we whine . **Somebody will have to produce these for as long as we live in a world of scarce resources ( aka forever ) ** . For that reason , the phrase `` each man should be free from the constraint of laboring for basic things '' is nonsensical : **someone will not be free from that constraint** , or *everybody starves* .",Greek,Greek

In conclusion I think that both parties could potentially be at fault . If the events that hire RL want him to be a bit more measured in his casting and he does n't do that , then yes blame him all you want for that one , but if the events that hire him want him to be 100 % himself , then it 's time for the community to do some research on freaking cultures and realise that he is n't really doing anything wrong .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"The books of the Bible were written by humans . Enlightened perhaps , but still humans . And each one tried to communicate what he knew / saw / the best way he could . As for people not getting what they pray for , I must ask : Did they followed Jesus 's path before asking from him anything ? Did they gave away their riches ? Did they forgiven the people they hated ? Did they helped other people without expecting anything in return ? Did they removed their pride becoming humble ? If not how can they say that Jesus is a liar ? You have to show some good will , to give something to get something in return . Years ago my father lost consience . I was terrified seeing him on the bed with his eyes open , not talking , not responding to anything . The doctors told us that his body could n't do the body functions and thus his condition was critical and that he had hours left . My mother insisted that he gets in life support system . Even with the life support system the doctors told us that his days were few and he would n't 'wake up ' . But my mother insisted . My father was in a comma with life support almost a year . And on 15th of August , the Saint Mary 's day for us Orthodox Christians I prayed to Madonna . The next day he woke up . He could talk . Doctors told us they did n't expected it and they were surprized . After some more days in ICU , he was able to come back to our house . And he lived long enough , about 10 years more after that . You can argue that this was a coincidense and what not , but for me it was getting what I asked through praying . If you are a good person and you do good deeds and help people , good will come back to you , even in ways you do n't expect . As for interpretation in the New Testament , the only points were there are things left to interpretation are Jesus 's parables , and John 's Revealation . Everything else is written historically and is to be taken literaly .",Greek,Greek

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Abstract Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass . Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs , the principle of specificity , which states that adaptations are specific to the nature of the applied stimulus , dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others . Research is lacking , however , as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains . The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program versus a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects . 17 young men were randomly assigned to either an HT group that performed 3 sets of 10RM with 90 seconds rest or an ST group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with 3 minutes rest . After 8 weeks , no significant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii . Significant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat . In conclusion , this study showed both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size , but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24714538/",Greek,Greek

For the layman that means that , oats lack some of the essential amino acids and thus they should be paired with a more complete source .

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"The two sexes have both similarities and differencies . One is better at some particular things , the other in the other . It just happens that what the female is better at , is more important that what the male is better at . My view as to why women are superior differs from the views of some other members of this sub-reddit , but I do believe in female supremacy . Unlike snowy_angels I do n't believe that men are inherently evil , neither that the aggresivenes Misandr4eva writes about is instinctual , but I do believe that our world has gone way in the wrong direction and is sick . So why women are superior ? Because they give life . Sounds simple and ordinary ha ? Think about it a little more . You live because of a woman . Your mother and father got to live because of women too . The universe hatched out of the Cosmig Egg , also known as the first and single matterial body that consisted of all the matter before the Bing Bang . And I ask you , who gives birth to eggs ? Exactly . Woman is blessed to create life , and is n't that a miracle ? And do n't forget that a woman can get impregnated even without a man . We are not required for the species to keep existing , they do . And what do you realise once you analyze and think of that ? That we are inferior . But that 's not bad , not necessarily . You ask how can female supremacy not be hate speech , and I answer to you , that not only it is n't hate speech ( some might came to defend female supremacy because of hate towards men , but that 's not the rule ) , but for me its the opposite : love speech . And why it is Love Speech ? Here are 3 arguments : 1 ) Supremacy does n't necessarily means or include hate , abuse , or exploitation . That is a fallacy caused because the most famous supremacist did all these ( and even more ) , and I refer to that psycho , Shitler . But forget about him . Think of the cats , and dogs , and inanimate objects like chairs and computer keyboards . They are INFERIOR , and we acknowledge it , as we also acknowledge that Humans are superior to them . But that does n't mean that we hate cats or keyboards . Nor that we want to exterminate them or abuse them . I love cats , and keyboards . And acknowledging my superiority to them does n't make me hate them . 2 ) Men have ruled Earth and women for quite some long time . We had our time , our try . Would n't it be just if we now backed off and let women to take over and rule Earth and men ? I believe that this would be justice , and that we owe it to them , that it 's their turn now . 3 ) Do n't you love the one responsible for being alive ? It is women that bring us to life . Should n't we be thankful about it , and respect them and love them for it ? And I do n't mean our mothers specifically , I talk in general . Should n't we love , respect , and be thankful ? I think we should . And tell me , which is better way to show love , other than putting aside our ego , and letting love flood our bodies from toes to head , and recognize the reality , that it is women who create life , that they are our creators , that we owe them our lives , and that we do n't have such abilities , and alone we would be worthless and could n't keep our species surviving , and that respect , and love and servitude towards them , as also them having a higher say and taking charge in our families , and later outside , is justifiable because of all of that . To put aside your ego and recognize your place us a man is one of the atmost actions of love . And I 'm not talking about the love between only one man and one woman , I 'm talking about daily feelings of love for all women , loving Life herself . And I say herself because indeed , in most languages in which a word has to be masculine or feminine , Life has a feminine name , and in all mythologies around the world , Life when personified , is personified as a woman . So recognizing our position is an action of love , as also ... 4 ) Women acknowledging their superiority is also an action of love . Because with superiority comes titles , and with titles come duties and responsibillities . And is n't an action of love for them to take the burden of these off us , by acknowledging their superiority , and accepting their rights/responsibillities ? It is . So there you go .

I 've passed through the state were you boldly and simply talk to people about things that they are not ready to accept because of their disbelief and / or even enviness . And I changed my way of approach so as to not directly speak about the 'hot ' stuff , but reach to that through conversation that is about more mundane , material things . Yet when people realise that even when you are to talk to them about things absolutely plausible according to their own limited understanding of existence that yet require from their part to put their brain in use , they usually avoid getting into such discussions . Because there is a mental illness that is so widespread and common that people do n't even recognize it as an illness and consider it a healthy natural state . And that illness I write about is to attribute way much more importance to unimportant things than they deserve , and focusing on such unimportant things , while ignoring and avoiding the really important .",Greek,Greek

Alithinos,truefemalesupremacy,"Unfortunately there are some mistakes in the article , from pseudo-science arguments dropped to basic fallacies . Here are some : 1 ) Regarding life expectancy . That men will live up to 40 years and women up to 130 is completely made up and does n't have a scientific ground . 2 ) A proper ideology does not take in account technology , and has ideas that can be applied and implemented no matter the available tech . Thus declaring PIV as an illegal activity , is wrong . Because what would you do if for some reason the technology for non-PIV impregnation was lost ? How would the tribes of people in poor countries like south Africa , or the aboriginals of Australia survive ? Clearly not enough thought was put in to this . 3 ) Schools teaching witchcraft ? Seriously ? 4 ) The writer bases her ideology on the fact that suddenly in one day / night the world changes and women all over take over . This ca n't and wo n't happen , if change ever happens , it will happen very slowly and gradualy , from town / city to town / city , from country to country , from continent to continent . We can do two things : Either believe that it will never happen and go crazy and make a joke about it , or believe that we can change the world , and be serious about it , and base the `` what to happen '' on solid grounds . 5 ) Thus you ca n't end wars . Its in the nature of humans . Even matriarchal tribes of people have done wars . Unfortunately that ca n't change . 6 ) You ca n't put an end to countries either . There are women so patriotic and courageous that would grab a rifle , a knife , whatever they can , and defend the ideal of 'country ' with their lives , that make many men feeling embarashed . Take a look at the Kurdish women for example and how they fight ISIS . They are true heroines . 7 ) That vegan part at the end ... We do farm animals because we need them for healthy survival .

Alithinos,BestOfOutrageCulture,"Wow that 's such a huge wall of text , with so many points ! I 'm a Greek living in Greece myself , and I 'll try to answer you , to give you a better idea about your fellow blood-brothers . First of all it seems that you are stereotyping people . `` Arabs wear clothes like these , Greeks were clothes like these , Others wear clothes like these ... '' That 's a stereotype right there . Not all Greeks dress like those you saw at Copenhagen . And you say right there , that 'European looking like immigrants as seen as good ' while others are not , is racism . It 's a far right wing preachery . Which was the Greek movie you watched that bashed 'Europeans ' and praised the people you write about ? Again here you split people to two sides based only on racial / ethnic criteria , like a standard far-right nationalist skinhead would do . Why one would praise Kurds ? Because they have courage and are the only dudes on Earth that fight body with body against ISIS . Because they have ISIS soldiers coming to murder them , and Turkey helping ISIS and bombing them at the same time , yet instead of giving up they fight with courage for their freedom . That 's why . Because they do now what your fellow Greeks did in 1820s to free our country , so today you are free in Scandinavia speaking racist bullcrap instead of being a sex slave in the harem of Ali Pasha being raped every day . So show some respect to people fighting for their freedom perhaps ? Instead of automatically thinking that anyone who has a bit darker skin than you is a subhuman and being envy to Scandinavians because they have brighter skin . Ridiculous . As for the Islandish music sounding Arabic , you are the first one I ever listen to saying this . Arabic songs have a dinstictive difference that becomes immidately recognized when you listen to one : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=QUBvVTNRp4Q If you are an audiophile or listen to more Arabic songs and Greek 'Nisiotika ' songs , you will learn how to immidately recognize which is which from the first seconds they play . Now truth is , that it is common for a number of Greek artists to buy music rights from Arabs to sing Greek on it . Why this is happening ? Well because Arab music is uplifting and easy to dance . And it has nothing to do with Turkey . Turkish music is inherently different with Arab music . Now when it comes to things like these , influences on music , geography plays a considerable role . Perhaps over there in Scandinavia , Scandinavian music is influenced by musics from countries that neighbour Scandinavia , perhaps Russian , or Slavic . Greece neighbors not only with Italy , Albania , FYROM , Bulgaria , and Turkey , but also through the Mediterrenean Sea , with Egypt and Libya too . So to an extent there are influences from there too . Why Greek musicians do n't focus more on being influenced from older Greek music ? Well , the right next older music is Byzantine music . And because that 's Middle-Ages music , and during that time Byzantium was a theocratic Christian Empire , Byzantine music is associated with the Church . If you visit any Church at Greece , you will listen to Byzantine music . And if we had to go even back on time , we would have to use ancient music from the B.C . years . But the common view is that that would be silly . As silly as wearing Spartan armor in everyday life . You say the rebetiko music is becoming popular ? Really ? Were ? Not in Greece in any way . What young modern Greeks really listen to is HIP HOP songs like these : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=VwBj9kg6A7g and https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=rXXzH9oo178 You have to check your facts . Rebetiko is a music genre from 1920s for God 's shake . How many decades back is your idea for Greek people based on ? As for Constantinupolis ... Well that is a very fringe idea here in modern Greece . It 's only a thing some local far-righters say , and the reason is because for 1500 years prior to the Ottomans , Greeks lived in the Roman Empire , and its capital was Constantinupolis . So for some people , who think Greece should continue to regain the place it had prior to the Ottoman invasion , their dream is a new Byzantine Empire . But these people are often seem like outlandish to most modern Greeks . And one more thing : Greece ca n't become a 'Middle Eastern ' country . Because Greece is the spot from wich West and East begins . No really . All countries in the West of Greece are called 'Western ' by the world , and those East of Greece are considered to be 'Eastern ' countries . So practically , Greece will always be IN THE MIDDLE . I am amazed how you did n't noticed that Greeks named the sea around Greece Mesoyios which means `` Middle Earth Sea '' , ( Mediterrenean ) , because Greece has always been in the middle between West and East . And that answers your main question . Greece is n't becoming an Eastern country . Neither a Western one . Greece always was and still is a Center country , sitting right there in the middle . And the oldest account we have for that is the story that says that when Zeus left 2 eagles fly on the opposite directions , they went full circle around Earth and met at Delphi , which is the center of Greece , which is at the middle of the Earth , and thus is considered the geographic center of the Earth . That story is millenia old .",Greek,Greek

Respect for private property is practically null , there are no protections for employers , personal income is taxed at a great percentage from the first cent ( unless you work for the state ... ) , our tax code is several thousand pages long , and business was chased out of the country by increasing regulation . We have never had a proper pro-business government , only the populist right , which used the same voter-bribing tactics as the actual left .

In today 's population of Greece , some Greeks feel more like Romans and related with the Roman / Byzantine Empire , than with the ancients like Socrates and Leonidas . These 'Greeks who feel more Romans than Greeks ' are stuck in the past , and think that the capital city ( Constantinupolis / Istanbul ) of their country ( Byzantium ) is in Turkey . They are dreamers living in a fake reality based of ideals and pictures from the past . Such statements like `` we want the City back '' are ridiculous , and only stupid people tell them . Even if Turkey one day decided to give Istanbul to Greece out of good will , the Greek prime minister who would accept that would be a fool , because Greece as it is now has 10 million population , and Istanbul alone is another 10 millions ... How would all these people in Istanbul get fed ? Greece is already struggling economically to offer what a government usually offers to its people , and its only 10 millions it has to take care of . Istanbul alone would double the expenses of Greece in a single day , and the result would be povetry and hunger for all the 20 millions .

AllAlongTheParthenon,AskHistorians,"Thank you for your answer . Everything you have said has been argued well , even though I disagree with your conclusion . But by no means do I want to claim it is absolutely incorrect . It is a well-known fact that Macedonians being Greeks or not was already debated amongst ancient Greeks . The key word being `` debated '' . However , I have never encountered any Roman source which considers Macedonians to be non-greeks , besides in the reflection of more ancient debates . But I am not a historian . Perhaps you , or some other historian here , can show me otherwise . I apologize because I ca n't help myself but keeping going : The Macedonians participated to the Olympics since Alexander I ( although only their rulers could , which sets them apart ) . They had to use force against southern Greece `` to keep them on their side '' but it 's not like Greeks did n't use force on one another `` to keep the other on their side '' . They were militarily different but so were Thebans , Athenians and Spartans from one another , although perhaps ( ? ) to a lesser extent . You say that it is `` historically incorrect '' to call them Greeks , when it is at the very least highly debatable ( I know wikipedia is not a reliable source , but the discussion on the topic is interesting ) . After all , they claimed to be Greek and spread Greek culture to the whole known world at the time . One could say that they were - quite literally - arguably Greeks . As for the modern Greeks claiming Alexander 's accomplishments , that is , I believe , justified . Modern Greeks are in my opinion more the descendants of the Hellenistic world than of ancient Greeks . Modern Greeks are mostly the cultural descendants of the Greek-speaking people of the Hellenistic kingdoms , the Roman Empire , and later the Ottoman Empire . This means they are ( to a large extent ) the descendants of the people who became hellenized through Alexander 's accomplishments , the ones which made Greek culture so pervasive that , for example , the new testament was originally written in ( Alexandrine ) Greek , or that the Eastern Roman Empire switched its administrative language back to Greek after Justinian . Alexander is , amongst others of course , a founding figure for modern Greeks . That is why he holds such a special place in Greeks hearts , and why we ca n't help ourselves from replying to posts that question him being Greek . Of course , how much any nation can ( or should consider so important to ) `` claim '' accomplishments , especially so remote in time , is also highly debatable .",Greek,Greek

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"Because your question is terrible . No sane man would say that the situation I described is voluntary , because it is not about being able to ~opt out~ using whatever convoluted definition for ~opting out~ you have . For an interaction to be voluntary , the rights of both parties must not be violated ( or threatened to be violated ) in any option . In my example , a house intrusion is not voluntary . I can choose to opt out and save my life by running away , but I make that decision under the threat of physical violence : if I do not run , I will be murdered , and in any case my property will be violated . There is no option in which my rights are respected . Because I just know you are trying to make a parallel to the state , lets examine that . It is easy to draw comparisons between the house intruder and the state : the state 's minions show up in my home one day and demand taxes . If I do not pay , I will eventually be jailed , and if I try to protect by freedom and property , I will be killed . Sure , I can choose to run to Somalia and abandon my home , but *there is still no option in which my rights are upheld* . And before you even think of claiming that the state defines rights , that would mean that the Third Reich had a right to commit genocide on the Jews living in it , a sickening conclusion that only psychopaths and fascists would support . Accepting the state ( or even the majority of the human population ) as the source of rights leads to implications that quite frankly disgust me and anyone with a functional moral compass , and can be used to justify some of the most horrific acts of terror in human history .",Greek,Greek

What worries me about Trump are the following : - His willingness to expand the power of the NSA . http : //thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261673-trump-sides-with-rubio-over-cruz-in-nsa-surveillance - His willingness with losing his shit with the smallest stuff , even with grade D celebrities ( rosie o'donnell for example ) . I am all for speaking your mind and being on point but these kinds of reactions are just bad tactical moves when it comes to dealing with Putin and the likes of him . These kinds of outbursts/reactions are a losing hand when it comes to diplomacy . Whom ever loses his/her shit first is the loser . - His willingness to expand on the definition of what torture is .

Alithinos,Archeology,"What makes me wonder is that none of the `` specialists '' who make statements about what this `` tomb '' is , have talked about a clue , as if they are all oblivious to its existence . The book `` Anthologia Graeca '' contains a poem from `` Antipatrus Thessalniceus '' who lived in the 1st century A.D. written for Amphipolis . In this poem he states that during his time Amphipolis is deserted and that nothing has been left standing , other than `` the temple of the Lady of Braurona and Ethopia '' . Meaning that if this poet is to be taken seriously , then what archeologists have found has to be a temple to a goddess . Of course subterranean temples are very unusuall in the Greek world . The only few that are known were the Necromanteia where necromancy took place , and the temple where the Eleusinian Mysteries took place in Eleusina . I just find it weird that there is a perhaps legit historical account about what the building found on Amphipolis might be , and none of the experts seem to know of or consider .",Greek,Greek

Some are old and some are young , some are smart and some are dumb . In fact , most factors that contribute to inequality are not related to capital at all : a stupid millionaire can quickly become destitute and an intelligent homeless man can potentially become a millionaire . Capital *helps* , but it is not a guarantee , nor is it deterministic . In your example , the first man has an advantage , yes . He used his own labor , risked his own life and applied his own intelligence to create value ( his shelter , walls , etc. ) . The second man ca n't be expected to freeload on the first 's effort . Nobody has a right to *life* , because if that was the case , then it would generate a slave-master relationship by virtue of obligating others to provide for them . But he has options ! *It is hard* can never be an excuse for demanding 'free stuff ' : he can make rain collectors , he can collect fruit rich in water content , he can build a makeshift 'desalination ' device using fire and condensation . *He is solely responsible for providing value for himself* . If he can do neither of these things , he can exchange items or services for access to the clean water : he can offer to hunt , or he can offer to work as a farmer for the first man .

( Al - Pha - Be - Ta ) it becomes obvious that each syllable has itself a meaning , being a root of the Doric dialect . With all the Doric words in line , if we read them , they do make sense , and they form a poem ! A poem that shouts Gods like Helios ( Sun ) , Mene / Selene ( Moon ) and Cronus . Yet its kind of mysterious and do n't know how to interpret it , what 's its deeper meaning . Here is my personal , rough and literal translation : '' Sun 's Light ( gives ) Life to Earth Mother , its force approaches and is thin , we live and wonder the Dawn , and the Father 's teaching . The Moon emits flakes , Oh Moon , Cronus 's thin particles of fire , stably approach , bringing and enstregnthening the Fall Oh , Great ! '' The fact that this poem was hidden all along in the alphabet is exciting , yet it births questions in me and rises my curiosity . Who is the 'Father ' ? Uranus ? Cronus ? Zeus ? What kind of flakes could the Moon emit ? What are Cronus 's particles of fire , and what is the 'fall ' ? In the end , does it says 'O Great ' as we say today 'oh great ! ' or does it refer to someone certain who is 'Great ' , like for example we read on some texts 'O , Someone ... ' ? I 'm out of ideas . My imagination tells me that perhaps at some point something like a metorite could have hit the moon , and debris might have fallen to Earth , and that someone decided to write a poem about it .

The brain does n't like this and stops working properly . To another person outside that looks a lot like the person who got hit in the head is sleepy , which is the first stage of a coma .

However , just because you got hit in the head , it does n't mean there 's a lot , or even any blood , filling your cranium .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't fucking know what to think anymore . I liked her being the ally in this arc ( even if she was the stereotypical princess that helps the SH 's , I liked her way more that the past ones ) and her memories about Lola , the moments she shared with Sanji and all that looked so real that I ca n't really believe she was bad from the beginning , plus the moment when Brook and Pedro saw her choosing a wedding dress she looked like she really wanted to make it to the seducing woods to help Luffy and the rest . Yeah , it looked too good to be true but let 's be honest , there 's a lot of characters that acted kindly with the SHs in every island since they meet them . Just remember Skypiea for example . Also , the way it 's been builded up it looked that some daughters of Big Mom felt like tools and wanted to get out of that ( not just Pudding and Lola , but also Praline and Chiffon ) . If she 's been working for mama since the beginning then she 's such a psychopath specially because Sanji was already tied and he could n't scape . Where is the point into making him falling in love for her then ? Also , why she said it to Luffy and Nami whispering if Opera was the only one there and he is also loyal to Big Mom ? So ... I not 100 % sure that she 's evil . Maybe she wants to make both parties fight each other so Sanji can scape . Maybe even if all that she said was true , it could be that she has two personalities or even that she started all this like what Big Mom planned and then it turned that she ended liking Sanji . After all why Big Mom wants to kill the Vinsmokes ? She would gain not only the technology but also the royal family as allies which are strong warriors . And why she wants to kill them in the ceremony ? I mean , she can kill them now , as we know the Germa kingdom is there so there 's no point into waiting to the wedding . Anyways , it is interesting to see how Oda has introduced us to the Vinsmokes as a kind of arrogant Nazi family which a lot of us hated or wanted Sanji to clean the soil with them and now it turned that I am even afraid that something bad could happen to them . Maybe this will be the path to make them see that Sanji deserved to be treated better when he saves their lives . At the other hand if she is evil then it would be really interesting , specially since it would be completely unique and different compared with the princess in distress we 've been seeing for years now . Having a manipulative and psychopatic female character is one of the things that would make this arc even better , plus it has some logic since with Anana we 've seen that Big Mom teaches her kids into being as cruel as they can , and for the rest of siblings it looks like they are absolutely loyal to her mother . Seriously , this arc is right now the most matured one we 've seen so far . The complexity and diversity of characters , the amount of `` What if.. '' moments it has with every chapter and the way Oda is showing us that the Yonko are at a different league in comparison with the rest of characters we 've seen so far makes this the best arc of the new world and pretty close to Enies Lobby as the best arc of One Piece .",Romance,Spanish

333ml,civilengineering,"Because of the lateral confinement which is present in a plate but is not present in a beam . If you consider a beam elongated along z under a transversal load it will have out of plane displacement , not only in the same direction of the load but in the second plane ( x-y ) too due to Poisson effect . Now in a plate these lateral deflections are prohibited ( that 's why you have internal moments in both directions ) , just imagine the slab as a row of beams which inhibit each other from expanding/shrinking . This change in behavior reflects on the constitutive relations between the resultant stresses and curvature . Consider the case of cylindrical bending , I think it 's the best way to compare the beams to the plates . The relation between the moment and the curvature in the plate is : Mx=DX D is the plate stiffness and equal to Eh^3 /12 ( 1-v^2 ) where h is the plate thickness and X is the curvature . Now consider a beam , the stiffness is EI=Eh^3 /12 . As you can see D is higher that EI ( the Poisson ration is ~0.2 for concrete and ~0.3 for steel ) .",Romance,Italian

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I have a theory that the Kaido-shogun alliance has something to do with the black boats of Matthew Perry , so first of all , I 'm gon na explain it : Imagine that you are the governor of a country that has been closed to the rest of the world for practically 200 years and it starts to grow the discontent between citizens and some political and military . Then some very powerful foreigners come to your shores and threaten you to open the doors to trade . You do it , but it 's obvious an unequal treatment and you go terribly disadvantaged . This happened in Japan in 1853 , and this obvious lack of strength against the `` nanban '' was one of the causes of the fall of the shogunate . Kaido is a Yonko , one of the four pirate emperors of the new world . A country that is not into the world government has a great disadvantage in the new world , because the world government ca n't help you in front of these huge pirates . Then someone like Kaido can just reach Wano and sit on the throne . After all , it is a closed country and quite possibly **what happens in Wano , stays in Wano** , so if he is recruiting an army , obviously there 's no better place that a country with a closed door policy . No one will know what is he doing in there , or even maybe he wants to have some samurais in his army . However , it is sure that Kaido know that the samurais are proud warriors and that they would not accept a `` foreign devil '' being their direct ruler , so he preferred to be allied to the Shogun . In truth , I believe that more than a ally , the Shogun is a puppet for him , something like an intermediary between him and the samurais . This Shogun obviously does have some Daimyos against him , So he needs Kaido to maintain the order in his own country . It is a symbiotic relationship in which however , Kaido wins . I believe too that the beasts pirates are really annoying to the looks of the Wano citizens ( holy fuck , they are called `` beasts '' for something ) : Drinking , breaking things and causing continuous fights . So , you have the conflict here , a Shogun who leaves a bunch of annoying pirates do what they want , while defend him in case there is a revolt of samurais . Btw , obviously he wants someone who could read poneglyphs and Wano is the country of the family who invented them . tl ; dr : Kaido has his entire zoan army in Wano bc the world government has no way to get information of what happens there , he wants the samurais joining his army bc he know how strong they are so he needs the Shogun to control them and he is wanting for someone to read the red poneglyph he has . The Shogun uses the fear that the citizens have for Kaido to maintain control of the country in a safer way .",Romance,Spanish

333ml,civilengineering,"I am doing a master in structural engineering . I have to choose two courses from the following three : * Computational structural analysis ( which I already took ) * Steel structures * Reinforced concrete structures So now the choice is between steel and concrete . I already took concrete in my undergraduate studies ( beam design , column design , one/two way slabs design ) . I never took prestressed or precast concrete structures . I saw the prestressing effect on beams in the computational analysis structure course ( we had to implement the effect in a frame analysis program we had to develop ) . In my graduate university all the course are too theoretical . And most of the topics we talk about do n't have exercises that can be solved manually . And the topics we talk about are not so popular ( maybe I 'm wrong ) , for example Wagner Vlasov beams , or advanced inelastic constitutive laws , or the stability of thin open walled section under torsion using the total potential energy principle with the Green-Lagrange strain tensor and the Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor . So I think this must be taken into account when choosing between the steel and concrete course . My undergraduate studies were in a very bad university in comparison to my graduate university . I would like to attend a higher standard concrete course with the additional PC that I 've never seen . But I would also like to learn about steel structures since I do n't know much about them , and a structural engineer most probably should know about both steel and concrete . I ca n't register for one course and attend both , not because it 's not allowed but because of the schedule ( both are given at the same time ) . I would love to hear your opinions/advice . **EDIT** : I think it 's important to add that I intend on doing phd studies after I finish my masters degree .",Romance,Italian

That gives you the impression that you 're interested in her but at the same time that you 're listening to what she 's saying . This avoids the feeling of the `` guy that just wants sex '' ( believe me , a girl can feel this just as the way you look at her ) . You need to look at her eyes like they are an artwork , but without looking like a wasted dude . If she can do the same or she avoids it but smiles , then it 's a good sign .

But what makes Sanji different to his brothers is that he can feel emotions and thus emphatize with them . He could even feel sorry for them . Maybe I 'm the only one that would want this to happen , but I think that it would be great if he could forgive them at the end of the arc so we could see them working together and Ichiji , Niji and Yonji recognizing that Sanji is strong enough to be respected . After all what we 've seen , defeating them would be just an eye for eye , and Sanji 's way better than that . Also , we already know that he 's more powerful that Yonji and Niji and possibly Ichiji . Sanji wants to save his sister , so he would need to tell what 's going on to his brothers in the case that Luffy and the others do n't show up until the wedding day . Surely his brothers would not believe him but sooner of later they would end working together . How could this end with the brothers respecting Sanji ? Easy .

The military said in a statement that the Syrian families left the makeshift camps in the northeastern border town of Arsal in a convoy of 30 civilian vehicles . They were accompanied by the Lebanese Army until the last military checkpoint on the outskirts of the area , The army said that the departure follows a `` high interest of the families '' to return to their homeland . Local media reported that the convoy comprised of 50 Syrian families . The families left through north and northeast Lebanon , the latter route going through the Lebanese border town of Tfail . Local Al-Jadeed TV reported that around 500 families are expected to return to Syria following `` reconciliations in Qalamoun and the Damascus countryside , and the militants leaving to Idlib . '' In February , Hezbollah 's media spokesperson told The Daily Star that the party is mediating the return of Syrian refugees from Arsal border area to their villages in the Qalamoun region in Syria in talks with Syrian opposition group Saraya Ahl al-Sham . MP Nawwar Saheli had told The Daily Star that `` it won ’ t be formal until the Lebanese government contacts the Syrian government . For now , it ’ s indirectly between Hezbollah and opposition groups. ” The Lebanese government estimates that around 1.5 million Syrian refugees live in unofficial camps around the country in deteriorating economic conditions – which Lebanon was already suffering prior to the refugee crisis .",Romance,Italian

He can empathize with them a bit or maybe leave the grudge he has aside for a greater good : To save Reiju . Leaving them to die would not solve the Vinsmoke drama either . He needs to solve the problems he has with his family . If they die it 's like he has done nothing to solve the issues he was going to solve back when this arc began . If he either kicks them then what 's next ? Yonji was in fact defeated off screen and it seemed like Sanji did it without blinking . If it was n't for Judge using that wall think he would have been defeated too . Also , with Niji he gave up because Zeff was in danger . The only one that imo could be strong enough is Ichiji and it 's just an assumption based on the fact that he seems to be the leader . The truly problem here is Judge , not the brothers . Sanji holds a grudge to the family as an extent for all the shit they did to him , but particularly to his father , which imo is the real conflict here . The whole family wo n't die after all , because it 's been hinted that they will show up at the reverie . So if Judge dies this arc , Reiju could lead the Germa .",Romance,Spanish

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"& gt ; The white horse representing the victory of Christianity was a creation of one mans interpretation in the second century . You could even call it his personal `` head canon '' . True , yet is was the main interpretation given by the roman theologists then and that interpretation survived to our days . Sure , originally the white horse was a representation of the romans since they conquered Palestine but that does n't mean that the other interpretations are wrong since we 're talking about a religion that has splitted a lot in different creeds since it was born . Luther and Calvin diverged from the point of view of the catholic dogma , same happened with orthodox , the coptic church or the ones that followed the arrianism . Religion is always opened to interpretations , and that 's why it has split so much over the centuries . Hell , do n't forget that christianism originally splitted from juddaism . But anyways , if we take into account the fact that the white horseman 's main representation was conquest like you aptly said , Shanks still fits with the concept : 1 - He 's known to have conquered the new world since he was part of Roger 's crew . 2 - He 's been shown to be the strongest user of Conqueror 's Haki till now . & gt ; You 're also wrong about big mom being introduced in the current arc .

I modified my skills to what it suggested though . I still do n't understand why the guide says not to do hatred . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but enemy xp is based on their base hp . If you end at X hp no matter what , should n't the hatred skill not really matter ? If anything , it gives you a multiplier bonus and ends the game earlier . Assume you can kill 1e50 .

You can run the math , turns out Hatred 1 loses by & gt ; 10 % , higher is worse . & gt ; I am guessing it has to do with the max hp chart , but I thought enemies max out at something crazy like 10^333 hp .

It turns out , if you want GR to match what we see , you can not take L to be 0 , but it 's got to have a certain tiny value .

L then reappears in the equation for the age of the universe , we plug it in and do the math , no funny business anywhere . The interpretation of L , now , it 's difficult . It turns out that L is on the same side of the equation as the densities/pressures of matter and radiation , so we think about L not as some wavy factor , but as the density/pressure of a strange kind of `` energy '' ( hence the name `` dark energy '' ) . But we know of no kind of particle/field/whatever that can produce the observed density/pressure of the dark energy , so for now we simply measure it and put it manually in Einstein 's equation .

I 've received and installed my `Sapphire r9 380x` this week , with crimson drivers right away , as they were made available tuesday and card arrived wednesday . PSU is `Corsair HX750i` , which is overkill , so I do not suspect power . Board is `Asus Z97MPLUS`with current fw . Running `Windows 10 Pro` . I 'm experiencing these issues : * System crashes while running `folding @ home` ( with gpu only ; I used to run it cpu only before I had gpu ) . After running for a while ( seconds , minutes at most ) , mouse freezes , screen powers off , does n't recover . `Furmark` seems to be fine . * Playing games that the GPU can more than handle ( `Fairy Fencer F` ) with vsync on ( to prevent tearing ) , GPU underclocks itself , which causes game to stutter for a while when entering scenes that use the GPU more . * In `The Witcher 1` , with everything set to max , GPU is too fast ( & gt ; 60fps ) causing it to tear heavily . Game does n't have a vsync option , so tried to force it via a game profile and via the global profile , to no avail . I 'm therefore unable to play this game ( as I ca n't stand tearing ) . Edit : I 've verified `D3DOverrider` does the trick . It 's sad a third party tool is needed . It would help my peace of mind if I knew I was not alone in these issues . I am wondering whether to wait for next crimson driver release , or to remove them and use whatever was available before crimson .",Romance,Spanish
12345ieee,AskReddit,"& gt ; In the known universe , sure . I 'm not entirely convinced about the theory that the universe created 1 % more matter than anti-matter at the creation of itself . AFAIK , the matter-antimatter imbalance is still unexplained . Known CP violation sources are still not enough to cover it all . & gt ; I think the chance that a majority of matter/anti-matter destroyed itself and then the rest of the matter and anti-matter never made contact is more likely . & gt ; With this hypothesis , it 's more likely that there is another half of the universe that is entirely anti-matter . I 'm not a theoretical physicist though , so I 'm not sure if there is more evidence or proof of the 1 % theory . This would go against the cosmological principle , while we do n't have evidence in either way , I think the other theory is more likely to be right .",Romance,Italian

Also that would be weird since we already know how Big Mom acted with Pudding when she was a child . If she suffered bullying or something like that I 'm sure that she would have never acted like that with her own child later . My own theory is that her fathers did something absolutely terrible that went against the laws of Elbaf . We know that Elbaf is a country based on viking tales and that honor is a big part of their culture , so I imagine that it could have something to do with that . Then she became an orphan and ended up under the protection of Mother Carmel . She has this enormous amount of children not only because she uses them as tools to make alliances , but because she has an enormous need to feel surrounded by a true family .",Romance,Spanish

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Hello , I recently started playing this game and I 've enjoyed it quite a bit , but I 'm a little confused on the next steps I should take . I am wizard level 2.3k and have just started some endurance runs . Hi & gt ; Lately , I get bored cuz it takes too damn long with lag , and I stop enraging and just send all waves . I 've made it to wave 372 in endurance . Is there any way to reduce lag ? Get all your settings to min . Short of that , nothing to be done , game is in Flash , the engine itself is shitty . & gt ; Maybe by modding the game to change the sprites of all the enemies to small boxes or something ? You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; However , I 'm not exactly sure how I should spend skills optimally . I saw a guide on steam that ranked skills in level of importance , but it did n't mention how many unused points to save . Right now I have almost all capped skills maxed out ( just the spells left at 30+15 ) and all non-capped skills at 30+15 ( the important ones at least ) . Said guide is mine . You have to leave enough unspent points so you have enough mana at the start . I do n't play for you , you have to find a balance . & gt ; I am also curious how people enrage waves and how often ppl upgrade gems . Any guidelines would be helpful . So far I 've just enraged until the HP of reavers/swarmlings is about equal to my killgem 's max dmg , then used the same number of gems on giant waves . Nope , enrage for armor over managem damage , not HP . The EEG guide has a ton of info on this and gems . http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=434889753 & gt ; Another question I had was what are the optimal talisman bonuses ? I 've heard anything with WoE is good , but I 'm not sure how to balance + % charge of all spells and enhancements . Anything with +1 all skills and +10 % exp is good , extra stats are just for show . Skills sought after are WoE/Freeze charges and effect and shrine charges & gt ; When are you strong enough to take on hatred 10 ? Never , unless you cheat & gt ; Final questions : does destroying a monster nest reduce the number of monsters in a level ? No & gt ; Does endurance mode end and how strong do you need to be to reach it ? Yes , at w999 . Depends on the difficulty . & gt ; When is it better to use bloodbound instead of poolbound ? Always after g30 & gt ; Thanks ! You are welcome & gt ; Edit : Another question , lets say I blocked beacons from spawning everywhere but a corner of the map and that corner can have a max of 20 beacons , if I were to enrage a wave such that 22 beacons would spawn , will the extra two beacons spawn after I destroy some of the first 20 ? No EDIT : Formatting is hard",Romance,Italian

3G6A5W338E,linux,"& gt ; Would it be too much work to literally just Google it rather than spouting baseless accusations ? Ahem . If you had any understanding of authentication and encryption , you 'd have found this : https : //support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hello-video-and-voice-conversations-online And figured out that this can not possibly be secure , as it 's heavily trusting a third party server to set the conversations up . & gt ; Hello uses WebRTC which is specifically not centralized . WebRTC is very nice and secure once a connection is established between the two actual peers . It does n't solve the problem of setting up this connection and authenticating the peers . If the setup is done through a third party server , as is the case here , this server can be taken over , and peers can be set up to talk through a man in the middle . It 's pretty evident as per the link above that the peers are n't authenticating themselves directly in any way ; the third party server is trusted blindly . What 's really dangerous is how mozilla 's documentation , guides and so on are misleading people into believing they 're having secure conversations . & gt ; Besides , who the fuck would be footing that bill exactly ? Telefonica , apparently . That 's a spanish telco which was privatized from what used to be Spain 's public telco . They 're pretty much an empire now , not surprising considering the privileged position they started from . Being Spanish , I can tell you they 're among the last people I 'd trust the `` secure '' setup of my confidential conversations with . E.g . : They used to be the only broadband option for most of Spain , and overnight they suddenly put everybody behind a not-so-transparent caching HTTP proxy which , unsurprisingly , had severe privacy implications , as sessions started leaking all over the place .",Romance,Spanish

Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth , but understanding , making , and healing , to preserve all things unstained . These things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained , though with sorrow . **But all that has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing , and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron , if he regains the One** sauron will know their plans but they will not become his minnions .",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,Turkey,"Hi , My view on KRG : Pro : KRG could be a reliable partner in a region full of terror and fighting . They seem to have no or much less troubles within their region , and it is quite expectable that they wo n't have any in the future . Con : I am first of all supporting the territorial integrity of Iraq . I see Iraq as a failed state since the US decided to fuck Saddam , and therefore I support Iraq and want them to unite their own people and to live in peace and harmony . I think Iraq should become a federal state , so the different peoples in Iraq - Kurds , Turkmens , Assyrians , Shiites , Sunni Arabs can live in peace and harmony . The KRG are trying to make use of the fucked up situation right now in Iraq - they try to extend their territory by claiming cities which were left by the Iraqi army . I do n't like this policy at all , since most of the oil fields are in the north anyway , and they want to claim the most , and they try to assimilate the other ethnic minorities . They either tolerated or supported the PKK for decades as well . Also an established independent state of Kurdish Iraq would lead to the wish to extend their territory . Especially the Kurdish minority of Turkey would want to 'unite ' with them , so that could be dangerous for Turkey , Iran and Syria . Minority language : Well , that 's a bit different compared to other states . Turkey was founded after the Turkish War of Independence and by that time the percentage of Kurds was much less compared to nowadays ' numbers . The desire was to have a united country , no matter of the ethnicity . So nowadays you can find people of different ethnicities like Laz , Circassian , Albanians , Bosniaks , Arabs , Crimeans , Tatars , Kurds , Zaza . The thought to have only one language was simply to keep the different ethnicities united . And that pretty well worked , except for the Kurds . What I criticize is that the Kurds were forbidden to speak Kurdish , which is wrong . Everybody should be able to speak their mother tongue , but the official language should be remained as Turkish .",Turkic,Turkish

What the Brits did is incredibly fucked up and as inhumane as it gets . Just googled it and came across this . & gt ; At a time when Ireland was enduring the terrible loss of a million dead and the mass exodus of a million more during the Great Hunger the story goes that the Ottoman Sultan , Khaleefah Abdul-Majid I , declared his intention to send £10,000 to aid Ireland 's farmers . However , Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only £1,000 , because she had sent only £2,000 herself . & gt ; So the Sultan sent only the £1,000 , but he also secretly sent five ships full of food . The English courts attempted to block the ships , but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors . That £10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately £800,000 ( $ 1.7m ) today . source : http : //www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/Little-known-tale-of-generous-Turkish-aid-to-the-Irish-during-the-Great-Hunger.html",Turkic,Turkish

19O5,soccer,"I guess it 's probably Juventus . We had some games with them during the last fifteen years , and one of them was highly controversial , it was during the time of Zidane , Del Piero & amp ; Inzaghi . So basically the head of PKK Abdullah Öcalan was stuck in Italy , and Turkey wanted Italy to hand him over to our intelligence service , however Italy let him flee somewhere else , and there were diplomatic tensions , and Turkish people attacked Italian embassy and burnt Italian flags . So Juventus did all they could to not play the match in İstanbul and the match was postponed to the week after that match , and Turks were really pissed that İtalians indirectly supported the head of a terrorist organization which was the causation for more than 40.000 deaths . In the stadium there were more than 1000 cops , imagine that , We had to win , it was more than a match . Juventus scored , and we equalized in 90+ with a header by Suat Kaya , probably one of the smallest on the field . İt was season 98/99 . Season 03/04 : We have Juventus again in our CL group , and they basically qualified for the next round but we are trying our best to qualify at least for UEFA , so in November 2003 there were terrorist attacks in İstanbul , targets : a synagoge , a British bank and the British embassy . Juventus should have played us in December 2003 , however they did all their best to not play in İstanbul , this time they were successful . So the match had to be played somewhere else in Europe with a high distance to Turkey , and it was decided to be played in the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund . Galatasaray 's European supporters turned Westfalenstadion to hell and Kral Hakan Şükür scored two against them , making us win 2-0 against Juventus , and we were so happy . Again Juventus could n't profit out of the situation . And the third controversy was last years CL campaign in İstanbul , we needed a win to qualify for the next round , and Juve needed either a draw or a win . However the snowfall led to the game being postponed to the day after . The pitch was unplayable in my honest opinion and Juve tried again to get the match postponed to another time or place , however the match was played the next day and Sneijder scored during the last minutes of the game , and we qualified for the next round . Juventus were pissed at us again . So I guess our international rival is Juventus .",Turkic,Turkish

What I love about Turkey is , we have places with influence of different ethnicities , Anatolia has Hittite , Lydian , Byzantine , Greek , Armenian , Assyrian backgrounds , and nowadays provinces and local cultures are influenced by different Kurdish , Arabic , Turkmen , Albanian , Bosnian , Circassian , Lazuri , Turkish people and cultures . We differ a lot , but in the end we are people from Anatolia , people from Turkey . I really find it annoying that people of the Arab World still claim parts of Turkey , due to the fact that most of the Arab states themselves have uncertain borders , and yet they claim , claim and claim . Funny , last week a Syrian dude I was talking to was saying , 'but you know Hatay is ought to be ours , right ? ' . Jeez , de facto Syria lost a lot of territory to the Islamic State , and yet he still claimed Antakya . Territories change over time , and people live by it . Just accept it , that Hatay has become Turkish already .",Turkic,Turkish

Today 's Iraq is a consequence of America 's greedy foreign policy of more than 35 years ago , when Saddam fought Iran . Long story short , America strengthened Saddam , weakened him , directly led to his execution , forbade any former Baath party member to become MP ( previous party members were mainly of the Sunni Arab Iraqis and had to be member of that party to become powerful because it was the party of Saddam ) , this led to a rule of Kurds and Shia , the Sunnis felt not represented , this led to terrorist attacks and sectarianism , finally ending in support of radicals in either side such as ISIS , Hezbollah and whatsoever .

He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither “ light nor dark ” but is instead “ dim ” . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad ’ s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the “ waters ” that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the ‘ plenoria ’ or the ‘ Epinoia ’ , and later as the ‘ pleroma ’ , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth ’ s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth ’ s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish

Those parts of the USSR which were Turkic should have been united . & gt ; yet you blame what happened to the Armenians on them being `` disloyal '' . I guess the rest of the ethnic Christian minorities , Assyrians and Anatolian Greeks were also somehow disloyal by not being Turkic and not fitting the vision TYT had for a new cleansed Turkic country that was never the case , and even if , why do that during times of war and not before ? that would n't make any sense . the early 20th century was the beginning of rebellions and the demand for self determination . fair enough , but if you demand such rights at the wrong time it ends badly . the Armenians rebelled , but Greeks were disloyal as well when the Greek Kingdom invaded Anatolia after 1918 . İf the İttihad-i Terakki wanted to remove non-Turks they would have done it earlier and would have removed Kurds as well , your logic has flaws . & gt ; which is what modern Turkey came out to be at the end .

Turks ... were the disloyals who massacred their own compatriots for being of different ethnic and religious backgrounds . Why would they do that ? Look again , local Armenians sided with Russians during WW I , they were deported , under bad circumstances , Armenians lost their lives . Armenians sided with the French a few years later and got their asses kicked out of Anatolia , so did the Rum ( Anatolian Greek ) population who sided with the Greek Kingdom and got their asses kicked out of Anatolia .

There are tons of issues that can be brought up , and tons of arguments to make it work . What is important is to have a discussion and agreement platform for the entire population , and we dont have it . Even if this was not for edemocracy , we still should have a public discussion platform to make our wants heard even if it didnt have direct legal power . That we dont have such a platform is the strange thing . In the platform experts and science people can give expert info and data on the subjects and everyone can read and discuss and vote on them , How can this be worse than 1 leader having 10 experts telling him what they know and him deciding , and all this behind closed doors ? ? And you only having 1 chance every 4 years to have any opinion ? ? E-parti.org is working on these things . Giving the people opportunity to learn , discuss and vote on subjects empowers people and encourages them to make enlightened decisions , the opposite would be to make them ignorant uncaring and uneducated in the subjects , and this is exactly whats happening today ! And possibly even on purpose . If you want your people to be caring , enlightened on the issues and capable of making educated decisions , then you must give them the tools and opportunity , and you must work to cut off those who work towards the opposite .",Turkic,Turkish

Especially this & gt ; The tiebreakers are the Ultra Orthodox parties .

6unauss,tifu,"As I used to be a swimmer ( and here in Estonia most swimming pools have gender specific showers without any partition walls ) , I did n't have a choice and showering naked in front of 20 naked women was simply a fact . Then again I think that this boosted my confidence as a teenager . I learned that there are very few women with `` perfect '' bodies and most of us have some flaws . Ergo - most men must have just as imperfect bodies as women ! I suddenly realised that I had absolutely nothing to stress about . The fact that one of my breasts was a bit larger than the other or that I had a quivering ass did not matter at all . My husband has a similar bacground and used to shower after football ( soccer to You ) practice with 20 naked dudes . So , because of that environment and the fact that my husband also knows what the average female body looks like , we do n't feel uncomfortable being naked in front of each other . I truly belive that if we lived in a place where only perfectly filled breasts , butts and six-packs were exposed , neither of us would be as chill walking around at home naked and that would n't be a bad thing either . If the marriage is happy and full of love then hell - do n't undress at all or go naked all the time ! Other people should not have a say in that : ) Oh and about the part of You considering Yourself conservative ... A formerly religious friend of mine used to be extremely conservative and I really could n't imagine her finding a husband outside her church ( Estonia is considered the least religious country in the world and that limited her options ) . Well , today she is 32 years old , married and expecting her first child , but what 's more - she married to a man from another church and today they are flaming atheists AND nudists ! ! ! That 's far too extreme for me . So , be warned ( take it as a joke ) - You too may one day become a nudist : D Edit : typo",Uralic,Estonian

You basically find a possible reason , you test it ( you and probably a couple of other guys from Valve who are not dedicated testers ) and repeat if it does n't work . This also applies to other kinds of software , not just video games . After the fifty millionth fucking testing session for almost every update , you **burn out** pretty quickly . You probably wo n't be able to comprehend how fucking annoying a 12-hour debug session can be and how you wo n't be able to enjoy your game after being forced to do the same menial task for as long as it takes , but it makes you want to throw the fucking game out of the window in most cases and burnout is a real thing in software development .

However , AI systems can and often do beat games without actually visualizing them .

2kewl4skoool,anime,"This was like something straight out of the 80 's , both the animation , in the best sense , and writing , in both the best and worst . The writing was extremely rushed , shallow and childish , so do n't except original concepts , great promos or much creativity . It really felt like it was written by an 8 year old kid , in the first few minutes we witnessed a bear getting bodyslammed in the air upside down and then a guy gut straight up murdered , only for the whole thing to be followed by ancient wrestling cliches with sensless booking . However on the other hand this really has a fun , dumb , campy charm to it . The action was weird too . Started with over the top moves , then later it attempted more realism with a series of head and chinlocks and grounded wrestling , but not even that felt like a cohesive match , just random moves . At least it looked really cool . So all in all we will have to wait longer for a decent wrestling anime ( depending on what you want out of one ) , but we might have just gotten an awesome old-school throwback anime instead . I 'll definitely keep watching it .",Uralic,Hungarian

Being economically controlled by anyone , let alone Jews is a dangerous game , one I do think Hungary does n't want . Hungarian and world Jewry constantly attacks Jobbik . Articles in the Jew run New York times constantly marr our image . There have also been a large number of barely veiled threats against Hungary economically such as by the world Jewish council . One such veiled threat I saw was from the World Jewish Council where they said that a Jobbik run Hungary would be unattractive to foreign investment and that we should worry that Jews wo n't invest in our country anymore . Id be happy if they did n't . About the attacks by world Jewry on Jobbik , I believe Goebbels had similar thoughts , `` and if the Jewish press believes today it can make veiled threats against our movement ... they shouldnt keep lying , one day our patience wiill end .

Because of this , her family and the local nobles fabricated her crime and used torture to get over 100 people confess that they knew about it or took part in it in just a few days .

6i7kh,news,"For what it 's worth , I think it should . And it is . There is no *hate speech exception* to the First Amendment *per se* . What you 're referring to is [ Brandenburg v. Ohio ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio ) , and that one case clearly defines what forms of expression are illegal . The problem with banning speech that is *hateful* towards a certain group is that only speech that is offensive , polarizing and/or subjective needs protection . & gt ; Should we not protect minority groups from obvious hate in our society ? No , we should not , if this means creating extra rules just to accommodate these groups . What we should do is treat minorities like the citizens that they are . That means they are ( or should be ) entitled to free speech and all the rights everyone else enjoys . A necessary consequence of this is that they might have to listen to speech that 's potentially offensive to them . & gt ; If you think hate speech can be subjective then why do n't you think normal crime can be subjective ? Normal crime *can* be subjective , that 's what we have the court system for . The whole purpose of its existence is that people disagree over whether certain acts constitute a crime or not . Also , *hate speech* is not a legal term in the US so there 's literally no weight to that statement . The problem with hate speech is *precisely* that the definition is to flexible to suit any particular agenda . Moreover , if you define hate speech as *all forms of speech that attacks someone on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation* ( which is the Wikipedia definition ) , you basically end up with a bunch highly polarizing issues where no matter what you do or what you say , you will end up offending someone ( and the PC police strikes down , etc. , etc. ) . This is precisely what happened here . If you mention that the shooter 's Muslim , you might accidentally offend Muslim individuals . If you say something pro-LGBT , that will be offensive to at least some Christians/Muslims/anti-LGBT people . Just let people say what they want to say . If you want to censor something on the basis that *it might offend someone* , you should really think again .",Uralic,Hungarian

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"This photo is all kinds of wrong , it 's over _and_ under exposed , almost as if the cat is lit up by a tiny but powerful flashlight , or something . Because of the light reflecting back from the white fur the photo has also lost a lot of contrast . In photography you generally want very soft light . Obviously harsh light has its time and place , but this is not it . Light is perhaps the most important part of photography and it 's hard to master . Your framing can be completely wrong but if you have good lighting it will still look good . Try practicing in natural light , in a situation where you ca n't control the light , but instead have to adapt yourself . Once you got that down you should try out using lights like flashes , reflectors and diffusers .",Uralic,Estonian

2PantsLady,DebateFascism,"The further you remove sex from its natural purpose , the more degenerate it becomes . Homosexuality has a disproportionate relation to pedophilia as well . The 1972 American gay platform specifically called for the removal of age of consent laws , and it took till the 90s for mainstream gay groups to distance themselves from pro pedophilia groups like NAMBLA . It is a negative to society , which is evidenced by the actions of gays . Incredible levels of sexual promiscuity , infidelity , drug use , and STD rates are common among homosexuals , not to mention a general obsession with sex that I 've noticed . As far as this whole gay 'marriage ' thing I 've seen recently , the whole concept is a joke and was really used to slip by globalist trade agendas . And of course we know who is [ behind ] ( http : //www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/22/biden-jewish-leaders-helped-gay-marriage-succeed/ ) this .

9Ghillie,itookapicture,"Not exactly , though it certainly can look like it if you bump it all the way to the max . It seems to affect contrast in the mid-tones , making it look more sharp .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; We 're agreed on that one , though it 's more of a `` muh traditional culture '' than Asian girls specifically , it just so happens that Asian girls usually come from very similar cultures to the one espoused as ideal by the right wing of western politics . If TRP could find western girls with traditional values in similar amounts , it would probably drop the `` Asian girls '' thing . That 's true . Not to mention , in America when I visited , I noticed pretty Asian women with even ugly white men . I think because Asian men are not attractive and white men are , it makes it easy more for white redpillers . I do n't think nihilism is good , especially among insecure men like the many there . One benefit of TRP is the ability to say offensive facts there such as jew naming , redpillwomen is also great .",Uralic,Hungarian

Recently , both the executive and legislative branches began to think they are no longer accountable before the people , having to answer only to fundraisers and oligarchs . They have to be reminded who truly rules over them . An amendment would create specific points of accountability . For example , with the Snowden case , the NSA would be held directly responsible for the spying on American citizens within the US . And by the NSA , I mean everyone in AND around the NSA who knew of it , had the power to stop , but chose not to . These people would be prosecuted and jailed .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Yes , the fact that there are no `` primitive '' languages is a well-known linguistic fact . Still , when it comes to practicalities , the actual vocabulary of a language is a lot more important than what you can *technically* express in it . Information density is important and if I have to paraphrase something because there is n't a good word for it , I will instinctively feel that the language is inferior in that particular aspect instead of *only* its vocabulary .",Uralic,Hungarian

I do n't honestly hate them as much as some people in this sub . I think they have a mental abnormality which does n't make them an awful person necessarily .

6i7kh,AskReddit,"Yes , but he probably meant to say that certain languages are more apt for expressing yourself , either because of personal preference ( i.e . having a broader vocabulary for a specific domain of life ) or lack of sufficient/widely-used vocabulary in one of the languages . These things also factor into language death , not having good enough words being one of the most important problems a language user can have , especially if there are competing languages within a person 's community . There 's the obvious case of English and science/engineering but I can give you a lot of examples where you just ca n't find a good enough Hungarian word for even a ridiculously simple English word ( fun , for example ) .",Uralic,Hungarian

0Gorthaur0,tolkienfans,"No , I do n't think , and I did not write that . First , I wrote the feanorian alphabet . That was created in their `` Golden age '' . Than , because of Melkor 's influence , they created weapons . I also wrote the same with the Númenoreans . They had advanced knowledge in mathematics , astronomy , etc.. In the times of their Darkening , they misused this knowledge : started to create warships , weapons . And , at last , the servants of Morgoth/Sauron/Saruman even created machines . I do n't think he objected to having a roof over his head .
