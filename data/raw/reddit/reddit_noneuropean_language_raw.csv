If they experience any success in fighting against the government on the other hand the government 's news agencies will loudly proclaim it 's because of Turkish assistance , regardless of whether such an assistance exists .

100100145,syriancivilwar,"& gt ; Russia and Iraq make up a very large part of the economy . Just looked at relatively recent numbers and saw that Russia and Iraq combined form roughly 11 % of Turkey 's exports . Russian trade also amounts to 7 % of Turkish imports . That as you can see that this is hardly a massive amount ( like 30 % ) , we are talking about . & gt ; A lack of coordinating sanctions does n't decrease the impact as long as they are both independently hitting the proper parts of the economy and enforcing the embargo . Without coordination commercial interests in both countries will make sure the separate embargoes have as little effect as possible . There is a reason why the Russian embargo is not a complete one . & gt ; Guerrilla warfare has cumulative effects on the economy . Turkey 's economy is large enough to where it chips away at the yearly GDP , however over time the money it costed them adds up to a sum that could have payed for many things . However if sanctions from two large trade partners cause the economy to shrink than all of a sudden those chips in the economy are more noticeable and impacting which is my point . By that line of reasoning Iraq has much more to loose from embargoing Turkey considering their conflict with IS .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian,NonEuropean

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,MapPorn,"Well , no not really . The Macedonians originate from an epicentre of different nationalities in the Southern Balkans . Its where the nations of Bulgaria , Serbia , Greece meet and have met for a rather long time with Albanians coming into the mix later on as well . Most demographics maps say they were mostly Bulgarians with Greek and Serb majorities closer to the countries ' borders . Bulgaria fought many wars with reuniting with Macedonia being the major desire . But after losing the second Balkan war which was completely fought because of Macedonia and WW1 which Bulgaria basically joined to get Macedonia there was a decrease in tensions and there were much larger problems in Bulgaria that it had to deal with . After WW1 Yugoslavia was created and I think that is where Macedonia as a nation really developed . So by 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia there was a legitimate Macedonian nation that wanted to govern itself . An issue with this though was that Macedonia had no real history as a country , and no national identity past the part of the people feeling Macedonian . So in order to create a Macedonian national identity the government started separating the language with Bulgarian ( which tbh had already developed differences ) amongst other things while taking huge liberties with history like making outright wrong claims like saying they were descendants of ancient Macedonia and Alexander the Great . So I would say that there is a legitimate nation of Macedonia , **but** a majority of that nation 's ancestors were Bulgarian .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian,NonEuropean

100100145,ukpolitics,"In spite of the popular opinion , free market liberalism is not some kind of philosophical dogma , deviating from the principles of the free market is not heresy . A doctrine of political economy works pretty much in the same manner as doctrine of military strategy . Free market liberalism is a set of instructions aimed at achieving a set of aims , nothing more and nothing less . It is not necessary that those set of instructions are logically consistent , or are all derived from a set of predefined axioms . Granted , any theory of political economy will begin with a set of axioms , but would not hesitate to act contrary to those axioms , whenever beneficial . Free market liberalism has always been opposed to allowing distinct social classes of people to act in a organised manner , be it trough price fixing agreements of the commercial classes , guild systems of the professional classes , or unions of the proletariat . Opposing those has never been consistent with the principle of economic freedom , but the empirical evidence of their harmful effects has been too overwhelming to ignore . Unions might improve the lives of workers in the short term , in the long term their effects are devastating . To give an example if an employer ca n't lay off workers , he 's eventually going to close down the entire coal pit . And a town 's economy may absorb the a few miners being made redundant , so the workers laid off will probably find a different employment soon enough .

The distinction in between `` true '' and `` false '' capitalism is made by people here in an effort to distinguish between all the things socialists consider `` capitalism '' .

Which do you think conveys a more accurate picture of of the economic system ? This is the standard most people use when referring to a thing as capitalist or socialist . Capitalism is what is advocated by the self described proponents of the free market and socialism what is advocated for by self described communists/Marxists/socialists .

The only way to deal with a housing shortage is to encourage the construction of more houses and that includes stuff like easing permits and allowing a procedure the legalization of illegal buildings .

As a result of successive right wing and left wing governments countries like Denmark have significant welfare states while maintaining very unregulated economies . ) Also the usual hypothesis supporting laissez faire is in fact that it is less easily corruptible . The idea is that with intervention over time people will figure out how the government interferes and optimize their behavior in order to take advantage of future interventions . Thus every intervention is a trade off between multiple undesirable outcomes . ( Take for example deposit insurance regulations . It ensures that ordinary people do n't loose their money , but also makes them more likely to put their money in a bank that behaves recklessly . ) Add to that Lucas ' argument as to why policies ' economic effects are n't really predictable and you can see why many believe that economic policy should be `` Do n't touch the damn thing ! `` .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian,NonEuropean

If the president were to be removed in a tidy way ( like an military coup for example ) quite a significant amount of rebel fighters would probably stop fighting or defect to the government 's side . Furthermore the government will no longer be intensely hated by large sections of Syrian society , which is an important prerequisite to long-lasting peace in the country . More importantly , in order to secure victory , the government desperately needs to conduct an army reform , and an enormous amount of the measures the government has to undertake are obstructed by the mere existence of the current president . If he were to be removed the SAA would at least have the chance to become a decent fighting force . So Bashar al-Assad 's probably wo n't end the war , nor will it guarantee that the war ends at some point in the future , but at least it would create a way out of this mess .

So IS 's desert offensive could quickly reach the city and the major part of the fighting happened in the city itself . This means that this offensive proceeds as quickly or as slowly as the SAA general staff would like it to proceed . Thus being 3.5 km away from the city does n't mean much . The success or failure of the offensive is yet to be decided .

100100145,CapitalismVSocialism,"Many regimes have been criticized for engaging in campaigns of brutal suppression against communists and communist sympathizers . From as far right as Chilean dictator Pinochet to as far left as the German social democrats , many regimes have found it necessary to suppress and sometimes even cull their communists , under the pretext that if communists were to take power many more would die . Among the left of center commentariat , the cruel logic behind such actions is either roundly criticized or outright rejected as intellectually dishonest and self serving . ( This in stark contrast to left wing governments which do quite often consider communists a grave danger to the interests of the working class . ) Yet there is one such regime seems to be largely forgotten . South Korean ( semi- ) autocrat Syngman Rhee suppressed communists with extreme prejudice , first sending them to gulags and then killing them when DPRK forces were about to liberate those camps . Estimates of the death toll put it at 100000 to 200000 . But we all know what he was fighting against . Even conservative estimates of state killings in North Korea are usually above 200000 for a mere decade or less . No one can deny that the South Korean proletariat lives much better than the workers in the North . Given all that , the question arises , as to your opinions on the actions of President Rhee . The Northern state is , from what I 've heard , not considered socialist , but rather closer to fascism . Yet it is certain that the Southern communists would have aided this fascist regime in its numerous attempts to conquer the peninsula . Reunification was , after all , one of the goals of the South Korean Workers Party . So was their destruction justified or not ? Or were those agents of fascism that marched under the red banner somehow different than the ones that marched under the swastika ? Perhaps one could argue that the amount of people killed was too large or that mass killing as a method is counter productive , but would n't that be a tacit admission that slaying South Korea 's communists would have been ethically sound and in the interests of the proletariat , if it were an effective suppression measure ? And if you were to say that Rhee 's actions were justified , questions arise about all those other regimes in the history of the world . Was Pinochet wrong ? Should the Social Democrats have murdered Rosa Luxembourg ? Was the CIA justified in overthrowing what could very well have been another fascist regime hiding under the red flag ? The CIA is a spy agency after all , they should recognize a fascist tendency in a government even before it is known to the general public , should n't they ?

Well , here it is . The Syrian government is not capable of conducting a siege because of it 's own corruption and incompetence . And pissing off the local population is no excuse . If they wanted they could have blocked all supplies apart from basic necessities . The rebels there would have still surrendered because of lack of munitions . You see my point is that the length and intensity of a conflict is rarely proportional to the skill with which it has been fought . In modern wars rarely drag on for very long unless the major adversaries in it fight in a defective manner . And there is much more military skill to be gained from fighting against skilled opponent with good soldiers and officers as compared to fighting against poor soldiers led by poor officers .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian,NonEuropean

Since the Iranian government is far more accoutable to it 's people and Iran is n't very rich the military is probably underfunded while the Syrian is overfunded . And overfunding leads to overstaffing at the top , while underfunding helps keep it under control ( from my experience with large organisations it rarely leads to understaffing ) . Though I still think they suffer at least from some of the same `` dictatorial army '' problems . Iran is no dictatorship but de facto the only thing stopping the supreme leader from becoming an absolute tyrant is tradition .

I 'm reminded by Warren Buffet 's comment about company annual reports . If you are confused , it 's probably because someone wants you to be confused . Edit : Let me further elaborate on that . When Marxists use the term `` exploitation '' , they use it in the conventional sense , not in the sense in which they define it . Under the Marxist definition of the term a community 's well being can improve by being exploited and can become worse if the community actively resists exploitation . Yet no Marxist seems to be willing to recommend that a developing country opens up to international capital that would exploit it 's people . It 's as if exploitation is unambiguously harmful . And exploitation is unambiguously harmful , but only according to the conventional usage of the term .

2ntle,soccer,"defence : all players behind the ball . period . as for facing the players sideways , that 's spot on . block the centre and let them go wide ( you 'll see a lot of 11-a-side players doing the same ) . speed wo n't get you far in this game but stamina will . when team is in possesion , all of the players without the ball need to constantly run and open up to receive the pass . play fast . 3 touches max . as you mostly shoot from close up , add shooting with the tip of your foot to your repertoire ( curl your toes first ) . it 's a powerful futsal move that results in a fast shot without needing to swing your leg that much ( thus being faster to execute ) and the shot often gets a top spin wich is difficult for the keepers to anticipate watch futsal clips on youtube and study the teams ' movement . the most common one is 'circling ' ( at least it 's what we call it here , do n't know any other terms for it ) . it takes some time to master and synchronize it , but when you do ( does n't even need to be perfect ) and if the league is soft as you say , you 'll start killing them in no time you can find lots of other futsal related stuff on youtube in a nutshell : defence and stamina are the key to the game . make sure you 're solid and responsible in the back and tireless up front and the offensive stuff will fall into place more and more as you guys gain experience together . also make sure to practice some set piece plays , especially corners almost forgot : keep the ball on the ground ! maybe if it 's a great counter - attack situation and the long ball is your only option to pass it on , but , as a rule of thumb , keep it low . hope this helps . if you have more questions feel free to ask",Balto-Slavic,Croatian,NonEuropean

They do n't see Croatia and everything about it as it is today ( which is admittedly difficult if you do n't live here ) but as it was when they left . So , for instance , people that emigrated during the Yugoslavia were either yugo-nostalgic or , if they were more on the nationalistic side , were still ranting on about Yugoslavian secret service , Croatian struggle and so on . The people that emigrated because of the war in the 90s were almost all pretty far right nationalists , identifying with the Ustasha regime , blindly hating Serbs , etc . It 's like they did n't have any closure and the war is still going on in their minds ( there a lot of people like that here , mind you ) . On the other hand they said that the Australian Croats they met were all friendly ( at least towards them ) . Most of them were hard working and almost all were business owners , so I guess entrepreneurship is something that they have in common . They talked about how they teach their children to love and respect their Croatian heritage . They met a couple of 3rd generation guys that were crazy about Hajduk , getting up in the middle of night to watch matches and stuff like that , without ever going to the homeland .

While it has it 's benefits ( no crowds ) it definitely has it 's disadvantages . There will be less to do . Compared to the season a LOT less . That 's why I would n't opt for two days on Hvar . Yes , it 's beautiful , but one full day should be enough . Remember , it 's off-season so you can forget about the famous Hvar nightlife ( which really is bitchin ' in the summer ) . * I would chop one day from Dubrovnik in favor of Split so it 's two days each . Three days in Dubrovnik may be a bit much . I 've managed to catch all the sites and museums in a day during the high season so two days should be fine while taking it easy and maybe taking that day trip to Montenegro . Split , being the bigger city and all , can give you more options . Not just considering nightlife . You can always hop to Trogir , a beautiful quaint town near Split , or visit ancient ruins of Salona or go whitewater rafting or rock climbing in Omiš . * Be careful around Easter . As my fellow redditors at /r/croatia already told you , the ferries are sparser but still run . Some museums might be closed .

Plus , it wo n't cost you much less than booking online . This way you can check out photos , see reviews and contact the host before you get here . Ultra Music Festival is held in Split from 12th to 14th of July . Around 50,000 people will be here for it and a decent number of them will stick around a week or two after it .

2ntle,travel,"Dubrovnik is easy , as in there 's only so much you can do there so you probably wo n't miss anything . I do n't know when you 're coming or what are your interests so I 'll try to keep it as general as possible . Things to do in Dubrovnik : Wander around the old town . Get lost in the small alleys . Push through the crowds ( Dubrovnik is 1 ) the most popular tourist destination in Croatia and 2 ) a stop on almost all Mediterranean cruises so it tends to get really busy ) . Take a walk around on top of the old city walls . Take a GoT tour ( Although I do n't know if they 're worth the money . You should employ some Google Fu to find some reviews . ) Take the cable car ( or drive ) up the hill overlooking the town for a fantastic view . Explore museums , galleries , restaurants . Make sure you 've exchanged enough Kunas for souvenirs . That pretty much covers Dubrovnik . Things to do in Split : The ancient Roman palace is a great place to get lost exploring , even if you 're local . People still live in it so it does n't have that 'museum-y ' feel to it . You can basically be looking at a 1700 year old ruin , turn around a corner and find yourself in someones back yard . So that 's neat . Check out museums and galleries if that 's what you 're into . Check out the palace basements where one part of the Split Got filming took place . I 'm not sure if there are any organized Got tours in Split , but even if there are I do n't think they 're worth the money , you can check out everything on your own . Take a stroll up the Marjan hill for a great view of Split . Check out some of the restaurants ( there are a lot of great reviews online ) . Grab a drink in the evening in one of the numerous bars in the palace and mingle with the locals and other tourists . Drive up to Klis Fort where the other part of the GoT filming took place plus enjoy a really breathtaking view of Split , the islands and surrounding area . Take a day trip to Hvar if you can squeeze it in . If you 're coming here in the summer : Check out Bačvice beach which becomes a party zone in the evening . It gets crowded during the day with beach-goers . There are other okay beaches in Split , but for really good ones you need to go outside the city . Luckily you 'll have a car . I would recommend somewhere south of Omiš ( probably an hour drive in summer traffic ) . There are good beaches in small villages in that area , just follow the southbound road . You can go kayaking in Split and whitewater rafting and rock climbing in Omiš . Probably other similar activities are available that I do n't know about , Google should know better . About the border checkpoint between Croatia and B & amp ; H on the Split - Dubrovnik route , there really is n't much to it . The Bosnians often are n't even there . Usually it 's just a quick passport check , you wo n't even need to get out of the car .

2ntle,CrusaderKings,"Thanks for the reply ! I 'll try to get into a bit more detail , 'cause I do n't think your ( albeit very helpful ) advice covered what I was aiming at . So here goes an example ( hypothetical , derived from many of the same outcomes ) : So , I have myself a nice little kingdom . All of my vassals ( of my and other cultures ) have positive loyalty ( as in rising , if it 's not at 100 it will be in a few months ) . Usually all from traits , friendship , prestige , the usual . When their heirs inherit them they are also very loyal . It says I have a ' ( very ) honorable reputation ' . Then it starts to get boring and I decide to expand a bit . And the Pope just called to arms . Excellent ! So I swoop in , let 's say , Burgos , liberate it and sue for peace demanding to be installed as a count 'cause that 's basically the only way to drive the heathens out . They accept and I keep it as a part of my demesne or give it to some of my kin ( the end result tends to be the same ) . I go for the next Muslim county , rinse and repeat . Then I see that my reputation is all of the sudden 'tarnished ' , but I do n't think of it that much because my vassals are still loyal . Then , let 's say , a new vassal ruler really does n't like me for my traits and he 's my rival . His loyalty has a negative trend . I 'm like 'Meh , if he revolts I 'll just send the army in , take the title back and give it to some one else ' . It happens exactly like that . Now I have a 'bad ' reputation . I conquer some more heathens . My reputation is now 'very bad ' . When I hover over the loyalty percentage over any vassal I see that the negative impact of my reputation is growing . Many more vassals are starting to revolt , and to emphasize since that 's the point of my question , practically only because of my bad reputation , and I have no idea how it got that bad ( I mean I know it 's from taking all those titles , but I have n't usurped them , I gained them through war/vassalization ) . So for example , a vassal is my son ( positive loyalty from family ties and succession order ) , is my friend ( another plus something % ) , likes my traits , scrutage , etc. , but ALL of that is n't enough to balance out the negative impact of my reputation ( it got to -10 % loyalty at one point ) . Same goes for my courtiers , my stewards have been know to get so disloyal that they robbed me blind and my martials fled from battle . That 's pretty much it . I do n't know am I going the wrong way obtaining these lands ( I thought that usurping them would be the shady thing to do , and I really do n't do I 'cause there has n't been a need for it yet ) , or is there something other messing with my reputation . I ca n't see what could it be , seeing how it does n't drop when I just stay put and do n't conquer heathens or when I let vassals go when they rebel . Appreciate the help ! P.S .

2ntle,travel,"Maybe I 'm a bit biased ( being a English and all ) but Croatia could hit all of the points on your backpacking checklist . It 's definitely cheaper than all the other countries you 're considering . There a direct cheap flights from London to several touristy locations here .

We have a lot of Aussie backpackers here so you 'll have no problem meeting new people ( Aussies being outgoing and English speaking as they are ) , esp . in hostels . We have great seafood here but a variety of other kind as well . Not what you would exactly call 'ethnic ' , but seeing how Croatia was under the influence ( lol ) of various nations through the ages , that has reflected in the cuisine as well . So you 'll find a mix of Italian , Slavic , and Turkish , with more German and Hungarian if you wander to the northern parts of the country . The same applies to the other aspects of the culture and architecture . Croatia had a turbulent history since well before it even became a country so there are plenty of sights to see , museums to visit etc . Nightlife is great in the more touristy cities while outdoorsy and off-the-beaten-path stuff is found a bit off the major tourist hot spots ( as one would expect ) . As far as safety goes , Croatia is basically as safe as it gets in Europe . With minuscule violent crime rates the only thing one should keep an eye out for ( esp . during the tourist season ) is an occasional pickpocket . For example , two girls going back to a hostel in the wee hours really do n't have anything to worry about . Of course , you should always practice standard safety precautions as you would anywhere else .

Kotor for beautiful scenic drive and Mostar for history and culture . But , if you really ca n't , then scrap Kotor since it 's in the opposite direction . You can , however , skip Vis . It 's a long ferry ride from Split and it 's a more of a relaxing , tranquil kind of place with nothing really to see . Bring the car with you to Hvar . That way you 'll be able to easily see both Hvar and Stari Grad and check out lavender fields more inland on your own . Unless you 're Scandinavian and used to swimming in frozen lakes you 'll find the water too cold . Maybe if the weather is really warm that week give it a go in Rovinj . The water currents are weaker up north making the sea a bit warmer . Although Plitvice are becoming hugely popular , I do n't think you really need to spend the night there . Yes , there 'll probably be lots of tourists but nowhere near as in mid July so you 'll have no problem going around and seeing everything . It 's a 3 hour trip from Split so if you get up a bit earlier you can get there early enough . While Rovinj is said by many to be the most beautiful town on the coast it 's also , as Vis , more of a unwind type of place so I suggest you use it as a base for trips to other Istrian towns and maybe a trip to the wine country inland .",Balto-Slavic,Croatian,NonEuropean

Trogir - a small town near Split , really pretty and historic . Not really must-see but it 's near Split so it 's convenient . Plus , by being so underrated it 's not so crowded . It 's connected to island of Čiovo where you can find some nice beaches to unwind . Split - has an ancient Roman palace , museums and galleries . Nice vista from Marjan hill overlooking the city . The beaches in the city are okay , but the main ones are likely to be crowded . The nice , more secluded ones are usually known only to the locals . Split is a port to the ferry that will take you to Hvar - both town of Hvar and Stari Grad on island of Hvar are worth visiting . They have their bit of history ( Stari Grad is the oldest town in Croatia , dating back to ancient Greece ) , nature and good beaches . Dubrovnik - beautiful town with lots of ancient as well as recent history . Has a great view from the hill outside the town ( you can get up there by a cable car ) .

3w4v,changemyview,"**Problem 1 : ** Individual value is not dependent on identity . People are assigning value to identity , but worth is not dependent on identity . This seems like a problem . Let value be the expectation of force which will be exerted on the world which moves it into better moral alignment with your values . Can attention to sexual and gender identity play a part in that ? I think a nuance which your argument misses is the role of individual/social level interaction . The focus on gender , insofar as it is a recognition of an existing negative effects on individuals from already existing conceptions of gender and an attempt to replace them with an alterEnglish , can readily be seen as an attempt to add moral value to the world . Existing social views on gender and sexual identity have been shown to lead to suffering and death . If that can be prevented by focusing on gender identity , it is a moral win . **Problem 2 : ** The amount of focus on gender and sexuality seems disproportionate to its effects , and is probably just social bikeshedding or another example of scope insensitivity . Why is it getting more attention than homelessness in my city , or malaria in tropical countries , or any number of other things that have big , measurable negative impacts on the quality of human life ? Well , maybe that 's right . But consider - is your perspective on this DEFINITELY based on figures , or is this a post-facto criticism ? Human nature is that we tend to arrive at positions and then justify them after the fact , so it 's at least worth exploring if discomfort with the topic , rather than a utilitarian assessment , led to your original criticism . Your reasoning process happens on a weird evolved difference engine with all kinds of quirks . Your intuition is n't a utility maximizer .",Balto-Slavic,Czech,NonEuropean

I think I knew , but I never really believed it . So thanks , reddit . I just went through an entire cycle of acceptance regarding this . & gt ; & gt ; Throwaway because my usual username is literally my name . & gt ; & gt ; After my dad 's divorce from his first wife , he did a lot of mixers and singles parties . He was freaking out that he was almost 50 and was the only one out of his siblings without a family . My favorite part of this story is that he said the last straw before he turned to `` dating magazines '' was when he went to a dance for singles and had to escape out of a bathroom window from a very agressive gay man . So he sent letters to all the women he was interested in and then planned his trip to meet all of them in their respective countries . The woman before he met my mom actually tried to trap him in a room when she found out there were other girls he was planning to see . I 'm glad he kept going after that because he went on to meet my mom in The Philippines . They had a connection and began dating until he brought her back to the states and got married . & gt ; & gt ; Reviewing this story now I ca n't believe I did n't think it was a mail order bride thing , for years I would deny it by saying it was a dating magazine . But I can see why , my parents really love and work well together . Reading about how most men that get a mail order bride are , I can confirm that my dad is kind of a socially awkward guy .

3w4v,haskell,"I 'm a little surprised no one has mentioned Go . At OSCON this year I heard about quite a few companies that were happy with Go for large projects . Praise included the relatively small language size , ease in training new hires , good community , and excellent selection of libraries . I think it would meet all of your requirements . I 'll second Rust , but it 's a new and immature language - the community is great , but libraries are n't comprehensive yet , and idioms in the language are likely to change significantly over the next few years . It also does n't have as much industry use yet . Python is another solid , pragmatic choice , and it may serve you particularly well depending on your interests . Look at popular Python libraries and see if any of them catch your eye . It also has the best language learning resources of the three , so that 's a major plus . **EDIT : ** To keep things to the point , my number one recommendation for the original poster is Python based on their interests , professional utility , and availability of learning resources . But since there was such an ambivalent reaction to Go here ( with respect to voting - the comments have been more \*ahem\* _uniform_ ) I think a few things need to be said . Firstly , all of the criticisms made here are valid _on the level at which they criticize the language_ . But the comments , in my opinion , largely miss the point on other levels . Go might be good language to learn for a person who has only been seriously programming for nine months _and_ only deeply exposed to Haskell for several reasons . It 's important to understand that the Haskell community is an echo chamber for certain - correct , according to us - points of view . As an aspiring programmer , it 's worthwhile to be exposed to communities with different points of view and different priorities , and we should put at least some trust in the ability of a student to eventually , with experience , form their own informed opinions . Another pedagogical point : our concerns as more experienced programmers are not all the same as those of someone who has only really been programming for less than a year . Comments like `` There 's nothing you would learn from Go '' lack perspective ; the familiar ideas Go contains are the best ideas from several generations of languages , and for a new learner some of those ideas are still unfamiliar . And the specification of the language is short , which is another big win for a learner . Then there 's the straightforward tooling and a set of solid open source projects to look to for for architectural guidance . Remember , this is the _second_ language OP might be learning , not the last . You can move from Go to C easily , or with Go and Haskell you can pick up Python as the third language , or C # , or C++ ... as a student , half a year of Go programming might lead to a better jumping-off point career-wise and intellectually than many of you are acknowledging .",Balto-Slavic,Czech,NonEuropean

Similarly , _all across_ could just as easily be _across_ . This excess of words is everywhere . A `` ... catastrophic failure of / the highest order ...

Think of this tutor in the same way you would a dance or music instructor , who can guide your child in different directions and develop ideas at her pace . Since there are n't likely to be many people experienced in this kind of role , find a math , computer science , physics , or economics graduate student at a nearby university who will be around for a few years and who seems like she/he would be a good tutor . * Do n't repeatedly tell her she 's smart or clever ! Encourage her love of math and tell her you 're proud of her when she does hard work on something , even if she does n't succeed . However , if she starts comparing her intelligence to others ' , have a conversation about what intelligence is , about self confidence , and all that . Just my two cents .

0bi,medicalschool,"So , the post currently on the front page about number of procedures done during rotations got me thinking about what 's considered 'normal ' in the U.S. and over here . I started comparing the procedures I 've done to some listed in that post and figured it was like comparing apples and oranges and that people first needed to understand the architecture of medical school over here . I figured that warranted its own post , I hope you find it interesting . I 've made it specifically about The Netherlands , because I 'm not aware of all the specific differences between the EU countries . Maybe people from those countries can chime in on that . **So , general outline first . ** Medical school in The Netherlands is six years , but requires no premed . You can enroll straight out of high school at 18 . The education is then grossly divided in two parts of three years , the first three focus on anatomy , physiology , biochem etc . The latter three focus on rotations in increasing manner . My faculty is unique in The Netherlands due to the fact that we have full-fledged rotations during third year ( a big advantage IMO ) . You have two weeks of Christmas holidays and 8 weeks of summer leave , though this decreases each year as you advance . In turn , you get two weeks twice off at randomly designated periods during the year from fourth year onwards . **The Netherlands is a small country** ( [ 16040 sq mi ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands ) ) but has [ eight university hospitals with ~300 first years each ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_hospitals # Netherlands ) , so due to student density you 'll never have to travel very far during away rotations . Door to door it rarely exceeds 1,5 hours and in those cases ( and often sooner ) you 'll most often have the option to be boarded locally ( paid for by your faculty ) . **Most medical schools** in The Netherlands have adopted a 'thematic curriculum ' . This means that instead of separate courses of anatomy , physiology etc . you get a course 'GI ' , or 'Circulation ' . You will then learn about anatomy , physiology , pathology etc . of relevant organs to that theme . The only 'traditional ' course I can think of that we have is biochem , though that 's already angled a bit towards onco . **So , the first three years** ( your 'Bachelor's ' ) consist of above mentioned 'themes ' . In general , this takes place in the faculty building and is made up of lectures , so called workgroup settings , practical sessions ( e.g . histo ) and live-patient lectures . You are also trained in scientific literacy and do an actual test-study and have ethics classes . If you 're an average or above-average student studying nine to five should be enough to pass with decent grades here . We do n't have the STEP-system , though each faculty has some version of 'progress exams ' where you take the same exam ( not the same questions ) at set intervals during med school but have to perform better as you progress . **The second portion** ( your 'Master's ' ) is mostly rotations with designated prep courses in advance . The length of each rotation differs per faculty , at mine most rotations are six weeks each . In general your first rotations will be at your faculty hospital or very close and as you advance you can have rotations further away ( this is relative though , see above ) . Most rotations are set , though you have several electives as well . Now , about the prep courses : these consist of repition and more in-depth study of most-common diseases , anatomy etc ; practical tools ( such as basic management of post-op surgical patients , heart failure pts , ATLS etc . ) ; more diseases within the field and practice patients and cases . In general you 'll be studying more than 40 hours/week during these prep courses as they are very short . **Rotations at my faculty** are ( with different prep course length , not listed ) : * IM 2 x 6 weeks * Surgery 2 x 6 weeks * Neuro 6 weeks * Psych 6 weeks * Ob/Gyn 6 weeks * Peds 6 weeks * GP 5 weeks * Ophto 2 weeks * Derm 2 weeks * ENT 3 weeks * Public health 4 weeks * Elective 6-10 weeks * 12 weeks of warding in one dpt of choice ) * Elective 12 weeks or 2 x 6 weeks All in all almost two full years of rotations . The last two bullets are both in sixth year , which is called the 'switch year ' nowadays as it has no more prep courses and focuses on actual clinical work . Rotations are generally 8-17.30 with several call duties added ; with of course the exceptions of surgery and [ derm ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/52elsz/i_dont_get_why_everybody_says_derm_hours_are_easy/ ) . **And afterwards ? ** You 're a licensed physician . You can either work as an *ANIOS* ( physician *not* in training for specialist ) , or if you 're lucky/very good/have work experience as an ANIOS you can enter a 3-6 year residency program , which will make you an *AIOS* ( you see the 'n ' for 'not ' is missing ) . There is no match system , you have to apply for a spot through regular means . After that , you 're a full fledged specialist and have to find work somewhere . Please note that to become a GP you also have to specialise . **Other notes . ** At a lot of faculties it 's possible to do a rotation abroad . At some faculties , there is a special 4-year med school programme for people who degrees in e.g . biochem- which is a lot more like your premed/med structure . I 'm not completely with all the differences between this programme and the US programme . However , they generally accept less than 30 students each year ( compared to ~300 regular 1st years ) . **So , I hope you enjoyed this read . ** Ask any question you like !",Germanic,Dutch,NonEuropean

I 'm just looking to hear someone 's thoughts , because I ca n't really talk to anyone about it IRL . I apologise if I 'm using this place for something it 's not intended for . Basically , nothing has been working out for me lately . Or at least , it feels that way . None of the things I worked hard for have yielded results , nor have the things I wished for come true . I do n't know why . All I do know is that I find it very hard to deal with- especially as a person who 's had a lot of things 'handed to him/going his way ' until the last year . It started about a year ago , but has only gotten serious the last 3 months . Nothing working out has made me apathetic , and it 's a self-enforcing loop I ca n't really get out of . The only times I 'm not having depressed thoughts are when I 'm out with my 'friends ' doing things that bear no relation to normal functioning- i.e . when I 'm keeping my mind off things . Lots of times , alcohol is involved . I always stay till closing , because I do n't want to go home . I put 'friends ' in quotes , because I have no one I can tell everything . They 're more like acquaintances , just people I have small talk with and know a little about . Over the past months , it 's gotten to the point where I do n't know what I 'm doing any more and how to stop this nonsense . I fail to see the point of life . The only thing that 's kept my from killing myself the last weeks is what it would do to my parents and some of my 'friends ' .

0bi,explainlikeimfive,"I 'm not 100 % on the Australian system , but this should basically explain it : Public healthcare is a hospital . Lots of different patients , many doctors and nurses . Partially paid for by the government . Private healthcare is a called a practice . It 's a lot smaller , and often targets one specific type of patient , e.g . those who need a knee replacement . # # # Warning : complicated stuff below that explains the underlying 'problem ' with private practice . # To understand why private practitioners make so much money , it 's important to understand the following . Hospitals can do two types of treatment : treatment that makes them money and that costs them money . Insurance companies are not willing to pay the huge costs for cancer treatment for a patient directly . It 'd mess up their statistics or something . So if that treatment costs 10X money , they get 2X from the insurance and have to pay the rest themselves . To be able to pay that treatment they need money , so they 'overcharge ' the insurance companies for the 'cheap ' treatments ( note : this is all regulated and consensual ) . So instead of charging X ( the cost ) , they charge 2X . So they make 1X profit per treatment to cover for the expenses of cancer treatment . A private practice offers only specific types of treatment- and you guessed it- those who make money . Since they do n't need the excess amount to cover for radiation therapy , they can charge less than 2X and still more than 1X . Result : they make more money , whilst being cheaper for the insurance companies . That results in more patients being sent there , and less 'cheap ' patients to the hospital . Eventually the hospitals will no longer be able to pay for the expensive treatment if this continues . That 's why doctors often dislike private practitioners- they 're money wolves and mes sup the system at the same time .",Germanic,Dutch,NonEuropean

That 's why it was such a massive shock to the Allies when it was defeated so incredibly quickly in WW2 . One of Churchill 's famous quotes before WW2 was `` Thank God for the French army '' - because he saw them as being the only ( and a massive ) obstacle between Nazi Germany and Britain . France 's downfall in both world wars was largely due to them making assumptions about their enemy that proved to be incorrect . They thought , in both cases , that Germany would n't violate the neutrality of Belgium and other countries . They were wrong . They had the most fortified land border in the world between themselves and Germany ( in both World Wars ) which was partly why they were considered such an obstacle - but that meant nothing when Germany , for all intents and purposes , just walked around those defences .",Germanic,English,NonEuropean

123xyz123xyz,Libertarian,"Depends how far back you want to go . The 19th century had a boom in socialist and anarchist thought , largely inspired by the French Revolution which tended to go more with `` egalite '' than `` liberte '' , but you could go back to the American Revolution , fueled in part by John Locke 's ideas , which were certainly more classical liberal ( economic libertarian ) than `` socialist liberal '' . But a few decades earlier than Locke was a movement called the Levellers , who were against enclosure of farmland in the 17th century and had become a fairly popular faction during the English civil war , and their views were more about equality than liberty - they are seen as proto-socialists or proto-anarchists . You could continue to go even further back , but most political theory seems to be forged and refined through conflict , so earlier forms of socialism , anarchism , and libertarianism are less consistent . Rome had a bunch of populist movements which would look similar to socialism today transferred into that historical context , but then Rome was also founded on some very liberal ideas , with a `` No more kings '' attitude .

08TangoDown08,worldnews,"McGuinness grew up in a sectarian statelet that viewed Catholics like him as second class citizens and who responded to their demands for civil rights with extreme violence . The IRA began to gain more and more support during this period because of the treatment of the Catholic population . People tend to react to violence with more violence and that 's what happened in Northern Ireland . If you 're a military man then you probably know why the British Army was sent into Northern Ireland in the first place - it was n't to fight the IRA , it was to protect the Catholic minority from Loyalist gangs intent on burning them out of their homes . Instead , the British Army went on to commit massacres like Bloody Sunday , Ballymurphy and Springhill . This bolstered the ranks of the IRA and united the Catholic/Nationalist communities against the British Army and the RUC . Now , none of this justifies the actions of the IRA at Warrington or anywhere else - but you ca n't just pick a date and decide that that 's where you 're going to start your history from just because it fits with your narrative . The IRA did n't start the Troubles - they were a reaction to an existing situation that Catholic communities were facing . The IRA would have existed with or without Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams . What you ca n't be sure of is whether they would have given up their weapons and adopted peaceful methods without McGuinness and Adams - and for that , I think they deserve credit . Northern Ireland is a better place today because they managed to bring the IRA to a ceasefire . Plenty of men go down the violent path and never turn back . McGuinness not only turned back from it himself , but he turned others back from it along with him .",Germanic,English,NonEuropean

She 's also a ratings machine since the 80s and the people respect her opinion too much to be silenced or murdered although assassination attempts have been made.. Alicia Ortega is newer in the investigative journalism and is more MSM and swampy.. Nuria 's office is an investigate one , not a TV producing one.. People with no resources go to her for help in investigating crimes the police wo n't touch either due to corruption or incompetence.. Downside to you its all in Spanish from Dominican TV but a lot is on YouTube ... You 'll find Nuria videos about pizzagate ( not called pizzagate ) about the Catholic Church and she 's responsible for many high ranking priests facing charges and or fleeing the country.. About satanic rituals you need to look into the 1994 election race between President Joaquin Balaguer and PRD opposition candidate José Francisco Peña Gomez.. PRD is notorious for their corrupt politicians , for having a convicted Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco , and Haitian descent and Haiti immigration friendly Peña Gomez ... Most powerful Lawyer Marino Vinicio Castillo ( VINCHO ) was responsible for prosecuting Jorge Blanco and for leaking to press Peña Gomez vudú ritual which took place in a luxury hotel waaaay back in the early 80s ... Video was released in '94 . Julio Iglesias Not only owns most of Punta Cana but he actually owns the entire fucking Punta Cana airport . He 's in the private sector but is globalist deep state and swamp monster . You ca n't own most resorts and hotels and not be involved jn human trafficking Dominican Republic is one of the top tourist sex destinations in the world.. There are resorts that only rent rooms with hooker included.. You HAVE to be in the business.. There 's no way around it ... I believe Punta Cana was the airport used jn Dominican Republic to extract Laura Silsby Haiti pizzas from DR ( remember Hillary had the kids kidnapped in Haiti , bussed to DR and shipped to pizza parties . That Doctor Melgen has been convicted for Medicare fraud I believe in 2015 ... He 's a rich criminal.. And according to my dad a sick fuck that likes teenage boys , but that 's my dad who said that after learning about it through a friend of his who was a supreme Court Judge ( deceased ) , Julio Imbert Barreras.. Dr Melgen was the family ophthalmologist until that moment . Senator Bob Menendez is NOT liked in Dominican Republic.. You really need to find a friend or something if you ca n't understand Spanish.. Look for influential radio journalist Alvaro Arvelo in DR , he 's been a critic of both Melgen and Menendez 's ... .

Although being essentially abandoned did help to revolutionize our economy and now we have one of the freest markets in the world . Cheers mum . & gt ; In 1970 Britain took more than 90 % of New Zealand ’ s butter exports and 75 % of cheese exports . The Luxembourg agreement reduced the butter quota by roughly 17 % and the cheese quota by roughly 68 % over 5 years . Quantities were reduced further after 1977 , to about half the 1973 levels . New Zealand continued to have butter quotas in the 1980s and 1990s – although at much reduced levels . & gt ; Britain had long been New Zealand ’ s main supplier of imports , but this was slowly declining – from 48 % in the late 1930s , to 43 % in 1960 , and down to 30 % in 1970 . This was due partly to the recovery of other economies after the war , and their ability to compete on price and quality with British exporters . But it was also a by-product of Britain ’ s EEC membership . When Britain entered the EEC all bilateral agreements between New Zealand and Britain had to be terminated . Preferential treatment of British imports into New Zealand ended in 1977 . & gt ; In 1980 imports from Britain had fallen to 14.5 % . In 2007 they were less than 3 % .

True , but we do n't even know how many viable nuclear devices the DPRK has . It 's not likely to be too many . There 's no theory of mutual destruction with North Korea . They 're not Russia - they do n't have enough nuclear weapons to completely cripple the USA . The USA has more than enough to turn the entire Korean peninsula into a smoking crater . The point I 'm essentially making is that while you 're correct that the DPRK may be able to target US cities , it 's unlikely they will be able to land multiple devices on multiple cities . It would still be an absolute humanitarian disaster if they managed to land even one , but it would n't take down the US government or the US military , and North Korea would quite probably still fall to the US and its allies . Also , despite the rhetoric that we 've been hearing from North Korea for literally decades now , I do n't consider it likely at all that they would launch a preemptive nuclear weapon towards the US . They would be wiped out if they did . The only way I can see them carrying out such a launch is if they 're already at war - they 're likely to feel as if they 've nothing to lose by launching what they have at the US in that case .",Germanic,English,NonEuropean

Adams and McGuinness literally risked their lives for the peace process , I think that 's a much bigger risk to take than Hume risking the fortunes of the SDLP . I really wish all of this revisionism would stop . Hume gets more than enough credit for his role - he won a fucking Nobel peace prize for christ sake .

6unauss,tifu,"As I used to be a swimmer ( and here in Estonia most swimming pools have gender specific showers without any partition walls ) , I did n't have a choice and showering naked in front of 20 naked women was simply a fact . Then again I think that this boosted my confidence as a teenager . I learned that there are very few women with `` perfect '' bodies and most of us have some flaws . Ergo - most men must have just as imperfect bodies as women ! I suddenly realised that I had absolutely nothing to stress about . The fact that one of my breasts was a bit larger than the other or that I had a quivering ass did not matter at all . My husband has a similar bacground and used to shower after football ( soccer to You ) practice with 20 naked dudes . So , because of that environment and the fact that my husband also knows what the average female body looks like , we do n't feel uncomfortable being naked in front of each other . I truly belive that if we lived in a place where only perfectly filled breasts , butts and six-packs were exposed , neither of us would be as chill walking around at home naked and that would n't be a bad thing either . If the marriage is happy and full of love then hell - do n't undress at all or go naked all the time ! Other people should not have a say in that : ) Oh and about the part of You considering Yourself conservative ... A formerly religious friend of mine used to be extremely conservative and I really could n't imagine her finding a husband outside her church ( Estonia is considered the least religious country in the world and that limited her options ) . Well , today she is 32 years old , married and expecting her first child , but what 's more - she married to a man from another church and today they are flaming atheists AND nudists ! ! !

The status is normally determined every ten years based on the language data in the population register . ( Minimum 8 % or 3000 residents minority language speakers . ) This status is set by government decree for ten years . There was a change in the law that directs extra government funds to dual language muncipalities . Basically some municipalities that are designated single language suffered in the change . However , the determination of language status is next made in 2023 and the government was not allowed to make special determinations . The new form of the law allows the government ( i.e . cabinet ) to assign a municipality dual language status **during** the ten-year period it had been determined to have a single language , if the municipal council asks for the change .

0_0_0,wikipedia,"`` 5 times '' is incorrect . Also the definition is not about molecules per bottle , the bottles was only mentioned by /u/LWschool . Are you sure how scientific notation and the homeopathic `` system '' works ? The dilution in this case is described as `` 200C '' . This means a solution of one unit of original substance in 10^400 [ one followed by four hundred zeroes ] units of diluent . The approximate number of *atoms* ( not molecules^1 , mind ) in the observable universe is ~10^80 . Therefore , dividing 10^400 atoms by ~10^80 atoms per universe leaves ~10^320 universes required to have **a single atom remaining in the solution** , on average . So the amount of diluent e.g . water required in this solution , is equivalent to the atoms of these 10^320 universes and the amount of active ingredient is one atom . The difference between 10^80 and 10^320 is not `` 5 times '' . It 's 10^240 [ one followed by 240 zeroes ] . Footnote^1 : The orginal analysis in the wiki ignores the difference between molecules and atoms to give a rough sense of scale . This means that the 10^320 number is actually not enough , because it needs to be multiplied by the number of atoms in the particular molecule . Really complex proteins can have up to 10^6 atoms . So the upper limit is more like ~10^326 universes . : )",Germanic,Finnish,NonEuropean

Game publishers that wish to sell in brick and mortar chains ( that would be basically all of the publishers ) mostly have to agree to charge the same base price online as the physical copies in the stores . Otherwise the stores would not agree to sell the game due to competititon from cheaper online offerings . And dropping the price in the physical copies would not be in their interest since products in those stores are subject to the high cost of living present in Australia , it would just cut into their profit . And as the publishers must price their products in the currency they do business in , they are kinda slaves to the exchange rate , irrespective of any hedging they may do . Another thing that keeps the prices higher - at USD equivalent terms - in non-USD currencies is stability of the price as observed by the consumer . Consumers have formed a general idea about the cost of games ( cost of everything ) . They are not going to assimilate very well to price changes if they followed the exchange rate , especially when the observed niominal price goes UP . So it seems the publishers are content at charging a price in local currency that remains profitable in USD terms even in the most extreme fluctuations of exchange rate .",Germanic,Finnish,NonEuropean

0j0s,Dreams,"I dreamt that I was back in school ( my friend is going back to school today ) and I met one of my actual old school friends there . On the way to school she got stuck in a mud hole -not real mud , more like black dust , the kind we had in our primary school play yard , and she was really stuck in there so I stood by her while other school-goers went by . But then we started attracting a few of them and more got stuck in the hole . Turns out there was a real assembly after a while and it became the actual school . I got naked and started showering in the middle of the mud pit ( which was solid and I could n't get stuck into despite the shower water flowing from directly above ) . From a school it became a sort of housewarming party . Some girls I did n't know started telling me that guys were checking me out , and sure enough I was getting some pervy looks . I asked two of my friends to get naked and come share the shower . One of them had the exact same boobs as a girl I slept with this summer . This defused the male sexual attention on me somewhat . I was n't in the housewarming school anymore but on a shooting set . It was a remake of the Addams family where Morticia was played by Daryl Hannah . Her make up was really mild and not even very dark , so I remember not being totally convinced of her efficiency . But I had n't seen her play so far . I was there during Wednesday scenes . The little girl was having a melancholic moment when she was dreaming that she was older . As it turns out , I knew the director , and he was giving me a little part in this scene . I had to appear in a puff of smoke at the end as the representation of teenage Wednesday/teenage Morticia . I was really really excited to be doing this and was working my poses ; I was definitely going to put some of the original Morticia in there . But as I 'm quietly working on the set , one my bar friends enters the room ( he 's a quiet family man IRL ) with a couple of pervy look guys from the housewarming school . They point me to him and he starts coming on to me and even stroking my ass . I tell him off once , twice , and also have to slap him once and twice and walk away to make him leave me alone . I made sure to do this where the guys could see . I was a little unsettled to play my part after that and had to take a break . Good thing my mother lived next door ( she lives about 620miles away from me ) , so I went there and cooked for her , my grandma and one of my friends Alex . After the meal my mum left with all her bags and stuff . Then I realised Alex 's bags were still there and I called her . Turns out Alex was her son . And he 'd just disappeared . ( I do have a little brother , both him and Alex have blond hair and are younger than me ) His phone was here so he had none of his stuff . But I realised I had no time for this . I went back to set and the director told me we were ready to shoot my scene . I realised I had worked all the mimics and poses , but my clothes were all wrong . I was wearing a black satin shirt under a red and black flannel shirt with impossibly patterned leggings . I KNEW I had the right outfit at home . I still shot the scene with some of the terrible clothes , and sure enough , the director suggested I changed .

Therefore , while some kinds of food ( mushrooms in particular ) were prohibited in Italy because of radioactivity , the French authorities took no such measures , in an attempt to appease the population 's fears ( see below ) . & gt ; French legal action Since March 2001 , 400 lawsuits have been filed in France against `` X '' ( the French equivalent of John Doe , an unknown person or company ) by the French Association of Thyroid-affected People , including 200 in April 2006 . These persons are affected by thyroid cancer or goitres , and have filed lawsuits alleging that the French government , at the time led by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac , had not adequately informed the population of the risks linked to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout . The complaint contrasts the health protection measures put in place in nearby countries ( warning against consumption of green vegetables or milk by children and pregnant women ) with the relatively high contamination suffered by the east of France and Corsica . Although the 2006 study by the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety said that no clear link could be found between Chernobyl and the increase of thyroid cancers in France , it also stated that papillary thyroid cancer had tripled in the following years . https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_Chernobyl_disaster Basically since the 60s the French put a very large part of their resource into nuclear energy and they are ready to lie to their population about it 's danger .

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"First of all , I am *not* a utilitarian . In fact , I have disputed utilitarianism several times in this subreddit . I do , in fact , believe that failing morally is the only acceptable solution , if the alterEnglish is succeeding immorally . This is not a debate about the necessity of deontology , because we 'd both be preaching to the choir . What I do disagree with is the notion that stating a preference for more freedom is immoral . A man who is being violently assaulted is not being immoral by begging the gang to only take his possessions , nor is he consenting to the theft : he is trying to reduce the magnitude of the violence he is being subjected to . He has no moral obligation to accept death at the hands of his assailants . Consider a different example . Say that you and nine other people are kidnapped by some gang , lined up against a wall , and told that you **will** be shot . You know that it is a certainty . The gang outmans you , outguns you and has you tied up so tight you can barely breathe . But for some reason , this unfortunate group of ten is told that , if they hold a vote and the majority agrees , they will only be beaten savagely , but will not be killed . Sure , accepting death at the hands of the gang is not immoral , and no man can be called immoral for **inaction** , but voting to be beaten instead of shot is also not immoral . You are not voting to reduce someone 's freedom to increase yours , you are voting for a net increase in freedom . Voting **to increase the oppression of others** is immoral , as it is the same as hiring a thug to beat up your neighbor . But voting **to decrease the oppression of others** is not immoral . If , tomorrow , a bunch of people formed the Anarcho-Capitalist party and claimed that , upon victory , they would immediately dismantle the oppression of the state , it would surely not be immoral to support them ?",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

We should therefore claim , in the name of tolerance , the right not to tolerate the intolerant . We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law , and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal , in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder , or to kidnapping , or to the revival of the slave trade , as criminal. ” ― Karl Popper , The Open Society and Its Enemies",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Anywho here are some sources . https : //carybankruptcy.com/blog/are-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy & gt ; After graduation , college students sometimes find themselves earning less money than expected and monthly student loan payments can quickly become quite troublesome . As stated above , ordinarily student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , but filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection may offer some assistance if graduates find themselves falling behind on student loan payments . Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects borrowers from having to repay student loans during the pendency of the chapter 13 plan . & gt ; & gt ; The only way a debtor can discharge either federally subsidized or private student loans is to prove that that repaying the student loan debt would impose an undue hardship . This is done by filing an adversary proceeding ancillary to the debtor ’ s bankruptcy case . The Brunner test is currently used in the Fourth Circuit , which includes the Eastern District of North Carolina , and requires that three conditions be met . First , the debtor must prove that a minimal standard of living can not be maintained while repaying the student loans . Second , other conditions must exist that suggest that the debtor ’ s poor financial circumstances will persist for a large percentage of the student loan repayment period . Finally , the debtor must prove that a good faith effort has been made to repay the loans prior to filing for bankruptcy . Fulfilling all of these requirements is difficult , but not impossible . http : //www.totalbankruptcy.com/overview/basics/student-loans-in-bankruptcy.aspx- - & gt ; Generally speaking , student loans are non-dischargeable debts that can not be eliminated through bankruptcy ; however , there are some rare exceptions . & gt ; & gt ; Prior to the bankruptcy law change in 2005 , student loans owed to private non-profit institutions were dischargeable , but the new bankruptcy law closed that exception . & gt ; & gt ; Currently , the only way to eliminate student loans in a bankruptcy is to file an adversary with the bankruptcy court and demonstrate that the student loans impose an `` undue hardship '' on you or your dependents . & gt ; & gt ; To learn whether your student loans may be discharged through bankruptcy , fill out the below form to talk to one of our sponsoring bankruptcy lawyers for free : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; The `` Undue Hardship '' Exception & gt ; & gt ; Bankruptcy judges have interpreted the `` undue hardship '' exception very favorably towards student loan lenders , and disability or other extreme circumstances are typically required to successfully eliminate student loans . & gt ; & gt ; A majority of jurisdictions require you to demonstrate the following : & gt ; & gt ; Repayment of the student loan would prevent you from maintaining an adequate standard of living & gt ; Your financial situation is unlikely to improve & gt ; You have made a good faith effort to repay the student loan & gt ; Adversary proceedings to determine the dischargeability of student loans can resemble a `` mini-trial '' and can be very time-consuming and complex . & gt ; & gt ; Accordingly , legal fees can be substantial and difficult to afford , especially for someone facing `` undue hardship '' . & gt ; & gt ; Chapter 13 and Student Loans & gt ; & gt ; Student Loans can be included in the 3-5 year repayment plan of your Chapter 13 bankruptcy , but you will be responsible for any remaining balance upon the completion of your bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; Anywhere from 10 % to 100 % of your student loan may be included in your bankruptcy , depending on your assets , debts , and income . & gt ; & gt ; Including your student loans in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers many protections and may provide you with short-term relief from collection activity . & gt ; & gt ; While you are in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , the student loan creditors are prohibited from adding any interest or penalties to your pre-petition debt and can not garnish your wages or place liens on your property . & gt ; & gt ; You can also request that the bankruptcy court make a final determination on the proper amount owed if there is a dispute as to the correct balance of the student loan . & gt ; & gt ; Speak to a Bankruptcy Lawyer Today & gt ; Student Loan Eligibility After Bankruptcy & gt ; & gt ; Generally speaking , a bankruptcy filing will not affect your eligibility for federal student loans . & gt ; & gt ; These government loans are based on need , not credit , and federal lenders are prohibited from denying a student loan solely based on your bankruptcy determination . & gt ; & gt ; However , federal lenders are allowed to consider your credit history since the bankruptcy when determining your willingness to repay the loan . They may also deny a request for further loans if your student loan is in default and not included in a repayment plan . & gt ; & gt ; Private student loan lenders may consider a previous bankruptcy filing when determining eligibility . & gt ; & gt ; Maintaining good credit after bankruptcy , repaying old student loans , and demonstrating a steady income are all factors that could influence a private lender to grant you a student loan even after a bankruptcy . & gt ; & gt ; A parent 's bankruptcy filing generally does not affect their children 's eligibility for a student loan , unless they are required as a cosigner on the loan . & gt ; & gt ; Debt After Graduation & gt ; & gt ; Of those students who do take out loans to finance their undergraduate education , some studies show that the average student loan debt is $ 20,000 . While most loans allow for a grace period for recent graduates , the likelihood of finding a full-time position that pays well enough for recent graduates to pay their loan bills is becoming increasingly slim . & gt ; & gt ; Advocates for student loan reform say that by eliminating subsidies to private lenders , the government will be able to make more Pell grants for low-income students while offering loans with fairer terms for those who require them . & gt ; & gt ; The above summary is by no means all-inclusive and is not legal advice . For the latest information on bankruptcy and student loans , speak to a bankruptcy attorney in your area . & gt ; & gt ;",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Alithinos,quake,"I had make a pause in playing games and keeping up with gaming news lately for some time . Then all of a sudden I spotted this video on youtube while searching for other stuff , by Youtube recommendations , and he convinced me to look out for the beta . So I downloaded it . Now the game has some potential , but I noticed some things that in unison made my experience not enjoyable with it . : ( I 've been playing Quake 3 and Live for quite some years mind ... But the negatives can still be fixed , if Bethesda is willing to make the game more enjoyable . I hope they do fix it . Here are the negatives , of course IMHO . 1 ) Netcode is bad . I had a good ping ( 60 ) and the things happening to my screen were messed up . I 'd die and the death animation of my character would play before even the enemy 's shoot animation played . I 'd obviously hit enemies , but the game would n't register some of my hits ... Messed up . 2 ) Perhaps I would n't have a problem with the powers , if the game actually explained what they do and how to use them properly . It does n't . Some empty maps to practice and better explanations would n't go amiss . 3 ) In the beta there is a considerable lack of options . At least to what I 've been used to playing QL . For example I always had the option to auto-equip guns if newer or better . Now there is n't such an option , as there also are n't other options . 4 ) I want dedicated servers and a server browser . We are not playing in consoles , we play on computers . This match making is n't good . 5 ) What are player 's levels supposed to mean ? What is their function ? Does a player who is higher level than me has more health or something like that ? The game does n't tell you . If so , why does the game place people of different levels on the same games ? 6 ) I 'm one of those people that do n't like how the game has meters counting down the spawn time for power ups , and it has that voice telling everybody about power up spawns . I also did n't liked it in QL . Because that gets everyone too focused on power ups . So I saw the players all gathering up on the exact same room , where Quad Damage was , and all the fighting took place there , with people fighting over who is going to get QD . The rest areas of the map were empty , were not played . This became predictable and old rather quickly . And unpredictability was one of the things that made QL enjoyable for me . 7 ) Long loading times . Especially the initial one . I thought the game hanged up and killed it and restarted 3 times , before searching about it on the internet and discovering that that 's how it is supposed to work . So these were my personal complaints . Hope they fix this game 'cause it would be a pity to not fix it , because I think it has potential .",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Alithinos,religion,"You remind me of myself some years ago . The first thing that seemed to me closer to how I felt inside me about God , was closer to the believes of Quakers , than that of the Orthodox Christianity , which I grown with . Yet I ended up myself in Platonism - Neoplatonism . The reason I started believing in this theology is because several years after I had envisioned a very 'weird ' dream , I read about the Neoplatonic beliefs , and I had this weird feeling of surprize one feels , when he reads in a book a very detailed analysis of things and concepts he saw in his own dream . Perhaps if I knew what the theology of Plato and his successors before seeing what I thought was a 'dream ' , I would believe that it was just my own imagination , my brain playing me tricks . But seeing what I saw before even knowing that Neo-platonism existed , and discovering about 10 years later that what I had seen was supposedly a beafitic vision that many other people had seen too in the antiquity and wrote books about it , made me invest time in studying the theology started by Plato , and much to my surprize , it seems to make sense . In the believes of Platonic & amp ; Neoplatonic theology , the Universe and everything in it derived from the One . The One is not a 'god ' like the 'gods ' that go by the names Zeus or Hera , and the One is n't even a 'God ' like that of Christianity , who is depicted as an old guy with a white beard . According to Platonism , the Creator of the Universe was a single being called `` The One '' , that consisted of three parts : Aither ( Divine Essence ) Nous ( Intelligence ) World Soul ( A fiery spiritual substance that is included on everything in the Universe ) According to Platonism , the Soul of a human originates from the World of Souls , also known as `` The Realm of Ideas '' , which is said that The One , and the gods such as Zeus etc , exist on . The Soul falls from Heaven if it wills the pleasures of the material world , and thus it materializes on Earth . Since that , the Soul gets trapped in a long circle of reincarnating in the material world , and to escape the material world and live forever in the Heavens , one would have to live his life ignoring material wealth and pleasures , and excercizing and perfecting the attributes of his or her divine part , the Soul . The Soul is said to appear on visions as a fiery , pulsing energy that carries the Intelligence of an individual person and is what makes the human body 'alive ' . When a human dies and he could n't avoid being dragged on by the material pleasures , then his or her Soul drinks the water of Oblivion , forgets everything , and joins the material world in a new body . If a human dies , and he followed the way of life suggested by the belief system , then his Soul wo n't drink the water of Oblivion , but the water of Memory instead , and will come back to a new body , but will keep all the memories from the last time it lived , and if a human manages to live rightfully for 3 lives , he releases his soul from the trap , and gets to live on Heaven , along with the gods , and the One .",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Aliencreature1,Anarcho_Capitalism,"'Your ' reputation may sound like property , but it is a misleading linguistic construct that does not properly elaborate its meaning . The phrase 'my reputation ' is just a convenient shorthand for 'the reputation *about* me ' . It is , in fact , a collection of thoughts of *other* people about your person . As you can not be said to own a person or their thoughts , you can not claim ownership of 'your ' reputation . If reputation can not be owned , then to 'smear ' it is not an initiation of aggression , as no property is being damaged . The idea that you invest in your reputation is also shorthand , and it does not represent its meaning well . You have taken actions to make others think more favorably of you , but there is no guarantee that they will ! For example , Hillary could gift me a million dollars , and I would still think terribly of her . She has invested in her reputation , but like any investment , there is no guarantee of return . You already addressed this , but I believe it is important to clarify . That is not to say that lying is a good thing .

But for those cases where private defense agencies fail ( which I believe will be very rare due to market pressure ) , the freedom to defend one 's property comes into play . In the end , I am not saying that murderers should not be killed . I am saying that , if a murderer leaves the city and goes to his own property , hunting him down would be a violation of the NAP and not consistent with libertarian ethics .",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Aliencreature1,Libertarian,"1 . First , I would like to argue that compulsory education is not a necessity . In fact , it is overwhelmingly ineffective and a waste of money and time , time that would be best spent learning a trade or focusing on what the individual is good at . Forcing a math prodigy to sit through five hours of literature a week is only going to waste his/her potential and drive him/her away from both literature and from learning itself . As to where the education would come from , there are many answers . Private charity can and will take care of the poorest , as it has done since before the existence of governments , and without taxation to steal a percentage of their income , people will be more inclined to donate to a cause they see as worthy . In addition , private education institutions have a market incentive to procure the best and brightest in the ranks of their alumni , which is why they are even today offering scholarships . And of course there is the matter of self-organized teaching , where parents in a community can organize their own classrooms by pitching in , or teaching their strengths . 2 . The same as above . Charity has improved the lives of billions in the past few decades , and hospitals have a market incentive to reach out to the community . Plus , there is health insurance , which would no doubt be very cheap in a free , cut-throat market . 3 . The market , of course . If roads are such a necessity for modern life and trade , then people will gladly pay to use them ( which they already do , just indirectly ) . Or , new ways to transport persons and goods will be developed under the forces of the free market . 4 . I would argue that the government has failed at protecting us from terrorists so far . But even so , private security can do a far better job than the police , because its survival depends on its success . Consider this : if the police/military/FBI/NSA fails , they blame a lack of resources and so they are given more funding - they profit from their failure . If a private security contractor fails , it is going to lose its reputation , its contracts and its share in the market . 5 . Nobody . People are free to live their life in whatever way they wish , under whatever values they personally adhere to , as long as they do not initiate the use of violence . 6 . You are probably sick of this answer by now , but , the market . In a free market , racism is insanely unprofitable : you are willingly forfeiting potential paying customers , and your non-racist competitor is free to take advantage of that vacuum . You may not like blacks/whites/latinos/gays/gingers , and that is your right , but money does n't smell . Otherwise , oh well , you are free to do what you want - just do n't come crying when your competitor uses buzzwords like 'equality ' to crush you . In the end , the purpose of libertarianism is not to answer all of these questions - it is not a way of life . It is simply the belief that everyone can choose the way of life that they want , and they are then free to sort these issues out either on their own or in voluntary cooperation .",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

But you ca n't say that it 's pure bad luck that makes people poor , or at the very least you ca n't prove it with any degree of certainty higher than attributing poverty to poor choices and bad management of money . Most 'poor ' are not homeless with barely a set of clothes . They are caught in a cycle of poverty of their own making ( poor choices in education , lack of marketable skills , criminal records ) that is propagated by their own behavior ( expensive vices like alcoholism , smoking , gambling , overspending on non-essentials ) and exacerbated by the state . Remember that laws like minimum wage were not implemented to 'protect the workers ' , but to force blacks into poverty by making it impossible for them to compete with whites . The war of drugs has destroyed urban communities and ruined the lives of 'criminals ' that harmed nobody . Mutual aid societies , which provided affordable healthcare insurance to the poor , were legislated away by the government . Drug patents upheld by the state prevent competition from reducing pharmaceutical prices . The solution is not more state . The solution is *less* state in every sector . Some examples are to get rid of the government enforced monopoly of the AMA and allow physicians licensed in other countries to work in the US , get rid of patent laws , remove all barriers to entry in the insurance market and for the love of god privatize Medicare/Medicaid after breaking them to smaller companies .

Alpigami,GlobalOffensive,"& gt ; How are mom jokes more mature One pattern that I 've seen is this subreddit ( especially regarding RL ) is that he gets a lot of flak for using what people consider as immature or insulting words or phrases . When we are talking about people from Great Britain , we all need to keep in mind that what we consider rude or inappropriate , in their country is considered `` banter '' and therefore they do n't really think that what they are saying is somewhat wrong . In conclusion I think that both parties could potentially be at fault . If the events that hire RL want him to be a bit more measured in his casting and he does n't do that , then yes blame him all you want for that one , but if the events that hire him want him to be 100 % himself , then it 's time for the community to do some research on freaking cultures and realise that he is n't really doing anything wrong .",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

Alithinos,DebateReligion,"The books of the Bible were written by humans . Enlightened perhaps , but still humans . And each one tried to communicate what he knew / saw / the best way he could . As for people not getting what they pray for , I must ask : Did they followed Jesus 's path before asking from him anything ? Did they gave away their riches ? Did they forgiven the people they hated ? Did they helped other people without expecting anything in return ? Did they removed their pride becoming humble ? If not how can they say that Jesus is a liar ? You have to show some good will , to give something to get something in return . Years ago my father lost consience . I was terrified seeing him on the bed with his eyes open , not talking , not responding to anything . The doctors told us that his body could n't do the body functions and thus his condition was critical and that he had hours left . My mother insisted that he gets in life support system . Even with the life support system the doctors told us that his days were few and he would n't 'wake up ' . But my mother insisted . My father was in a comma with life support almost a year . And on 15th of August , the Saint Mary 's day for us Orthodox Christians I prayed to Madonna . The next day he woke up . He could talk . Doctors told us they did n't expected it and they were surprized . After some more days in ICU , he was able to come back to our house . And he lived long enough , about 10 years more after that . You can argue that this was a coincidense and what not , but for me it was getting what I asked through praying . If you are a good person and you do good deeds and help people , good will come back to you , even in ways you do n't expect .

AgentErgoloid,Fitness,"Abstract Regimented resistance training has been shown to promote marked increases in skeletal muscle mass . Although muscle hypertrophy can be attained through a wide range of resistance training programs , the principle of specificity , which states that adaptations are specific to the nature of the applied stimulus , dictates that some programs will promote greater hypertrophy than others . Research is lacking , however , as to the best combination of variables required to maximize hypertophic gains . The purpose of this study was to investigate muscular adaptations to a volume-equated bodybuilding-type training program versus a powerlifting-type routine in well-trained subjects . 17 young men were randomly assigned to either an HT group that performed 3 sets of 10RM with 90 seconds rest or an ST group that performed 7 sets of 3RM with 3 minutes rest . After 8 weeks , no significant differences were noted in muscle thickness of the biceps brachii . Significant strength differences were found in favor of ST for the 1RM bench press and a trend was found for greater increases in the 1RM squat . In conclusion , this study showed both bodybuilding- and powerlifting-type training promote similar increases in muscular size , but powerlifting-type training is superior for enhancing maximal strength . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24714538/",Greek,Greek,NonEuropean

For the layman that means that , oats lack some of the essential amino acids and thus they should be paired with a more complete source .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"Can absolutely confirm . I 'm not saying this is an acceptable answer or that it should be an excuse , but to all the other people out there , imagine finding a bug like this . You basically find a possible reason , you test it ( you and probably a couple of other guys from Valve who are not dedicated testers ) and repeat if it does n't work . This also applies to other kinds of software , not just video games . After the fifty millionth fucking testing session for almost every update , you **burn out** pretty quickly . You probably wo n't be able to comprehend how fucking annoying a 12-hour debug session can be and how you wo n't be able to enjoy your game after being forced to do the same menial task for as long as it takes , but it makes you want to throw the fucking game out of the window in most cases and burnout is a real thing in software development .

6i7kh,GlobalOffensive,"That 's not technically true , but close enough . Most games are randomized in that enemies do n't always appear or behave identically every time you play the game . However , AI systems can and often do beat games without actually visualizing them . Some systems look at the memory of the game and make deductions about what a *good* move is ( e.g . moving towards the right , getting points , etc . ) and they *know* the sequence of moves that increase the *goodness* state of the system .

2kewl4skoool,anime,"This was like something straight out of the 80 's , both the animation , in the best sense , and writing , in both the best and worst . The writing was extremely rushed , shallow and childish , so do n't except original concepts , great promos or much creativity . It really felt like it was written by an 8 year old kid , in the first few minutes we witnessed a bear getting bodyslammed in the air upside down and then a guy gut straight up murdered , only for the whole thing to be followed by ancient wrestling cliches with sensless booking . However on the other hand this really has a fun , dumb , campy charm to it . The action was weird too . Started with over the top moves , then later it attempted more realism with a series of head and chinlocks and grounded wrestling , but not even that felt like a cohesive match , just random moves . At least it looked really cool . So all in all we will have to wait longer for a decent wrestling anime ( depending on what you want out of one ) , but we might have just gotten an awesome old-school throwback anime instead .

6i7kh,news,"For what it 's worth , I think it should . And it is . There is no *hate speech exception* to the First Amendment *per se* . What you 're referring to is [ Brandenburg v. Ohio ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio ) , and that one case clearly defines what forms of expression are illegal . The problem with banning speech that is *hateful* towards a certain group is that only speech that is offensive , polarizing and/or subjective needs protection . & gt ; Should we not protect minority groups from obvious hate in our society ? No , we should not , if this means creating extra rules just to accommodate these groups . What we should do is treat minorities like the citizens that they are . That means they are ( or should be ) entitled to free speech and all the rights everyone else enjoys . A necessary consequence of this is that they might have to listen to speech that 's potentially offensive to them . & gt ; If you think hate speech can be subjective then why do n't you think normal crime can be subjective ? Normal crime *can* be subjective , that 's what we have the court system for . The whole purpose of its existence is that people disagree over whether certain acts constitute a crime or not . Also , *hate speech* is not a legal term in the US so there 's literally no weight to that statement . The problem with hate speech is *precisely* that the definition is to flexible to suit any particular agenda . Moreover , if you define hate speech as *all forms of speech that attacks someone on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation* ( which is the Wikipedia definition ) , you basically end up with a bunch highly polarizing issues where no matter what you do or what you say , you will end up offending someone ( and the PC police strikes down , etc. , etc. ) . This is precisely what happened here . If you mention that the shooter 's Muslim , you might accidentally offend Muslim individuals . If you say something pro-LGBT , that will be offensive to at least some Christians/Muslims/anti-LGBT people . Just let people say what they want to say .

It is a negative to society , which is evidenced by the actions of gays . Incredible levels of sexual promiscuity , infidelity , drug use , and STD rates are common among homosexuals , not to mention a general obsession with sex that I 've noticed .

2PantsLady,SlutJustice,"& gt ; We 're agreed on that one , though it 's more of a `` muh traditional culture '' than Asian girls specifically , it just so happens that Asian girls usually come from very similar cultures to the one espoused as ideal by the right wing of western politics . If TRP could find western girls with traditional values in similar amounts , it would probably drop the `` Asian girls '' thing . That 's true . Not to mention , in America when I visited , I noticed pretty Asian women with even ugly white men .

333ml,civilengineering,"Because of the lateral confinement which is present in a plate but is not present in a beam . If you consider a beam elongated along z under a transversal load it will have out of plane displacement , not only in the same direction of the load but in the second plane ( x-y ) too due to Poisson effect . Now in a plate these lateral deflections are prohibited ( that 's why you have internal moments in both directions ) , just imagine the slab as a row of beams which inhibit each other from expanding/shrinking . This change in behavior reflects on the constitutive relations between the resultant stresses and curvature . Consider the case of cylindrical bending , I think it 's the best way to compare the beams to the plates . The relation between the moment and the curvature in the plate is : Mx=DX D is the plate stiffness and equal to Eh^3 /12 ( 1-v^2 ) where h is the plate thickness and X is the curvature . Now consider a beam , the stiffness is EI=Eh^3 /12 . As you can see D is higher that EI ( the Poisson ration is ~0.2 for concrete and ~0.3 for steel ) .",Romance,Italian,NonEuropean

I saw the prestressing effect on beams in the computational analysis structure course ( we had to implement the effect in a frame analysis program we had to develop ) . In my graduate university all the course are too theoretical . And most of the topics we talk about do n't have exercises that can be solved manually . And the topics we talk about are not so popular ( maybe I 'm wrong ) , for example Wagner Vlasov beams , or advanced inelastic constitutive laws , or the stability of thin open walled section under torsion using the total potential energy principle with the Green-Lagrange strain tensor and the Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor .

The military said in a statement that the Syrian families left the makeshift camps in the northeastern border town of Arsal in a convoy of 30 civilian vehicles . They were accompanied by the Lebanese Army until the last military checkpoint on the outskirts of the area , The army said that the departure follows a `` high interest of the families '' to return to their homeland . Local media reported that the convoy comprised of 50 Syrian families . The families left through north and northeast Lebanon , the latter route going through the Lebanese border town of Tfail . Local Al-Jadeed TV reported that around 500 families are expected to return to Syria following `` reconciliations in Qalamoun and the Damascus countryside , and the militants leaving to Idlib . '' In February , Hezbollah 's media spokesperson told The Daily Star that the party is mediating the return of Syrian refugees from Arsal border area to their villages in the Qalamoun region in Syria in talks with Syrian opposition group Saraya Ahl al-Sham . MP Nawwar Saheli had told The Daily Star that `` it won ’ t be formal until the Lebanese government contacts the Syrian government .

I modified my skills to what it suggested though . I still do n't understand why the guide says not to do hatred . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but enemy xp is based on their base hp . If you end at X hp no matter what , should n't the hatred skill not really matter ? If anything , it gives you a multiplier bonus and ends the game earlier . Assume you can kill 1e50 .

You can run the math , turns out Hatred 1 loses by & gt ; 10 % , higher is worse . & gt ; I am guessing it has to do with the max hp chart , but I thought enemies max out at something crazy like 10^333 hp .

Einstein 's equations have a free parameter , called `` Cosmological constant '' ( I 'll call it L ) , that ca n't be constrained by local measurements ( we can just say it 's very small ) . It turns out , if you want GR to match what we see , you can not take L to be 0 , but it 's got to have a certain tiny value . This is not a `` fudge factor '' , it 's simply a free parameter of the theory we tuned with experiments ( like , dunno , the value of surface gravity in classical mechanics ) . L then reappears in the equation for the age of the universe , we plug it in and do the math , no funny business anywhere . The interpretation of L , now , it 's difficult . It turns out that L is on the same side of the equation as the densities/pressures of matter and radiation , so we think about L not as some wavy factor , but as the density/pressure of a strange kind of `` energy '' ( hence the name `` dark energy '' ) . But we know of no kind of particle/field/whatever that can produce the observed density/pressure of the dark energy , so for now we simply measure it and put it manually in Einstein 's equation .

12345ieee,Gemcraft,"& gt ; Hello , I recently started playing this game and I 've enjoyed it quite a bit , but I 'm a little confused on the next steps I should take . I am wizard level 2.3k and have just started some endurance runs . Hi & gt ; Lately , I get bored cuz it takes too damn long with lag , and I stop enraging and just send all waves . I 've made it to wave 372 in endurance . Is there any way to reduce lag ? Get all your settings to min . Short of that , nothing to be done , game is in Flash , the engine itself is shitty . & gt ; Maybe by modding the game to change the sprites of all the enemies to small boxes or something ? You 'd have to decompile and recompile the .swf . If you have the technical skills I 'll be happy to assist you . & gt ; However , I 'm not exactly sure how I should spend skills optimally . I saw a guide on steam that ranked skills in level of importance , but it did n't mention how many unused points to save . Right now I have almost all capped skills maxed out ( just the spells left at 30+15 ) and all non-capped skills at 30+15 ( the important ones at least ) . Said guide is mine . You have to leave enough unspent points so you have enough mana at the start . I do n't play for you , you have to find a balance . & gt ; I am also curious how people enrage waves and how often ppl upgrade gems . Any guidelines would be helpful . So far I 've just enraged until the HP of reavers/swarmlings is about equal to my killgem 's max dmg , then used the same number of gems on giant waves . Nope , enrage for armor over managem damage , not HP . The EEG guide has a ton of info on this and gems . http : //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/ ? id=434889753 & gt ; Another question I had was what are the optimal talisman bonuses ? I 've heard anything with WoE is good , but I 'm not sure how to balance + % charge of all spells and enhancements . Anything with +1 all skills and +10 % exp is good , extra stats are just for show . Skills sought after are WoE/Freeze charges and effect and shrine charges & gt ; When are you strong enough to take on hatred 10 ? Never , unless you cheat & gt ; Final questions : does destroying a monster nest reduce the number of monsters in a level ? No & gt ; Does endurance mode end and how strong do you need to be to reach it ? Yes , at w999 . Depends on the difficulty . & gt ; When is it better to use bloodbound instead of poolbound ? Always after g30 & gt ; Thanks ! You are welcome & gt ; Edit : Another question , lets say I blocked beacons from spawning everywhere but a corner of the map and that corner can have a max of 20 beacons , if I were to enrage a wave such that 22 beacons would spawn , will the extra two beacons spawn after I destroy some of the first 20 ? No EDIT : Formatting is hard",Romance,Italian,NonEuropean

Several local media outlets reported earlier in the week that “ out of 1.9 million Syrian refugees present in Lebanon ... there are 300,000 pregnant Syrian women that will give birth in 2017. ” The outlet did not provide a source for the information , raising questions as to its credibility . “ We ’ re not quite sure about the source used in the report , but our records show that since the beginning of the crisis in 2011 there have been a total of about 100,000 Syrian newborns in Lebanon , ” Khaled Kabbara , spokesperson for the United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , told the Daily Star . Mounia Amrani , Medical Coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres , also challenged the figure . She said such a number was impossible based upon MSF ’ s data and work with Syrian women . “ The number is exaggerated and really strange . We can expect an estimated number of about 80,000 [ pregnant women ] maximum , ” she told The Daily Star . “ The Syrian women that come to us for aid often request and use methods of family planning . So the fact that these figures are so high doesn ’ t make sense with practices we see at MSF , ” Amrani added . Minister of State for Refugee Affairs Mouin Merehbi dismissed the media reports ’ claims , saying he thought that such false information was part of an anti-Syrian refugee agenda in Lebanon . “ The maximum growth rate is maybe about 4 or 5 percent in some countries . In our region , a 3 percent increase in population is very high , ” he said . “ It ’ s not right [ to report this ] . I ’ m not sure what the purpose of this propaganda is , but it is definitely crazy. ” The report claimed that unnamed Scandinavian and Gulf countries had offered aid packages in response to the alleged projected uptick of refugees in Lebanon . Specifically , it noted that the EU had already donated 200 million euros ( $ 219.4 million ) in support . As of Thursday evening , the European Union was unavailable to corroborate or deny the claim . Over 1 million Syrian refugees are currently registered with UNHCR in Lebanon , but the government has estimated that the number is closer to 1.5 million .

12345ieee,spacechem,"& gt ; Link to youtube video generated by the game 's record function for verification , done . No need for any steam id friendlist bullshit , just submit a link and anyone can verify it . This way all the solutions will become public . I do n't think this should be mandatory to submit a score . & gt ; I would n't bother listing scores by platform , as there 's no easy way to verify that something like a production level is using a specific platforms random seed except for fully constructing the solution on that platform . Just lump them together and let people minmax their random seed by platform selection if they want to push the envelope . The problem with this is that the score table will become meaningless . The first place would always be of the guy who wrote a botched C math library ( this counts as 'platform ' ) , had the game load it and then abused a randomness he can perfectly control . The table should lock down the platform to be usable . & gt ; I would n't try to evaluate what is and is n't a state machine , because you run into a lot of edge cases . Is a solution that is n't able to handle a rare input combination a state machine for taking advantage of that or just not a perfect solution ? What about only using knowledge of the first input , or just the last ? Many optimized solutions take advantage of that kind of knowledge while handling all other inputs normally . & gt ; & gt ; For bug exploits you 'd need to be very specific for what is and is n't allowed , since the same bug that enables particle smashing also enables Input + Fuse where you input on top of another atom and avoid collision by fusing the same cycle to remove the collision . Input + Fuse is used in a ton of optimized and even regular solutions to various fusion levels . Choose a standard , then rely on the honor system .",Romance,Italian,NonEuropean

I did suppress them for a while , but in the end , they always came back and ended up fucking with my head quite a bit . Maybe you will deal with them on your own and all will be well .

This from someone who vastly preferred the City Elves to the Dalish in earlier games , so , in my experience , it can be a satisfying story even if the Dalish are not your favourite .

333ml,arabs,"I never had issue with government surveillance , I was like I do n't do anything harmless meh . My opinion changed after reading this post . I do n't have a link to the original comment , I only have the text : ***************************************************************************************** I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship . One of the Arab spring countries . I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US . People here talking about curfews are n't realizing what that actually FEELS like . It is n't about having to go inside , and the practicality of that . It 's about creating the feeling that everyone , everything is watching . A few points : 1 ) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state . Not terrorists . People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo . These could be religious ideas . These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking . It makes it very easy to know who these people are . It also makes it very simple to control these people . Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals . So you make a plan and go to protest these practices . You get there , and wow , the protest is huge . You never expected this , you were just goofing off . Well now everyone who was there is suspect . Even though you technically had the right to protest , you 're now considered a dangerous person . With this tech in place , the government does n't have to put you in jail . They can do something more sinister . They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend . Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes . Or they can threaten to get your dad fired . All you have to do , the email says , is help them catch your friends in the group . You have to report back every week , or you dad might lose his job . So you do . You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid , you 're reporting on them to protect your dad . 2 ) Let 's say number one goes on . The country is a weird place now . Really weird . Pretty soon , a movement springs up like occupy , except its bigger this time . People are really serious , and they are saying they want a government without this power . I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal . You see on the news that tear gas was fired . Your friend calls you , frantic . They 're shooting people . Oh my god . you never signed up for this . You say , fuck it . My dad might lose his job but I wo n't be responsible for anyone dying . That 's going too far . You refuse to report anymore . You just stop going to meetings . You stay at home , and try not to watch the news . Three days later , police come to your door and arrest you . They confiscate your computer and phones , and they beat you up a bit . No one can help you so they all just sit quietly . They know if they say anything they 're next . This happened in the country I live in . It is not a joke . 3 ) Its hard to say how long you were in there . What you saw was horrible . Most of the time , you only heard screams . People begging to be killed . Noises you 've never heard before . You , you were lucky . You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you , but no one shocked you . No one used sexual violence on you , at least that you remember . There were some times they gave you pills , and you ca n't say for sure what happened then . To be honest , sometimes the pills were the best part of your day , because at least then you did n't feel anything . You have scars on you from the way you were treated . You learn in prison that torture is now common . But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker . Its considered a threat to national security . Pretty soon , a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad . You think it 's infected . There were no doctors in prison , and it was so overcrowded , who knows what got in the cut . You go to the doctor , but he refuses to see you . He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you . Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police . You decide to go home and see your parents . Maybe they can help . This leg is getting really bad . You get to their house . They are n't home . You ca n't reach them no matter how hard you try . A neighbor pulls you aside , and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and have n't been seen since . You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest . Even your little brother is n't there . 4 ) Is this even really happening ? You look at the news . Sports scores . Celebrity news . It 's like nothing is wrong . What the hell is going on ? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper . You lose it . You shout at him `` fuck you dude what are you laughing at ca n't you see I 've got a fucking wound on my leg ? '' `` Sorry , '' he says . `` I just did n't know anyone read the news anymore . '' There have n't been any real journalists for months . They 're all in jail . Everyone walking around is scared . They ca n't talk to anyone else because they do n't know who is reporting for the government . Hell , at one time YOU were reporting for the government . Maybe they just want their kid to get through school . Maybe they want to keep their job . Maybe they 're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor . It 's always a simple reason . Good people always do bad things for simple reasons . You want to protest . You want your family back . You need help for your leg . This is way beyond anything you ever wanted . It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms . Now you 're basically considered a terrorist , and everyone around you might be reporting on you . You definitely ca n't use a phone or email . You ca n't get a job . You ca n't even trust people face to face anymore . On every corner , there are people with guns . They are as scared as you are . They just do n't want to lose their jobs . They do n't want to be labeled as traitors . This all happened in the country where I live . You want to know why revolutions happen ? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse . But this thing that is happening now is big . This is the key ingredient . This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above . The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described . In the country I live in , they also claimed it was for the safety of the people . Same in Soviet Russia . Same in East Germany . In fact , that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone . But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality . Maybe Obama wo n't do it . Maybe the next guy wo n't , or the one after him . Maybe this story is n't about you . Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now , when a big war is happening , or after another big attack . Maybe it 's about your daughter or your son . We just do n't know yet . But what we do know is that right now , in this moment we have a choice . Are we okay with this , or not ? Do we want this power to exist , or not ? You know for me , the reason I 'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance . I was taught that the United States meant `` liberty and justice for all . '' You get older , you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution . That 's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is . Well , the government just violated that ideal . So if they are n't standing for liberty and justice anymore , what are they standing for ? Safety ? Ask yourself a question . In the story I told above , does anyone sound safe ? I did n't make anything up . These things happened to people I know . We used to think it could n't happen in America . But guess what ? It 's starting to happen . I actually get really upset when people say `` I do n't have anything to hide . Let them read everything .

3Fyr,skyrim,"[ Video1 ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=btOb2XqnNTw ) We ’ re starting the new year with a all-new Skyrim modding interview . This time around we ’ re talking to Will Willson , part of the Dark Creations team . A post-grad student in the UK , Will is an integral part of DC ’ s ambitious project known as “ Beyond Skyrim ” . What ’ s the mod all about ? Find out below… **Can you give a general overview of Beyond Skyrim and where the mod project currently stands ? ** Beyond Skyrim is a series of interlinking mods which will ultimately allow players to visit other areas of Tamriel within the Skyrim engine . Assets for each new region are being painstakingly created from scratch , including architecture , creatures , weapons , landscapes , textures and objects created by our artists and modelers . We pride ourselves on our fidelity to Elder Scrolls lore , and our ultimate aim is to create a player experience which will fit together seamlessly with Skyrim itself , allowing players to continue their existing character ’ s adventures in other lands , or perhaps even sidestep Skyrim ’ s story entirely and experience what the rest of Tamriel has to offer . [ Image1 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uVzSmEa.jpg ) We have made three years of progress towards this goal , though of course there remain many challenges ahead . When we started back in 2011 , we had little more than ideas and determination . While similar mods had been conceptualized and even released for previous Elder Scrolls games , we ’ re in uncharted territory for Skyrim . As we move into 2015 , we have built up a well-developed and cohesive community dedicated to our goals , in which our veteran members can actively train newcomers and continue to grow the project . Both our technical and artistic foundations are now firm and we are working hard to implement the quests , characters and stories that will bring this expanding world to life . **The project seems pretty ambitious… how much time is being put into the project ? ** It ’ s difficult to give a precise estimate , since our community depends entirely on volunteers working in their free time , which is of course a variable commodity . As a result of this a degree of membership “ cycling ” is necessary , as different individuals become able to contribute more or less , depending on their other commitments . At the last count , Beyond Skyrim had more than 50 active members , although the amount of hours each of those can contribute will continuously change based on their personal circumstances . Some members can work only a few hours a week , while others put in almost as much time as a job . At a minimum , thousands of hours have collectively been put into the project so far . We ’ ve become increasingly adept at managing and coordinating a highly flexible membership base . It ’ s necessary to break down some tasks like landscaping regions into smaller units , which can be worked on by individuals as they become available . We ’ ve found that taking many very small steps produces the most consistent rate of progress overall . **On your FAQ , you mention the project includes several modding teams – care to give any shoutouts ? ** The two largest groups within Beyond Skyrim are currently the teams working on Cyrodiil and High Rock . They are the oldest and most developed of the projects , and the closest to producing release-quality content . Cyrodiil in particular has gained a reputation for attracting high-caliber 3D artists eager to create their own interpretations of classic locations from Oblivion , some of which will be centre stage in what is likely to be the first Beyond Skyrim release : the region containing the Cyrodiilic city of Bruma . [ Image2 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/Hrfeq1v.png ) Although much remains to be done on the asset front for High Rock , it has made great strides in landscaping , and is within sight of completing our first pass for the entire landmass of the Province . I think that it ’ s safe to say that many of the hardest challenges for both these projects have now been passed ( which of course isn ’ t to say there aren ’ t more still ahead ) . We also have teams working on Hammerfell , Morrowind and various other smaller projects , although they are currently at a less advanced stage of development . But progress has accelerated recently and we can expect to hear much more from them in the coming months . [ Image3 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/6CrDLFP.jpg ) As for individual members , there are too many , contributing in too many ways , to mention them all . But there are a few I would like to single out , not simply for their own work , but for their dedication to raising the bar of quality of Beyond Skyrim as a whole . In the field of 3D art , I should draw attention to Markus Liberty , who has constantly set new standards for himself in making architectural models , and inspired others to produce assets to match this quality . [ Image4 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/cYaHaek.jpg ) Among landscapers , we are greatly indebted to Wellpapp , not only for his phenomenal output but also for his generosity in sharing his hard-won expertise with multiple projects . [ Image5 ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/ZNRW8u8.jpg ) And on the soundtrack front , mention must be made of Xae and Guin , our two Lead Composers , who have forever raised our expectations for the original soundtracks that will accompany our project .

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"The game models are very , very different . Wow has steadly been losing players , and it rises up every new game . There are still a pull towards the `` longevity '' of having one character , leveling it up and so on , compared to a game like Dota or Starcraft or Battlefield etc . It 's not comparable . Dota is and will be a game that is always battling to keep it 's players interested , just like every other game ever . Games struggle always to stay fresh , to evolve , to be on top , and it 's even harder to do so when you have a game where you just play 1 match , and that 's it , compared to an RPG . Dota has and never will be a `` casual '' game . It 's not something whoever can pick up and enjoy . So go for most MOBA games , it 's just that some are easier than others . And Dota is the hardest . And when it battles with other Mobas , like LoL , which more plays and is easier to pick up , it will always struggle to get new player . 7.00 was n't a step to , how can one put it , `` become casual '' , neither to become a better and more interesting game . It was to refresh the game . And it did , for many people . For many people , it drove them away , but that 's because many , like me , was `` afraid '' of this change , when I see now that it was a great and interesting move to refresh something stale . I 've played Dota for many years . When 7.00 came out , I thought it was a hugely drastic change . But playing Dota now , it 's not that different from what it was a year ago . Those that stop playing the game , will stop playing the game no matter what happens . And there will be some new players , but just like Wow , the player base will go up and down . https : //www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/ Just look at wow , and look at any other games ever , and realise the facts ; A video game is always living at a limited time , and will always need to work and evolve to stay fresh , but no matter what it do , it will eventually die . All Valve can do is try to keep it 's player base now , and hope that enough young people are interested in MOBA 'S , but get tired or bored of the more casual ones . But the time of the Moba-games are slowly fading . We will see how long they can keep it up , but just like every other thing , it will eventually collapse by it 's own weight , and I think Dota is heading there . & gt ; No , not this old game horseshit again . Saying it is an old game is 100 percent legit . You know how many young people do n't see old movies because `` they are not good , they are black and white '' ? That is 100 percent legimate reason for them themselves to say . They do n't think black and white movies can be good , and why is that wrong to say ? If that 's what they think , it 's what they think and it ca n't be changed unless they activly watch the movies themselves and see they are wrong . But it does n't happen , because `` they are old '' Dota is getting old . Young people can look it up and see `` Dota 2 released 2013 '' and immediatly be turned off by it , because they want something released this year . And comparing sports to it is just ridiculous . Sports are sports , it 's the most casual thing and it 's also fun . There will always be sports . But do every person growing up take an interest in Basketball ? No , but lets say 5 or 10 percent do . That 's millions of people all around the world . And when you have that high number of people , you do n't need 50 percent to take an interest to keep it alive and big .",Germanic,Norwegian,NonEuropean

A win however , that 's scary , because then you 'll start thinking `` hey , we can be top 2 this year '' , and it 's true , we would be just 2-3 points behind the rest of the top ( bar Chelsea ) , and that 's quickly develop the mentally that backfires , and the teams form suddenly fall quickly . Even so , I would be incredible happy beating Liverpool and being just 2 points behind them . The real winner however would be Chelsea . They still have a 7 point gap on 2nd , Liverpool win today would mean only 5 ...",Germanic,Norwegian,NonEuropean

Nike still has his shoes , whenever Ronaldo do interviews on his own he is covered in Nike etc . It benefits Nike more to have Ronaldo on a contract , and also allowing Adidas/RM to use his image rights , than not have him at all .

In the comments her official snap was posted , so I tought `` I 'll have a go , see if something of use is on it '' This was a couple of months ago . Surely it was , and it was actually a very funny snap to follow too . Turns out the girl is like an escort and had some sugar daddy ( or daddies ? ) somewhere , and traveled around the world , she being in Asia at the time . She talked about doing sexual favors for thousands of bucks and so , so she was like , living a comfortable and rather fun life , as she traveled around and smoked weed etc . most of her days , as well as having a decent following on snap where she posted casually her being naked in bath or in her bed or in her room and so on . Nothing sexual acts . Last week ( and I think this ? ) she is at one of her `` sugar daddies '' place , and it 's incredible beautiful , and her and one more girl is staying in this great place , having time of their life , eating comfortable , helicopter ride etc . I have only seen the mans hands , and it turned out he would be 60-70 years probably . But hey , she was having a blast it seemed . You might be wondering , `` Why is this nutsack going on about this , what has it to do with the comment he is replying too '' Well , hear now . Couple of days ago I would say , I check her snap story . She 's talking about everything being fucked . Turns out , some mother of a young teenage boy had seen her story , as the boy followed her snap . And this bitch contacted the girls mother . Mother ( and seemingly family ) was clueless to her lifestyle . And she was taking it rough , as her parents found out , saying it was fucked , but `` sorry mom , but I dont want to work at a starbucks making shit all '' So she got hit with reality , and as you said , `` paid the social cost '' , but checking her snap afterwards , she seems like she 's taking it alright . Still , ca n't believe someone ( the mother telling ) felt like she could contact this girls parents over what she was doing , because her little shit of a son was following her snap ... And it was n't that bad either , she was just casually naked mostly . It was n't porn .

29255DaysToGo,DotA2,"They did have a winning condition ; Get ahead early , get all the roshans and use aegis/cheese to push highground with Bristle and lifestealer in front and Bloodseeker aghs Rupture forcing the cores on IG to having to stand and fight . By that time your line-up should be far enough ahead to win the team fights . What failed was the lifestealer , and somewhat bloodseeker , being underfarmed despite the more towers/map control from Secret , because they farm so slow compared to IG 's cores . When you farm slow , it does n't matter if you got both jungels open . Lifestealer spending time infested in a Rubick is never a great idea . Maybe if they had a faster farming carry they could have closed it earlier , but what other carry can you send alone botlane ( since they played CM jungel/RubickBristle off ) , when IG has n't picked their offlaner yet ?

Blizzard 's video , before showing HD remaster , at the event was basically a video how people in Korea talked how they used to play BW and spend hours and hours of it . It 's basically marketing old fans that HD is coming out . I think they know their target group : People who used to play BW and/or SC2 that look to play some RTS again . I doubt they are working to get many new players into the BW scene , but I have a theory that they want to develop a new RTS in a new setting/universe , and try to get some RTS hype going again . But changing the gameplay for BW would be a pretty big decision , and big in a bad way . The game already survived 19 years in it 's current interaction , that living through it 's sequel .

29255DaysToGo,starcraft,"Fighting spirit is one of the most balanced maps , it had almost 50 percent through all match ups . However , it suits the `` turtling '' Terran kinda . I do n't really know how balanced it is if Terran just go that style of `` 2 base turtling '' Flash is the king of responsive play , and it 's just really strong game style to turtle 2 base + respond to your opponent . 2 base Terran is scary , and can do pretty much anything when scouting the opponent . Arbiter tech , lurker , muta , the turtle terran has a lot of option because in all situations you will tech up to science vessel and you never `` lose '' out on anything going there . Some builds , like protoss for instance , when going arbiter , it 's pretty strong because you get Templars and storm with doing it . Zerg is in the roughest spot , since getting a spire wo n't help you get lair , nor will Hydralisk Den . And you need that defiler tech . So Terran is in the easiest place when it get to `` teching '' , Protoss can do it fairly easy , only bad thing for them is that they need robotic facility to get observers , as well as the stargate , citadel of adun , templars archive and then arbiter tribunal , and it 's the last tech unit for protoss . Defiler mount is n't that rough , but you still need to choose between hydralisk den and spire on the way , which stops you from straight teching . However , Terran just get barrack - & gt ; factory - & gt ; stargate - & gt ; science facility . And that 's all the tech they need ( + armory ofc ) With 4 buildings they have teched up as far as they need . All relevant units unlocked . Can even get dropships from it . That 's where the power of 2 base turtling Terran is . And why they seem so OP towards Zerg . Zerg need to choose lurkers or muta often , but the Terran will do the same build to counter both play style , which means they can practice the same build over and over again and master it , countering the 2 main builds ( which make it seem like Zerg need to do some cheese to win ) However , if the map makes for the expansion being vulnerable to aggression or harrass , the Terran ca n't turtle each game without being punished . However , take it too far , and the Terran ca n't get an expansion , and then it 's auto lose against both races . Of the three races , Terran seems like the most limited in options to go builds , however , they also got the easiest way to do those builds , which makes for practising an easy time for the pros . Throughout ASL , Tastosis/Rabbit wondered why Protoss had to do the `` awful arbiter rush build '' , but I think it 's the only way the pro 's can get enough arbiters and tech/energy to use spells and actually win fights , before the terrran have 10 vessels out and emp 's all your arbiters . Terran is in the easiest spot atm , but I do n't think they are overpowered . Just need the maps to have less chokes for all the tanks and just an harder expansion to hold .",Germanic,Norwegian,NonEuropean

29255DaysToGo,soccer,"Trying to counter point this : Despite having a lackluster season , 25 matches without losing is a feat in itself IMO . If we did n't have to struggle with injuries , and especially not having Zlatan completly out in one of the more important stages of the season , I 'm sure we would finish top 4 . We are obviously still a step below Chelsea/Tottenham this season , but I think we was fairly hanging on with Liverpool/City . We already had one of the best defense in the league , and with building on the team into the next season , we could probably get a top 4 finish fairly comfortable . Maybe , if the window was amazing enough and all buys fit in perfectly , we could go for a title challenge . Mourinho know how to win a league , and the team got the defense to do so , and with the right buys going forward , the team looked capable . However , obviously would need to improve in many areas and especially against top 6 . Is the team a decade away from winning ? Who knows . The best in the league are always so good . Transfer windows gets harder and more important , but all buys last windows turned out fairly good . & gt ; Throwing money at stars without having the right balance in the squad wo n't get you anywhere Also , what the fuck does this mean , because as I said , the buys were all fine , the team got great defense and just lacked finishing this season . I understand the point of view , but you are just writing stuff that is repeated again and again about teams that do n't perform . Right balance ? ? ? Liverpool finished 2 points away from the title some years ago with having 50 goals let in . Chelsea won it a couple years ago scoring only 73 goals . Chelsea this year had a balance and just performed every week , maybe due to not having to be concerned about European football ? How todays game work , it 's impossible to say how even next season is going to be . & gt ; And missing that many chances is n't bad luck but actual lack of quality . So ... buying a striker that finish chances and then we have a shot at the title ? Because that 's the only big thing the team is missing . Finishing chances .",Germanic,Norwegian,NonEuropean

Also , I 'm a little bit bummed that Hail the Sun is leaving BSR only after one release ( that can be said to be a success as their fanbase grew twice as big as before the release of `` Wake '' ) especially if we look how Donovan is linked with some bands ( as their manager ) , is a lead singer in Sianvar and was part of BSR 's Holy Trinity Swan-Medina-Melero . Their next record could probably be another success that would bring BSR a steady position at this stage of the label . & gt ; That said BSR took some hits lately - Kurt Travis left BSR and founded Esque Records , Adventurer crashed their crowd-funded van , their drummer left and there 's still little information about their album , Stolas parted ways with their lead vocalist and decided to become a trio which will change their sound and their performence of the already existing songs . Also Eidola got pretty bigger after their release and I would n't be surprised if they would be also signed by Equal Vision in the future . & gt ; Now I 'm curious what Swan & amp ; co. will do - will we see a bunch of signings of some bands with established reputations ( maybe with a little branching out of `` swancore '' genre ) and try to grow as a label or will go into the path of signing smaller , very swancore bands like Oranges and be a stepping stone for them .

What 's worse , Bran and Rickon suffer from the same deal . What should I do ? Wait 2 years more until Arya is 16 , her portrait updates and maybe something refreshes ?

Instead the proper greeting is `` dzień dobry '' . It is still common to get up from your seat so elderly can have it .

The vote should be Jo . I do n't know if this is the solution , first time I played it I also got voted out at F5 , later by running around I found the HI , played it , and Jo went out in a 5-1 vote out Then I continued , Nikola has been voted out , I 've got left with Vinni and Sasha , the only person I talked to for the whole game . I do n't know how to continue past that , Vinni wins immunity so it 's me or Sasha and Vinni votes me . I do n't know what should be done , I have a few ideas * talk to Sasha till you make an alliance with him , later switch to Vinni * talk to Sasha and when asked , advise him to quit * I 've noticed that after the tribal I 've found the HII the floor that I 've found it on - 5th - started to burn down . Later , on the day that I 've been voted out the 4th floor started to burn down . I do n't know if a HII is hidden there ? When I tried to look for it the host said she 's tired of it and reused the `` break the wall '' challange , but it was impossible to beat * Normally it seems that you go out if you do not play the idol after the fourth challange , but when I played no votes were cancelled and Jo went 5-1 . Probably it 's how it 's supposed to be but maybe you can keep the idol and play it on the FTC and single handedly vote out Sasha I 'm probably somewhere close to beating this game but I do n't think I want to go through the creepiness of it If someone is interested in the `` boot list '' , here it is ( it 's always the same thing but maybe it 's helpful to be on the good side of the votes ) Ellis Asla Dana Margo Karo ( pick up the HII ) Jo Nikola My tactic was to stick with Sasha and Jo , but she is n't the late gamer . Talk to Sasha from the start , when he talks about Solidarity do n't tell him that the ship is sinking , on the next convo he will become your ally . Two or three conversations later he will consider quitting . I do n't know , anymore , game is very creepy and artsy-fartsy but on the other end , it definitely creates some interest and being against the game itself is also interesting . ( the game outright tells you after the vote out you are normally meant to be going but you played your idol that you was n't going to get that far and there is nothing left for you ) Whew , that became a longer post then I intended but if someone wants to try and solve this game I 'd be more than happy to know how it ends .

1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"The Dear Hunter ' song has now been changed from `` Wait '' to `` Whisper '' La Dispute 's song has been changed from `` King Park '' to `` St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues '' Many times I chose the most popular or the most played tracks , when in doubt I compared them . Also , I wanted to keep this as post-hardcore as I could so I did n't include more popular songs of bands that later on changed their style , hence `` Devil In Jersey City '' by C & amp ; C is on the playlist . With Underoath , you may be reffering to the fact that their later albums stray from this sound and are often considered to be metalcore . But `` A Boy Brushed ... '' is a good representation of the sound from this album so it fits imo . `` Cosmopolitan Blood Loss '' is a staple of this sound of post-hc spectrum so it fits . Also , Glassjaw 's sound on their albums can change pretty often so it 's not easy to pin-point the best representative . Letlive 's `` Muther '' is the song they 're most known for , and `` The Blackest Beautiful '' production is polarizing even Letlive 's so I did n't want to include a song from this album . Sadly , `` What Is It To Burn '' by Finch is n't available where I am , I 'll think on some solution to that",Balto-Slavic,Polish,NonEuropean
1Sopel6,PostHardcore,"I need to say that I 'm a little dissapointed , I kind of hoped that BSR will have aspirations to rise to the level of the bigger players and wo n't just be a local , mostly California based label . Also , I 'm a little bit bummed that Hail the Sun is leaving BSR only after one release ( that can be said to be a success as their fanbase grew twice as big as before the release of `` Wake '' ) especially if we look how Donovan is linked with some bands ( as their manager ) , is a lead singer in Sianvar and was part of BSR 's Holy Trinity Swan-Medina-Melero . Their next record could probably be another success that would bring BSR a steady position at this stage of the label . That said BSRtook some hits lately - Kurt Travis left BSR and founded Esque Records , Adventurer crashed their crowd-funded van , their drummer left and there 's still little information about their album , Stolas parted ways with their lead vocalist and decided to become a trio which will change their sound and their performence of the already existing songs . Also Eidola got pretty bigger after their release and I would n't be surprised if they would be also signed by Equal Vision in the future . Now I 'm curious what Swan & amp ; co. will do - will we see a bunch of signings of some bands with established reputations ( maybe with a little branching out of `` swancore '' genre ) and try to grow as a label or will go into the path of signing smaller , very swancore bands like Oranges and be a stepping stone for them . Or maybe they 'll decide to not change their roster that much ? Still , I 'm glad Hail the Sun grows , the song is great",Balto-Slavic,Polish,NonEuropean

Those cases in which the glans presents a moist , semi-oily appearance … long thickened foreskin , pliant and giving , large and often tortuous dorsal veins , go to make up a picture that is exceedingly tempting to the surgeon ’ s scissors . … To obtain the best results one must cut away enough skin and mucous membrane to rather put it on a stretch when erections come later . There must be no play in the skin after the wound has thoroughly healed , but it must fit tightly over the penis , for should there be any play the patient will be found readily to resume his practice , not begrudging the time and extra energy needed to produce the orgasm .

11111000101,poland,"Heya , I 'm currently traveling around europe half for fun half surveying a new place to live and work . Poland really caught my interest . I ca n't really speak for the country as a whole but I visited Warsaw and Krakow and I absolutely loved Krakow . I 'm from Portugal and I do n't really see a future in my country and Poland seems to be in a good place economically , cost of living is cheaper and salaries are about the same or even higher ( I 'm a web developer ) than in Portugal . So it seems like a good choice . But since being somewhere as a tourist is very different from living somewhere , I have a few questions : - How bad is it really with religion and the conservative government ? I have n't met that many poles while traveling but the few I did seemed pretty fed up with religion and with the impact it had on their lives and they spoke to me about it out of their own initiative . Maybe I was unlucky but how big is the influence of religion in this country ? - How is the public healthcare ? According to what I found on google it seems almost required to have private insurance to have effective care , correct ? - Do you think it 's a good idea to move there ? : ) - Any other cities you think I should absolutely visit before making up my mind ? Gdansk ? Poznan ? About Krakow : - While researching I found out that smog could be a problem . Is this still true ? How bad is it ? - I can rely on trams for my transportation , right ?

222baked,explainlikeimfive,"So baisically whenever you get hit in the head , there 's a risk of blood filling into your brain holder , or cranium , and increasing the pressure inside there . The brain does n't like this and stops working properly . To another person outside that looks a lot like the person who got hit in the head is sleepy , which is the first stage of a coma . Usually a coma is judged by seeing how a person 's eyes , voice , and movements respond to different levels of stimulation ; from normal to only responding to pain , or not responding at all . However , just because you got hit in the head , it does n't mean there 's a lot , or even any blood , filling your cranium . Decreased conciousness , or sleepiness , is a sign that there might be blood in there , and you should n't go to sleep without going to the doctor 's and getting a picture taken of your brain to make sure you 're ok . If you go to sleep , you can lose more conciousness , or fall deeper into a coma . The doctor will never see you , wo n't be able to tell if there is too much pressure in your cranium , and you might go into deeper and deeper sleep as the pressure increases , until you can never wake up .",Romance,Romanian,NonEuropean

Look at Vancouver 's poverty stricken Downtown East-side where rentals have resisted the inflation that is paguing the city , and you can find one bedrooms in the 350-500 $ /mo range . Why ? Because it 's a shit hole that 's targeted for the low income group we 're talking about . UBI would not increase this target group 's disposable income by a significant margin , and it should n't effect the price of housing in that area . As to your second point , that is only partially true , and there 's many times when it 's downright false . Often times people who have lost all ties and are in severe poverty wont find a job . They smell , theyre dirty , and they dont have a phone . They often wo n't get hired in the first place , and one needs some basic amenities and support to be able to pull themselves out of severe poverty . It 's why it 's a called a poverty trap .

When I bought my current car , I saw some 30k mile cars with work brakes , worn clutches , worn cheap tyres ( different model on each wheel ) and so on .

222baked,canada,"Wow , there 's some real misunderstanding of our system here . First of all , let 's understand a bit the role of your family doctor . He 's the one who is supposed to hold a complete medical history for you , and ultimately decide treatment regimens , and tailor them to your needs , even above the authority of a specialist . If you visit walk-ins , it 's very difficult for your family doctor to keep track of your medical history . You may have revealed something at a walk-in that could later on affect your future treatment . This lack of effective communication might lead to your family doctor getting a big slap of malpractice when something goes wrong in the future . He 's ultimately responsible for you . Why would he take the risk ? Another big one is the misunderstanding in how our billing system works . That he 's being billed directly for your walk-in visit . GPs receive a yearly sum of cash for having you as a patient , and will receive a service fee every time you come in . When you go to a walk-in , not only is he not receiving that fee , but he is getting billed for a service fee . Now , you might scream that he 's being money hungry , but that 's not even remotely the case . Family physicians can only take so many patients to remain effective ( some take too many , but that 's besides the point ) , and so by you going to see walk-ins more often than your GP , you are essentially occupying a spot that could be better used on someone else for whom he can treat more effectively . Also , you 're literally depriving him of revenue . Your GP does n't make that much after covering his overhead ( see : http : //www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/how-much-are-canadian-doctors-paid/article7750697/ ) . Have you ever seen a server get angry when they do n't make tip ? Now maybe you can empathize a bit . Next is this 2-3 week waiting you are all screaming bloody murder about . That 's not really how it works . Most GPs have atleast 1-2 days a week where they will see take walk-ins also , and if you come into your GPs office with a soft emergency , they will squeeze you in . You might have to wait . The 2-3 weeks is for scheduled visits , which are not supposed to be used for acute conditions . When you have strep throat , you go right away and wait for your turn . Those scheduled meetings are used when it 's something that can wait ; follow-up , adjusting treament , yearly physical , non-emergency complaints . Also prescription refills should n't be a 2-3 weeks wait . Your family physician knows when you run out of medication , and usually schedules you to come back for a refill when you run out . I once got hit in the tailbone , and it hurt so bad I could n't sit down , but it was n't a serious ER emergency , so I went in to my GPs office he took me in first , because it was a priority . Learn to use your family doctor effectively . You should n't be going to walk-ins except in very extreme circumstances . It 's actually to your own detriment in the long term , and since you 're warned about this when signing up , your doctor is in right for freeing up a spot when you are being uncompliant .",Romance,Romanian,NonEuropean

I 'm going to wrap up my degree in Paris in the coming couple of years , and if Canada had not had its bilingualism , I never could 've done it . I 'm glad I was forced to learn French . No contempt on this part . People in the English speaking Canada who have contempt for the French language are ignorant , but hey , the world is full of ignorant people , so we ca n't worry about them . However , from what I garner these are just going to be used for short internal memos , and it wo n't be like all official documents will be published using a translator . What does it matter if a machine translates it , or a human does if the end result is the same ? Either way it 's getting done . Realistically , I doubt machines are at that level yet , but it is besides the point . We 'll never have laws published in broken French , so fear not . I wish French-speakers were not so sensitive about these language issues . Do n't misunderstand , I can see why one feels that they are losing their language , but to start yelling fire that a machine will translate some internal memos used by parliament seems rather excessive . The truth is , and read this with feelings aside , the languages are not equal . Nobody said they 're equal . French is spoken by a clear minority of the population ( 22 % according to wikipaedia ) . It 's sad that not more people speak French , but you ca n't really impose 3/4 of the population who have no clue about the French language or culture to all of a sudden speak French , and do everything in both languages . I believe any rational being can see the folly in believing it possible to achieve something like this . French has huge respect across the country . Every cereal box is in both English and French , every child has to learn 9 years of French , and all official functions are bilingual . It would be hard to find a country where a minority language has the respect French has in Canada .

They 're essentially the same thing , the newer one that was marketed only needs to be taken once a day ( which is good ) . You 'd prescribe them anyways , they 're quite harmless , so what if the drug rep wants to pitch their drug ? It can get unethical only if the drug is inferior in either cost/effectiveness , and the physician prescribes it , but it 's the physicians responsibility and privledge to make that call . I do n't know any physicians who actually compromise on their patients well-being and ethical duty for some gifts and free meals . People have some sort of repulsion to these things because they do n't understand them and only see the outrageous superficial nature of them . Drug company = bad , doctor = evil and corrupt . In reality a lot of physicians are n't aware of new drugs which are constantly coming on the market , and some are better , whereas some are just the same .

As soon as I realized that , I pulled out the MacBook but it was already too late since the water was spilled already . Desperately I tried turning it on but obviously it did n't work . Since I 'm not from the US and in my country there is no official Apple Store , I had to resort to third party repair services . So I handed it to them and like 5 days later they tell me that the repair cost would be around 1700 dollars , where MacBook 2015 is worth around 1200 ? I think . The point is that I do n't really trust these guys with having the fairest prices . So is it possible that water could ruin the laptop so much that the repair price is higher than the retail price ? Considering that only minimum amount of liquid got into the laptop , I did n't throw it into the pool or anything . Thanks",Balto-Slavic,Russian,NonEuropean

My mom who 's 70 was treated for chlamydia last year because of a hospital visit where some equipment was n't sterilized correctly or something of the sort . There are non-STD forms of Chlamydia . For example , Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic ( animal to human ) infection that causes psittacosis , an acute kind of pneumonia . People who have pet parrots , parakeets/budgies , cockatiels , and similar birds ( aka psittacines ) have gotten this infection in the past .

I had a weird upbringing , but a lot of these things didn ’ t come from my parents , it came from realising what it takes to be a decent human being and gain respect from others and be treated fairly . It comes with having common sense . Sometimes parents are retarded and raise their children to be that way too , but oftentimes like in my own example , I tried to do my best to not be like my parents and have better habits . Not saying these are theirs , just giving a general statement , but these are some things that tick me off and give me a general impression about yourself and your choices growing up : If they constantly try to sound smarter than they are . If they litter and try to say that there ’ s a janitor or city worker that cleans up that mess , it ’ s their job . Basic manners . People who fuck up , and apologize by saying “ I ’ m sorry , but… ” There ’ s no but . If you are sorry , you say so , then shut up and deal with the consequences . How you treat waiters , bartenders , drivers , clerks , staff , etc . How you treat anyone for that matter , like animals . Animals are below you , they are weak and can not defend themselves , so how you treat those below you , says a lot to me about yourself . Judging someone before you get to know them . Maybe that McDonalds worker has a degree but can ’ t find a job in it . Maybe life forced them to change course . Also , who would serve you that McDonalds if they didn ’ t ? If you have read nothing but the Bible . Big red-flag for me . Open your eyes a little . At least try and understand other people ’ s points of view .

Little things , that made my life harder , just avoid them . Avoid certain people that were bad for me . Change relationships . Stop my friend from killing himself . My current boyfriend ( that I love to death ) had one girlfriend before me , and she died in a car crash . Even though it would pain me to do this , I 'd prevent that so he did n't have to suffer the way he did ( totally messed up his life , he stopped exercising , caused him to gain a lot of weight since he ate a lot and did n't burn it off , and it got so bad that he became obese and his stomach overproduced acid and it ate his stomach and they had to operate to remove it , which resulted in no stomach , he can only eat a cup worth of food for a meal . No more . ) He 's lost the weight but you can see the scars from the surgery all over . I 'm pretty sure he 'd be better off not having to experience all that , also his life was very dull before he met me .

Complete internal bleeding and for months he could n't move an inch without pain and suffering . Find better ways to make money . I was always scheming how to make more money , but definitely make better choices there . Maybe even make something I knew would be popular ( not necessarily something big , I do n't want to alter the world that much so that the whole future changes and I do n't know a thing about it - I do want to retain at least some control of my future ) Now that I know what people think about me , perhaps change their perceptions to something better ?

So sometimes we get the email wrong , and I can see that in the mailbox , but I do n't have access to the other report that he supposedly has access to .

How can he still have access to something like that if he does n't have access to the inbox ? How can we see something like that ? I only see 'delivery status notification ' in the inbox , just saying the email has bounced back . Nothing more than that . We want to stop him from having any kind of access but would also like to have access to those reports ourselves . I do n't see anything of the sorts in the godaddy email page . Nothing in settings , anywhere . Nothing suggesting he 's getting something forwarded to him . In the old emails we used to send ( ones made by him ) I can assume he had an image in there that he would track how often it was loaded , but I 've made a new email for the company since because the old one kind of sucked and they liked mine better .

Not everyone can change with sobriety but some people do . 3 . They become substance abusers because it 's a change from the norm , it 's fun , it 's a way to kill the boredom which we suffer . 4 .

Guys can be annoying as fuck so I rarely bother with them . So , we hit it off , have tons in common , talk about this and that , I offer to dogsit her dog over new years , and I tell her about a concert on Saturday . She 's excited as she only moved here a couple months back and did n't even know we had a punk scene so I made her day by telling her about it . Then at some point she mentions her husband , and I 'm like 'oh you 're married ? That 's unusual for Tinder ... ' 'Yeah , I just felt weird putting it in my profile ... but another person mentioned it too . Sorry if I gave the wrong idea' Told her it was fine but I did kinda get my panties wet hoping she was into me and Saturday would be a date . Why did I offer to dogsit ? I 'm still gon na do it cause furries < 3 but man ... She added it to her profile in the end cause several people brought it up . But she was worried people would n't swipe if they saw that . I told her I 'm down for making friends , so I would have swiped anyway if you made it clear you want friends and it does n't sound like you 're married and looking for something .

12084182,Epilepsy,"Just looking for other people 's stories . Started last night . Took one dose , first three days I 'll be taking just one dose to adapt and then 2 doses a day . Woke up with swollen eyes and was too tired to get up , could n't even change my alarm , which is what I usually do if I 'm tired , set it for 5 mins later ( rare though , if I have to be up for something specific , I 'm up ) . ( had ~7 hours of sleep , not unusual but prefer 8 ) Woke up 35 mins later and got up . Went to the bathroom , stumbled a bit by the door . Maybe I 'm just so tired , maybe it 's the meds . Felt like farting later . Everyone farts , but this felt really strong , and it was ! Did n't eat anything out of the usual . Rest of the day would occasionally get knots in my stomach and feel like I might need the bathroom . Thankfully nothing happened there . Maybe it 's the meds , maybe something else . Only thing I could n't find under symptoms , I found stomach upset , but no farting . Maybe that counts . Came home , passed out , slept for a good 4 or so hours . Woke up , found my left eye to be swollen a bit . I guess I 'm a bit drowsy , but not a whole lot , just tiredness I guess . Took my next dose like 2 hours ago . I hope tomorrow 's better . Might be worse , oh well . Really do n't like this tiredness thing , my line of work requires not a lot of sleep and energy . Tomorrow night is my last night of a single dose . From then on I start morning doses too . I 'm on 500mg for starters , then it 'll keep going up until I reach my needed dose . I have staring spells , which is why I 'm taking this . At least I do n't have anger outbursts , that was my biggest worry as I irritate easily . Apparently the side effects subside within 4 weeks , get weaker so I 'm hoping that 's the case . Edit : Second day , right eye is n't swollen or even hurting to touch anymore , but left eye is swollen some more and hurts . Also itchy . Slight sore throat . Had a mild headache/earache this morning . Or , more like pressure on the head . No other symptoms , farted a bit ago , so I know that 's still ongoing , but less than before . Stomach still twists on occasion . Second Edit : So , turns out the whole eye thing was a completely separate thing . I got a [ stye ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stye ) in my eye , literally right as I started taking Keppra so I assumed it was a side effect , but turns out a pore on my eyelid got blocked so that happened . And my stomach being upset was just my period happening , and I guess I did n't realize it cause I was too focused on the meds and trying to see what side effects I was getting . They probably affected how I felt too so I did n't recognize the usual symptoms .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,Shoestring,"The concept is pretty simple : The traveler performs a service for a host in exchange for free accommodation . The service can be anything the two people agree on : from cooking lessons or massage to website design or house repairs . Likewise , the length of stay can be accordingly negotiated . Sometimes a service will require host ’ s presence ( in case of , lets say , personal coaching ) . Other times , the service can be delivered independently , such as website design . In such instances , it ’ s possible that the host will let you use his summerhouse for a week or two or maybe even their home without them actually being there . Whatever you two agree upon should be honored . We are here to provide a platform that will help you find a great opportunity and enable you to make a connection with your match , be it a host or a service provider . We are still in the early stages of project development , but are working hard to make it come to life . One of our main goals is to make this platform free for everyone . If that turns out to be impossible , and we are cornered into charging some kind of fee to cover our operating expenses , we will aim to make access fee as low as possible . We are determined , however , to grant our early adopters Premium Free Membership for life regardless of how much we may later decide to charge regular users . It 's for people that would love to travel and see new places but ca n't really afford to get a room . So you 'd just offer your skill set to a potential host and they 'd let you stay at theirs for free in exchange for helping them out with what you can offer . For example : I need someone to help me with this programming course I 've started . I ca n't seem to get a hang of it . You come along and I offer you to stay at mine in exchange for help with programming . You 've got a place to stay , food , and outings if we arrange it . It 's up to the host if they want to offer more than a place to stay and food/necessities . Discuss with them and find a suitable arrangement . Sure , you can teach programming online and get yourself a room in a hotel as you travel and work , but why not meet people along the way ? We think this is the best way to integrate into a local culture , be with locals !",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

We decided to find someone to pay off my truck for me and then keep it . We found someone , wrote up a contract on paper , took photos of his and our ID 's and that was that . 500 $ a month . First month , late payment . Second month , late again . Third month , no payment as of yet , ( should have been on the 25th of last month ) . ( I 'm guessing using late payments as a means of buying time ) Ahhh ... Cops wont do anything , cop came over one day and we filed a complaint , said he needs to deal with the matter otherwise in 10 days it becomes theft . Then we got a call that because it was a civil matter , they ca n't do anything . But we do n't know where he is , if we did , it would be fine , but we do n't , so it 's not really a civil matter . The whole contract thing screwed us up and therefore the police wont do anything about it . We started going to all known addresses , everyone is clearly covering for him . Looked up addresses online , hired an investigator to look him up , either he does n't live at an address or no one knows where he is , or even has his number . He 's deleted his number , his dad 's deleted his number , there 's just nothing there . We ca n't reach them anymore . We received a toll a while back , showing that he was in Miami and failed to pay a toll . Investigator found us some address in Miami to check out . We ended up calling a repo service and they said they would search Miami for us so we do n't have to go down ( It 's a 4 hour drive ) The other day we noticed there was an old ad of his on craigslist that he 's selling a bed ( had his old number on it ) and I started messaging him from my email as he does n't know who I am , and from google voice , I set up a number , so he 's texting me , and setting up a meeting . During our conversations I mentioned I was moving from Miami and that I did n't have a car . and then he goes 'I work at a dealership , I can hook you up with a car ' which now makes me think he 's sold the car and that 's why he could n't have delivered it because he does n't drive a truck . We 've considered telling the repo man to say we already got the car back and he stole it again , and at that point be able to report him for theft .

12084182,AskReddit,"That post itself might very well not be real ( as most things on the internet are n't , and we should all be cautious ) . But things like that do exist out there . You 'd be amazed at what is real and people think it 's just there to be gore for us . That movie , where the girls go on a trip and take a random ride in a bus to their hotel thinking it 's an airport bus and one of them ends up on a shipping container with a cat litter box and stuff . That movie is actually pretty spot on with what happens . When I was younger I was approached by someone late at night ( I was like 14 coming home from a night out ) and I later found out that they were a convicted sex trafficker trying to get me to go with them . It fueled my anger towards how little is done to help sex trafficking victims . As a college student I did a research paper on sex-trafficking and slaves because it bothered me so much how little people knew about it and I wanted to shock my class with the facts . Girls as young as under 10 get kidnapped . They are promised jobs like working in a carpet factory . Family agrees because they do n't have money or is n't aware it 's happening as the children just walk off with strangers claiming to know their family . Sometimes girls just get kidnapped as I almost did ( guy tried to bribe me with his private plane and mansion , I did n't buy it , he then tried proposing to me and telling me he loved me ) and are sent off . Girls are forced to have sex ( in some cases ) with at least 30 men a day . Does n't matter if you 're on your period , do n't feel well , are in too much pain from the last client or anything for that matter , you do it . If you do n't have sex with at least 30 men you get punished . All girls are drugged so they are numb and keep needing more drugs so they do what they are told and are too fucked up to try and escape . You want to escape ? You get punished if you get found out . One girl had her teeth knocked out . another got pregnant at 12 and when she managed to escape and get home , her family ostracized her and did n't believe her and said she put it on herself , then her 'uncle ' said he 'd offer her a better life and a job and ended up sending her right back into the sex industry she just barely got out of . If you 've been in there long enough , and are not useful to them anymore Stockholm syndrome kinda happens . They offer you money and all the latest fashion and a nice car and place , in exchange you recruit new girls ( and yes , girls do this , it 's either getting a new life with nice things or fucking 30 guys a day , so of course you 'd rather recruit new girls . You 're so numb and drugged at this point that you do n't care , anything that takes you away from the day in day out of fucking is better ) . So these women , go out there , act as role models for girls from shitty countries in Eastern Europe or some Asian place or anywhere this is rampant and these girls think 'ooh , I could be like her , I can get a job and have nice things and look how confident she is , she 's happy with her life , I can get away from this shitty life where my family sucks and is poor ' . Then they get sold off to the highest bidder . You could end up in someone 's basement as a slave , or go work in a brothel . Making friends with a brothel worker ? Nope , boss does n't like that , he 's selling you off to another brothel . He does n't want to see you possibly happy or making friends with a worker . New boss finds out that you were being sneaky at last brothel and insists your new sex limit is at least 50 guys a day or punishment . Why do people encourage this ? It 's cheap . Taxi workers can take an hour off of work and not lose much because it 's so cheap to get sex . Some people like that they get young girls , too young to get anywhere else . Others like the fact that they might not speak their language . Or that they can do what they please because they have the money . Or because it 's risky and illegal . It 's disgusting is what that is and I really hope that something gets done about it . I 'm apparently from ( well , grew up in ) the country with one of the highest sex trafficking rates in Europe . It disgusts me how this is capable of happening . And my class was flabbergasted when I brought up the statistics and directly quoted our country as one with a high problem . People turn a blind eye too easily to problems around us and refuse to believe that things are real and happening .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,cyprus,"'Sports handicapping ' which is a fancy term for sports betting . Like if you 've seen the website bet365 ( it pops up everywhere for me so I 'm going to assume it 's known ) but we use another bookey and we convince clients to use our services and we place bets on their behalf . They bet , earn 75-82 % on average for each game ( apparently we have some top traders that do amazing guesswork and have access to trainers/coaches that give inside information to get those high percentages , no idea how that works ) , our company takes 20 % profits , and I get 5 % of that . So if you 're good with convincing clients , then you have clients that are constantly betting and every time they withdraw money and it hits their bank , you get 5 % of that .

12084182,careeradvice,"So , my resume might make me out to be a bit flaky . I started one degree , a year in , transferred to another university ( the degree was really crappy , and the university too ) . The other one was better , but 3 years in I got accepted to a really good university in the States and moved there . I graduated . All 3 degrees were somewhat arts related , so nothing businesslike . The first one had a focus on advertising , but I never got to that , as the first year was very traditional arts based . I 've come to the conclusion ( long story , involving family , and me being fed up with my current situation , 26- jobless and stuck with family problems ) , that I 'd like to move out and just get any job . So I 'm trying to get into the forex/binary options/trading industry , whatever you call it . It 's huge in my country , so there 's constantly jobs available . Even though I possess a skill they always want : Languages ( I speak more than 3 fluently ) , I 'm not their ideal candidate . My social skills are not that great , and even though they hire just about anyone , ( you do n't need any skills for entry-level positions because they offer training ) , they want to see extroversion in a person . The last interview I went to , the lady asked some general questions , and even though I answered them the way she wanted , she was a bit stuck on how I have 3 artsy degrees and nothing on my resume related to their industry or business in general or customer service . I said I was looking for a long term job , but it did n't seem to help . I have a job listed on my CV , working in promotions , where I used to hand out product samples and interact with people , but I do n't think she cared for that . She pointed out how I worked as a lyricist for about 2 years , but when asked if I still do that , I said no . I regret not expounding on the interview . For lyricist I could have said that I did n't like the contract , which was true . My manager got 20 % of all profits and if I had any kind of job during that contract ( other than it ) , he got 20 % of my profits , even if the job continued when the contract expired ( what kind of bs is that ? who does that ? ) If she had known I quit not because I got bored and do that all the time , but because I was being treated unfairly , it would have been different , no ? Another thing I wish I had mentioned , though I 'm hoping you can tell me if my logic is sound , I have epilepsy that has only recently been discovered though I 've had it all my life ( a type that is n't easily noticeable ) and I might not be able to work in my field anyway if the doctors conclude that lights and sounds affect my health . So I wish when she had asked me 'what was your first job choice upon graduation , or what would you rather chose right now if given the chance ... ' that I had said I had epilepsy and could n't work in my field either way because of that , and am thus seeking work elsewhere without having to obtain another degree . Would that have helped reassure her I was n't a fight risk ? I 'm not sure how to land a job like that , since I do n't look like someone that would last long , but I really just want a job so I can move out and be on my own and not be surrounded by my toxic family . They are really starting to get on my nerves and I just want a place of my own , a stable job whatever it might be and time for myself to de-stress .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,relationships,"I know I 'm not him , but I 'll try and put it from his perspective , take that how you will , I know I might not even know what 's going through his head . `` It 's been years since the incident , I 'm still depressed but I manage to go on . I 'm in college for game art , I suppose that 's good , better than engineering school , that was too easy , though I suppose this is too since I 'm better than most of the other students . I 'm bored enough to join a dating site , lets message some girls to see if they want to hang . Hmm , she seems cool , she 's into games too . Maybe we can play sometime . Oh God , she 's amazing , we spent every day together this week , I have n't had so much fun in years . I 'm in Love . I told her that today , I think it might have been to sudden when I blurted it out , she looked at me funny , but hey , I ca n't help what I 'm feeling . I asked her to be my girlfriend . There 's not a day we do n't spend together , I do n't want to be around anyone else . I broke down tonight , I guess my past caught up to me . I told her about my only other girlfriend , how she was in a car crash when we were 18 , after dating for four years , and how I had to pull the plug . Nothing was the same since . I was so depressed and gained weight abnormally ( after stopping all sports that I was actively in ) , that they had to remove my stomach , I became obese , I 'm better now , but she has n't seen what I was like . I told her that she was the only thing that made me feel good anymore . She made my world . We 've been together for 3 weeks , and she 's going away to visit her family in a little over a month for 3 months . I do n't want her to go but I do n't want to be too forward to suggest to go with her . I brought it up , kinda , I do n't get why she 's being weird about it , what has she got to hide ? She got a weird message the other night from a friend back home . I could n't sleep , it was 3am and I did n't like it , but there was nothing to suggest anything weird in their conversation history . I 'm worried she 's hiding something , I should just leave this place , forget it all . I do n't want to get hurt . She 's awake and convincing me to stay , that it was a wrong message , and that there 's nothing in the history , which is true . I 'll trust her . But as I say this , I do n't trust her going home , I 'm going to go with her , I bought myself tickets , it 's two months in and I 'm spending 2k to go be with her , is n't that romantic ? I hope she thinks it 's as romantic as I do . I hope she moves in with me soon , I told her I 'd get her a cheap car from craigslist so she can drive to school since I 'm not at a walking distance from it . We 're heading back home , her lease is running up and I suggested she moves in with me . It 's been 5 months now . I 'd like her to be with me , we have n't spent a day apart except from her being 1 week home until I got there . Her roommate brings up moving with some friends so she can move in with me , perfect ! I told her she 'd be paying less rent if she stays with me , besides , her mom just had expensive surgery and her parents are probably short on money . She 's not going to be selfish and spend more money is she ? She can get a car now with that money she was meant to use for rent . I lost my income , things have been a bit tight so I 've asked her to contribute to me more than usual . But we 're a couple and we help each other right ? I helped her with her stuff when she needed it , now it 's her turn . She wants to go out often , which I think is a waste of money ( by often I mean , 2-3 times a month ) . She goes out with her friends and stays up late , like 3-4 am and I do n't know what she 's doing or if she 's alright . She texts me all the time but I feel bad to interfere with her friend time so I tell her so but she still texts me . Then I start feeling bad for her so I stop texting , but then I sulk at how she 's out having fun while I 'm home alone . But it 's okay , I make sacrifices for the relationship . She says I should go out with my friends , but why ? I 've got her , she 's all I need , I do n't need anyone else in my life , she makes me happy , my friends were there just to kill time . I was still bored , even hanging with them . She gets me , like no one else does , she makes my day , anything she does is just magical . If she were to leave , I 'd be devastated . I said the other day that I 'd probably kill myself , then I realized later that she took it the wrong way . I noticed she posted to that Reddit site she 's always on , I did n't like her post , it sounded like she was unhappy . She mentioned that it was emotional abuse , but then I told her that I did n't mean it that way , I was joking . I was n't , but I did n't want to crush her , I love her , she 's my everything . I do n't want to hurt her . She told me it was n't the same , things have changed , she has different feelings now . It crushed me , I was devastated , how could she say that ? Was what I offered her not enough ? I got her everything that she wanted , even when she told me I did n't have to , I knew she 'd want it and was just modest . We still have sex regularly , 1-2 times a day , I know she 's not always into it , but she knows it makes me happy and I know she wants to make me happy . I do n't get how she can suddenly not be into it , it 's weird . I still try hard to get her to enjoy herself and hope that she changes her mind . I ca n't take it anymore , everything 's piling on , I 've got a warrant for my arrest , I failed to mention I have some bad habits , but it 's okay , she accepts me , bad habits or not . That 's what I love about her . I told her I could n't take it , and I got some sleeping pills . I planned on doing it right at the time she leaves , oh yeah she 's flying to see her sister for a month , I feel like she ca n't take it here anymore and it 's the only reason . I told her it was selfish of her to want to just hang with her sister while I 'm here struggling with a warrant and everything turning to shit . I used to make 4k a week , and now I 've got nothing . Except the job that I got right out of college , out of 500 people applying to the same company , 80 in my city , I got the job among 6 other people . I was that lucky guy . I mean , I also have a house , of my own , my own car , smart TV , gaming computer , 5 consoles , 4 laptops , etc ... But I 'm broke , really . I have nothing , I ca n't afford to pay for things soon . And she 's leaving . She found me , paralyzed in the bed , not feeling it , and called an ambulance . I told her to go , but she could n't , she stayed by my side . I made sure my parents did n't find out , it would devastate them . I got out but realized I could n't evade my warrant for too long so I turned myself in right before she got a second ticket to just go see her parents . My parents had to find out eventually . They were more supportive than I thought , I told her to not tell them all the details of what I did , just enough . Especially not about killing myself , I ca n't have them know that . She 's gone for the summer , I ca n't call her . I used to call her daily , and she 'd brighten up my time in here . I ca n't take it , I 'm not meant for jail . She 's back now , and she came to visit me once , but seems to be busy to come again . She wants to move out . I do n't see why she should , I mean , she can stay there , and does n't even have to pay rent , my parents got it covered , I do n't want to stress her while she has school and all these other stresses moving is too much for her . I told her I 'd help her once I 'm out , I want to help her . Plus money 's tight , so she should save up while she 's here and I can help her get money and fix things . It 's official , she 's leaving and sooner than I thought . I told her to at least stay until I can get house visits once a week for 10 hours . Just to hold her and hug her and watch a movie one last time . I was hoping the distance would make the heart grow fonder . Turns out I was wrong , oh so wrong . What do ? I get out of jail , I lost the job I had for the summer , I lost my car , did n't make payments . I have the house , but it 's empty , she 's gone and I 've got nothing .

12084182,travel,"So my friend was looking for flights to Miami , and he did n't want to search for flights from his origin ( Georgia , Europe ) but from any other big city in Europe that would have cheap flights to Miami . We tried everything , but the most we could get was a website that let you search nearby airports and had the option from a distance of 2,000 miles . It was able to show me that flights existed but failed to load them or tell me which airport it was leaving from . I know you can search by origin and leave the destination blank like on Skyscanner or Kayak or even Google , but the other way round seems impossible . How can one do this without having to type each city manually ? We 've already settled on a flight but I would like to know for future use as well because I travel to Europe sometimes and there are plenty of cheap airlines flying to major cities in Europe from where I 'm from , but not to the States and sites like Skyscanner do n't include those 'cheap ' airlines all the time so it 'd be nice to have options from a city so I can look up the cheap flights .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,ipod,"I 've always had a Zune , I do n't know why but they always worked for me . Recently my Zune died and I figured since I want more space anyway and somehow possibly iPod 's are better ( and the Zune was discontinued ) I 'm better off with an iPod . I 'm getting pretty frustrated with it . For starters , Zune knows how to organize a library , it can detect the same artists from similar files whereas the iPod ca n't . For example , The Band and The Band , are according to the iPod a different band , even though they have the same name . Or The Band vs The band or the band or just band . It ca n't seem to tell that it 's the same thing . Also , Zune categorizes things by album artist , so if there 's a song The Band Feat . The The , it knows that the main artist due to the album artist field is The Band and sorts it accordingly , that way I do n't have a ton of compilation songs all under separate names . Another thing , I recently added a lot of random music from an old HDD , now the iPod sorted it into the library but gives me no option of seeing what was recently added . With the Zune however , I can see recently added artists and add them accordingly . With iTunes , I have to go through all my files to find the new ones and add them ( and I have over 200GB of music ) . I decided to double check all the name fields so it sorts it under one , make all mixed files sorted by genre so I do n't have to look for a ton of files at once but add by genre , but iTunes did not decide to update all this ( I did it externally ) and even when I reloaded it , it refused to update the files . What can I do ? EDIT : My library is not set to auto sync as I have two computers and originally used one to add music , but then found songs on the other one and added them manually , and that 's where this problem comes in . I ca n't sync automatically on this computer without erasing all music .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,relationships,"This is so true . The weirdest thing in this whole situation , when the first big conversation happened , we discussed a lot of things , like me not really wanting kids but liking the idea of adoption . I think that bothered him in the end more than anything because he still brings it up and asks me to consider having my own kids . Anyway , my sister went for a job interview in a neighboring country , took her kids ( 7,8 ) and fell in love with a guy working for the company , they plan on getting married . My dad was so shocked . My other sister is dating a guy 10 years younger and he 's all tattooed up and in piercings . So he goes to me 'you know my friend Brian ? He got divorced , found himself a young girl and got two kids now he 's running around after them . He looks 10 years younger , says he has a purpose for life now , something to fight for . Maybe I should find myself a young girl and get a little kiddo ' ( although my parents are married , their marriage is really weird and strained and they almost divorced a dozen times but ended up just not doing it , they do n't really do anything together much anymore except family meals and him occasionally visiting to see how she is or staying at the house , but in a different bedroom . They both claim the other snores too much ) That hurt , on such a huge level . You were n't there for me , but want a kid to be there for and fight for ? It honestly was n't the first thing that popped into my head since dad told me that my sister 's getting married and I Was like , what ? Since when ? and to whom ? And then I was like , well , you 're 70 , so if that kids in high school when you die , what then ? or the age factor , you 're 70 'well at least he had a dad that loved him , that 'll always stay with him , kids love their parents no matter who they are or how old they are , I probably ca n't have kids , but if I did , I 'm sure it would n't judge me for my age ' . And then I felt shit because he was n't there for me and said that but I kept quiet cause he was like 'well if your sister gets to get married on a whim , the other one dates a guy 10 years younger with tattoos , and you do n't want kids , just to adopt and might marry a girl , then I think it 's fair I can want to have kids of my own , it 's been 10 years since I had any sexual relations ( note the viagra I spotted on his bedside table in a bag full of meds , possibly telling me otherwise , did he find someone already ? and just wants approval ? ) and it would be nice if I could have someone ... How unfair would that be on mom who 's sick and suffering ? Every time she knows he 's coming over , she insists on some blue ring he got her and does little things she normally would n't . To me it 's clear she still cares and wants something . I do n't think he does . Also , my oldest sister might be a half-sister . Wow . Interesting news from my middle sister , who says that 's why dads so panicked about neither of us wanting kids of our own cause those might not be his real grandkids . Sorry for the long ass rant . my mom started yelling at me earlier for forcing her to go get something rather than me get it for her ( we 're trying to get her to be active and not become a statue , her left hand has lost mobility because she refuses to use it , and she just watches tv all day , so I told her to get the item herself , it 's short , and she has n't been on her nightly walks in 2 days anyway because of rain so it 'll be exercise even though I would n't call it that as it 's 5 steps to the item and then 20 to bed ) . Anyway , she started yelling I 'm an idiot , over and over and I just lost it . I asked was I an idiot for trying to help her get back into shape ? Yes , apparently . Then I said I should just kill myself since I 'm that much of an idiot . she agreed and I said I was heading to the balcony and did , and when she said 'go for it ' I just lost it and almost jumped . Sorry for dumping this here but I had nowhere to put all this and I 've had the worst past 2 years of my life and all this shit piling on just makes it so hard to keep going . After not being able to do it , I sat and cried on the balcony and she came 10 minutes later crying herself , asking for an apology . Saying I do n't know how hard it is for her . A year ago I had a car wreck and spinal fusion . I could n't move my arms even an inch in any direction at first . Could n't move my head . It was painful and all the physiotherapy was a nightmare . I hated it , I wanted to yell at them and tell them to stop and that I could n't do it . But had I let that happen , I would almost be a statue right now . It 's the only reason I make her do things on her own sometimes so she can get back into shape .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

When loading said band/artist , do n't force me to pick a specific album or chose all songs . Have them all there , categorized under album , so I can just pick a song without having to make another touch to get to all the songs . 3 . When past 5-10 seconds of a song and I click the skip back button , I want to restart the song , not go to the previous one . First five seconds , fine , I 'll go to the previous one and play it again . ( this would be really handy , so used to windows programs that do that ) 4 . On the lock screen , I do n't need an extra screen with song info , only to exit that one and get to my regular lock screen and then finally get to my device , so if it has this option , I 'd like to be able to disable it so I only have one lock screen to go through . ( sometimes I need to get to my device fast ) 5 . When I pause a song and want to skip through to find another song , do n't auto play each song . I paused for a reason so I would n't hear 2 seconds of each song as passing through . Keep it paused until I press play when I reach the song of choice .

12084182,ADHD,"I have no idea how to go about doing this . I used to take meds back home years ago . I 've tried a few different kinds and found that Ritalin worked the best . That was in Europe . I got off the meds and did n't do anything for a while and it was more or less okay , my symptoms are not extreme , but they do affect daily activities . I 'm currently studying here in the U.S. , specifically in Florida , and I 'm considering going back on my meds as I feel I 'm getting progressively worse . Also , my boyfriend is getting more and more frustrated , well observant of my situation . He always brings it up when I 'm distracted or forget to do something ( which is 90 % of the time ) since he 's the exact opposite of me , he is naturally 110 % focused and alert about everything . I frequently forget to do things he tells me to do or mess them up . Example , I often forget to put the sponge in the sink , a huge pet peeve of his as everything has to be clean and orderly , and I 'm not like that . I forget important things such as going somewhere and forgetting to bring something I needed to bring for that task such as a document . Or even simpler , putting laundry in the machine and forgetting to put detergent and washing a load without it . I 'm not focusing well in classes as well , even if they are really interesting . I also tend to be distracted so I mishear things often or do n't hear them at all when he 's speaking to me and he ends up just saying 'it 's not important ' and then does n't tell me and it gets annoying . I have no idea how to go about getting meds though cause I really do n't want to pay someone to prescribe them to me as it might be expensive , I 've seen cheap medication online but from what I 've understood , it 's illegal to order medication from online pharmacies .

Leave the house without half my stuff , forget that I 've done stuff so I 'd do it again or not at all thinking I have . But with time I got better at it and spoke to psychologists and learned techniques and can now more or less do most of those things fairly well .

She is so forgetful it 's almost frustrating , I 've learned to make habits of things , like turning off the lights in the bathroom when I 'm done . She however ca n't . Every time I bring up a pet peeve like how the bathroom floor is soaked after she showers , she says that she just wont remember to clean up or dry in the bath so it does n't happen and it 's just how she is . She forgot her house keys on several occasions and was locked out . She left the stove on a few times , once I came home to the house in smoke , and she burnt my pot , which had her coffee in it .

12084182,socialism,"I had a car accident , got whiplashed and in a neckbrace after surgery to implant titanium screws in my neck . I was so doped up and in pain that thinking about payment was the last thing on my mind . And apparently the hospital I was in , only gives you a weeks worth of time to talk to the financial department . I missed that week and they told me there was nothing they could do to help me with payments . So I decided to just not pay shit . I started getting the bills from debt collectors , for all sorts of random things , from nurses , to surgeons , to physiotherapists , even the front desk wants a cut for every time someone asked where I was located or called to see how I was doing ... A sum of over 200k ! ! ! Now though when it 's hit my credit , it 's gone down to 40k , I think they decided to let some of it go because they know I ca n't pay it back . I had a score of 700+ and it 's now at 400+ Oh well . I 'm not in the states anymore so it 's not bothering me that much but I wish it was still good , though I do n't like the concept of a credit system .

12084182,AskReddit,"What life path to take . Found out my health is affecting my career choice ( my degree is now practically useless ) . It ’ s not a big health issue , I can work just about anywhere else but with my degree , it ’ s impossible to find a suitable job . So now it seems I have to look for work in fields I have no knowledge about or get a regular job until I figure out what I ’ m going to do with my life . I just hope I don ’ t get sucked in to being stuck with no progress because I end up living paycheck to paycheck . I can freelance , but that 's very unpredictable . I have three other attempted degrees , so maybe I can try and finish one of those ( saves time , instead of spending another 4 in a university , since I 'm 26 and already kind of old to not have held a job in a field of study ) but that 's also time wasting . I ’ m currently back under my parents roof and daily think about how homelessness would be better than this ( we do n't get along ) and that I should just move out and figure things out . But I have nowhere to go , can ’ t drive for a while until my medical tests come back as safe to drive . So can ’ t take a car either . I think about ending it all but then I remember the things I have to look forward to . My best friend of 10 years now , is finally seeing his life looking up and it ’ s because of me among other people/things . It ’ s something that gives me hope every day , knowing I ’ m the reason he ’ s still alive and here for me . I also think about this kid I took in , who was homeless , and had nowhere to go . I saw something in him , I wanted to help him somehow . Knowing what it felt like to have nowhere to go and feel worthless was something I didn ’ t want anyone to have to experience . I gave him a place to stay for a bit , and told him to apply for jobs daily and make something of himself . Find a way to finish high school and do something more . I wonder how he is , if he ’ s okay . We lost touch but he could n't have been more grateful that I came along and gave him something , hope , a home , something to look forward to . I ’ m jealous in a way that even though he was homeless and on the street , he managed to get away from his parents and get away from the abuse and didn ’ t give in to the manipulation . I also think about how I can find someone that 'll stay with me as both a best friend and partner . I ’ ve had some odd life choices and it makes it hard to open up to people because I fear they ’ ll reject my past . I also have issues with emotional abuse , I ’ ve been dealing with it my whole life with my mom and it ’ s affected all my relationships too , I always end up with those types , and I just end up giving in to their tactics and am too nice to do anything about it . I ’ ve learned my lesson though and am not letting it get to me , but for a while I was stuck in this pattern where people would manipulate me to stay in the relationship . I don ’ t care if we lack a social life because we ’ re both struggling to make something of ourselves , I just want us to have each other and be happy . My last ex tried to kill himself because of our break-up ( manipulation tactic , not really wanting to die… ) and I still can ’ t get over that . It was so hard because I still cared about him as a person . I was supposed to fly out to visit my sister , which he knew would result in me just leaving ( he was going away for a while , and figured I ’ d move out while he ’ s gone ) . So me missing my flight to be in the hospital with him was a sign of hope that I still cared and wanted to be with him . He changed himself for the relationship , he turned into someone he wasn ’ t just to get me to like him more but that made me like him even less . And I have this constant paranoia of ending up in a relationship where the person keeps doing that . Just be yourself . I ’ m tired of people suddenly being like me because they fear I ’ ll leave them because there ’ s nothing there . Do n't suddenly read books because you think I 'll like you more for reading them . I know you hate reading them so do n't torture yourself so I can stay . It 's weird . You might try and turn into all the things I want from a partner , but it ’ ll never be real . I ’ ll always want someone who ’ s just themselves around me and I ’ m myself and we never have to hide or be fake to feel like the other person will stay . I ’ m not changing for you , and I don ’ t expect you to change for me . If you change , change for the better , make better habits , be a better person for YOU . Not for me . So I think about that . Also friendships . I ’ m so busy all the time and the friends I ’ ve had have mostly left or are busy themselves , have gone their own ways and are doing other things with their closer friends . The few friends I do have that want to hang all the time aren ’ t as intellectually stimulating as I ’ d like or are n't doing anything worthwhile . They just sit around high all day and do nothing worthwhile for the most part . I have friends I can have a good conversation with , but now that they 're working and busy , they 're always tired and weekends involve sitting in a coffee shop chatting instead of activities like camping/picnics or going out like we used to . I want to make new friends but because I get busy at times and am not sure when I ’ m free it makes it harder because I don ’ t want people to get the wrong idea that I ’ m not interested . Also I don ’ t know if I ’ m staying here for now or leaving ( I want to leave as soon as possible but I know I need a job first to save up money and get medical stuff in order , I live in a small island in the middle of nowhere and it makes it hard to do anything here , small population and all ) but if I make friends , and then have to move , it ’ ll just be so much harder . I guess I hope I find people that are as busy as me or understanding of my situation so when we do hang out , it ’ s worthwhile and we understand if one of us can ’ t . So yeah , those are some of the things I think about .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

She lost her job suddenly and as she had a job and school loans , the extra money made her very spendy and she bought us a TV and various other things .

Children see things subjectively , and thus draw in a subjective manner . If you were to draw your family , you 'd draw them pretty normal , how they are in real life . But kids on the other hand , draw them as they see them , for example , one image was of a family , where the father had huge hands , as in ginormous , and the mother was drawn very small in proportion to him and her mouth was nonexistent while his father had a very big one . This shows that he hits with his hands , physical abuse as well as verbal ( the big mouth ) , while the mother is small and can not do anything about it and is afraid to even speak .

I 'd go to hang with my friends and he 'd seem like it 's weird that I do n't include him . I did some of the time , but like if it 's a study group right after class , then we 're just gon na chill , go over homework and test work and I do n't see why he needs to be there . He got all weird that day , but my friends hinted at liking him so I called him to come and bring us pizza , and he was over in a flash , despite being with his friends . Ever since it 's like I never had any time to myself , he 'd just feel weird why I need time to myself , why I need to browse the internet without him behind me watching . It 's not that I need to or have something to hide it 's just that it felt weird , he felt possessive with all of that . He wanted to get me a car not even two months in , like maybe not even a month in , my sister came down to visit for a day , and I spent it with her , get home to my apartment to find a gift on the bed , a watch he knew I had wanted . Okay , it 's cool , you got me something I wanted and paid attention to me . But wanting to get me a car that 's like 4-5k and then have me move in with you so fast is weird . I was going home to the summer and looking forward to spending it with my friends , then one night my friend drunkenly messages me for a threesome and he flips out . The next day he wanted to leave and never come back , leave his whole life behind , house and education included . I prove to him through my previous conversations with said friend that there 's no history between us , nothing . And the message was something out of the blue too , like 'oh btw , do you mind if a girl joins us in our whatever ' so it was hinting to something already arranged . He did n't trust me going home and surprised me with a ticket to see me and I had planned on breaking up with him when I was gone as I thought it would be easier . Him wasting more money on me made it harder . I had to tell my parents that I had a boyfriend and he was coming over , huge shock . I kept trying to make it work , to want it to work but it was just hard with everything he was doing . I lost my friend cause he would n't hear of him , even when the guy added him and sent him a message and said 'sorry man , it was my honest mistake , we 're good friends I do n't want to loser her , I 'm glad she 's found someone finally and I 'd like to get t know you and we can all be friends ' That just angered him more and he threatened to be violent if he saw him . We went to spend Christmas with his family and unbeknownst to me he planned on proposing to me in front of his family but for once he thought about how that would make me feel and realized that I would n't be into that . He only told me after the break-up when he had a breakdown and hoped that knowing that would make me change my mind about the situation . I 'm not the kind of person to get married 6 months into the relationship . Or move in 5 months later . It was all too rushed and stuff . We did n't have much in common either , he was happy to do anything I wanted to but I knew he would n't be into it entirely , he 'd just be doing it because he 'll do anything to make me happy .

12084182,Dentistry,"So about a year ago I had some major stuff done to my teeth . I went to a dentist at my moms village that was cheap and he said I had more to be done but since I was only visiting for a week he said he did the major stuff and next year I can get the rest done and he thinks it 'll be fine for a year . Now I 'm back home for the summer but in the city ( my parents have an apartment in the city and my mom has her parents summer house in a village ) . I went to a dentist my sister goes to , she says he 's great , blah blah . He looked at scans of my teeth I did before the visit , said he really liked the work the previous dentist did , and all I needed were my fillings replaced as they were reaching their expiry date and falling apart . Alright , cool . First time just bottom right side . Second time bottom left . ( two teeth each time ) . Second visit he says for the top it 's easy , he can do both sides at once with anesthetic , unlike the bottom which has to be done separately for whatever reason so I 'll only have one more visit and he 'll also give me a nightguard for my bruxism . Great ! Next visit though he only does top right . I find that odd , but maybe he was just making a remark how the top does n't need to be done separately and never intended to do both sides . Gets the imprint for my guard thing and fixes my filling a bit ( from previous visit ) as I felt my bite was a bit weird . When he did my bottom and top right side , I had no problems , even after the visit , after the anesthetic wore off , no pain . Left side though , one tooth , as he was drilling , just kept being sensitive , he said it 's probably under too much stress . So I figured , okay , that must be it . Then after the visit , it kept hurting a few nights in a row , oddly enough right as I want to sleep , so I 'd take an ibuprofen and then finally it went away but the cold issue came in . Cold water makes my left side feel weird . Sometimes it 's the bottom part , my jaw area , sometimes it 's even the top part where he did n't even do anything to my teeth . My sister schedules a visit for general cleaning and so I can ask him stuff . He cleans my teeth , massages my gums or whatever . My sister made an off comment to him how I have breath issues and maybe something 's still up , and he said the spacing between my teeth is really tight , and that 's was what caused breath because I do n't floss enough and remove the food that 's stuck there . But when we got in the car , I said how he forgot to tell me why my gums are sensitive to cold , and she said it was the teeth spacing but then I told her it only started after he worked on my bottom tooth and now I do n't know why I 'm still sensitive to it . Do I have a problem ? Or is it normal to take a bit longer for some teeth to recover from all the drilling ? I do n't get my upper gums feel sensitive too at times even though he never touched my upper teeth at all . tl ; dr : Went for change of fillings , one tooth was more sensitive than the others during filling change . Since then ( a month ago ) my whole left side has become sensitive to cold and it took a while for the pain in my tooth to subside while other teeth that had fillings had no pain afterward .",Balto-Slavic,Serbian,NonEuropean

12084182,CRedit,"I have two credit cards , my primary one is 10 months old . I 've paid everything off on time and never had even just the minimum balance paid , it was full . ( According to CreditKarma - it 's 662 ) I 've recently wanted to purchase some things from Amazon ( I have a bunch of gift cards saved up ) , Amazon offered ( through Chase bank ) to give me 6 months , no interest financing if I sign up for their card . I do n't know if I want to add another card and have more things to think about and pay each month , also from what I 've seen , Chase is n't the best bank . On the other hand , if I do n't have to pay for everything right away , I would go for that since it means I can afford all the things I want now without spending my gift cards . If I just pay a little over the minimum balance each month , does that mean my credit wont drop ? If I take one of the items out of my cart , I get 30 $ off instead , which is n't bad , but it involves paying for everything else with cash vs. gift cards . So I do n't know if I want to consider that instead . Any thoughts on the Amazon card ? Another card will help boost my score , but at the same time , is it a good one ?

Our university originally turned her down because she was 'overqualified ' . They could n't hire someone like that even if she was content with the low salary because it would look bad on their part why they would pay so little for someone who is that good at what they do . She ended up modifying her resume , cutting half of her qualifying traits out , and applying to another branch of it in a different city . They accepted her and she asked for a transfer .

12084182,techsupport,"Laptop , HP EliteBook 8760W A rundown of recent events : HDD crashed . Plugged another one in from a different laptop . I downloaded Windows to do a fresh install as that one had windows configured for the other laptop . Before I got to that though , the laptop suggested I do a free upgrade to Windows 10 . I accepted it and did n't realize that it had 32-bit architecture and that it would follow on to the Windows 10 installation without prompting me if I 'd like 64-bit instead . So I got 10 at 32-bit and it was sluggish so I downloaded the ISO for Windows 10 64-bit . Used some Microsoft tool for creating a bootable USB . Formatted the drive to install Windows on a blank drive without previous Windows on it . Now every time it preps Windows to install , it restarts and it gets stuck on the boot screen that says 'press esc to enter setup menu ' or whatever . If I do n't click esc right away the screen freezes and I ca n't click any button to get a response . I have no idea what to do at this point . In the installation menu for Windows it asks if I have a product key . I tried typing what came with the 32-bit windows ( going from what the properties of My Computer had displayed ) but I was missing 4 digits . So I chose 'I do n't have a product key ' thinking it 'd just know that I had Windows 10 and it was a free upgrade and register it for me . Should I find a key for it ? Would that make a difference ? I currently do not have access to any other computer other than a MacBook and I 'm not sure how helpful that is since it 's not Windows .

There 's nothing limiting Him from conferring grace directly . So it is possible to get liberation without doing any meditation , study , never meeting a Guru . It can happen as a sudden descent of Lord 's Power ( śaktipāta ) : & gt ; such a being becomes spiritually illuminated and liberated on his own , relying directly on Śiva , not needing initiation or instruction from other exterior guru . This is facilitated by an intense awakening of his spiritual intuition ( pratibhā ) which immediately eliminates ignorance That being said , this is extremely rare , to the point that it 's practically best to not even consider it as an option . But it 's important to keep in mind that liberation is possible at all times since the Lord 's Freedom is unlimited and not conditioned by anything . In practice though , you will need the assistance of an external Guru and holy scriptures . But do n't give up just because a Guru has n't appeared in your life yet .

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Electrical power is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current . So in order to power a 1kW device , like a hair dryer , you would need to supply it about 4,3 amperes at 230 volts ( 4,3 x 230 = ~1000 ) , OR about 9 amperes at 110 volts ( 9 x 110 = ~1000 ) . Amperes are what cause losses from resistance ( more amps = more losses , voltage does n't matter ) , so ideally you want to use as high a voltage as possible , so the current required is lower and so the losses are lower . The flipside is that higher voltages are more prone to arcing , so the wires and circuits carrying it have to have better ( or more ) insulation . Higher voltages are also more likely to cause electrical shocks , and I believe that was the reason the US ( and some other countries ) went with a lower standard voltage .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene,NonEuropean

What does it look like ? Any special markings ? It ’ s the acrowoof ridgeback , of course , not to be mistaken with the Rhodesian ridgeback ( *no , really , please don ’ t* ) . It looks a little bit like [ this ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/fJoNqTK.jpg ? 1 ) and has a ( *very scratchable* ) green fluffy tummy . * Which traits did it take from each parent species ? Does it have any new traits/behaviors that were n't seen in the parent species ? It has the body frame of the three-headed dogs ( including the number of heads ) , the heads and back spines of a Norwegian ridgeback and the hair of the acromantula , along with eight eyes on each of its heads . Along with that it inherited the friendliness and cuddliness of all three parent species , the fiery cough of the Norwegian ridgeback , the family sense and loyalty of the acromantula , and the slobbering of the three-headed dog ( or at least the specimen that was really close to Hagrid ’ s heart ) . * What type of magical properties does this new species possess ? Along with breathing fire , the acrowoof ridgeback can also see in the dark and wag its tail at ridiculous speeds . Its saliva is also incredibly venomous and its bite could kill you in a matter of minutes . As this is a new species , its magical properties have still not been fully explored but it is definitely **NOT** because no one dares come near it . * Where do they live ? Can wizards keep them as pets ? Is there a new sanctuary for these animals to live peacefully ? There are as of now three acrowoof ridgebacks that live happily in the mountains of Asia . They are under the close observation of witches and wizards to ensure that they adapt well to the local ecosystem .

Aggropop,Games,"**X-COM Apocalypse** I loved this game back in the day , even more than the two previous X-COM games . I bought it ( again ) for pennies on Steam and started a new campaign to see if it 's all nostalgia or not . The first thing I learned was that the UI and general game controls are pretty clunky by modern standards ( unintuitive , weird nonsensical keayboard shortcuts , no drag select , confusing tactical map ) but at least it 's usable . Nowhere near as bad as modern consolized UIs in any case , because at least it let 's you use the mouse effectively ( Looking at you , Bethesda ) . The fact that the game was released in an unfinished state also became apparent pretty fast ( something I never noticed when I was younger ) , there are lots of little details that seem like they were part of something bigger that ultimately had to be cut from the final game . Things like your agents being able to use public transport in the city , even though you can fly them anywhere you want from the start . Lots of mega-corporations feel pointless and they are too similar overall . Once they become hostile to you they all boil down to target practice for your agents . But overall I found that I still really enjoyed the game . Your agents and vehicles are highly customizable so you can create your dream team exactly how you want . They also gain experience and improve drastically over time . I found that I got really attached to some of them because of that and I genuinely felt bad when they got fragged ( which was n't the case with any of the recent X-COM games ) . The combat is also pretty well done in both strategic and tactical mode and it never feels totally unfair , like some moments in the recent X-COM games do , forcing you to retry until you get lucky rolls x times in a row . The fully destructible terrain adds a whole new layer of strategy and it can easily turn the tide of battle . Collapsing buildings can fall on UFOs and crush them , agents can dig tunnels Minecraft style to get around obstacles , smoke and fire obscure vision ... Using high explosives is great fun as a consequence , if a but risky . You can easily blow out the floor underneath your agents feet , making them fall to their death . The atmosphere and music/sound are easily the best part of the game and they have aged very well . The music goes from super creepy and suspenseful when there is no combat , to hard industrial techno when the enemies pop up . The sound files are noticeably low-fi , but that does n't really detract from the experience , it makes it sounds more gritty and dirty IMO . The sound effects are also crucial to the gameplay . Because every weapon and alien has a unique sound , the sounds can be used to pinpoint them even out of line-of-sight . If you play turn based you can listen to the aliens move around during their turn , which can give you crucial information , but its also very suspenseful . The `` hidden movement '' screen is probably the highlight of the game , as weird as that sounds . The creepy music , combined with weird noises in the distance that you are encouraged to listen for , then the switch to loud techno when the alien comes around the corner ... Overall I found the game stand up to the test of time pretty well , particularly if played at night . I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenging and creepy turn based game and is willing to put up with some old-school clunkyness . There are definite sandbox elements to the game and the player is given a ton of freedom , so that 's a huge plus if you 're into that as well .",Balto-Slavic,Slovene,NonEuropean

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Physical comedy like that comes from juxtaposition ( a comparison of two things that are different/opposites ) and loss of stature . We find it funny when we see people of high status put into situations where they are humiliated/embarrassed . The juxtaposition of the two ( high and mighty vs. humiliated ) is a source of humor . For example : A priest slipping on a banana peal is considered funny because priests are seen as cautious , reliable , inflexible people who do n't make simple mistakes like stepping on slippery trash ; when the priest slips his stature is reduced , there is a juxtaposition and this can be considered funny ( no accounting for taste , obv ) A crippled homeless woman slipping on a banana peel is n't funny . She has no stature , when she slips she is not reduced in status , there is no juxtaposition , so that scene would n't ( generally ) be considered funny . In addition there is a concept called `` Schadenfreude '' . It means `` to take pleasure in the suffering of others '' . Everyone feels schadenfreude to a degree , but the degree depends on the level of empathy that each person is capable of . You might just have an overly keen sense of empathy that stops you from having a laugh when someone is hurt .

Aggropop,explainlikeimfive,"Actually , the pistons in an internal combustion engine and turbines in a power plant both work on the same principles : They extract energy from hot gasses and convert it into motion . The hot pressurized gas that pushes the piston in a car engine is the result of an explosion of gasoline and oxygen , while steam turbines take in hot pressurized steam ( created in a boiler ) and exhaust `` cold , low pressure '' steam ( quotes because it 's not really cold or low pressure by human standards ) . The question then is : Is it more efficient to create high pressure gas by explosions or by boiling water ? Turns out , boiling is better . Mainly because the boiler of a power station can be very finely tuned to produce steam at a constant rate 24/7 , while gasoline engines have to be able to adapt to various operating conditions , like cold/hot weather , slow/fast speeds , low or high load ( towing ) ...

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I do n't fucking know what to think anymore . I liked her being the ally in this arc ( even if she was the stereotypical princess that helps the SH 's , I liked her way more that the past ones ) and her memories about Lola , the moments she shared with Sanji and all that looked so real that I ca n't really believe she was bad from the beginning , plus the moment when Brook and Pedro saw her choosing a wedding dress she looked like she really wanted to make it to the seducing woods to help Luffy and the rest . Yeah , it looked too good to be true but let 's be honest , there 's a lot of characters that acted kindly with the SHs in every island since they meet them . Just remember Skypiea for example . Also , the way it 's been builded up it looked that some daughters of Big Mom felt like tools and wanted to get out of that ( not just Pudding and Lola , but also Praline and Chiffon ) . If she 's been working for mama since the beginning then she 's such a psychopath specially because Sanji was already tied and he could n't scape . Where is the point into making him falling in love for her then ? Also , why she said it to Luffy and Nami whispering if Opera was the only one there and he is also loyal to Big Mom ? So ... I not 100 % sure that she 's evil . Maybe she wants to make both parties fight each other so Sanji can scape . Maybe even if all that she said was true , it could be that she has two personalities or even that she started all this like what Big Mom planned and then it turned that she ended liking Sanji . After all why Big Mom wants to kill the Vinsmokes ? She would gain not only the technology but also the royal family as allies which are strong warriors . And why she wants to kill them in the ceremony ? I mean , she can kill them now , as we know the Germa kingdom is there so there 's no point into waiting to the wedding . Anyways , it is interesting to see how Oda has introduced us to the Vinsmokes as a kind of arrogant Nazi family which a lot of us hated or wanted Sanji to clean the soil with them and now it turned that I am even afraid that something bad could happen to them . Maybe this will be the path to make them see that Sanji deserved to be treated better when he saves their lives . At the other hand if she is evil then it would be really interesting , specially since it would be completely unique and different compared with the princess in distress we 've been seeing for years now . Having a manipulative and psychopatic female character is one of the things that would make this arc even better , plus it has some logic since with Anana we 've seen that Big Mom teaches her kids into being as cruel as they can , and for the rest of siblings it looks like they are absolutely loyal to her mother . Seriously , this arc is right now the most matured one we 've seen so far . The complexity and diversity of characters , the amount of `` What if.. '' moments it has with every chapter and the way Oda is showing us that the Yonko are at a different league in comparison with the rest of characters we 've seen so far makes this the best arc of the new world and pretty close to Enies Lobby as the best arc of One Piece .",Romance,Spanish,NonEuropean

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"I have a theory that the Kaido-shogun alliance has something to do with the black boats of Matthew Perry , so first of all , I 'm gon na explain it : Imagine that you are the governor of a country that has been closed to the rest of the world for practically 200 years and it starts to grow the discontent between citizens and some political and military . Then some very powerful foreigners come to your shores and threaten you to open the doors to trade . You do it , but it 's obvious an unequal treatment and you go terribly disadvantaged . This happened in Japan in 1853 , and this obvious lack of strength against the `` nanban '' was one of the causes of the fall of the shogunate . Kaido is a Yonko , one of the four pirate emperors of the new world . A country that is not into the world government has a great disadvantage in the new world , because the world government ca n't help you in front of these huge pirates . Then someone like Kaido can just reach Wano and sit on the throne . After all , it is a closed country and quite possibly **what happens in Wano , stays in Wano** , so if he is recruiting an army , obviously there 's no better place that a country with a closed door policy . No one will know what is he doing in there , or even maybe he wants to have some samurais in his army . However , it is sure that Kaido know that the samurais are proud warriors and that they would not accept a `` foreign devil '' being their direct ruler , so he preferred to be allied to the Shogun . In truth , I believe that more than a ally , the Shogun is a puppet for him , something like an intermediary between him and the samurais . This Shogun obviously does have some Daimyos against him , So he needs Kaido to maintain the order in his own country . It is a symbiotic relationship in which however , Kaido wins . I believe too that the beasts pirates are really annoying to the looks of the Wano citizens ( holy fuck , they are called `` beasts '' for something ) : Drinking , breaking things and causing continuous fights . So , you have the conflict here , a Shogun who leaves a bunch of annoying pirates do what they want , while defend him in case there is a revolt of samurais . Btw , obviously he wants someone who could read poneglyphs and Wano is the country of the family who invented them . tl ; dr : Kaido has his entire zoan army in Wano bc the world government has no way to get information of what happens there , he wants the samurais joining his army bc he know how strong they are so he needs the Shogun to control them and he is wanting for someone to read the red poneglyph he has .

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"At the start of this arc I was expecting Sanji to crush them . Now that we know that the brothers act like that because they ca n't show emotions , I feel that **they are also victims** . Their ability to feel emotions was taken away , and their childhood was robbed to make them weapons . Do n't get me wrong , what they did to Sanji was terrible . But what makes Sanji different to his brothers is that he can feel emotions and thus emphatize with them . He could even feel sorry for them . Maybe I 'm the only one that would want this to happen , but I think that it would be great if he could forgive them at the end of the arc so we could see them working together and Ichiji , Niji and Yonji recognizing that Sanji is strong enough to be respected . After all what we 've seen , defeating them would be just an eye for eye , and Sanji 's way better than that . Also , we already know that he 's more powerful that Yonji and Niji and possibly Ichiji . Sanji wants to save his sister , so he would need to tell what 's going on to his brothers in the case that Luffy and the others do n't show up until the wedding day . Surely his brothers would not believe him but sooner of later they would end working together . How could this end with the brothers respecting Sanji ? Easy . Let them fight to a strong pirate of Big Mom 's crew and make them struggle . Then Sanji comes and defeats that guy like if it was nothing . It also can end with them starting to show emotions , like if they started to awaken .",Romance,Spanish,NonEuropean

2stepsfromglory,OnePiece,"& gt ; The white horse representing the victory of Christianity was a creation of one mans interpretation in the second century . You could even call it his personal `` head canon '' . True , yet is was the main interpretation given by the roman theologists then and that interpretation survived to our days . Sure , originally the white horse was a representation of the romans since they conquered Palestine but that does n't mean that the other interpretations are wrong since we 're talking about a religion that has splitted a lot in different creeds since it was born . Luther and Calvin diverged from the point of view of the catholic dogma , same happened with orthodox , the coptic church or the ones that followed the arrianism . Religion is always opened to interpretations , and that 's why it has split so much over the centuries . Hell , do n't forget that christianism originally splitted from juddaism . But anyways , if we take into account the fact that the white horseman 's main representation was conquest like you aptly said , Shanks still fits with the concept : 1 - He 's known to have conquered the new world since he was part of Roger 's crew . 2 - He 's been shown to be the strongest user of Conqueror 's Haki till now . & gt ; You 're also wrong about big mom being introduced in the current arc .

PSU is `Corsair HX750i` , which is overkill , so I do not suspect power . Board is `Asus Z97MPLUS`with current fw . Running `Windows 10 Pro` . I 'm experiencing these issues : * System crashes while running `folding @ home` ( with gpu only ; I used to run it cpu only before I had gpu ) . After running for a while ( seconds , minutes at most ) , mouse freezes , screen powers off , does n't recover . `Furmark` seems to be fine . * Playing games that the GPU can more than handle ( `Fairy Fencer F` ) with vsync on ( to prevent tearing ) , GPU underclocks itself , which causes game to stutter for a while when entering scenes that use the GPU more . * In `The Witcher 1` , with everything set to max , GPU is too fast ( & gt ; 60fps ) causing it to tear heavily . Game does n't have a vsync option , so tried to force it via a game profile and via the global profile , to no avail . I 'm therefore unable to play this game ( as I ca n't stand tearing ) . Edit : I 've verified `D3DOverrider` does the trick . It 's sad a third party tool is needed . It would help my peace of mind if I knew I was not alone in these issues .

WebRTC is very nice and secure once a connection is established between the two actual peers . It does n't solve the problem of setting up this connection and authenticating the peers .

16dollars,SuicideWatch,"This reply is intended for you OP but I hope that some other lurker out there as well will benefit of it . 1 . In a relationship , be it a love , friendly or family one , there is a minimum of two persons . What a lot of us tend to forget is the amount of responsibility you have to take , or should *not* take , to maintain one . If you 're the one who is always calling your `` friend '' , maybe you should reconsider your friendship with this person ? Move on and try to find someone who cares for you . It may be a cliché but look at it from another perspective . You 're not boring - the people who do n't want to spend time to get to know you are . Basically - **if they do n't want to be your friend - fuck 'em . Their loss and not yours . ** Try contacting someone you have n't spoken to in a long time . I can almost guarantee that they 'll be happy that you reach out . Just have a chat and if it feels good take it a step further and meet . Just have a beer together , play some xbox or whatever you enjoy . And then you repeat . And repeat . And repeat . And then you reconnect with another person . And repeat . 2 . Have you tried internet dating ? It may sound a bit cheesy but it seems that a lot of people get something out of it . And if a date does n't work out , maybe you 've at least made a new friend ? 3 . Do you play any video games ? Voice chat is a minor social interaction but it still makes you connect with other people . Plus you 'll have something to talk about . A big warning though - excessive amount of playing video games can send you down an evil spiral ... Use it as a compliment and **not** a complete substitute for social interaction . 4 . Get out and do stuff . Take a cooking class , learn how to scuba dive , join the local bowling team . It 's the small things that keep you from killing yourself . Just think of it for a second . Suppose you actually took a cooking class . Ok , so you have to get there . You have to meet a bunch of new people and you get to cook something . Talk to some of the people there . Try something like `` hey , we should team up next week since our meatballs were so damn good '' . This means that you have to show up next week . Or one person will wonder what happened to you . You learn how to scuba dive . Sign up for a day trip with your club . Your [ buddy ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_diving ) is going to ask you to pick him up at 11am . If you do n't show up two people will now wonder what happened to you . You join the local bowling team . Next sunday is your first game . If you do n't show up 10 people will wonder what happened to you . Maybe you feel that you have nothing in life that is worth living for . But try filling it with *something* and some good may come out of it . I 've been trying to live like this for the last couple of years and it does make a difference . I think you should give it a try , what do you have to lose ? Yes , I 'll admit that some days I still just want to put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger .

1008oh,GlobalOffensive,"**Background** As we all know , Valve did n't just remake Inferno for the pleasure of it . As one of the most iconic maps in counter-strike history , it is only a question of when this map is brought back for competitive play . For those of you wondering , I am an LEM , with Inferno as my farvorite map by far , so I am very exite to have it back . I also love watching professional CS , so I am very exited right now . **Active Duty** As I said , it is only a question of time until Inferno returns to competitive play . However , this causes a problem . In the past , when a map has been moved to active duty , another one had to go . Let 's say that this would be the case , which map should then be removed ? In order to answer this question , we have to think about what Valve wants Counter-Srike maps to be like . During CS : GO 's history , a clear trend has been seen where the developers want maps to be more balanced , have better visibility and estethics and improve general playability of maps , by fixing bugs or places where players get stuck , for example . With all of this in mind , which map could Inferno be replacing ? * *Cache* Cache is a well made map , enjoyed by the community . It is fairly balanced between sides and played frequently in pro matches . Cache will not be leaving active duty . * *Cobblestone* Cobblestone may be fairly T-sided and the B-site too easy to take , but it is still played frequently . I do not think it will be leaving active duty ; instead , I expect a major overhaul of the B-site without removing the map from professional play . * *Dust II* Dust II is quite balanced in the sense that it is possible to be good on either the CT or T-side . On top of tis , it is too iconic to be removed from active duty . * *Mirage* Mirage may be a bit CT-sided , but it is still frequently played , and it is possible for teams to get great scores on either sides . I ca n't see why mirage would be taken out of active duty . * *Nuke* Nuke is still quite young , with the possibility to grow in the future . Based on the fact that it recently got a total overhaul , it will definitly not be leaving active duty . * *Overpass* Overpass is arguably CS : GO 's most balanced map , with great scores possible on both the CT and T-side . It plays well and will not be leaving active duty . * *Train* Train was the first map to get a full overhaul , and has barely changed from the early 2015 version . It is often played and has no reason to leave active duty . As you can deduce by this list , all maps , exept for nuke which I think still needs some time to grow , are in general quite balanced , play well and are appreciated by professionals and the community in general . Two maps stand out to me , Cobblestone and Dust II . Cobblestone has recieved a lot of criticism regarding the B bombsite , that it is too easy to take for the terrorists and too hard to retake as counter terrorists . However , I think that this issue is not big enough for the whole map to be redone , instead some careful spawn timing ajustments and tweaks to the bombsite might be enough to balance things out . Dust II is in my opinion too iconic to be taken out of active duty , even though many pro players have been complaining about the map in recent times . Even if I hate the map , I have to admit that it is very well made . What this map needs is small tweaks , such as when the skybox between short and long A was opened . I feel as though it is also up to professional teams to find new ways to play the map , in order to gain an advantagewhen it makes an apperance in a series . As a final line , no map deserves at this point in the game to be removed from active duty . I think that if some teams are willing to start working on strats and tactics for nuke , it will force other teams to learn to play it too . This domino effect in combination with the community and pro players giving feedback to Valve should make nuke a great map again . **Adding Inferno To Active Duty** As we ’ ve come to realize , no map should be removed from active duty . Instead , i see many benifits with bringing in Inferno without removing any map , effectivly increasing the map pool to 8 maps . Firstly , it is the only logical move to do . As I ’ ve said multiple times already , no map deserves to be taken out of active duty . Inferno was remade to make it more viable in professional matches , and will make its way back into the pro scene . If no map can be removed , just expand the pool . Secondly , it allows for other maps to come back to CS : GO , or evn for brand new maps like overpass to be born . Before overpass was introduced , no one would have thought that Valve would create a map from scratch to then force it into professional play . With a bigger map pool , the addition of a new map has a lesser impact on the current professional scene . One new map in a map pool of eight maps in total is going to stagnate the pro scene a lot less than the swap of a map in a pool of seven maps . A valid point to make is the burden placed upon the professional teams . As the number of maps increase , the amount of work required by the pro teams also increases . This may seem like a concern , but this is only due to the bad map draft cutrrently used at major events , where the last map is always selected randomly which requires a team to be very sharp on at least four maps : their own pick , and all three that remain in the randomizer . By increasing the map pool to eight maps , the pick-ban system can be redesigned to work in a very favorable way . Valve ’ s argument for the random third map has been to increase the diversity of maps played , while in CS 1.6 , the maps were banned down until one was remaining . With eight maps , the system could look like this : -First , both team get to ban a map , their “ permaban ” . -Then , both teams pick a map out of the six remaining . -Now , both teams get to ban a map again , reducing the remaining amount of maps to two . -The last map is selected randomly . Technically , by putting in the same work of studying four maps , a team can learn an own favorite map , the favorite map of their opponents as well as both the maps in the randomizer . This should lead to much more interesting BO3 series with closer games , since the teams are given more opportunity to study each other . **Conclusion** The current CS : GO map pool is fairly balanced , with all maps , exept nuke which still should be given time to grow , are quite enjoyed by the community as well as the professional scene . Before the reintroduction of Inferno to competitive play , it is worth considering the possibilities surrounding the active duty map pool . As no map has a real valid reason to be taken away from professional play , a good alterEnglish is to add Inferno without removing any other map , effectivly increasing the map pool to eight maps . In the process , the pick-ban system at major and minor events should be changed in order togive the teams more control over the third map whilst retaining the randomizer for the purpose of variation : let each team ban once , pick once , ban once again and randomize between the last two maps remaining . This should lead to teams being more capable of preparing for events , as well as giving the spectators a better viewing experience , as a consequence of closer map scores . TL ; DR : Reading a TL ; DR is not enough to participate in a discussion I feel like , but if you want to just quickly realize what my thoughts are , just read the conclusion .",Germanic,Swedish,NonEuropean

Arguing that virtue of work is lost through inheritance is weird . Taking a similar example , the extreme compensations for executive directors in Fortune 500 companies . Such a compensation is not meant to be used on fancy cars , but on creating new companies . This is why people like Bill Gates restrict inheritance willingly . Ofcourse it is naive to think all people act in an altruistic manner .

They are real trendsetters with their flow . He says his own flow depends on his mood during the time of the recording . ___ After the Future song he says he always destroy songs by listening to them too much , like Hard in da Paint and Versace . He 's apparently called Sweden 's Soulja Boy by Emilio Faggone ( Sad Boys manager ) , and Thaiboy himself agrees on that . ___ He loves auto-tune , it makes things better . Because it gives you more stuff to listen in a song and that people who ca n't sing are able to by using auto-tune , like Chief Keef .

The lyrics make no sense , the melody makes no sense , but the song 's feeling makes sense and that 's all his music is about , the feeling . ___ He started making music in a serious way last summer , people started hating because it sounded pretty bad . Last winter he decided to add auto-tune and now you can catch him on podcasts . Started from the bottom now he here . He described Gravity Boys like a bunch of nice people that help each other out .

There are several levels of boppin : the amateur one where you just turn your knees left to right , the exclusive boppin where you do things with your hands and twirl and move around , and next level boppin where you do flips and stuff . She asks who in GTB and Sad Boys are best at boppin .

19O5,Turkey,"Hi , My view on KRG : Pro : KRG could be a reliable partner in a region full of terror and fighting . They seem to have no or much less troubles within their region , and it is quite expectable that they wo n't have any in the future . Con : I am first of all supporting the territorial integrity of Iraq . I see Iraq as a failed state since the US decided to fuck Saddam , and therefore I support Iraq and want them to unite their own people and to live in peace and harmony . I think Iraq should become a federal state , so the different peoples in Iraq - Kurds , Turkmens , Assyrians , Shiites , Sunni Arabs can live in peace and harmony . The KRG are trying to make use of the fucked up situation right now in Iraq - they try to extend their territory by claiming cities which were left by the Iraqi army . I do n't like this policy at all , since most of the oil fields are in the north anyway , and they want to claim the most , and they try to assimilate the other ethnic minorities . They either tolerated or supported the PKK for decades as well . Also an established independent state of Kurdish Iraq would lead to the wish to extend their territory . Especially the Kurdish minority of Turkey would want to 'unite ' with them , so that could be dangerous for Turkey , Iran and Syria . Minority language : Well , that 's a bit different compared to other states . Turkey was founded after the Turkish War of Independence and by that time the percentage of Kurds was much less compared to nowadays ' numbers . The desire was to have a united country , no matter of the ethnicity . So nowadays you can find people of different ethnicities like Laz , Circassian , Albanians , Bosniaks , Arabs , Crimeans , Tatars , Kurds , Zaza . The thought to have only one language was simply to keep the different ethnicities united . And that pretty well worked , except for the Kurds . What I criticize is that the Kurds were forbidden to speak Kurdish , which is wrong . Everybody should be able to speak their mother tongue , but the official language should be remained as Turkish .",Turkic,Turkish,NonEuropean

What the Brits did is incredibly fucked up and as inhumane as it gets .

However , Queen Victoria intervened and requested that the Sultan send only £1,000 , because she had sent only £2,000 herself . & gt ; So the Sultan sent only the £1,000 , but he also secretly sent five ships full of food . The English courts attempted to block the ships , but the food arrived in Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors . That £10,000 that the Sultan pledged to the Irish would be worth approximately £800,000 ( $ 1.7m ) today . source : http : //www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/Little-known-tale-of-generous-Turkish-aid-to-the-Irish-during-the-Great-Hunger.html",Turkic,Turkish,NonEuropean

We had some games with them during the last fifteen years , and one of them was highly controversial , it was during the time of Zidane , Del Piero & amp ; Inzaghi . So basically the head of PKK Abdullah Öcalan was stuck in Italy , and Turkey wanted Italy to hand him over to our intelligence service , however Italy let him flee somewhere else , and there were diplomatic tensions , and Turkish people attacked Italian embassy and burnt Italian flags . So Juventus did all they could to not play the match in İstanbul and the match was postponed to the week after that match , and Turks were really pissed that İtalians indirectly supported the head of a terrorist organization which was the causation for more than 40.000 deaths . In the stadium there were more than 1000 cops , imagine that , We had to win , it was more than a match . Juventus scored , and we equalized in 90+ with a header by Suat Kaya , probably one of the smallest on the field . İt was season 98/99 . Season 03/04 : We have Juventus again in our CL group , and they basically qualified for the next round but we are trying our best to qualify at least for UEFA , so in November 2003 there were terrorist attacks in İstanbul , targets : a synagoge , a British bank and the British embassy . Juventus should have played us in December 2003 , however they did all their best to not play in İstanbul , this time they were successful . So the match had to be played somewhere else in Europe with a high distance to Turkey , and it was decided to be played in the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund . Galatasaray 's European supporters turned Westfalenstadion to hell and Kral Hakan Şükür scored two against them , making us win 2-0 against Juventus , and we were so happy . Again Juventus could n't profit out of the situation . And the third controversy was last years CL campaign in İstanbul , we needed a win to qualify for the next round , and Juve needed either a draw or a win . However the snowfall led to the game being postponed to the day after . The pitch was unplayable in my honest opinion and Juve tried again to get the match postponed to another time or place , however the match was played the next day and Sneijder scored during the last minutes of the game , and we qualified for the next round . Juventus were pissed at us again . So I guess our international rival is Juventus .",Turkic,Turkish,NonEuropean

However , it did n't turn out how it was supposed to be and people stayed . People seem to forget that Turkish people of Germany , especially the first two generations , experienced a struggle not many people know about . And the first wave who were rather uneducated and conservative will of course still be conservative , in comparison to the second wave of mostly leftists who were relatively well educated . Uneducated Turks love Erdoğan , because he gives them the feeling of being powerful , important and strong as a nation . Meanwhile he builds a palace for himself and steals money that belongs to the nation , but hey at least he 's building some roads . I hope I could give you a hindsight , and btw .

Kurdish was forbidden until mid 2000s , they were not allowed to teach in their language , and they were not given any extra rights , while they always had the same rights as the Turks or any other minority in Turkey . That 's why the PKK was founded and that 's why they were supported . But since the PKK committed crimes in Kurdish villages , collected money from the people against their will , recruited kids or young people against their parents ' will by propaganda , the Kurds are not supporting PKK as much as they did , nevertheless they support BDP and HDP to seek the power on a political level . The Kurdish question became an issue with Özal in power in early 80 's and it still is n't solved , or is going the right direction .",Turkic,Turkish,NonEuropean

She considers herself being from Turkey , but being Christian Arabic though , but is in full solidarity as being from Turkey . That 's very common by now , and due to Kurdish migration , it is very much inhabited by Kurds and by Turkmens also . What I love about Turkey is , we have places with influence of different ethnicities , Anatolia has Hittite , Lydian , Byzantine , Greek , Armenian , Assyrian backgrounds , and nowadays provinces and local cultures are influenced by different Kurdish , Arabic , Turkmen , Albanian , Bosnian , Circassian , Lazuri , Turkish people and cultures . We differ a lot , but in the end we are people from Anatolia , people from Turkey . I really find it annoying that people of the Arab World still claim parts of Turkey , due to the fact that most of the Arab states themselves have uncertain borders , and yet they claim , claim and claim . Funny , last week a Syrian dude I was talking to was saying , 'but you know Hatay is ought to be ours , right ? ' .

Today 's Iraq is a consequence of America 's greedy foreign policy of more than 35 years ago , when Saddam fought Iran . Long story short , America strengthened Saddam , weakened him , directly led to his execution , forbade any former Baath party member to become MP ( previous party members were mainly of the Sunni Arab Iraqis and had to be member of that party to become powerful because it was the party of Saddam ) , this led to a rule of Kurds and Shia , the Sunnis felt not represented , this led to terrorist attacks and sectarianism , finally ending in support of radicals in either side such as ISIS , Hezbollah and whatsoever .

He creates a whole host of other Archons , each of whom share his own basically deficient character , and creates a world for them to inhabit . This world is fundamentally inferior to the world above . It is fashioned out of darkness , but animated by light stolen from Sophia . The result is a world that is neither “ light nor dark ” but is instead “ dim ” . In his arrogance and ignorance , Yaltabaoth declares himself the sole and jealous God of this realm . Recognizing the imperfection of Yaltabaoth and his counterfeit world , Sophia repents . In forgiveness of her error , the Spirit of the Monad assists the other Aeons and powers in an attempt to redeem Sophia and her bastard creation . During this process Yaltabaoth and his angels hear the voice of the Monad ’ s Spirit . While they are terrified by the voice , its echo leaves a trace of an image of the Spirit on the “ waters ” that form the roof of their realm . Hoping to harness this power for themselves , they attempt to create a copy of this image . The end result of this process is the first human man , Adam . Recognizing an opportunity to retrieve the light imprisoned in the darkness of Yaltabaoth and his world , Sophia and agents of the higher order , referred to variously as the ‘ plenoria ’ or the ‘ Epinoia ’ , and later as the ‘ pleroma ’ , devise a scheme . They trick Yaltabaoth into blowing his own spiritual essence into Adam . This simultaneously animates Adam and empties Yaltabaoth of the portion of his being derived from Sophia . Seeing the luminosity , intelligence and general superiority of the now animate Adam , Yaltabaoth and the Archons regret their creation and do their best to imprison or dispose of him . Failing to do so , they then attempt to neutralize him by placing him in the Garden of Eden . In this narrative , the Garden of Eden is a false paradise where the fruit of the trees is sin , lust , ignorance , confinement and death . While they give Adam access to the tree of Life , they conceal the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . According to this narrative , the Tree actually represents the penetration of the positive forces of the higher world and the Epinoia into Yaltabaoth ’ s realm . At this point in the narrative , Christ reveals to John that it was he who caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . Additionally , it is revealed that Eve is a helper sent by agents of the higher order to help liberate the light imprisoned in Yaltabaoth ’ s creation and in Adam . She is created when Yaltabaoth attempts to draw the light out of Adam . This results in the creation of the female body . When Adam perceives her , he sees a reflection of his own essence and is freed from the bewitching power of Yaltabaoth .",Turkic,Turkish,NonEuropean
