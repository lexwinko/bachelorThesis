2girls1crap,europe,"& gt ; And this is a vastly different picture than how most Eastern Europeans understand this crisis.\\n\\nThanks for your lecture . Now let me explain what this migration \ '' crisis\ '' is.\\n\\nIt is a \ '' wave\ '' of people mostly not from war zones . Those are too poor and they are stuck in refugee camps . It is people from all kinds of areas who heard that there is good time to go to Germany and Sweden , because mother Angela will accept everyone . And if by some miracle they are not awarded asylum , no one will make them go back . And it is not a wave in a sense that it spikes and will subside , it is a stream that will go stronger or weaker , but will increase over time . Those people are not interesed in getting to safety , they reached it before they got on the life-threatening jurney accross the sea . They go after welfare in the promissed european lands . And not some mediocre welfare in southern or eaastern european states , only top tier welfare of Germany and Sweden will do . \\n\\nSo the Eastern states do not feel very invested in sharing the burden the rich states brought onto themselves by their wealth and unreasonable attitude towards migrants . \\n\\n**tl ; dr : ** \\nTo us , you are saying : \ '' We are so rich and naive there are milions of people who want to move over here , while you are too poor , homogenous and without the welfare to be interesting for anyone from MENA so no one is coming to you .

3dom,AskEurope,You are right . But there is a reality in which a lot of European countries - even rich ones like France - have relatively high unemployment rates and already overburdened with their own existing population thus can not accept even very motivated migrants - let alone hundreds of millions third world inhabitants who would be more than happy to live in Europe . Not to mention lack of mechanics to assimilate large amounts of migrants and enforce European cultural values and customs to them to avoid incidents like mass groping during festivals in Germany - it makes whole immigration idea look bad ( besides possible terrorism import ) .\\n\\nThough I\\ 'd be happy to see \ '' migrant assimilation conveyors\ '' open to all who want to move to EU - apparently they must be located outside of EU since it takes years and it would be better to allow entry to already prepared people rather than complete strangers who require years of support and may completely fail assimilation process for few generations ( like Afghani parents of Orlando shooter ) .,Balto-Slavic,Russian

AThousandD,europe,"I apologise , looking at the sentence again , you did seem to mean Poland . Does Poland moan about the Soviets to Germans ? How does it manifest itself , I would be happy to learn ( I fear my perspective may not afford me a sufficient deal of clarity ) ? \\n\\nFurthermore , saying that \ '' the only thing Poland does is exchange its moaning for German funds , roughly speaking\ '' is speaking very roughly indeed . And it was me who was supposed to be dramatic ? I don\\'t even begin to ascend to the level of drama exhibited above , me thinks , sirrah.\\n\\nAs for \ '' feeding\ '' , I remain unconvinced . Neither was Poland starving *en masse* prior to EU accession , nor were the sums that it benefited from sufficient to \ '' feed\ '' anyone effectively for a year.\\n\\nConsider : Poland is a relatively populous European country , the largest from the EU newcomers , with some 38 mln people - making it the 5th biggest country in the EU , were we to exclude the UK , which is now removing itself from the equation . Were we to divide the 2014 EU benefits value you\\ 've provided and used per capita , I come to a figure in the region of 452 Euros per year per capita ( 17,436.1 mln Eur / 38.53 mln people as per a 2013 World Bank estimate acquired from a search engine ; I\\ 'd appreciate it were you to check my maths , just to be on the safe side ) . ( Also , using a nominal GDP 2016 estimate value of $ 508.857 billion , which Google translates into 480,711,361,133.07 Euro , I figure that the 2014 benefits constituted something in the area of 3.6 % of the national economy - do check me on my maths again , which is huge , but I stand by the view that it would be an exaggeration to say it was \ '' feeding\ '' ) \\n\\n452 Euro per head per year ( 1908 PLN using current values ; coincidentally , that\\ 's almost exactly the current minimum wage , but per month , not per year ) . If that\\ 's \ '' feeding\ '' , then - pardon the indiscretion - I have to ask where you are from.\\n\\nLastly , you seem to be taking an issue with this whole structural funds thing . You are correct in stating that the disparity between contributions and benefits is approximately four times in favour of the latter - I mean , that appears to me the whole idea of structural funds : to quickly help a region develop .

20_Bucks_Is_20_Bucks,europe,"Maybe I went overboard a bit . Possibly fueled by decades of being unable to speak with anybody on this matter in a rational manner . I think there is a big identity crisis in Bulgaria . We dont know if we are Slavic or Turkic ( proto-Bulgarians were , 500 years of Ottoman rule and as you said a lot of resettlement ) or Thracian , etc . because the truth is we are all of them . So no we have very little in common with the Proto-Bulgarians . At this point the only thing that is left is the name . Then I remember studying in school that the major population make-up of the Balkans when the Bulgars arrived were Slavic , this is incorrect . They were definitely present but there was another bigger group which were one of the oldest European population , which have stayed in South-East Europe for thousands of years . We see most of those people in countries like Croatia , Serbia and Bulgaria . If the population was mostly Slavic then Bulgarians would look much more similar to Poles or Russians , a.k.a fair skin , blonde hair , blue eyes , while we have some people that look like that , I would say more look more \ '' southern\ '' , brownish skin , dark eyes , dark hair . Initially I though that was due to the Ottoman rule but it turned out most of them are from this old European group . \\n\\nAnyways we have very little inherited from the Bulgars . Ands when you think about it , they were 30k people that settled in to live with 2-3 million Englishs . And forming the military class , you can safely assume a big loss would be quite the hit to them . So I go as far as saying that Bulgarians today have little to nothing in common with the Bulgars or the rulers of the First Bulgarian Kingdom . Maybe you are more right about the second kingdom though . Yeah you can say that the normal populace were more common to us than not . \\n\\nNow lets look at the Ottoman rule . Here I think you are incorrect about some things . First Bulgarians really didnt see themselves as such for a very long time . Its not just food production . They saw themselves as Christian . That is why the Bulgarian awakening in the 18th century started by the Slavic-Bulgarian history was such a massive event . People were re-taught to be Bulgarian . \\n\\nWhen it comes to living together I think its pretty clear that Christians and Muslims in their communities did so to a certain extent . Yes it was a rotten relationship , but it was not slavery . The Bulgarians were certainly second-rate citizens but not slaves , they still owned land and had rights . This is also why Levski was hanged , for the murder of a Bulgarian boy ( there was a big outcry about this questioning its truth . But the police reports state so and I believe the truth was buried by the socialist regime ) . It wasnt a perfect society but it was a society which the Bulgarians were part of nevertheless . Id compare it to 1920\\ 's America with the Bulgarians being the black people . Unfair , riddled by discrimination but not slaves . I honestly though the Turks would have left a bigger genetic imprint but it turns out that part the 10 % Turkish minority a very small part of the population has Turkic genes . Id definitely urge you to read the Bulgarian entry of the Wikipedia page a linked , it was a very interesting read.\\n\\nYou are right though , I was wrong to say we have nothing in common with our ancestors from 1000 years ago , and I shouldnt have commented on the Greeks , I do not know enough about the topic . I am born and raised in Bulgaria so I definitely see myself as Bulgarian . But I think its very very important to encourage an open discussion on the topic . The socialist years blurred and twisted many parts of history in order to drive their idea of national identity . \\n\\nNow you know why my friends forbid me from speaking about anything related to this when we hang out .",Balto-Slavic,Bulgarian

If oil price won\\'t go up to $ 70+ then reserve fund will be fully depleted during Q1 2017 , prosperity fund ( ~ $ 70B ) will last about 3-4 quarters since it has substantial part of it ( 1/3 ) already spent ( \ '' invested\ '' ) into long-term projects.\\n\\nHere is the [ article with numbers ] ( https : //lenta.ru/news/2017/01/10/reservefund/ ) .",Balto-Slavic,Russian

Actually Kurdish society is still quite conservative , and even tribal features still exist .

And in any case they and everybody are aware that the progressive Kurdish movement is the only effective force for Kurdish interests.\\n\\n & gt ; Arent they Kurdish nationalists too ? \\n\\nDefinitely , but the substantive answer depends on what you mean by nationalists . If you mean people who seek an independent Kurdish state and anything else just as battles on the way to that aim , this kind of people are to be found scattered in almost all quarters of Kurdish society , particularily urban youth in the Southeast , but they do not drive the agenda for now .

Haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . His new voters didn\\'t care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably didn\\'t understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . Haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . His populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . While he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state Carinthia suffered from an economic decline . Haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . One year after Haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . There are few of them left who are not convicted . \\n\\nHaider had left a toxic heritage to Austria . The formerly state owned bank Hypo Alpe Adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . The bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion Euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . Haider and the FP\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in Carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . Everything the FP\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . \\n\\nAs writer Josef Winkler said , Haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . But voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . The FP\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . This new chair , Strache - his name derives from \ '' Strach\ '' , the Czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . These campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . A new soviet Union arising from the EU ( \ '' EUDSSR\ '' ) quickly became their main issue . \\n\\nThe FP\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . They dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . There were rumors that Trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring . The FP\u00d6 has been a main developer of that far right line and with Trump , we appear to see the return of this political poision to the place from where it originated .",Germanic,German

AngieMcD,europe,"& gt ; Well , it might come as a surprise to you , but it is very difficult for unwanted non-citizens to get a Dutch citizenship .

But they\\ 'll be in the next govt so we shall see ) so for me it\\ 's not difficult enough I\\ 'm sorry to say . I don\\'t want these 2 million or their children to be a part of my democracy.\\n\\n & gt ; \ '' you\ '' just don\\'t like muslims , and you have never known a muslim in your life ... \\n\\nThat\\ 's not correct . One of my childhood best friend\\ 's was a nominal Muslim ( I was his best friend , but I was a bit of a whore and had multiple ) also my fave colleague at my last job . What I don\\'t care for is the political influence of Islam . Seeing as I live in a democracy and I\\ 'd like to keep it that way.. That is an issue . We can\\'t very well live with Muslims without giving them democratic rights can we ? \\n\\nA party that is allied to an enemy state that has accused us of genocide and Nazism is about to get into parliament with 2 seats purely on the Muslim vote . There isn\\'t a nation in the world where Muslims are the main political power where I\\ 'm not a 2nd-class citizen . I\\ 'm very sorry that it offends you that I don\\'t care for Syria\\ 's politics anymore than the refugees do .

AFAIAA,europe,"& gt ; That\\ 's plain wrong . If Greeks are able to solve the situation , but EU prevents them , they\\ 'd leave EU . They didn\\'t and actively fighting against any attempts to push them out of EU/eurozone . So either they know better that EU is good for them or they are totally stupid , but in this case you can\\'t say they are able to solve the situation . \\n\\nI was referring to the economic situation . You moved the goal posts . You haven\\'t logically explained why the former would motivate the latter , that they leave the EU . The statements I\\ 've read from Greeks in government over the past few years indicate that Greeks had no choice due to threats from many sides . Second , Greece is not a unified \u201cthey\u201d , the situation is sooner that Greece did not have a successful majority attempt at withstanding EU demands or leaving the EU.\\n\\n & gt ; ECB being ruled by a council , which consists of heads of Eurozone countries\\ ' central banks + 6 people appointed by EC and EP . Every time I see someone saying \ '' unelected , unaccountable bureaucrats\ '' I understand that this person didn\\'t bother to read documents.\\n\\nI did not write \ '' unelected , unaccountable bureaucrats\ '' , so I\\ 'm not going to defend a position I do not hold . Your \\'understanding\\ ' is a misunderstanding . \\n\\n & gt ; Directly elected parliament , indirectly ( through national parliaments ) elected EC is so undemocratic it hurts . \\n\\nThe parliament is an imitation of a functioning national parliament . Citizens of European nations have virtually no influence over the so-called representatives in the EU . The real power is displaced into unreachable power structures . \\n\\nMore importantly , saying a thing is \u201dundemocratic\u201d does not mean that that thing is not designed to be or even look like a democracy . What\\ 's relevant in this case is how that thing functions . The Third Reich was democratically elected , but according to your reasoning , it is incorrect to call the Third Reich\\ 's Reichstag undemocratic.\\n\\nRegarding EU\\ 's so-called democracy , there are problems with things like accountability , representation and legitimacy . The problems include low trust in the EU , low voter turnouts in EU elections , and national elections for EU seats that focus on national issues when the EU is a supranational organisation . There are no EU-wide parties and there are no actual EU elections . National issues voted on that get national politicans voted into the EU only have indirect influence on actual EU-level issues . Half of EU\\ 's citizens feel apathetic about the EU and distrust the structure of its representation . Then there\\ 's the extensive lack of citizen participation in EU elections . Read more about \ '' democratic deficit\ '' in the EU . It\\ 's topic on which books and papers have been written for decades , so there\\ 's no shortage of perspectives . It is not some problem you can easily dismiss.\\n\\n & gt ; Norway is out of EU because it wanted to protect its agriculture . Ask them how happy they are about food prices , or \ '' egg crisis\ '' before Easter . \\n\\nNorway has a different economic and agricultural structure than Sweden , regardless of its relationship to the EU . You\\ 're moving the goal posts again and avoiding the issue.\\n\\n & gt ; That\\ 's the point of the entire EU . Like with phone chargers -- every vendor created its own \ '' in his best interest\ '' , until EU forced them to use the same standard . This harms vendors , but customers benefit from it.\\n\\nThe point of the EU is to erode democracy and make decions-making more inefficient . Great .

Ax_Dk,europe,"The Famine of 1943 can not just be summed up in one nice little paragraph that says \ '' Britain Bad , India Suffer\ '' . \\n\\nThere are so many reasons for this famine not just that Churchill diverted grain for troops . You also need to look at this from a whole of India situation . \\n\\nCertain areas of India were not producing enough food to feed their populations and were reliant on imports of grains and rice from Burma ( also a british territory ) . \\n\\nWhen Burma fell to the Japanese , this import source was gone . \\n\\nIndian states had a large degree of self governance at this stage and rather than ensure that food was made available to Bengal etc by sending food from states with surplus as they had done in previous decades , they decided to implement price controls etc to try and solve the issue - something that had not previously been tried in India . These price controls meant that states that had surplus food were not willing to send this food to these provinces as farmers would make losses and profits may be released outside of their states . \\n\\nThe failure is the inability to get Indian States to work together for the good of the larger nation , rather than the recently democratic states within India - politicians in these states now felt the need to show that they were standing up for locals first . \\n\\nSo really , if this article was looking to tell a complete story it should expand these subsections . \\n\\nThe British had largely handed power over to the Indian Government and didn\\'t have their hands on their day to day \ '' levers\ '' of running India . \\n\\nI am not saying that this is not the responsibility of the British to fix , but I am sick and tired of the Bengal Famine being bought up as a prime example of how the British Empire failed and as such - should be considered 100 % horrible . Authors always actively ignore the circumstances and go with the revisionist narrative and ignore the fact that India had achieved a level of self governance at this stage sufficient to handle this issue themselves . \\n\\nIf this had happened in 1843 then it would have been 100 % Britain\\ 's mistake . In this case the issue was caused by an inefficient Indian Bureaucracy and an apathy and unwillingness of the British to step into the devolved power of the Indian Government .",Germanic,English

Nagorno-Karabakh is virtually ultra-Armenian in ethnicity , and the Russia-friendly Eastern Ukraine regions are largely composed of ethnic Ukrainians who just prefer to speak Russian and being under Moscovite rule rather than Kievan . Same thing is more-or-less true about South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\\n\\nRussia does not actually need to intergrate these regions into their lands . Just keeping them as puppet states while maintaining troops and power over them is enough . It achieves the same goals without putting *ANNEXATION* into the title.\\n\\nCrimea was a special case , since the majority of the populace are ethnic Russians . But snatching it away from Ukraine wasn\\'t for national reasons . It was in theory , but in practice , Russia wanted to make sure that influence in northern Black Sea waters would remain under Moscow and the port of Sevastopol would never be allowed to fall off russian hands.\\n\\nIt was mainly NATO\\ 's interest in Ukraine that pushed Russia to such extremities . I\\ 'm not justifying Putin\\ 's annexation , but there\\ 's no way in hell he\\ 'd let such an important to Russia , warm water port become a naval base for a NATO member ( if Ukraine ascended ) so close to home . Russia is the one who punched first and they should be punished for that ( sanction-wise and whatnot ) , but they did it only after NATO kept fake-punching and shouting \ '' I\\ 'm not touching you\ '' to them for several years.\\n\\nUkraine\\ 's role as Russia\\ 's lapdog since independence also gives a strong sense of \ '' ownership\ '' on it . It\\ 's the same way with Belarus ( which \ '' Russia\ '' in all but name ) , since neither country was a thing before they were formed by USSR .

ArisKatsaris,europe,"You\\ 're confusing further sanctions with extension of existing sanctions.\\n\\nLook at the statement of the Greek ministry regarding the sanctions , and how *hard* it fought to oppose further extensions , how desperately it tries to express that it fought hard to oppose further sanctions against Russia , and that blocking such further sanctions ( and limiting the extension of the current sanctions ) was the very best it could do . http : //www.mfa.gr/en/current-affairs/top-story/initial-statement-of-foreign-minister-kotzias-to-foreign-and-greek-correspondents-following-the-eu-foreign-affairs-councils-extraordinary-meeting-on-ukraine-brussels-29-january-2015.html\\n\\nSome quotes : \\n\ '' The main thing we wanted to be removed , and for which we fought for two hours \u2013 half of the time we were in the Council was spent on this issue \u2013 was the proposal for new sanctions . This was certainly a difficult negotiation . \ '' \\n\\n\ '' The phrase providing for the new sanctions on Russia was removed . \ '' \\n\\n\ '' In this sense , we called upon the present Council not to move ahead to new sanctions against Russia.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' What is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in September.\ '' \\n\\n\ '' It was also agreed for the Council to explore and think about new lists . This will probably be discussed at the Council\u2019s next meeting . But these lists are subject to approval and ratification by each country , and we would not like to see the inclusion of persons we will not accept.\ '' \\n\\nIn all of this statement , frankly , you can see the desperate attempts of a pathetic servant to convince his Russian masters , that yes , Greece did NOT betray Russia by agreeing to the extension , that it worked its hardest to stop even heavier sanctions , that in all the negotiations they still have the best interests of Russia at heart.\\n\\nAnd here\\ 's how the Greek threat of a veto was cancelled out by another country\\ 's threat of a veto in the opposite direction : \\n\ '' In this sense , we called upon the present Council not to move ahead to new sanctions against Russia . I must mention to you that there was a country that moved to veto , but it was not Greece , as the international press had expected . This veto was put forward because a phrase was to be removed \u2013 and we had debated for an hour and a half on this issue . The Greek delegation explained clearly that this phrase would be removed \u2013 otherwise our work would not be able to move ahead . This country was isolated and , in the end , creatively , agreed to a text that does not provide for heavy sanctions or new sanctions against Russia . What is provided for is the extension of the sanctions that have been imposed in the past , which , however , rather than being extended to the end of the year , will be reconsidered in September . \ '' \\n\\n & gt ; Shit , the French are selling Russia warships , are they traitors to the EU and in Putin\\ 's pocket for doing so ? \\n\\nLook at http : //www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/a_power_audit_of_eu_russia_relations\\nCountries like France , Germany , Italy , Spain , are categorized as \ '' strategic partners - whose governments have built special bilateral relationships with Russia , which has sometimes cut against the grain of common EU objectives in areas such as energy and the EU Neighbourhood Policy\ '' \\n\\nGreece and Cyprus was categorized under a new category altogether - \ '' Trojan horses\ '' of Russia . And that was already in 2007 , not in 2015 with the much more blatantly Russophilic SYRIZA administration.\\n\\nBasically , it\\ 's a different thing when a country does some things which are in Russia\\ 's interests when and ONLY when it has a clear benefit to do so , and when a country does almost *everything* in Russia\\ 's interests.\\n\\nFrance ( and Germany and other countries ) have been capitalist opportunists .

And since there were not and still aren\\'t any jobs for them in Italy and Greece , because our economies can\\'t support MILLIONS of immigrants , since there simply aren\\'t so many jobs available in our two countries , that practically meant that with the \ '' EU immigration policies\ '' hundreds of thousands of people were forced to live in countries were because of the lack of jobs , the only option they had left for their survival was crime . Because of your \ '' EU immigration policies\ '' our countries have become like large jails of punishment for the immigrants , something that not only is bad for the immigrants , but also for the Englishs , as crime rates have skyrocketed , and we are afraid to walk on the streets , because starving immigrants might kill you for a piece of bread to save their own lives . \\n\\n\\nSo instead of having these immigrant people shared between our countries , and I mean ALL E.U . countries , which would allow for them to get jobs and help grow some economies , the current EU policy is to strand ALL immigrants from Asia and Africa to just 2 countries , meaning overpopulation , povetry , suffering , crime.\\nI am disturbed by the inhumanity and lack of sympathy that is very often portrayed by Northern Europeans.\\n\\n\\nSo before spitting out remarks of irony about Greece and Italy , learn first whats the situation has been like for the past decade in these countries , and try to think how would you feel if that happened to your own .",Greek,Greek

Arathian,europe,"Full text : \\n\\nZIPPING across the choppy Aegean in his powerboat , Nassos Karakitsos , a volunteer with a search-and-rescue NGO called Emergency Response Centre International , scans the horizon for refugees . He spots none . A few months ago the seas around the Greek island of Lesbos were filled with overstuffed rubber dinghies ( \u201cballoons with engines\u201d , Mr Karakitsos calls them ) carrying Afghans , Iraqis and Syrians from the Turkish coast . Today they are home only to the more forbidding vessels of the Greek coast guard , Frontex ( the European Union\u2019s border agency ) and NATO , lately arrived to help with maritime surveillance.\\n\\nThe quiet seas are the result of a deal struck between the EU and Turkey to reduce migrant flows , which came into effect on March 20th . It took everyone by surprise , says a European official on Lesbos , and there were teething troubles : the police tailed a Turkish liaison officer stationed on the island , suspecting he was a spy . But for now the migrants have stopped coming . Some of the scrappy volunteer groups that flocked to Lesbos last autumn , when 6,000 refugees might clamber ashore in one day , are closing shop . Larger organisations are moving staff to mainland Greece , where 46,000 refugees have been trapped by the closure of the Macedonian border.\\n\\nThe drama has shifted to Greek ministries , EU agencies and the quasi-prisons on Aegean islands created by the Turkey deal . On Lesbos , all arrivals are taken to Moria , a \u201chotspot\u201d ( processing centre ) turned detention camp . Most will face return once their asylum claims have been found inadmissible , on the ground that they reached Greece from Turkey , now considered a safe country for asylum-seekers . ( Deportations of migrants who did not claim asylum in Greece have already begun . ) Activists consider the deal a shameful abrogation of the EU\u2019s commitment to human rights . The pope , who has attacked Europe\u2019s \u201canaesthetised conscience\u201d on refugees , will visit Lesbos on April 16th.\\n\\nWell over 3,000 souls have been stuffed into Moria , a grim place of barbed wire and watchtowers . Through a fence Muhammad , a Syrian refugee , tells Charlemagne of overcrowded shelters and a complete lack of information before a policeman cuts the conversation short . Pakistanis\u2014who , curiously , have been arriving in greater numbers since the deal kicked in\u2014have begun a hunger strike . The NGOs that used to provide services inside Moria have partly withdrawn in protest , leaving it short of infrastructure , expertise and food . Last week Amnesty International , a human-rights watchdog , criticised the \u201cappalling conditions\u201d at Moria and another centre on the island of Chios.\\n\\nWorse may be to come . All migrants on the island have the right to claim asylum and to appeal if rejected , and 95 % have taken this up . The Greeks plan to conclude each case within just 15 days . But there are endless unanswered questions over the process , from the treatment of unaccompanied minors to the provision of legal aid . \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for us , and for Europe , \u201d says Maria Stavropoulou , the director of the Greek asylum service.\\n\\nVery little about Europe\u2019s handling of the refugee crisis has gone right . This deal is unlikely to be an exception . Refugees who have spent vast sums to flee life-threatening situations may not go willingly . The fate of non-Syrians returned to Turkey is unclear . Legal challenges are certain . The timeline for processing may well slip . In the meantime , if arrivals pick up again , Lesbos could reach its capacity of around 6,000 . Officials have already begun offloading migrants from Moria to other camps . Dozens of EU asylum officials have been dispatched to process the claims . Ms Stavropoulou\u2019s service has doubled in number . But she can not bring herself to say that she is confident the deal will work.\\n\\nMuch of the criticism the deal has attracted is therefore deserved . And yet , as Yannis Mouzalas , the Greek migration minister , notes , by the time it was signed it was the best that could be done . The EU had learned the hard way that it was unable to create a relocation scheme to share the refugee burden , and without one , fences were the only alterEnglish . For those European politicians whose priority was to reduce the flow , the new arrangement looks like a success . New asylum registrations in Germany fell to 21,000 in March , down from over 200,000 in November . Fears that migrants stranded in Greece would find other ways through have not come to pass ; instead , they have camped out in wretched conditions near the border , and elsewhere , in the futile hope that it will reopen one day.\\n\\nAsylum or bust\\nThis has created a tinderbox in Greece\u2014last week Macedonian police tear-gassed migrants who tried to storm the border\u2014but breathing space for politicians . Not long ago pundits speculated that Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , might not see out her term . Now she enjoys rising approval ratings.\\n\\nThat could change if the deal collapses . But there is a bigger concern . There was , despite appearances , a noble idea behind the EU-Turkey deal : stop the irregular migrant flows to make way for regular ones . Europe will probably make good on its minimal commitment to accept one Syrian refugee from Turkey for each one sent back from Greece . But the deal also includes a vague promise of far more substantial resettlements to Europe : optimists have spoken of 200,000 a year or more . On this there is little sign of movement , despite the efforts of German and Dutch politicians to corral their colleagues into making pledges.\\n\\nThroughout this crisis Europe has been accused of pulling up the drawbridge and shunting its problems onto its neighbours . So far the accusation has not been warranted . But it will be if the EU fails to make good on its resettlement promises . On the wall of Moria the graffiti is still visible behind the whitewash : \u201cEU shame on you.\u201d If Europe does not show that its refugee policy amounts to more than border closures , detention and forced deportation , it will become impossible not to agree .",Greek,Greek

ArisKatsaris,europe,"& gt ; Nothing to do with religion . Like the witch hunts in the 16th,17th , 18th centuries . \\n\\nIn pre-Christian Rome , in 331 BC , 170 women were executed as witches.\\nIn 184 BC , about 2,000 people were executed for witchcraft\\nIn 182\u2013180 BC another 3,000 executions took place.\\n\\nChristianisation actually drastically reduced the killings of witches , with the first church teaching actually calling for the punishment of anyone who *accused* people for witchcraft . From wikipedia : \\n\\nThe Councils of Elvira ( 306 ) , Ancyra ( 314 ) , and Trullo ( 692 ) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship . This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries . The general desire of the Catholic Church\\ 's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn , which , in 785 , explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch . The Lombard code of 643 states : \\nLet nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch , for it is not possible , nor ought to be believed by Christian minds . [ 22 ] \\nThis conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900 AD ( alleged to date from 314 AD ) , which , following the thoughts of Augustine of Hippo , stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was , itself , false and heterodox teaching . The Council of Frankfurt in 794 , called by Charlemagne , was also very explicit in condemning \ '' the persecution of alleged witches and wizards\ '' , calling the belief in witchcraft \ '' superstitious\ '' , and ordering the death penalty for those who presumed to burn witches . [ 23 ] Other examples include an Irish synod in 800 , [ 24 ] and a sermon by Agobard of Lyons ( 810 ) . [ 25 ] \\n\\n ... \\n\\nPope Gregory VII , in 1080 , wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence . \\n\\n & gt ; Nine million of them just went puff.\\n\\nI suggest you recheck your numbers .

You\\ 're mocking the creation of wealth , and one second later you\\ 'll probably be asking to \\'redistribute\\ ' the non-existing wealth whose creation you\\ 've been mocking , or you\\ 'll be begging for money from countries that don\\'t actually sabotage their industry.\\n\\n & gt ; Never mind the unique ancient sites and artifacts , because ... investors ! \\n\\nRight 10,000 acres in Rhodes were just declared an \ '' archaeological area\ '' just in order to pause a 400 million euro tourist investment in the island . By comparison the whole of the Olympia archaeological area is just 6500 acres . ( But it needed to stretch to 10,000 acres , so that it would encompass the area the investors needed , and which was by itself actually far far away from any actually discovered antiquities . ) \\n\\nIsn\\'t it funny how all that area in Rhodes was only *now* declared an area of archeological interest , *just* when such a declaration was needed in order to pause the tourist investment . Nothing of archeological interest *there* until it was needed to be declared such for the purposes of the sabotage .

For more details , check \ '' why do you want to be a moderator\ '' . \\n\\n -- -- \\n\\n & gt ; How often are you on reddit in an average week ? \\n\\n\\nThat depends on how much work I have . However , I usually browse reddit at least 1-2 hours a day and , sometimes , it can be way , waaaay more than that . It\\ 's kind of embarrassing , really.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; How often do you visit /r/europe ? \\n\\nThe vast majority of my lurking time on reddit is in /r/europe . The majority of my posts are also in /r/europe . So ... quite often.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What country are you normally resident in ? \\n\\nI move a lot due to work but , for the foreseeable future , I will be residing in east coast Canada . That means I mainly lurk in the off hours where most people are asleep . \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Do you speak any languages besides English ? ( If yes : which and to what level ? ) \\n\\nMy mother tongue is Greek . I can also understand some German , although I am very rusty in them.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What interests you about Europe ? \\n\\nI was born here : ) \\n\\nBut besides the obvious , I like European politics and have some basic understanding of most countries\\ ' current political situation . I am mostly in /r/europe to discuss its politics and their effects on the population.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\nedit : oups , forgot this one ! \\n\\n & gt ; What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe ? \\n\\nFavourite : This sub has many great discussions frequently , which is rather rare for most subreddits this size . I honestly think this is the greatest strength of this sub . This and many fun tibits and top bantz about various European nations.\\n\\nLeast Favourite : This sub has too many camps that yell at each other with no intention of ever changing their minds . This directly hurts my favourite thing about this subreddit . I hope I can help reduce that ! \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? \\n\\nAbsolutely none and automoderator could as well be casting spells for all I know . However , I usually learn the computer hocus pocus rather fast when needed.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Why do you want to be a moderator ? \\n\\nRight , I will be blunt on this one : because I am a right winger.\\n\\nHowever , that doesn\\'t mean what some might expect . I don\\'t think there is a \ '' grand conspiracy of left wingers\ '' in this sub\\ 's moderation . In fact , I would go so far as to say that it is pretty much a fact that there isn\\'t such a conspiracy.\\n\\nAs a right winger , I would have the \ '' legitimacy\ '' to do something the current mods can\\'t do due to calls of \ '' censorship\ '' : I can properly moderate immigration threads . If I become a moderator , I will probably spend most of my time whacking over the head two types of people : \\n\\n-the \ '' I am not racist but muslims should be gassed\ '' people\\n\\n-the \ '' everyone who disagrees with me in & lt ; shill , racist , SJW & gt ; \ '' people.\\n\\nI intend to enforce civility and try to bring the discussion back to people discussing an event rather than a yelling competition . I strongly opposed the megathreads ( even got banned for it , although it was reversed ) but the current situation is getting slightly out of hand . My main reason for being a moderator is to help balance the front page again.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; why do you think you would be a good moderator ? \\n\\nCheck preface for a detailed answer on that . For tl ; dr : I don\\'t think I would be the best one . I do think I would be a competent one . I also think my presence in the moderation team , in itself , would be a good thing.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; do you have any experience with statistics , data-mining or reddit bots ? \\n\\nI have extensive experience with statistics . In fact , I got a minor on that ! I do not have any experience on data mining or reddit bots.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? What do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? \\n\\nI strongly opposed it . I still strongly oppose any such solutions . Immigration is a very complex story but the basics ( people going from X to Y ) has been talked about to death and anything worthwhile has been said . The point of immigration threads is to discuss specific *events* that happen as they happen . That is not possible in a megathread . Megathreads are ... .okey for single events , not great , but okey . They are absolutely terrible as a permanent solution for discussing a major topic.\\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What\\ 's one weakness you have ? \\n\\n [ I usually v\u00f6rk all day and neglect my family . Fok em . ] ( https : //youtu.be/2W0WsdLobq8 ? t=138 ) \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? \\n\\nObviously a hundred duck sized horses . Horses are stupid and they won\\'t form up to fight you . You can just bash em to death one by one while they are trying to flee from you . Also , they can be latter used for delicious , duck-sized horse steaks ! \\n\\n -- -\\n\\n & gt ; What single word connects all of these three of the following words : Europe , Pussy Cat , Teacher ?

Well obviously , we don\\'t have something personal with Hitler other than that fact that he did what he did.. Turkey has been muslim since the beginning but only now that it\\ 's going more radical people are vocal about it . Do you think that\\ 's somehow wrong ? Turkey has been muslim 15 years ago and it was best buddies with the West so no , it\\ 's not about Islam , cause Turkey has always been there . It\\ 's about allowing someone to tether Turkey to Islam and allow religion to affect its society.\\n\\n & gt ; See this is exactly what I am talking about . The perpetrators of those get arrested and locked up you guys act like these are actually encouraged by the state they are not . You guys trying to push that stuff like this is ordered by islam and supported by muslims while perpetrators are generally violent idiots.\\n\\nAs far as i know the guy that attacked the girl in the bus was released . If that changed , good . I\\ 'm not trying to say if it\\ 's Islam that orders it or not but since you mentioned it , the attacks happened because of religious reasons right ? These typically don\\'t happen in secular countries . Obviously it\\ 's not the rule in Turkey but the whole picture is getting increasingly worse for you guys . Try to understand that it\\ 's not a matter of Islam . In Greece if you follow what religion dictates , people are not supposed to eat meat during Easter too but we don\\'t have cases like this one . Regardless of the religion , if that happened people would be mad because it\\ 's not a secular thing but a sign of backwardness . So no , it\\ 's not about Islam . It\\ 's about Turkey getting closer to being a society with bullshit laws dictated by religion and moving away from what it used to be.\\n\\n & gt ; Another example that proves my argument . Do you see the pattern here ? Death penalty maybe coming back to Turkey has absolutely nothing to do with islam yet you act like it does . Why ? I know why but please answer.\\n\\nIt\\ 's very simple . Because unlike what you\\ 're claiming , i\\ 'm not using Turkey to bash Islam . As you just pointed out , this has nothing to do with Islam . Other things do have to do with religion generally , but this one doesn\\'t.\\n\\n & gt ; Islam is barely relevant here if majority of Turks were non-religious Erdogan\\ 's methods would simply change he uses religion because we are religious people.\\n\\nThat\\ 's correct . He\\ 's using religion to get what he wants but i\\ 'd except from a country like Turkey to be able to resist that given that even though you\\ 're religious people ( like us pretty much ) , there was a strong secular core . Unfortunately Erdogan is taking Turkey away from that from what i see . His motives might not be religious but the outcome affects exactly that . Again , this is not a beef against Islam . It\\ 's a beef against a country slowly turning theocratic regardless of the religion it adheres to.\\n\\n & gt ; No it is you who want that . So that you can say \ '' I told you so\ '' . If you actually cared you would get informed.\\n\\nThat\\ 's a pretty childish mentality , it\\ 's all i can say .

So many bosses now take the role of the \\'boss\\ ' quite further than they should , accompanied with a feeling of smug superiority .

Like for example say you are hired as a front-end web developer , and the employer asks you to go buy him coffee , take his dog for a walk etc ... And of course you will spend more time at work , without getting paid for it . At worst , employers keep postponing pay you FOR MONTHS . Sometimes after some months of not paying , they fire you and they never pay you for all the work you\\ 've done . There are some cases in which people demanded to get paid for the months they worked got attacked and injured . Perhaps you might have heard about the story from 4 years ago when at a strawberry field the boss started shooting at Bangladeshi workers that were never paid and demanded their salaries : https : //www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/bangladeshi-strawberry-pickers-shot-at-by-greek-farmers-win-european-rights-case\\nBut this is just one case that got popular because of its size and the fact the attacked were Bangladeshis . There are more incidents of attacks , that don\\'t get to international news . Like for example recently a Greek woman was attacked with punches and kicks by her ex-boss for demanding the salary for her work , but this news story was \\'disappeared\\ ' . Of course quite usually people who do work and are getting paid are harassed daily by their bosses with name calling and what not , and workers swallow their pride and accept it because they are afraid of losing their jobs and not finding another one after . A job has become something rare , and if you are lucky to find one you are expected to do whatever you are told , even things not related to your profession , and being harassed , and feel lucky about it because you have a job while others don\\'t . \\n\\nAnother phenomenon is the rise of fringe political groups , and political extremism . Politicians that were once thought to be clowns now have got into the parliament . Neonazis have become the 3rd strongest party in the parliament . A bunch of neonazis murdered a man some years ago , a group of anarchists walked into the offices of some business and broke machinery in it like computers etc with hammers , recording it all with a cell phone and uploading it to Youtube ... https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6MByeh3soKU\\nThese are just hand-picked incidents , there are more like these.\\n\\nA third phenomenon is people believing easier than ever in conspiracy theorist charlatans . We are perhaps the only country in the world where an elected parliamentarian asked the government if it secretly \\'sprays\\ ' people with a chemical , following the popular \ '' chemtrails\ '' conspiracy theory . Aside from that , a few years ago a man appeared on TV saying he had 3 trillion euros ( ! ) , and that he would give 600 billions from his wealth to end Greece\\ 's debt . When asked where he found all that money , he said that the \\'gods\\ ' of ancient Greeks were aliens , and that he discovered an abandoned spaceship of them , and that he sold the technology of that aircraft . He promised that not only he would pay Greece\\ 's public debt , but also that he would give each Greek 25.000 euros once he becomes the ruler of Greece . Because of course he wanted to rule Greece as a return for his favor ... And people believed him . And they went to find him , and he convinced them that he can only use the money after he becomes the prime minister . And asked people to pay so he can start a political party . And some people paid , and hundreds of offices of his new party popped up at cities and towns all over the country . Eventually one of his organization\\ 's members ( who are all nutjobs ) murdered another thinking that the other member was plotting to steal his place in this organization of nutjobs . And the organization was banned only because of that . http : //www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2017/03/17/artemis-sorras-the-man-to-buy-greeces-debt-with-600bn-sentenced-for-embezzlement/ \\n\\nAnother thing , is religious people acting more than ever . In the last years we saw a muslim trying to convert people through Youtube https : //www.youtube.com/user/GreekMuslimEldin , the same thing done by a Jew https : //www.youtube.com/user/JewishIdea77 ( these two often speak about one another in a bad fashion as they see each other as competitors ) . We also have lately some Christian dude believing that the antichrist is here , and he attacks ATMs saying credit cards are the mark of the antichrist , he breaks cell phones because these are Satan\\ 's too , and does other similar stuff : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zALLL-azSOM and of course there are people marching through the streets with a statue of Dionysus and beating drums : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=q8uARn0do4I\\n\\nHere is another phenomenon : Lots of Greeks now open their businesses on other countries like Cyprus , Bulgaria , or Malta . And although the headquarters are there , they live and practice their professions in Greece . They do it so they can be taxed in these other countries because tax rates there are shorter . Globalization allows them to do it , and it\\ 's an argument against austerity , as if the taxes are too high on one country , businesses just move to another one now that it\\ 's easy . This way the Greek government collects even less taxes because the number of businesses is reduced.\\n\\nAnd there are more ... I got tired up a bit writing all this for now . Perhaps I might edit this post to add more later . Tell me your opinions about these . Do you have similar phenomena in your countries ? If so , for how long , and do you think that there is something in particular that leads to them ?",Greek,Greek

Each state was very autonomous up until the constitution replaced the articles of confederation , but perhaps more-so up until the civil war when the federal government\\ 's claim to dominion over the states was solidified . The common way to refer to the USA was \ '' these states united\ '' in contrast to \ '' these united states\ '' to give you an idea.\\n\\nThe autonomy of each of the US\\ 's states has slowly eroded over time and this is what\\ 'll happen to a federalized EU . One of the most egregious aspects of the way the US treats it\\ 's states is the \ '' you may enter but never leave\ '' policy it has in place . It\\ 's the sort of freedom stripping attitude you wouldn\\'t expect from a country that uses freedom as it\\ 's middle name . It\\ 's especially bad in regards to the original 13 states and states that were sovereign before they joined the US ( Vermont , Texas , California ) .

For example in one of his letters , he was calling a verse from quran something like \ '' nonsense\ '' which is a big no . On the opposite side ; there was a religious singer H\u00e2f\u0131z* Kem\u00e2l G\u00fcrses whom Atat\u00fcrk is said to love listening and even give his Surname .

Incidentally I would argue that proper full 100 % Christian lifestyle is incompatible with modern Europe as well , but currently in Europe there is no State that is using Christianity the way the current Turkish government are using Islam . \\n\\nSo based on this , the argument is that Islamic lifestyle is somehow inherently deeply entrenched in Turkish society and every little dogmatic rule in Islam is at least passively present in any Turkish persons lifestyle . But in actual fact I would argue that Islamic ways of living are not inherently involved in the way the average Turkish person lives their life , and I would even go further and say even the average AKP supporting Turk doesn\\'t live their life with much real Islamic influence.\\n\\nI imagine I will be getting weird stares at the moment . \ '' But Erdogan is Islamist , he is bringing Islamism to Turkey , Sharia Law , headscarves etc.\ '' . It\\ 's true yes . He is using Islamist populism to garner support . The Turkish demographic that supports him easily fall for the plea to emotion . A few Islamic phrases here and there and they are swooning for him , because these are people doe eyed for the days of their ancestors village and since their ancestors saw these words as noble and associated with good deeds , they automatically see it that way as well . This certainly is a problem that causes a division between the way people vote in Europe and the way they vote in Turkey , Turkey still has an electorate that can be exploited with religious populism . \\n\\nBut then in terms of the lifestyle of these AKP voters ... are they actually 100 % living lives that are not redeemable with the West ? I would say no they are not . A religious AKP supporter who does his 5 times a day prayers is not incompatible with the West . Forcing this religion on others is , and to be honest in my experience of AKP voters among my relatives I have never experienced any force or anything in their lifestyles that would see them as being fundamentally different from their humble socio-economic equivalents in Europe ( especially those in the Balkans who are probably much like them but with the Church replaced with the Mosque ) . \\n\\nThere is a minority pocket of hardcore Islamists that are fringe compared to AKP mainstream standards and who actually are most certainly not compatible with Europe in any way shape or form . These are similar to the Islamists we see protesting on the streets of London , Paris or Berlin , who I like to call \ '' the Saudi pocket\ '' . These people shouldn\\'t be in the conversation if they are talking about mainstream Turkish culture and its compatibility with Europe , as they are not representative of Turkish Muslim cultural norms.\\n\\nFor me Turkey\\ 's incompatibility with Europe starts and ends with politics . The fact that a right wing conservative government is in power , voted in by people who see their religious identity like a football team and a Fascist President who resembles a leader from the days European states were riddled with Fascist leaders . The fact that the political institutions and state apparatus\\ ' of Turkey are not up to European Union standards , judiciary etc . things like this . This is the main difference between a Turk and a European . It\\ 's not that there is a deep cultural difference . \\n\\nBut away from politics , if we look at the general Turkish life map , it is the same as a European life map ( and I imagine this life map is true of the whole World ) . Born , go to school , hopefully do well at school and go to university , get a well paying job , get married , have kids , rinse and repeat etc . all while participating in the capitalistic free market along the way . This is just as true for Erdoganist Turks as it is for Europeanist Turks . It\\ 's not as simple as poor working class people from Anatolia VS rich educated Istanbul/Western Coast elite . Much of the bedrock of AKP support is by the \ '' Anatolian Tigers\ '' , the noveau rich who come from humbler backgrounds than the \ '' old money\ '' Kemalists . \\n\\nI guess what I\\ 'm essentially saying is this . Let\\ 's say we lived in a wacky alterEnglish history where Turkey was a historically Christian country . All of the things in Turkish politics could still be the same as they are . There is nothing inherent in Islam that makes Turkish politics the way it is , you can substitute any religion and it would work the same , especially the Abrahamic religions . Erdogan could be a Christian leader using Christian rhetoric to drill the masses up in the same way . A Jesus here , a Jesus there . \\n\\nTurkey\\ 's problems and incompatibility with Europe therefore are not with Islam itself , but with the meta-problem of religion being mixed with politics and with problems in its State apparatus not being up to European standards . Europe could in theory have countries that are Christian equivalents of Erdogan\\ 's Turkey and they would be just an antithesis to \ '' European Culture\ '' as Turkey is . \\n\\nI wrote more than I intended to but there\\ 's my opinion . I\\ 'm very interested to hear other peoples opinions on this topic .",Turkic,Turkish
Alpy94,europe,"& gt ; Just because we have trauma influence our relationship with Judaism doesn\\'t mean that\\ 's how it should be . Ideally we would treat no religion in a privileged manner , as no religion can be superior to another in the eyes of the state ( only if the state is secular though , like France or Turkey ) . That\\ 's why this front page is a good wake-up call : it shows that we treat some religions as \ '' untouchable\ '' , when we really shouldn\\'t . \\n\\nThose aren\\'t only religions . They also represent cultural/ethnic minorities , too , and extreme violence towards minorities don\\'t just appear out of blue one day . There tends to be a whole baggage of misguided opinions , similar to what the front-page can reinforce . That is why it is bad . It is dangerous.\\n\\nAnd with the rise of nationalist parties , frankly it makes me a bit scared . I wouldn\\'t want to see you guys become genocidal maniacs .

I don\\'t find CNN ( or FOX ) trustworthy either , but CBS , PBS or NPR ( besides the pro-Israel stuff ) is fine in my opinion . \\n\\nAnd the subscription for NYT is growing , because of Trump.\\n\\n & gt ; That said , the ongoing pewdiepie debacle demonstrated quite clearly that there\\ 's a serious internal psychological problem among the very profession of journalists in the Western English-speaking world.\\n\\nSorry what problem ? Is it a problem with WaPo journalist , BBC journalist , DailyMail journalist , FOX journalist and CBS5 journalist or in general ? Aren\\'t you painting with really broad stokes here ? \\n\\n & gt ; In other words , there\\ 's absolutely no falsehood in there.\\n\\nYou want falsehood and contradiction ? \\n\\n & gt ; Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \ '' leak\ '' into the public . One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany ? \\n\\nLater : \\n\\n & gt ; They [ the media ] are among the most dishonest human beings on earth , and they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.\\n\\n & gt ; It has a system of government called a constitutional republic . \\n\\nAgain with the semantics.\\n\\n & gt ; He\\ 's fully within his rights to do so.\\n\\nOf course . I never argued otherwise . Do you think the democracy can\\'t be dismantled totally lawfully step by step ? A leader is allowed to a lot of thing , but there are lines that most would not cross . Criticising judges is one of those things.\\n\\nBut tell you want . Since you are so in love with authoritarian leaders I give you an example . Erdo\u011fan is fully within his rights to sue anyone who says bad stuff about him . Do you think he is right to do so ? Not lawfully but morally ? \\n\\n & gt ; That is the nature of having freedom of speech over political issues.\\n\\nA constitutionality of a law is not politics . But again whatev.\\n\\n & gt ; I find mass media claims that this freedom should be suppressed for people they do not agree with extremely disturbing . \\n\\nYeah it\\ 's extremly disturbing when the President is criticised for doing something . : ( Poor Pres . He is only the most powerful man on the Earth . : \\ ' ( \\n\\n & gt ; You appear to have a serious problem understanding that people can discuss ideas they do not hold and people they do not support and argue both for and against merits of these ideas and people from such a position.\\n\\nNo your just an idiot in the context of US Politics . So I don\\'t need to convince you . I mean believe what you want , you obviously made up your mind . Arguing is only useful when someone involved is open-minded . Since I don\\'t think anyone else is reading this besides us ... \\n\\nLook I see that I was wrong that you are a Trump fan . You are more of an obsessive contratarian person , who has to reject the mainstream way of thinking . You just love being the Devil\\ 's advocate , because it makes you seem smarter.\\n\\n & gt ; That said , the ongoing pewdiepie debacle demonstrated quite clearly that there\\ 's a serious internal psychological problem among the very profession of journalists in the Western English-speaking world.\\n\\nSee ?

Huehue777,europe,"Feminist logic is oftentimes even sillier than religious logic imo.\\n\\nFor example , I know that Christianity considers casual sex \ '' immoral\ '' and thus prostitution as well and I can kind of understand the reasoning there , as \ '' A good Christian\ '' should focus on spiritual life and refrain from material pleasures etc.\\n\\nHowever , feminist logic is even more weird . First off , it is difficult to understand , as to whether feminists even think that women should be having sex in the first place , because according to them it is an act in which the man is in a dominant position and a women in a submissive position , so the act must be frowned upon , probably at least according to some of the 3rd wave feminists.\\n\\nOK , whatever the feminist logic is toward sex , then comes the issue of when a woman is having sex on her free will . Well , the feminists can\\'t really stop that I guess , since most women actually love to have sex and find great pleasure from it . Yet , for some reason , if both people have decided on their free will that they want to have sex , it is OK , but if the man decides to gives some money for a mutual decision to have sex ( trafficking is illegal anyway everywhere in Europe and large social safety nets provide everyone with minimum living standards ) , then the man suddenly becomes a criminal ? ! \\n\\nI mean you can\\'t make this up and it is mind-boggling even to try to get into the brains of the 3rd wave feminists , but the logic seems to be getting lost somewhere here.\\n\\nIt is kind of the same as with the whole Gamergate thing imo . At one point feminists go about the streets naked and ask that they be able to walk without having to wear a shirt and extremely rarely also they raise a concern of women having to wear niqab\\ 's in muslim countries , but at the same time the same 3rd wave feminists get extremely angry , if a video games decides to create a female character , who shows some cleavage , which has forced most game developers to completely cover up the new characters now and so scared to EVER create a sexy character any more in fear of a 3rd wave feminist backlash ( e.g League of Legends ) .\\n\\nSo yes , probably wasted my time trying into the minds of 3rd wave feminists , but they and their new policies , which they are enforcing with social media smear campaigns , have become kind of a joke , especially taking into account that there is still massive discrimination against women in 3rd world countries going on , especially in muslim societies , but who care about women not being able to drive a car in Saudi Arabia or women getting whipped in Indonesia with a lash for walking in the streets without a male companion , if you have bigger problems like game devs releasing sexy video game characters .",Uralic,Estonian

In this turmoil there will be another free-for-all Wild West capitalism in that all previously nationalised companies will be sold off again and oligarchs will regain their power , while most of them or their families will actually live in Western countries to protect their safety and their money.\\n\\n5 ) Some Balkan countries have been able to get close to joining EU , but there hasn\\'t been much progress for Belarus , Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia , unfortunately .

Also , Tallinn is now a very popular place for Westerners to migrate as well , since they are warmly welcomed here and everyone knows English and it is in general a great city to live in.\\n\\nHowever , as Estonia became wealthier , more and more immigrants from third world countries started to come here as well , also many people trying to flee the crisis in Russia .

Month after month , year after year since 2010 , none of the other parties come remotely close to Fidesz in polls , regardless which source is used ( Median , Szazadveg , Nezopont , Ipsos etc ) . To my knowledge , the leftist Unity coalition is launching candidates in every single one of the individual voting district . This means that they can achieve victory by plurality in 106 out of the 106 districts . Jobbik is also launching candidates in every district . I\\ 'm not sure about LMP . The point is that , if the people will it , then Fidesz will be voted out of power .

Leftist papers inside and outside the country are hammering the government . None of the leftist activist or politicians have been imprisoned ( to the despair of many Hungarians ) . \\n\\nYes , Fidesz is full of incompetent fools , but they are a democratically elected government who can be democratically disposed of this year , should the people will it .

Also by burning trees you reduce the amount of CO2 than trees can remove from the environment because there will be less trees.\\nFor the same amount of energy burning a tree releases more CO2 in to the environment than coal.\\n\\nBurning wood is not the sustainable solution because think about what happened if the whole world started to burn wood as its main renewable energy source . It would be catastrophic for the environment which ironicaly is the thing we want to save right now.\\nEuropean Union has acknowledged that burning wood is a loophole in the requirements and they will fix it eventually but it will take time because it will mess up all the renewable energy goals if they do it too soon.\\n\\nEDIT : World already has a deforestation problem as well so burning them for energy instead of coal is the last thing we should do .
